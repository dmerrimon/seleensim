3.1 Systemic Lupus E rythematosus,  Immune Complexes , Human Safety Data with 
RSLV-132 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disorder affecting many 
tissues and organs including skin, kidney and brain [22] .   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_375630]-patient diversity 
with respect to clinical manifestations, a common characteristic of SLE patients is the presence of circulating autoantibodies directed against nuclear antigens [24, 19] .  The presence of these 
autoantibodies signifies that host immune tolerance has been compromised.  The physiological 
cause underlying the loss of tolerance is unclear, but current theories include that SLE patients’ 
cells are predisposed to undergo capricious apoptosis or that host mechanisms involved in clearance of apoptotic cells/debris are impaired [27, 16].  In either scenario, the extracellular 
accumulation of nuclear -associated antigens, including nucleic acid -containing complexes, elicits 
B-cells to produce antibodies that recognize these normally sequestered components as foreign antigens.  As a result, immune tolerance is broken 
When complexed with their respective antigens, SLE patient autoantibodies form immune 
complexes (ICs) which can promote activation of immune cells in vitro.  For example, ICs formed following incubation of SLE patient sera with necrotic and/or apoptotic cell extracts (a 
source of nuclea r antigens), are effective agonists for activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
(pDCs) to produce type 1 interferon (IFN) [5] .  Circulating ICs recovered from SLE patients are 
also capable of eliciting IFN -α output from pDCs in culture, though lower abundance of the 
endogenous complexes relative to the quantities formed following addition of exogenous 
antigens promotes smaller quantities of cytokine production [1, 8] .  ICs also are capable of 
stimulating B -cells resulting in NF -κB activ ation and proliferation [15, 6] .  Moreover, SLE 
patient ICs have been reported to activate human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell activities 
including chemotaxis, the oxidative burst response, and netosis [17, 7] .   In addition to effects on 
immune cells, ICs can deposit within tissues (e.g. kidney, blood vessels) where their physical 
accumulation and associated inflammation appear to disrupt normal homeostatic function [21, 3] .  
Overall, ICs are positioned at the ape x of an effector cascade which instigates and drives SLE 
disease pathology.   
Many common SLE patient autoantibodies are directed against nucleic acids or to proteins that 
bind to non-coding RNAs.  Importantly, recent studies have established that nucleic acids associated with SLE patient ICs are capable of activating Toll -like receptors (TLRs) [12, 18, 14, 
4, 13].   Although TLRs are thought to operate as key elements of the innate immune system by 
[CONTACT_375640]- associated molecular components, it is now clear that host nucleic acids 
also can activat e specific family members including TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 [26] .   Cells 
expressing these receptors do so without distributing them to the cell surface; rather, TLRs 7/8/9 are sequestered within endosomes [26].  This positioning is postulated to minimize interaction 
with host nucleic acids.  However, when present within an IC, nucleic acid antigens are actively 
internalized into cells via receptor -mediated endocytosis.  Effector Fc, complement, and B- cell 
receptors all may facilitate entry of nucleic acid containing ICs into endosomes [18, 14] .  Once 
internalized, the nucleic acid cargo is positioned to bind to and activate resident endosomal TLRs.   Activated TLRs, in turn, promote type 1 IFN from pDCs, activate PMNs, and promote B-
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 15 of 52 cell proliferation and autoantibody production.  Thus, the nucleic acid- containing antigens are 
envisioned to contribute to multiple aspects of SLE disease pathophysiology.  
Evidence of the importance of TLR -induced signaling to autoimmunity is further suggested by a 
mouse transgenic line engineered to overexpresses TLR7 [9] .  Overexpression of this receptor is 
associated with development of spontaneous autoimmunity.  A substantial increase in TLR7 
expression is associated with enhanced mortality, an increase in circulating anti -DNA antibodies, 
and dendritic cell dysre gulation [9 ].  Given that the transgenic mice do not require an exogenous 
agonist to promote the autoimmune phenotype, these findings suggest that elevation of the receptor’s steady state expression is sufficient to tilt the homeostatic balance from a state where immune tolerance is maintained to one where tolerance is broken.  Since TLR7 is known to 
recognize RNA -containing ligands [11],  the spontaneous development of autoimmunity in the 
TLR7 transgenic animals suggests that endogenous RNAs are contributing to the 
pathophysiological response.   Importantly, when the TLR7 rece ptor transgenic mice are crossed 
with a mouse line over expressing bovine RNase under control of a serum albumin promoter, the double transgenic descendants demonstrate increased survival, reduced activation of T and B lymphocytes, and reduced hepatic infl ammation [25].  Thus, the addition of a secreted 
ribonuclease to the system appears to attenuate the heightened state of autoimmunity, presumably by [CONTACT_375641]7 ligands. 
Evidence also exists in humans suggesting that TLRs and nucleases impact SLE.  A mutation 
within the promoter of the TLR7 gene is reported to enhance TLR7 expression and to be a risk 
factor for development of SLE [ 23].  In addition, polymorphisms within TLRs 7/8/[ADDRESS_469913] been 
linked to SLE patients [10] .  Likewise , mutations resulting in loss of DNase1 or DNase1L3 each 
have been reported as predisposing to the development of SLE [28, 2].  Moreover, genetic 
association studies have established a link between the 3’- 5’ exonuclease T rex1 and SLE [20].   
Therefore, in both mice and humans the balance between the levels of endogenous nucleic acid-
containing ligands and expression of the nucleic a cid-sensing TLRs appears key in regulating 
cellular immune responses and autoimmunity. 
3.2 RSLV-132 
RSLV -132 is a novel therapeutic being developed for the treatment of SLE.  This fully human 
biologic ( Figure 1) consists of RNase1 (also known as pancreatic RNase) fused to the N-
terminus of the Fc segment of IgG1.  The attachment of the Fc segment is intended to extend the 
circulatory half -life of the RNase and by [CONTACT_375642].  
RSLV -132 is intended to utilize the RNase to break down RNA containing immune complexes, 
thereby [CONTACT_375643], decreasing the production of type 1 IFN and decreasing 
the proliferation of B- cells and autoantibody production.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 17 of 52 3.4.1 Study 132-01 – Single Ascending D ose Study Summary: 
This first -in-man study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in healthy 
volunteers in a phase one unit to assess the safety and tolerability of a single, escalating IV dose 
of RSLV -132 (0.3 mg/kg – 10.0 mg/kg).  There we no SAEs, or drug discontinuations due to an 
AE.  The drug was well tolerated at all doses tested and an MTD was not reached.  The serum half-life of the drug was measured to be approximately 16 days.  None of the subjects in the 
study were positive for anti RSLV-132 antibodies.  
3.4.2 Study 132- 02 Multiple Ascending Dose Study Summary: Safety  
This was a multi- center, double -blind, placebo- controlled study with successive escalating 
cohorts to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated IV doses (0.3 mg/kg – 10.0 mg.kg) of 
RSLV -[ADDRESS_469915] dose of RSLV-132 tested.  Repeated administration of RSLV- 132 doses was generally 
well tolerated by [CONTACT_375644]. Across all dose cohorts, AEs were observed at the same overall incidence in RSLV 132 subjects as placebo subjects (6/8 subjects [75%] versus 
18/24 subjects [75%]). The incidence of AEs and the average number of events per subject did not increase with increasing dose level. The most frequently reported AEs in the RSLV [ADDRESS_469916] infection, each of which occurred in 5 
subjects (20.8%). The majority of AEs in this study were Grade 1 in severity; 13 subjects (10 RSLV -132 and 3 placebo subjects) experienced Grade [ADDRESS_469917] in Cohort 1 of the 
RSLV -132 arm experienced a Grade 3 AE of acute cholecystitis (this event was also reported as 
the only SAE in the study). No Grade 4 or Grade 5 events occurred. Adverse events judged to be related to  blinded study drug were reported for 38% of placebo subjects and 29% of RSLV [ADDRESS_469918] one out-of-range chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis value, but no values were considered clinically significant in RSLV-132 subjects. No dose-dependent 
trends were observed in the incidence of out-of-range values and no concerning patterns of 
laboratory abnormalities were detected. No notable differences between treatment groups and no trends over the course of the study were observed in vital signs or physical findings. No 
clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported during the study. No confirmed positive 
anti-RSLV -132 antibodies were detected in any of the subjects in this 113- day study.

Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 19 of 52 5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a  multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of approximately fifty subjects 
with SLE.  Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 
twenty -eight days prior to study entry (i.e., prior to Baseline visit ). 
Subjects will be evaluated during screening for evidence of active, evaluable cutaneous manifestations of SLE which will be measured by [CONTACT_375645].  The photographs will be adjudicated by a de rmatologist with 
expertise in the use of the CLASI tool in SLE clinical trials in order to confirm the subject meets 
the CLASI entry criteria.  
Following Baseline evaluations on Day 1, subjects will receive their first intravenous infusion of RSLV -132.   Subjects will return to the research unit for additional visits as described in 
Appendix A.   
The subjects will be randomized 2:1 (active:placebo) to receive IV administrations of 10 mg/kg 
of study drug or placebo as follows on days: 
• 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, and [ADDRESS_469919] will be screened within twenty-eight days of admission to the study center 
(Baseline visit).  The duration of the study from Baseline visit to End of Study visit, excluding 
the screening period is approximately [ADDRESS_469920] Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects who meet the following criteria may be included in the study:  
1. diagnosis of SLE by [CONTACT_375646] 1997 
update of the 1982 SLE criteria (see Appendix D) including cutaneous involvement at 
Screening;  
2. cutaneous manifestations of SLE and a CLASI activity score of ≥10 at Screening; 
3. elevated levels of any one of the fol lowing autoantibodies (local or central laboratory): 
• Ro-52/60, La, Sm, SmRNP, U1 RNP A/68; 
4. no changes to SLE medications in the 30 days prior to Baseline; 
5. able to communicate and able to provide valid, written informed consent; 
6. ages 18 to 70 inclusive; 
7. minimum weight of 45 kg;  
8. Female participants shall be either of non -child -bearing potential (permanently sterilized 
by [CONTACT_248438], hysterectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or menopausal more than 
one year since last menstrual cycle and confirmed by [CONTACT_375647] ≥ 22 
mIU/mL);  OR practicing highly effective contraception (e.g., oral, implantable, transdermal or injectable contraceptives, a non-hormonal intrauterine device [IUD] with spermicide; female condom with spermicide; contraceptive  sponge with spermicide; 
intravaginal system, diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom with spermicide; a sterile sexual partner) for at least [ADDRESS_469921] dose. 
6.2 CLASI Score Entry Criteria – Adjudication 
Prior to being enrolled in the study, each patient’s cutaneous SLE disease activity measure and photographs of the cutaneous areas of disease involvement will be submitted to and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_375648].  The adj udicator is a dermatologist with extensive experience in reviewing 
cutaneous clinical data from SLE subjects in a clinical trial setting.  The adjudicator will review 
the photographs of the cutaneous disease to confirm the subject meets the entry criteria and is eligible for the study.  
6.[ADDRESS_469922] Exclusion Criteria  
The following will exclude potential subjects from the study:  
1. severe, active CNS involvement at Screening;  
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 21 of 52 2. severe renal involvement (urine protein/creatinine ratio of >200 mg/mmol, or an 
estimated creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min) at Screening;  
3. use of cyclophosphamide within 3 months of Baseline; 
4. use of background medications within 1 month of Baseline in excess of:

13. female subjects currently breast feeding at Baseline;  
14. inability or unwillingness to comply with study restrictions, return for follow up 
appointments, or other considerations, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], which would make the candidate unsuitable for study participation. 
6.[ADDRESS_469923] from investigational treatment if, in the 
Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue. Notification of discontinuation of investigational treatment will be made immediately to the Sponsor. In case of premature discontinuation of investigational treatment, efforts will be made to perform all End of 
Treatment (EOT) assessments  and an End of Study (EOS) visit outlined in (Appendix A ). 
 
If a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, the site staff should confirm whether the subject is agreeable to continue the assessments without the investigational treatment or if they wish no 
further involvement in the study. In the latter case no further study- related evaluations will be 
performed and no additional data will be collected.   
The date and the reason for discontinuation of investigational treatment or withdrawal from the 
study will be recorded on the subject’s Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects that withdraw after 
receiving study drug will not be replaced. 
6.5 Women of Child-Bearing Potential 
As women of ages 18 to 70 years old are eligible to enroll in this study, all women will be 
considered to be of child-bearing potential unless: 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 22 of 52 • the subject has undergone a surgical sterilization procedure (e.g. bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy, or tubal ligation); 
• the subject is greater than [ADDRESS_469924] menstrual cycle and menopause is confirmed by [CONTACT_375647] ≥ 22 mIU/mL

RSLV -132 is a novel therapeutic candidate.  This fully human biologic consists of RNase1 (also 
known as pancreatic RNase) fused to the N-terminus of the Fc portion of IgG1.   The attachment 
of the Fc domain is intended to extend the serum half- life of the RNase and reduce the frequency 
of administration.  RSLV -[ADDRESS_469925] been used in the study; lot 1- FIN-1778 which was provided at 
9.5 mg/mL, and lot 1- FIN-2899 which was provided at 10.0 mg/m L. 
7.2 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered at the clinical site by [CONTACT_375649]. 
7.3 Concomitant Medications  
Subjects entering the study who had no changes to their SLE medications in the previous 30 days 
prior to the Baseline visit shall remain on the background medications at the same doses 
throughout the study.  With the exception of decreases in OCS, no changes in lupus medications shall be permitted during the study, including the addition of topi[INVESTIGATOR_375631], except for the rescue of a lupus flare.  
7.4 Steroid Tapering  
One of the objectives of the study is to evaluate the potential steroid sparing effects of RSLV -
132.  Steroid doses should remain stable through Day 85.  Thereafter, Investigators shall decrease the use of oral corticosteroids beginning on Day 85 using the guidance below.  No further steroid d ecreases should occur from Day 141 through Day 169. 
• Subjects receiving >7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily AND demonstrating a clinical improvement in the cutaneous manifestations of lupus as measured by a decrease 
in the CLASI activity by 50% compar ed with Baseline shall decrease oral corticosteroids 
as follows: 
o Decrease prednisone (or equivalent) by 2.5 mg/day  
o If the prednisone dose (or equivalent) remains greater than 7.5 mg/day AND 
cutaneous disease activity remains improved (CLASI activity score decreased by 50% compared with baseline) AND prednisone has been stable for 2 weeks, 
reduce prednisone by [CONTACT_33018] 2.5 mg; repeat after 2 more weeks.   
o If prednisone reduced to 7.5 mg, see below,  
o If after a decrease in prednisone, the CLASI is no lo nger decreased (compared to 
baseline) by 50%, the investigator may increase the prednisone to the previous 
daily dose (not to exceed the baseline dose)  
• Subjects receiving ≤7.5 mg/of prednisone or equivalent daily AND demonstrating clinical improvement in the cutaneous manifestations of lupus as measured by a decrease

drug. The lot numbers for each concentration of the study drugs will be provided to the clinical site by [CONTACT_289961]/manufacturer  and will be on vial labels.  
8.[ADDRESS_469927].  
8.3 Study Drug Packaging, Labeling, Storage, Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and Preparation 
The study drug will be provided to the sites in single use vials, clearly labeled with drug name 
[CONTACT_44714].  Study drug will be stored at <-20°C under secure conditions and protected from 
light. Prior to administration to the subject, individual dosing solutions will be prepared fr om a 
vial as detailed in the Study Drug Reference Manual.   Details of study drug packaging, labeling, 
storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and preparation, including preparation of matching placebo doses, will likewise be provided in the Study Drug Reference Manual.  
8.4 Study  Drug Administration 
RSLV -132 or placebo will be administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg at baseline, then weekly 
for two weeks and then once every 2 weeks for the next 20 weeks (13 administrations) to 
subjects with SLE. The preparation of the study drug and rate of infusion will be provided in the Study Drug Reference Manual. For each dose, the date, actual infusion rate, start and stop time of infusion will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the CRFs. 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- [ADDRESS_469928] as shipped by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee), including the date received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensation.  
8.[ADDRESS_469929] received any infusion with either RSLV-132 or placebo will be included in 
the overall analysis of safety. All data relating to safety will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_2070]. The change from baseline for each of the vital signs parameters will also be computed and included in individual patient listings and descriptive summaries.  
Deaths that occur during the study and the proportion of subjects discontinuing the study due to adverse events will as  well be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
All adverse events will be coded and tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) and presented in descending frequency. Adverse events will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_375651]. Serious adverse events will be summarized separately.  
9.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relation ship with this treatment. 
Adverse events may be reported by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_49232], or 
detected through PE, a laboratory test requiring further attention, or other means. 
Adverse events can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product. Adverse events include: 
• Any sign, medical diagnosis or symptom 
• Any new un desirable medical experience or unfavorable and unintended worsening of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related 
to study drug 
• Abnormal laboratory results that have associated symptoms or findings, require specific 
treatment, or require a change in subject management.   
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis under a single event term. For example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped 
together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”. If possible, abnormal laboratory results that meet 
the definition of an AE (that warrant management, investigation or treatment) should be reported as a clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal value itself (e.g., “anemia” rather than “decreased 
blood count”).  Adverse events will be graded according to the Rheumatology CTC (Woodworth 
et al., J. Rheumatology 2007; 34(6): 1401-1414). 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- 03 
 
Confidential  Version 5 27 April  2017  Page 28 of 52 9.2 Serious Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
o This definition implies that the subject, in the view of the Investigator, was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928] 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375633], for social reasons, or for 
normal disease management procedures (including  treatment adjustment) are not 
to be considered SAEs according to this criterion. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity  
• Results in an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the study 
treatment regimen before  conception of during pregnancy. 
• Otherwise considered medically important in the judgment of a health care professional. Medical and scientific judgment should determine whether an AE is classified as an SAE 
in many situations. Medically important conditio ns that may not result in death, not be 
life-threatening, nor require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered SAEs when they may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
9.[ADDRESS_469930] dose of study medication until the End of Study visit.   
9.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
SAEs will be reported to Resolve on the SAE report form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by [CONTACT_093].   
In the event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a SAE 
immediately, the investigator is to report the even t within 24 hours of his/her first awareness of 
the SAE.  
Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product is suspected.   
The initial report should include as much relevant information as possible but at a minimum 
should include subject Number, date of event onset, event term/description of event, 
investigator’s assessment of relationship to study drug. 
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- [ADDRESS_469931], follow-up by [CONTACT_375652], stabilize or are explained.  
9.7 Severity Assessment  
As required on the AE case r eport forms, the investigator will assess the severity of an event 
according to the Rheumatology CTC (Woodworth et al., J. Rheumatology 2007; 34(6): 1401-1414). 
9.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious).  Causality is determined as not related, possibly related, or definitely related according to the following definitions: 
• Not r elated: The event can be readily attributed to other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other concomitant medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Possibly Related: Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrati on and is 
unlikely to be attributed to the subject's clinical state or environmental factors or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Definitely related:  Clear -cut temporal association with study drug administration with 
improvement on cessation of study drug AND cannot be readily attributed to other 
factors such as the subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other concomitant medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
9.[ADDRESS_469932] finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or; 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or;  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_76617]. 
An abnormal test result, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 
9.[ADDRESS_469933] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], are considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a prec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is 
not an SAE.  Examples include: 
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development 
of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work-up of 
persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality); 
• Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); 
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam); 
• Protocol-specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_60658]); 
• Pre-planned or opt ional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596].  
Resolve Therapeutics    Protocol 132- [ADDRESS_469934] serum samples will be quantitated by [CONTACT_375653]; a 
validated ELISA assay that dire ctly measures RSLV -132 (ICON Laboratories), and a catalytic 
activity assay that measures the RNase enzyme activity of RSLV -132 (Resolve Therapeutics, 
LLC).  
10.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be calculated for each subject, whenev er possible, based 
on the serum concentrations of RSLV-132.

Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704398] 
resulted in a significant increase in renal transplantation 
success (Oniscu et al, 2005). Currently, the worldwide rates for 
1- and 5-year graft survival are 95% and 80%, respectively, with 
death with a functioning graft being the most common reason for 
renal graft loss after 1 year (Daly et al, 200
5). Studies on 
renal transplantation outcomes have traditionally focused on 
patient and graft survival, with little to no consideration of 
graft function (Boom et al, 2000). Although graft loss is the 
worst type of graft dysfunction, grafts with an impaired 
function require the most intense follow-up, are economically 
most costly and require rigorous clinical management to preserve 
life-expectancy of the graft (Boom et al, 2000). For these 
reasons, parameters of graft function are being increasingly 
included as outcome measures in renal transplantation studies, 
including delayed graft function (DGF).
 Indeed, the new UNOS 
allocation policies
 
(http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/policiesAndBy[CONTACT_28769]/policies.asp) 
scheduled for implementation in [ADDRESS_704399] decade, the incidence 
of patients with DGF has remained steady and was reported in 2.6 
percent of transplants from living donors, compared to 22, 28, 
and 41 percent of SCDs, ECDs, and donations after cardiac death 
patients respectively.

Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704400] a degree of early dysfunction (Halloran and Hunsicker, 
2001). Delayed graft function (DGF) is a term used to describe 
the lack of acceptable function in a kidney after 
transplantation (Daly et al, 2005). DGF has been well described 
in association with an inferior functioning kidney at [ADDRESS_704401]-transplant (Halloran et al, 1988; Hariharan et al, 
2003). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_540372], loss of proximal epi[INVESTIGATOR_540373]
h border, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_540374]/apoptosis, and cellular casts (Smith et 
al, 2003). In the presence of DGF, kidneys are more likely to 
have adverse outcomes including decreased functional graft 
survival and 6- month patient survival, and increased acute 
rejection (Daly et al, 2005; Halloran and Hunsicker, 2000). It 
is interesting to note that analyses of the UNOS scientific 
renal transplant registry (United
 States) showed DGF was 
associated with increased probability of patient death in the 
first 6 months (Halloran and Hunsicker, 2000), whereas analyses 
in the Netherlands found DGF to be an independent risk factor 
for acute rejection and suboptimal renal fun
ction at 1 year, but 
not survival (Boom et al, 2000). The use of kidneys from 
extended criteria deceased donors (ECD) are also associated with 
higher rates of DGF and poorer long-term survival. These ﬁndings 
are especially important in view of recent publications which 
showed compromised outcomes in patients receiving kidneys from 
suboptimal donors. A recent analysis of outcomes from 9134 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540375]-death and brain-death donor kidneys, donor 
age ≥60 years was identiﬁed as a risk factor for g raft failure 
and reduced long-term renal function. (Summers et al, 2010).  
These investigators found that graft survival and renal function 
decrease as the age of the donor increases, with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540376]. Another group 
performed a comprehensive systematic review of kidney 
transplants from ECDs and concluded that management protocols 
for this patient population need to be based on nephron-
protecting strategies (Pascual et al, 2008). Thus strategies to 
reduce IRI and DGF are critical to
 increasing the number and 
long-term outcomes of marginal kidneys.  
 
Historically DGF has been defined as the requirement for 
dialysis during the first week after renal tran
splantation, 
however the postoperative requirement of hemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis is not standardized and the decision to 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 9 dialyze varies from center to center and among consultants (Daly 
et al, 2005). More recently, efforts have been made to 
scientifically quantify DGF in a more stringent manner with 
various alternative definitions of DGF including; (1) the number 
of days to achieve a creatinine clearance of >10 mL/min, 
calculated by [CONTACT_540417]-Cockroft formula (Giral-Classe et al, 
1998), (2) a serum creatinine level of >3 mg/dL on the fifth day 
post-transplant (Humar et al, 2000), (3) the need for dialysis 
within 72 hours after transplantation (Hetzel et al, 2002), (4) 
serum creatinine level changes, including an increase, remaining 
unchanged, or dec
reasing by [CONTACT_21316] 10% per day immediately 
after surgery during three consecutive days for >1 week (Boom et 
al, 2000), (5) a rising serum creatinine level above that before 
surgery, or urine output of <300 mL within 6 hours of 
transplantation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_540377] (Gonwa et 
al, 2002), (6) urine output of <[ADDRESS_704402] 24 hours or a 
decrease in serum creatinine of <20-30% reflected in a poor 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Halloran and Hunsicker, 2001), 
and (7) calculating the creatinine reduction ratio on day two 
following surgery (Salahudeen et al, 2004). However despi[INVESTIGATOR_540378], the conventional definition of 
“requirement for dialysis in the first week post -transplant” 
remains the most utilized and published definition for DGF, with 
“need for dialysis” being easily measured and clinically 
relevant. 
 
The reported incidence of DGF varies widely depending on the 
source of the graft, with DGF estimated to occur in 
approximately 20-35% of all patients who receive a deceased 
donor graft (Koning et al, 1997; Halloran and Hunsicker, 2001), 
and rates varying up to 80% in association with extended 
criteria (ECD) donor grafts (SCJ personal data from CSMC). The 
risk factors for DGF are the same as those that influence graft 
survival and include donor tissue quality (age), brain death and 
other components of cadaver donation, preservation variables 
particularly cold ischemia time, immune variables, and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540379] (Halloran and Hunsicker, 2001). The duration of cold 
ischemia time has been shown to have a direct effect on the 
presence of DGF and graft survival with durations longer than 28 
hours associated with increased risk (Lechevallier et al, 1998; 
Jacobs et al, 1996; Peters et al, 1995; Kahan et al, 1987), and 
a 23% increase for every 6 hours of cold ischemia time (Ojo et 
al, 1997). Additionally, DGF is significantly associated with 
the use of kidneys from older donors, particularly donors of 
more than 50 years of age (Boom et al, 2000). In the United 
States, in the last decade, the proportion of deceased donors 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 10 older than 50 years of age has increased from 21% to 30% (Nathan 
et al, 2003; Ojo et al, 2001), however the kidney waiting list 
has increased by 260% and the number of deceased donor kidney 
transplants has increased by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 16% (Metzger et al, 2003; 
Port, 2001; Nathan et al, 2003). Due to the increasing disparity 
between organ supply and demand, the use of kidneys from “older” 
expanded criteria donors (ECDs) has become generally accepted 
and increasingly common (Metzger et al, 2003). 
In the [LOCATION_002], the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS) (www.unos.org) which administers the national Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) (www.optn.org) 
defines two types of deceased donor kidneys, namely “ standard 
criteria donors” (SCD) and “ expanded criteria donors ” (ECD). 
Using pre-transplant variables to identify increased risk of 
graft loss, an ECD donor kidney is defined as a kidney donated 
for transplantation from (1) a brain
-dead donor over the age of 
60 years, or (2) from a donor between the ages of [ADDRESS_704403] two of the following: a history of hypertension, a 
terminal serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl 
(normal range 0.8-1.4 mg/dl), or death from a cerebral vascular 
accident (CVA) (stroke or aneurysm). In comparison, an SCD donor 
kidney is defined as a kidney donated for transplantation by a 
donor who has suffered brain death and does not fit the criteria 
for ECD. With the growing demand for first-time and repeat 
deceased donor renal transplants, ECD donor kidneys are being 
increasingly considered by [CONTACT_540418]. As a consequence 
of the utilization of marginal kidneys, DGF is a major 
complication following transplantation with ECD donor kidneys. 
 
 
Complement as a Mediator of Ischemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI) 
 
The complement system in humans exists as a system of 
recognition molecules, proteolytic enzymes and receptors for 
activated complement components that are responsible for host 
defense. The complement system c
an be activated in at least 3 
separate ways; first, the classical pathway which depends on 
antibody binding to antigen targets and binding complement 
components (i.e. C1q) to ultimately activate C3 and initiate 
terminal complement component activation of C5b-C9 (see figure 
1). Binding of lectins (i.e. man
nose binding lectin and mannose 
binding lectin serine protease (MBLSP) activate the C3 
convertase without activation of C1
->4->2 (C3 convertase). In 
addition, the alternative pathway is activated by [CONTACT_540419] H 20 or activating surfaces. The deposition of complement on

Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704404] compartments (central and local). The central 
compartment of complement is produced in the liver and is 
responsible for all circulating complement factors. The 
peripheral compartment included complement generated locally in 
organs such as the CNS and kidneys (Sacks et Zhou 2012.
 
Activation of complement in the peripheral compartments appears 
to be regulated primarily by [CONTACT_540420]. Figure 2 below describes the 
importance of complement activation in initiation of renal 
tubular cell (RTC) injury wit
h reference to induction by [CONTACT_540420]. 
Briefly, IRI stimulates C3 production in the RTCs that is 
subsequently cleaved by [CONTACT_540421]/MBLSP or alternative pathway 
(Sacks et Zhou 2012). C3b generated then activates C5 to C5a and 
C5b. C5b forms the C5b-C9MAC which induces cell death and 
cytokine (IL-6) release. C5a interacts with the C5aR to induce 
apoptosis and cell death. 
Data from (Sacks et Zhou 2012) have 
also shown that kidneys from C3 deficient mice are resistant to 
IRI. Other investigators have also shown that ex
pression of C3 
and other complement components in human donor kidneys before 
transplantation had a negative impact on graft outcome at 2-3 
years (Naesens et al 2009). Thus there is significant support 
for a role of complement activation in inducing RTC inj
ury and 
ultimately DGF and it would be reasonable to assume that 
administration of complement inhibitors would be of potential 
benefit in prevention or amelioration of RTC injury and possibly 
improve outcomes in kidneys at high risk for development of DGF.

Zhou 2012). 
 
Evidence for Use of C1INH to Prevent IRI and DGF  
 
Although limited, there are recent investigations which show 
dramatic results in prevention of IRI after C1I NH treatment. 
(Dalle Lucca et al 2012) investigated the ability of recombinant 
C1INH (rC1INH) to alter tissue injury in a porcine model of 
controlled hemorrhage. In this model, the administration of 
100U/kg or 250U/kg rC1INH significantly reduced IRI injury to 
kidneys, 
lungs, intestine and liver. The animals treated with 
250U/kg also showed significant reductions in TNF - levels and 
severity of metabolic acidosis. The significant beneficial 
effects of rC1INH administration were found to be related to the 
ability of C1INH to reduce IRI induced complement activation in 
tissue. All treated animals also showed reduced immune cell 
infiltration and cytokine production. The authors felt that the 
use of rC1INH would have significant benefits in patients with 
hemorrhagic shock in prevention of IRI and organ failure 
(Castellano et al, 20 10) . In a comprehensive analysis of rC1INH 
use in an IRI model of kidney injury in the swine model found 
that IRI was associa ted with significant C3 activation, 
primarily through the MBL/MBLSP -[ADDRESS_704405]. The infusion of 
rC1INH led to significant reductions in peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] 
C4d deposition, and C5b -C9MAC. Complement inhibition with rC1INH 
also reduced the numbers of infilt rating CD163+, CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cells. Animals treated with rC1INH had significantly less RTC 
injury and renal damage. The authors conclude that the use of 
C1INH may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the 
prevention of DGF that would have particular relevance to kidney 
transplantation.  
 
2.0 Hypothesis 
Since complement activation is detectable in animal models of 
IRI and in human kidneys after IRI and since experimental data 
suggests that use of C1I
NH prior to induction of IRI shows 
significant beneficial effects on reducing IRI as well as 
inflammatory cell infiltrates, we hypothesize that the use of 
C1INH in patients receiving deceased donor (DD) kidney 
transplants with high risk for DGF will show significant 
reductions in DGF and improved outcomes post-transplant compared

-risk for IRI and DGF. We 
hypothesize that 
C1INH treated patients will demonstrate 
improved function of the kidney allograft compared to placebo, 
with equivalence in safety. We will also evaluate biopsies at 
transplant in all entered patients. 
The primary objectives of this study are: Using a double 
blinded, placebo controlled format, we will:  
1. Evaluate and compare the safety of C1INH (50 U/kg, round to 
the nearest 500unit
)administered pre-transplant and [ADDRESS_704407]-
transplant in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540380]. 
The secondary objectives are to:  
1. On the basis of safety and efficacy, determine appropriate 
Berinert® study dose for Phase III investigation, and 
 
2. Determine appropriate endpoint choice for Phase III 
investigation.

DGF.  A >35% incidence of DGF has 
remained constant over time despi[INVESTIGATOR_540381].  This may be due to 
increased use of kidneys from “extended -
criteria” and/or non -heart-beating 
donors, where even g reater rates  (>60%) 
of DGF have been reported.  
 
More than 96,680 people are currently 
waiting for a kidney transplant in the 
[LOCATION_002]  (UNOS.org 3/22/13) .  Of 
the 15,092 kidney transplants performed 
in the US in 2011, ~11,000 (62%) were 
from deceased donors.  Of these, 
approximately 17% were from expanded -
criteria donors.  The USRDS reports tha t 
more than 50% of patients on the waiting 
list are willing to accept a kidney from 
an expanded -criteria donor  (ECD) or DCD 
donor.  
 
NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS AND 
CENTERS 70 patients will be enrolled into the 
study (35 C1INH and 35 Placebo). The 
study will be initiated at Cedars -Sinai 
Medical Center and extended to 
collaborators with completion of

4. Investigational Plan Study Design And Plan  
This is a Phase I/II double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study assessing safety and limited efficacy of 
intraoperative C1INH (50U/kg)
 vs. Placebo administered prior to 
graft reperfusion in adult subjects receiving a deceased donor 
kidney allograft considered high
-risk for development of DGF. 
Patients will also receive an additional dose [ADDRESS_704425]-
transplant (C1INH (50U/kg vs. placebo). Once eligible patients 
are identified, consented, and have an acceptable kidney 
transplant offer, they will be randomized by [CONTACT_451284]
-Sinai 
Research Pharmacy to receive study drug vs. placebo. Drug and 
placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_451284]
-Sinai Research Pharmacy 
and conveyed to the operating room in a blinded manner. 
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_704426] time point of treatment 
application before graft reperfusion (ie. beginning of renal 
vein anastomosis),study treatments will be administered pre-
operatively at any one point in time, from time of admission up 
to the beginning of renal vein anastomosis before graft 
reperfusion. Due to the biologic half-life of C1INH 
(approximately 2.5 to 3.8 days), the time difference between 
early and late intraoperative treatment application, is thought 
to be negligible.  In addition, the patients will receive study 
treatments at [ADDRESS_704427]-transplant. This will constitute the 
entirety of C1INH vs. placebo administration. The study format 
is shown below in figure 3.

Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time 
for any reason without penalty or prejudice.  The Investigator 
also has the right to withdraw patients from the study if he/she 
feels it is in the best interest of the patient or if the 
patient is uncooperative or non
-compliant.  It is understood by 
[CONTACT_540425]-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of 
patients should be avoided.  Should a patient decide to 
withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations, and early withdrawal procedures, as thoroughly as 
possible. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_540426] a personal visit to determine as completely as 
possible the reason for the withdrawal.  A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the patients withdrawal should be made 
with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the 
study.  If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is 
an adverse event or an abnormal laboratory test result, the 
principal specific event or test will be recorded on the CRF.  
For all patients who are withdrawn pre-maturely, every attempt 
should be made to assess the patient’s status (i.e. patient and 
graft survival, malignancies, etc.) at [ADDRESS_704433] dose of study medication. 
 
4.4 Premature Termination Of Study/Closure Of Center 
The sponsor has the right to close this study, and the 
investigator/sponsor has the right to close a center, at any 
time, although this should occur only after consultation between 
involved parties. The Ethics Committee/Institutional Review 
Board (EC/IRB) must be informed. Should the study/center be 
closed prematurely, all study materials (except documentation 
that has to remain stored at site) must be returned to the 
sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification given by [CONTACT_142086]. 
 
4.5 Treatments 
4.5.1 Treatments To Be Administered 
This study is designed with two blinded treatment groups (C1INH 
vs. Placebo). Each group will include 35 patients in a treatment 
arm and 35 patients in a placebo arm.

Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 26 This design is statistically powered to show significant 
differences if there is a 30-50% reduction in the treatment 
group and may trend towards positive treatment effect since 
extensive DGF (40-50%)is expected in ECD and DCD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The 
dose of C1INH chosen is (50U/kg)
(round to the nearest 500unit) 
X2 (high-dose treatment) which should increase serum C1INH 
levels significantly above physiologic levels. This is based on 
our observations from our experience using C1INH vs. placebo to 
prevent antibody-
mediated rejection in humans.  In those 
randomized to placebo, an
 equivalent volume of placebo (0.9% 
normal saline) will be administered prior to graft reperfusion. 
Patients who fulfill all I/E criteria will be enrolled into 
this

Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704443] 
The active treatment arm (Berinert® 50U/kg, maximum dose 4000U) 
will be compared to a placebo control treatment arm, with a 
total of [ADDRESS_704444] dropouts. This design 
is statistically powered
 to show differences in DGF with a 30-
50% reduction in DGF predicted for the Berinert® study group.
 
Treatment effect will be investigated following intravenous 
treatment with two dos
es of Berinert® or an equivalent volume of 
placebo (0.9% normal saline) pre-operatively prior to graft 
reperfusion and repeated [ADDRESS_704445] will be contact[CONTACT_540429] a patient’s e

blinded study medication or placebo. The study treatment will be 
prepared according to a pharmacist-supplied randomization code 
(blinded from all other study personnel). The study treatment 
will be prepared in an IV syringe (total volume up to 70 ml 
Berinert® {4000U } for 80kg individual) and labeled with: 
 Protocol Number 
 Screening number  
 Randomization number. 
The blinded intravenous syringe of study treatment labeled as 
stated above will be transported to the surgical suite and 
matched with the matching patient chart. 
In case of a medical emergency, the study drug assignment for a 
particular patient may be unblinded. Unblinding study drug 
assignment will only be necessary if knowledge about treatment 
is needed for the medical management of the patient. The 
patient’s treatment assignment can be identified for unblinding 
purposes by [CONTACT_540430] (310-423-
6580). When this is necessary, the investigator must immediately 
notify the Sponsor’s  Medical Monitor, and document the reason 
and date of the un-blinding. The event must also be documented 
on the study termination record, the AE page of the CRF, and in 
source documents. Additionally, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_540403] a written explanation describing the event 
within 5 working days. The procedures for un-blinding study drug 
treatment will be provided to the Principal Investigators prior 
to study implementation.

4.6.2 Safety Variables 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reactions : The most serious adverse 
reaction reported in subjects in clinical studies who received 
Berinert® was an increase in the severity of pain associated 
with hereditary angioedema.  In a placebo controlled clinical 
study, the incidence of adverse events occurring in more than 4% 
of subjects (n = 43) receiving Berinert® up to 72 hours after 
infusion was nausea (7%), headache (7%), abdominal pain (7%), 
dysgeusia (4.7%), vomiting (2.3%), pain (2.3%), and muscle 
spasms (2.3%).   Adverse reactions can persist [ADDRESS_704459] been reported to be abdominal pain (6.5%), 
diarrhea (4.6%), nausea (6.5%), vomiting (4.6%), headache 
(11.1%), hereditary angioedema recurrence (11.1%), muscle spasm

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Risk for Thrombotic Events with C1INH 
Administration: Patients with known risk factors for thrombotic 
events will be monitored for signs and symptoms of thrombosis, 
such as new onset swelling and pain in the limbs or abdomen, new 
onset chest pain, shortness of 
breath, loss of sensation or 
motor power, or altered consciousness, vision, or speech.  To 
address the increased risk of TE, we will apply the Well’s 
criteria for diagnosis of DVT ( http://www.mdcalc.com/wells-
criteria-for- dvt)(Wells , 2003,2006,2006). Patients will be 
assessed with each infusion for evidence of DVT or other TEs. 
Those receiving a high-risk score will have lower-extremity 
Doppler venous ultrasounds to rule-out the presence of DVTs.  In 
addition, routine measurements of coagulation factors to 
evaluate DIC (D-Dimers, fibrinogen, PT, PTT) will be performed 
(See Appendix A). 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evidence of a Thrombotic Effect of C1INH Administration 
when Given in Supraphysiologic Dosages to Humans: The German 
Medical Profession’s Drugs Committee (AkdÅ) rep orted on 13 cases 
of severe thrombus formation after Berinert® infusions
 
Arzteblatt, 2000). These infusions were given to neonates 
undergoing cardiac surgery and doses of Berinert® were given at 
exceedingly high doses (~500U/kg) without control studies(see 
Appendix C). Nine of these infants died of this complication. 
The conclusions from this re
port are as follows:   
 There are no studies to support the use of C1INH outside of 
those with hereditary angioneurotic edema.  
 The use of C1INH in patients who do not have C1INH 
deficiency may result in abnormal coagulation parameters 
with propensity to thrombosis. 
 There are no controlled studies that suggests a benefit of 
C1INH therapy in conditions other than C1INH deficiency.  
 Any proposed uses outside of C1INH deficiency should be 
conducted in a controlled manner to monitor for unexpected 
or unanticipated side effects of C1INH therapy. 
 
Clearly, this is a serious and unanticipated complication of 
C1INH therapy that could potentially limit its use in patients 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704461]-transplant has great potential for 
prevention of complement-dependent DGF. In addition, there is an 
important unmet need for new therapeutics in the prevention and 
treatment of DGF. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], it is important to assess the 
tolerability and safety of C1INH therapy in this patient 
population. Although the C1INH dosing proposed in our study is 
much less than tha
t reported to be associated with TE (50U/kg 
twice, Days 0 & 1), there is still a possibility that increasing 
C1INH levels above normal baseline could have deleterious 
effects and induce coagulation abnormalities. Recent safety data 
from clinical trials of C1INH for use in C1INH deficiency 
(Cicardi 2010, 2010 and Zuraw 2010) have not reported TE with 
one exception of a basilar artery thrombosis in a patient 
treated for C1INH deficiency (Appendix C). This event was deemed 
unrelated to C1INH therapy. For that 
reason, the study will be 
randomized and patients will be monitored for DVT using the 
Wells Criteria. In addition, C1INH levels will be obtained at 
every visit and D-Dimers as well as PT/PTT will be monitored. As 
previously indicated if significant coagulation abnormalities or 
TE events are seen in any study patient, the study will be 
terminated. However, data from our recently completed study of 
C1INH in prevention of antibody-mediated rejection 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])in a randomized placebo controlled study showed no 
evidence of thrombotic events in any patient treated with 
Berinert® at 20U/kg x [ADDRESS_704462]-
transplant. In addition, recent reports from the FDA (Gandhi et 
al 2012) suggests that thrombotic events do occur with C1INH 
therapy, but most cases are associated with the product 
(Cinryze®). Thus, continued surveillance will be part of this 
study.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evidence of a Thrombotic Effect of C1INH Administration 
when Given in Supra
-physiologic Dosages to Animals:  Data on 
C1INH transgenic mice show that blood levels as high as 2mg/ml 
(Vinci,2002)(Appendix D). Other investigators have shown that 
ischemia-reperfusion injury is reduced in animals transgenic for 
C1INH expression (Vinci, 2002) (Appendix D).   Data provided by 
[CONTACT_540431] (Appendix 
D) shows that administration of Berinert® 
up to 200U/kg daily for 
14 days had no deleterious effects and 
did not induce coagulation abnormalities.

6 Statistical Methods And Determination Of Sample Size  
6.1 Statistical And Analytical Plans 
6.2 Determination of Sample Size 
 
The sample size calculations were based on a conservative 
assessment aimed to show ~50% reduction in DGF rates with C1INH 
application. Data from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Renal 
Transplant Program for DGF rates are shown below: 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 42  
Briefly, the DGF rates at our center for the proposed study 
groups are >70% compared to 33% for SCD donors. Thus, a 
conservative proposal is explored below. The sample size 
calculations showing 35 subjects per group would sufficiently 
power the study (80%) to show 50% reduction when an anticipated 
DGF rate of 50% for the study group is anticipated.
 
         
The “proportion” below is the proportion with DGF.  
A 2-sided test (to be more conservative) was performed. 
We assumed a 50% DGF rate in the Placebo group.
 
Treated group DGF rate vary: 20%, 25%, and 30%. 
sample size per group for 80% and 90% power are shown.

Statistical Assumptions  
 
 Since this study is a Phase I/II, we will primarily explore 
the safety of the proposed dose in the renal transplant 
population receiving high-risk ECD and DCD kidneys. Our 
previous experience in a population of highly
-HLA 
sensitized renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540409] 20U/kg (8 doses in 1 month) was safe and 
without AE or SAE when compared to placebo ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . 
Based  on the calculations above, we propose a randomized, 
placebo controlled trial of C1INH vs. placebo entering 35 
eligible patients into both arms of the study. 
7 Adverse Events (AEs)  
7.1 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
7.2 Adverse Event (AE) Definitions 
7.2.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject administered with a 
pharmaceutical product. The AE does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 44 be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of an investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related, include the following:  
 An AE occurring in the course of the use of a drug 
product in professional practice, 
 An AE occurring from an overdose whether accidental or 
intentional, 
 An AE occurring from drug abuse,  
 An AE occurring from drug withdrawal.  
 An AE where there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event occurred purely as a result of the subjects 
participation in the study (e.g. adverse event or 
serious adverse event due to discontinuation of anti-
hypertensive drugs during wash-out phase) must also be 
reported as an adverse event even if it is not related 
to the investigational product. 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected 
pharmacological action is not recorded as an AE if it is already 
reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  If, however, the 
event fulfills any of the criteria for a “serious” AE (SAE), it 
must be recorded and reported as such. 
 
7.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 results in death 
 is life-threatening 
 requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 is an important medical event 
Life-threatening:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition 
of “serious” refers to an adverse event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to 
an adverse event which hypoth
etically might have caused death if 
it were more severe. 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 45 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Any AE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540410], 
UNLESS at least one of the following exceptions are met  : 
 The admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or 
scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the 
study)   
 
OR 
 The admission is not associated with an adverse event 
(e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540411])   
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] ‘medically 
important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on 
clinical judgment.  In addition where local regulatory 
authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, 
the local regulation takes precedent. 
Disability:  a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life’s functions.  
Important medical event : Any adverse event may be considered 
serious because it may jeopardize the subject and may require 
intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance 
for determination of important medical events refer to the “ WHO 
Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical Terms List” . These terms 
either refer to or might be indicative of a serious disease 
state.  
Such reported events warrant special attention because of their 
possible association with a serious disease state and may lead 
to more decisive action than reports on other terms. 
SAE medwatch reports  WILL NOT be filled out for any prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540412]’ primary disease (ESRD).  For 
example, prolonged admissions for dialysis or readmission for 
fluid overload as a consequence of ESRD since this this is an 
expected complication of the patients’ disease state and not 
related to study drug. These events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_1600]. Otherwise, all SAEs medwatch reports will be submitted to 
the IRB, study sponsor and FDA.  
 
 
7.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event (AE) 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 46 Investigator Brochure (or Package Insert for marketed products). 
Also, reports which add significant information on specificity 
or severity of a known, already documented adverse event 
constitute unexpected AEs. For example, an event more specific 
or more severe than described in the Investigator Brochure would 
be considered “unexpected”. Specific examples would be; (a) 
acute renal failure as a labeled adverse event with a subsequent 
new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a 
first report of fulminant hepatitis.
 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_704479] 
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the 
administration of study drug is a clinical decision based on all 
available information at the time of the completion of the case 
report form. 
An assessment of ‘No’ would include:  
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g., 
mechanical bleeding at surgical site; or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the subject is struck by [CONTACT_540439]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a few days after the first drug adminis
tration.  
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_540413]. 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug include:  
 The temporal sequence from drug administration: The 
event should occur after the drug is given.  The length 
of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated 
in the clinical context of the event
 
 Recovery on discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence 
on reintroduction (re-challenge): Subject’s response 
after drug discontinuation (de
-challenge) or subjects 
response after drug re-introduction (re-challenge) 
should be considered in the view of the usual clinical 
course of the event in question 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each 
report should be evaluated in the context of the 
natural history and course of the disease being treated 
and any other disease the subject may have 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, 2014 47  Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs 
the subject is taking or the treatment the subject 
receives should be examined to determine whether any of 
them may be suspected to cause the event in question
 
 The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test 
drug(s), coupled with the individual subject’s 
pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
 
7.2.5 Severity Of The Adverse Event (AE) 
The following classification should be used: 
The severity of AEs should be graded as follows: 
Mild – usually transient in nature and generally not interfering 
with normal activities
 
Moderate – sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
activities 
Severe 
– prevents normal activities. 
 
7.2.6 Adverse Event (AE) Documentation 
All AEs occurring after the subject has signed the informed 
consent must be fully recorded in the subject’s case record 
form. 
Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s 
file.  A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically 
relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, 
requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, 
or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an 
AE.  Each event should be described in detail along with start 
and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational 
product, action taken and outcome. 
 
7.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Pregnancy  
Serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory test 
abnormalities fulfilling the definition of serious, after 
signing the informed consent and during follow- up period must 
immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be 
reported to the person detailed in the study file.  A Serious 
Adverse Event Form  must also be completed within 24 hours of the 
CONFIDENTIAL                         C1INH (Berinert®) IRI Study in Kidney Transplant  
Berinert® Ischemia/Reperfusion Study: V3 March 14, [ADDRESS_704480] be reported to the EC/IRB and Regulatory Authorities. 
All AEs, SAEs, and S[LOCATION_003]Rs believed or possibly attributable to 
the investigational product must be reported to CSL-Behring in 
accord with the signed Pharmacovigilance Agreement, which will 
also be included in the study file and regulatory binder.
  
Pregnancy occurring during a clinical investigation, although 
not considered an SAE, must be reported to CSL- Behring Inc. 
within the same timelines as an SAE on a Pregnancy Monitoring 
Form
. The outcome of a pregnancy should be followed up carefully 
and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be 
reported. This also applies to pregnancies following the 
administration of the investigational product to the father 
prior to sexual intercourse
.

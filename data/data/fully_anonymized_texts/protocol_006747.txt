1.1       SYNOPSIS   
Title:  MKit: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8677] a Life Skills Application to Address 
Interpersonal Relationships in College  
Study Description:  This study will conduct a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_8678] -based 
application (WebApp). MKit was previously adapted to a  diverse (race, 
ethnicity, gender/sexual identity) college population with a focus on 
life skills and holistic self -care as reinforcement to currently available 
primary prevention programming available to freshman student s. Our 
hypothesis is that the adapted WebApp will be safe, acceptable, and students will be willing to use it as a reinforcement to current university primary prevention programming.  
Objectives:  • Primary: To evaluate the safety, usability, acceptability, a nd 
willingness of using the adapted WebApp among a randomized sample of [ADDRESS_7976] year university students.  
• Secondary: To complete preliminary evaluations on retention and efficacy measures such as sexual and intimate partner violence knowledge, attitudes, and experiences  (victimization and 
perpetration) to allow for power calculations for a future R -level 
submission.  
Endpoints:  • Primary: Safety (qualitative interviews), Usability  (System 
Usability Scale, Brooke, 1986), Acceptability (investigator generated), and willingness to use (qualitative interviews).  
• Secondary: Retention (percent completing follow -up surveys), 
Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence Knowledge (adapted from [LOCATION_007] Education Program Participant Response Form) , Self -
Efficacy of Prot ective Behaviors Related to Sexual and Intimate 
Partner Violence (investigator generated), Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale (adapted from Finchman, Cuit, Braithwaite, & Pasley, 2008), Consensual Sexual Activity (investigator generated), Sexual vict imization/perpetration (Sexual 
Experiences Survey, Koss et al., 2007), and Universal Violence Prevention Screening (adapted from Heron, Thompson, Jackson, & Kaslow, 2003).

MKit Protocol   Version 1.[ADDRESS_7981] been minimal attempts at providing reinforcement for students around the primary 
prevention of sexual violence and nobody has approached this topic with the consideration of holistic well- being in mind. Many of the currently available primary prevention programs 
include a one -time interaction and do not provide reinforcement throughout the student’s college 
career (Banyard, Moynihan, & Plante, 2007; Foshee et al., 2004; Moynihan et al., 2015; Taylor, Mumford, & Stein, 2015; Ta ylor, Mumford, Stein, & Woods, 2015). Principles of learning 
suggest that attitude change and skill training are more effective with reinforcement (Skinner, 1958).
 There is a need for holistic interventions that provide students with the means to address 
all of the physical, emotional, and social changes they may be experiencing during their 
transition to young adulthood. Past research has emphasized that life skills and social 
competency are promising approaches that address individuals within their ecolog ical context 
(Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002).  
With a national annual incidence rate of 5%, rape is the most frequent violent crime that occurs 
on college campuses  (Finn, 1995; Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Nearly 80 -90% of college 
students know the perpetrator, which increases the likelihood that the rape will be c ompleted, 
rather than attempted (Fisher et al., 2000; Karjane, Fisher, & Cullen, 2005). Furthermore, many college survivors do not perceive or ac knowledge their experiences as a rape, often because of 
lack of evidence, the absence of a weapon, or because alcohol and/or drugs were involved (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003; Karjane et al., 2005) . These characteristics of sexual 
assault in college therefore contribute to the underestimation, under reporting, under prosecution, and low rates of seeking post -assault services among college survivors  (Bondurant, 2001; 
Karjane et al., 2005).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_8680], an event with long -term negative effects 
on a survivor’s health, few survivors receive comprehensive post -assault care. In the period 
immediately following a rape, about half of all survivors will have evidence of physical trauma, up to 30% contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and 5% of female survivors become pregnant  (Resnick et al., 2000). Specific to college survivors, about 20% report physical injuries  
(Fisher et al., 2000) , many fear social consequences so they alienate themselves from cam pus 
activities or drop out of school, and it appears that college women who experience post -traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) from an assault may use substances and/or sexual behavior to reduce distress (Messman -Moore, Ward, & Brown, 2009) . Post -assault, su rvivors can access 
comprehensive health services through referral by [CONTACT_8695] (SANE) programs. Comprehensive care includes 1) treatment of physical injuries or other sequelae of the assault, 2) pregnancy prevention, including options if emergency contraception is not effective, 3) STI screening and treatment, 4) psychological care for PTSD, 5) forensic and victim services, and 6) legal care, including safety from  the perpetrator and the ability to report the assault and press [ADDRESS_7982] 2018  
 7 charges if the survivor desires  (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006) . However, only one in five women 
raped as an adult reported their rape to the police and of these reported rapes , prosecution rates 
were only 37%  (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006) . Thus, the prevalence of rape is under reported, 
under prosecuted, and many women do not seek care after experiencing rape due to multiple 
barriers to care (Munro, 2014) .  
Even with the high prevalence and severe phys ical health, mental health, and social outcomes 
associated with sexual violence, there are limited data available on effective primary prevention programs  (Centers for Disease Control, 2016) . A recent systematic review of primary prevention 
programs for se xual violence identified only three primary prevention strategies that have 
demonstrated significant effects on sexual violence , including Safe Dates , Shifting Boundaries , 
and the [ADDRESS_7983] (VAWA) Funding  (DeGue et al., 2014) . However , 
there are promising trends that favor multisectoral programs that engage stakeholders to challenge the acceptability of violence and the underlying social risk factors. There is strong consensus among researchers that more rigorous evaluation of promising programs is needed in order to continue to address sexual violence  (Ellsberg et al., 2015) .  
Furthermore, recent national legislation has also highlighted the need for primary prevention of sexual violence. The Dear Colleague Letter  issued by [CONTACT_8696] [ADDRESS_7984] be offered primary prevention and 
awareness programs focused on domestic violence, sex ual assault, stalking, and rape. The 2014 
VAWA acknowledged specific content that should be included in these programs but did not stipulate how these  programs were to be administered to incoming students. Thus, each institute 
of higher education implements primary prevention programming individually, often using a 
combination of web- based, in- person, and performance -based methods.  
Many  college  campuse s rely on online  learning  modules  to meet  the requirements  of the 2014 
VAWA;  however, there  is a lack  of evidence  on the  effectiveness  of these programs  and the 
potential  that mobile  or web -based  applications  hold for the  prevention of  sexual  violence.  
Technology  has become  a ubiquitous  modality  for communication  and accessing  knowledge  
across  the United  States.  In 2011 the  White  House  called  for initiatives  that leveraged  technology  
to prevent  dating  and sexual  violence  (Rosenthal, 2013) . This  resulted  in the creation  of a mobile  
application  called  Circle  of 6 (http://www.circleof6app.com/
), which  makes  it easy  to contact  a 
person in  your circle to  let them  know  where you are and  what  you need. More  recently,  a 
randomized controlled trial at  a university  in the Southeastern  United  States  found a  web -based  
by[CONTACT_8697],  RealConsent, significantly  reduced  sexual  violence  perpetration  
and increased  knowledge  around consent, intervening,  and rape my ths and decreased  negative  
attitudes  around hostility  toward  women  (Salazar,  Vivolo- Kantor, Hardin, & Berkowitz, 2014) . 
However,  neither  of these technology -based  approaches  targets  the social  and cultural  
constructions  of sexual  violence  that promote  gend er inequality  and discrimination  nor do they  
offer holistic  approaches  to primary  and secondary  prevention (Dartnall  & Jewkes,  2013) . 
A holistic  approach  recognizes  college  students  as individuals  transitioning  into young  
adulthood. The  transition  into young adulthood is  associated  with  myriad  of preventable  health  
problems  including  higher  rates  of mortality  and more  involvement  in health  risk behaviors  
(Ozer  et al., 2012) . Additionally, college  students  are often  learning  to manage school, work, 
new relationships, stress,  conflict,  and their  own  health  for the  first time  as independent  young  
MKit Protocol   Version 1.[ADDRESS_7985] 2018  
 8 adults. A  holistic  approach aims  to identify  the student’s  goals  and needs  by [CONTACT_8698]. Positive  and respectful  communication within  interpersonal  relationships  
may help  prevent  some  types  of unwanted sexu al activity.  Furthermore, when  students  make 
decisions  consistent  with  their  values,  they  may  be less likely  to engage  in behaviors  or 
encounter  situations  where  sexual  assault  perpetration or  victimization  could occur.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_7986]/high -impact 
reinforcement intervention that could improve interpersonal relationships and reduce sexual violence within college camp uses.  As such, the available information suggests that the present 
clinical study has an acceptable risk -benefit ratio.  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  Justification for 
Endpoints  
Primary    
To evaluate the 
safety, usability, 
acceptability, and willingness of using the adapted WebApp among a 
randomized sample Safety will be assessed through qualitative 
interviews  
 Usability will be measured through the System Usability Scale  (Brooke, 1986)  
 The endpoints are 
common outcomes of interest for studies of technological interventions. These outcomes will be 
measured throughout 2.3       RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
[ADDRESS_7987] scale uptake.  
Secondary    
To complete 
preliminary evaluations on retention and efficacy measures , 
such as sexual and intimate partner violence knowledge, attitudes, and experiences  
(victimization and perpetration) to allow for power calculations for a future R -level 
submission.  Retention will be measured as the percentage of 
participants completing the 1 - and 5- month 
follow -up surveys.  
 Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence Knowledge will be measured with 20 items adapted from the [LOCATION_007] Education Program Participant Response Form (https://www.wcasa.org/file_open.php?id=787).  
 Confidence in the ability to handle situations related to sexual and intimate partner violence will be measured  using 15 investigator created 
items that called the, Self -Efficacy of 
Protective Behaviors Related to Sexual and Intimate Partner Violence.  
 Attitudes related to Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale will be measured using 34 items adapted from Finchma n, Cuit, Braithwaite, & 
Pasley (2008).  
 Consensual Sexual Activity will be measured with 2 primary questions developed by [CONTACT_473].  
 Sexual victimization (n=10) and perpetration (n=10) will be measured with the Sexual 
Experiences Survey (Koss et al., 2007).  
 
Experiences of intimate partner violence will be measured with 26 items adapted from the Universal Violence Prevention Screening 
(Heron, Thompson, Jackson, & Kaslow, 2003).  The endpoints are 
important , as the 
WebApp under study is a primary sexual violence prevention intervention with a focus on healthy relationships . As 
such, knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of sexual and intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration  are 
outcomes of interest. Though this pi[INVESTIGATOR_8681], obtaining data for power calculations for a larger study is a key component of this study.  
MKit Protocol   Version 1.[ADDRESS_7988] builds on the current momentum to address the primary prevention of sexual 
violence within [LOCATION_002] institutions of higher education as well as the proliferation of web -
based applications. A  before- and-after quasi -experimental, mixed -method pi[INVESTIGATOR_8682]. Two residence halls ( Alice 
Lloyd and Couzens ) at the University of Michigan will be randomized to receive either: (1) the 
control arm (n=150) which will receive usual care only (all incoming students receive three programs about healthy relationships and sexual violence including Haven, Relationship Remix, and Change it Up) or (2) the usual care (n=150) described abov e and the web -based intervention 
(MKit). We will use cluster -randomization by [CONTACT_8694] (to minimize contamination 
associated with individual -level randomization of students living in the same residence hall). 
Following the informed consent process, s tudents in both conditions will complete a baseline 
survey of xx questions . Baseline measures will include: 1) demographic data (n=12), 2 ) 
investigator developed questions on knowledge about sexual and intimate partner violence (n=20)  adapted from the [LOCATION_007] Education Program Participant Response Form 
(https://www.wcasa.org/file_open.php?id=787), 3) investigator developed questions on self -
efficacy (n=15), 4) 34 questions from the Revised Intimate Pa rtner Violence Attitude Scale 
(Finchman, Cuit, Braithwaite, & Pasley, 2008), 5 ) investigator developed questions on 
consensual sex (n=2), 6) 10 items from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) will measure past experiences with sexual violence (Koss et al., 2007) and 10 items from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) will measure past experiences with perpetration (Koss et al., 2007), and 7) 26 questions from the Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol – Adapted questions (Heron, Thompson, Jackson, & Kaslow, 2003) . All of these are measures have been validated 
and used extensively in the [LOCATION_002] to measure knowledge and attitudes related to gender -
based violence. Following the survey, students in the Intervention group will be given the 
opportuni ty to interact with the application at their own pace, choosing which content to view in 
the order they prefer.  
The Control group will only receive the usual care delivered to all incoming University of 
Michigan students, which includes Haven (an online c ourse about sexual violence), Relationship 
Remix (an interactive program about healthy relationships and sexual violence delivered by [CONTACT_8699]), and Change it Up (a theater based performance on by[CONTACT_8700]). The Intervention group will receive the usual care described above as well as access to MKit . They 
will be encouraged to interact with MKit throughout the study. Data will be collected on the content viewed by [CONTACT_3038], as well as the amount of time they spend within each content area, and the order in which they view the content.  
At 1 and 5 months, we will repeat all baseline measures in both groups. Participants in the Intervention group will a lso be asked to complete the 10- item System Usability Scale (Brook e, 
1996) and an investigator  created  5-item acceptability scale.  [ADDRESS_7989] 2018

For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], individuals who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible to 
participate in the study : 
1. Currently enrolled as a student at the participating university  
2. Participated in  Relationship Remix in Fall [ADDRESS_7990] -year or transfer student  
3. Willing to participate in the study  
4. Able to speak and read English  
For the semi -structured interviews, individuals who meet the following criteria will be 
considered eligible to participate in the study : 
1. Currently enrol led as a student at the participating university  
2. Participated in  Relationship Remix in Fall [ADDRESS_7991]- year University of Michigan college students, will be 
recruited for t he study. Two residence halls ( Alice Lloyd and Couzens ) at the University of 
Michigan will be randomized to receive either: (1) the control arm  (n=150)  which will receive 
usual care only (all incoming students receive three programs about healthy relationships and sexual violence including Haven, Relationship Remix, and Change it Up) or (2) the usual care (n=150) described above and the web- based intervention (MKit). We will use cluster -
randomization by [CONTACT_8694] (to minimize contamination associated with individual- level 
randomization of students living in the same residence hall). At the end of the Relationship [ADDRESS_7992] 2018  
 13 Remix program, a brief announcement w ill be made about the opportunity to participate in a 
research study about healthy relationships and palm cards will be distributed (see recruitment 
materials). We will recruit specifically from Relationship Remix to ensure that all experimental and control subjects receive the same primary prevention programming currently in place on campus. Interested students will receive a palm card with a link to either the MKit web -based 
application (Intervention) with an access code to sign- up for the website, or a l ink to the baseline 
consent and Qualtrics survey (Control) without access to the web -based application. At the end 
of the study, students from each condition will be invited to participate in an in- person semi -
structured interview. Students will receive th e invitation to participate in the semi- structured 
interv iew on the final page of their 5 -month follow -up survey. Students who opt to share their 
email address with the study team at that time will be contact[CONTACT_8701] -up an in- person interview 
based on use r status for the intervention (consistent user of MKit, frequent user of MKit, 
minimal user of MKit) and a diverse group based on gender, race/ethnicity, and age for the control group. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted with participants from bot h the 
Control group (n=10) and the Intervention group (n=15).  
The Intervention group will receive the usual care described above , as well as access to MKit . 
They will be encouraged to interact with the web -based application throughout the study. Built -
in reminders to the web -based application, an email alert, and a text -message alert (if the 
participant chooses to share their phone number) remind participants about their goals and encourage retention and continued engagement.  
 
 
This study will test a web -based application focused on healthy relationships and sexual 
violence . The web -based application will provide information and resources using a life -skills 
approach . Participants will also have the opportunity to set personal goals, find resources, and 
evaluate their interpersonal relationships and self -care. This web -based application will have the 
ability to be utilized on any smartphone , tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. 
Intervention group participants will have five months to interact with the WebApp content, as 
this time period should present sufficient time for meaningful short -term change in the outcomes 
of interest. Further , the study will run for the duration of the school year, allowing study staff to 
follow students from the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year as they interact with the WebApp content. Study participa nts can choose to interact with the WebApp 
and take study surveys whenever is comfortable and safe for them to do so.

The efficacy of this study is not a primary outcome as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8685], 
acceptability, usability, and willingness to use. However, a number of measures will be used to gather preliminary data for future scale- up at all three time po ints (baseline, 1 -month, and 5-
months). Study participants’  knowledge, attitudes, and experiences will be measured with the 
following measures:  
1) Investigator developed questions on knowledge about sexual and intimate partner violence (n=20) adapted from the  [LOCATION_007] Education Program Participant Response Form 
(https://www.wcasa.org/file_open.php?id=787)  
2) Investigator developed questions on self -efficacy (n=15)  
3) 34 questions from the Revised Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale (Finchman, Cui t, 
Braithwaite, & Pasley, 2008)  
4) Investigator developed que stions on consensual sex (n=2)  7          STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT

 16 5) 10 items from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) will measure past experiences with 
sexual violence (Koss et al., 2007) and 10 items from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) will measure past experiences with perpetration (Koss et al. , 2007)  
6) 26 questions from the Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol – Adapted 
questions (Heron, Thompson, Jackson, & Kaslow, 2003).  
All of these are measures have been validated and used extensively in the [LOCATION_002] to 
measure knowledge and attitudes related to gender based violence.  
The safety of MKit  will be assessed through post -intervention sem i-structured interviews, 
conducted with [ADDRESS_7997] medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686], a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8687], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outc omes listed in this definition.  
 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  8.2      SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

[IP_ADDRESS]   SEVERITY OF EVENT   
MKit Protocol   Version 1.[ADDRESS_7998] 2018  
 17 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_8702]. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a  
clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study in tervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established. 
The Principle Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropria tely regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as interm ittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The Clinical Research Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring 
any time after informed consent is obtained until the last day of study participation. Events  will 
be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  [IP_ADDRESS]   RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION

not considered study intervention related, including breach of confidentiality or lack of safety 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. All  adverse 
events (AEs) will be followed unt il satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the 
event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_8704]. 
The Primary Investigator  will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event  
including lack of safety  whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention 
caused the event. All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution 
or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_8704].

MKit Protocol   Version 1.[ADDRESS_8001] 2018  
 19 The Primary I nvestigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) . The UP report will include the following information: 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB  
project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other c orrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be  reported to the IRB and to the study 
sponsor within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be  reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 14 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs shoul d be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 7 days  of the IRB’s receipt of 
the report of the  problem from the investigator.

Primary Endpoint: MKit  is safe, usable, acceptable, and partici pants will be willing to use it. 
Secondary Endpoint: To  explore preliminary differences between the intervention and c ontrol 
groups  in regards to retention, knowledge, attitudes, and experiences related to sexual and 
intimate partner violence . 
Formal sample size calculations were not performed  because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688] . The 
number of subjects was chosen based on feasibility and is considered sufficient to meet the study objectives.  8.4.[ADDRESS_8002] 2018  
 20 All data collected through the pi[INVESTIGATOR_8689], usability, and acceptability . The data collected from the semi -structured interview 
subjects will be utilized to analyze the safety o f the application and the willingness of 
participants to use the application.  
 
9.4.1     GENERAL APPROACH  
The survey data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS); all 
p-values will be set  at <.05. Descriptive statistics will be assessed first. The baseline, [ADDRESS_8003] -intervention tests will be examined for measures of central tendency, 
measures of dispersion, and frequency distribution on outcomes. Analysis of variance  (ANOVA) 
will be utilized to determine if the scores on the baseline and follow -up tests differ significantly 
among the two arms. Usability and acceptability scores will be assessed among those in the intervention group.  
We are not powered to assess outcome measures (sexual violence experiences/behaviors, rape 
myth acceptance, or sexual relationship power ); however, we will look at the direction of effects 
for our outcome measures to allow for power calculations for a future R -Level submission. The 
results of this project will establish the safety and usability of this adapted web -based application 
for future scale -up. 
For the semi -structured interviews, all audiotapes  will be transcribed verbatim. Data analyses 
will be con ducted using an iterative process and the constant comparative method of analysis 
(Glaser, 1992). Member checking will contribute to credibility through validation of the research findings by [CONTACT_4317]. A codebook will be developed after repeated high -level reading of the 
transcripts by [CONTACT_3476]. Data will be coded and grouped into categories to facilitate abstraction and concept analysis.

from the intervention group and 10 participants from the control group. The usability for the 
WebApp will be assessed at two ti me points (1- month and 5- months) using the 10- item System 
Usability Scale (Brook e, 1996). The acceptability of the WebApp will be assessed at two time 
points (1- month and 5- months) using an investigator created 5- item acceptability scale. Usability 
and acceptability scores will be assessed among those in the intervention group.

[IP_ADDRESS]     CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS  
                  PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the participant and electronic documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study intervention.  The following  consent materials are submitted 
with this protocol:  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8690]  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8691]  
• Semi -Structured Interview Consent Form  
[IP_ADDRESS]     CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION
 
Informed consent is a process that is init iated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the participant will be asked to read and review 
the doc ument. For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], participants will read through the consent online prior to 
completion of the baseline survey and make the determination to participate in the study individually. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any study activities . Participant s will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, and that the study is not connected to their schooling . 
For the semi -structured interview, t he investigator will explain the research study to the 
participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as  research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to 
carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any study activities . Participant s will be inf ormed 
that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, and that the study is not connected to their schooling . A copy of the informed consent document will be 
offered to the participants if they would like it . The informed consent process will be conducted

relevant pr eliminary findings or prior research by [CONTACT_093].   
Response: Severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder, are associated with increased morbidity and mortality from 
somatic disorders.  People with a severe mental illness have a life 
expectancy as much as 10 -20 years less than people witho ut such 
disorders (Lomholt, et al, 2019).  These differences in morbidity are 
reflected in healthcare costs, with SMI patients incurring nearly $5,000 in 
annual Medicare costs for physical conditions more than patients without 
 Page 6 of 37  SMI with excesses observed for diabetes as well as ischemia and 
congestive heart failure. (Figueroa, et al 2020).  
 
While there are a number of factors that contribute to the physical health 
risks of people with SMI, obesity is of particular importance.  Obesity 
creates an increased risk for many common medical conditions, such as 
diabetes, heart disease, hypertension a nd cancer.  Moreover, people with 
SMI are about twice as likely as those without to be obese (McElroy, 
2009).  While there has been some evidence that suggests that individuals 
with SMI may be predisposed toward obesity and metabolic dysfunctions, 
it is al so clear that psychosocial factors and antipsychotic medications 
have a very strong impact.    
 
Among the psychosocial factors that appear to play a role are low self -
efficacy and motivation for physical/social activities, effects that may be 
exacerbated with the stigma experienced from the disorder, as well as 
from the effects of medications to trea t SMI (Gates, Killackey, Philips, & 
Alvarez -Jimenez, 2015).   
 
Antipsychotic medications also are powerful contributors to weight gain.  
D’Aurignac, Leonard, and Dubovsky (2014) demonstrated that 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], but not a placebo, led to a significant weight gain of 3.[ADDRESS_448473]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_359467] 10.34 lbs. in 
12 weeks, and increases in insulin, c -peptides and triglycerides (Graham 
et al, 2005).  This increase in weight, as well as increases in cho lesterol, 
leptin, and insulin, continue to increase over the first year of 
antipsychotics, and then stabilize (Mustafa, et al, 2019; Perez -Iglesias et 
al, 2014).  
There have been numerous studies that have examined weight loss 
interventions among those with SMI.  One of the most well -known, 
ACHIEVE, compared an 18 month lifestyle intervention (diet and 
exercise) with a control condition for SMI patients attending da y 
treatment centers.  At the end of the [ADDRESS_448474].  A recent meta -
analysis examined 41 randomized clinical trials focusing on interventions 
that attempted to decrease body weight through improved diet, increased 
activity, or both (Speyer, et al, 2019).  The overall conclusion was that 
 Page 7 of 37  these interventions led to statistically significant weight loss that was of no 
clinical significance (a difference of approximately 4.8 lbs), and which did 
not persist beyond the intervention.  While neither this meta -analysis nor 
an earlier one (Alvarez -Jimenez, Hetrick, Gonzalez -Blanch, Gleeson, & 
McGorry, 2008) found that the effects were stronger for patients with a 
shorter duration of disorder,  studies of weight management in other 
samples often find that it is easier to prevent weight gain than to l ose 
weight, given metabolic changes that occur with increased weight.  As a 
result, there has been recent interest in interventions to prevent weight 
gain among patients experiencing their first epi[INVESTIGATOR_359468].   
 
While there has been interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_359469] a SMI, most of the work has 
attempted to establish the acceptability and feasibility of interventions 
(e.g. Thompson, et al, 2020), o r has conducted small, uncontrolled studies 
of changes in weight in a group receiving the intervention.  There have 
been very few randomized clinical trials.  For example, Curtis et al (2016) 
provided [ADDRESS_448475] care.  Only 57% completed the programs 
and were available for analyses.  At the end of the [ADDRESS_448476] well -controlled study to date was conducted 
by [CONTACT_359483] -Jimenez and colleagues (Alvarez -Jimenez et al, 2006; Alvarez -
Jimenez et al, 2010).  This study randomized 28 patients to a  7-16 session 
early behavioral treatment including psychoeducation, dietary counseling, 
exercise, and behavioral therapy and 33 patients to routine care.  Patients 
in the behavioral treatment had gained significantly less weight, 9.0 lbs, 
by [CONTACT_2671] 3 month program than patients in routine care gain, 15.2 
lbs.  Nearly 97% of the sample was successfully followed up one year 
later, and there were not differences in their weight.   
 
Given the poor adherence in one study and the lack of a lasting effect,  
modifications of these weight management programs would be important 
to consider.  One particular aspect that has been shown to be effective 
with adolescents is the involvement of a p arent.

5.0 Study Design * 
5.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case-control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
Response: This is a multiple baseline N of 1 design.  Participants will chart their 
weight for two months prior to the initiation of a weight management program, 
and continue to cha rt their weight throughout the 3 month intervention and for 2  
months following the intervention.  
 Page 10 of 37   
6.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
6.1  Describe the study intervention and/or investigational agent (e.g., 
drug, device) that is being evaluated.  
Response: Families will receive a 12-week FBT adapted for first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743]. This 
will be delivered in 12 weekly meetings with a trained case manager and two “eating 
plan” education sessions. Both the patient with psychosis and parents are targeted for 
eating and activity/exercise ch ange to ensure a change in the shared family environment, 
which will also help weight control in both sets of participants, as well as medical issues 
that accompany obesity, including glycemic control, hypertension and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. If 
parents are not ov erweight/obese, they will still target improved health behaviors. They 
will learn about GREEN, YELLOW, and RED foods (healthy vs. unhealthy foods), 
energy density, glycemic index of foods, reducing serving sizes, eating less, healthy 
lifestyle and programm ed activity programs and recording their diets and activity. 
Weekly sessions will involve discussion of weight loss principles presented in modules in 
the weight control manual, and coaching parents and patients how to implement the 
Traffic Light Eating Pl an and healthy lifestyle techniques. At each session, participants 
meet with staff and attend a brief problem solving session with their case manager where 
they will troubleshoot any expected or encountered issues with implementing the 
program.  This intervention may be through Zoom (which is still approved for 
telemedicine interventions  in [LOCATION_001]) or in -person.  The NAVIGATE program has 
used telemedicine with this patient group throughout the past year successfully.   As part 
of treatment, participants wi ll weigh themselves daily with a Bluetooth scale. 
Contingency management ($1 per completed weighing) will be used to facilitate 
adherence to this weighing schedule.  
An innovative aspect of this treatment is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_359473]. The first step is to identify alternative 
activities th at have a higher reinforcement value than the patients’ favorite foods. 
First, participants will identify potential alternatives from the [ADDRESS_448481] then works with the patient to better 
specify the behavio r, ensure its feasibility and describe the parameters of the 
behavior (e.g. duration). After the participant and case manager agree on a list of 
alternatives (at least 5), the participant will complete the Behavioral Choice 
Questionnaire that assesses the reinforcing value of that activity in comparison to 
food. The most reinforcing food to be used to assess behavioral substitutes will be 
chosen from a list of usual meals that can be obtained from home cooked, fast 
food or casual dining restaurants. These a lternative reinforcements are used non -
contingently by [CONTACT_13935]/parents to provide highly desirable activities that 
compete with excessive food consumption.  
 
6.2 Drug/Device Handling: If the research  involves drugs or 
device, describe your plans to store, handle, and administer those 
 Page 11 of 37  drugs or devices so that they will be used only on subjects and be 
used only by [CONTACT_10733].  
• If the control of the drugs or devices used in this protocol will 
be accomplished by [CONTACT_10734], approved 
organizational SOP (e.g., Research Pharmacy SOP for the 
Control of Investigational Drugs, etc.), please reference that 
SOP in this secti on. 
Response: NA, the medication that patients are taking will be managed by [CONTACT_359484] a screening criteria.  
 
6.3 If the drug is investigational (has an IND) or the device has an IDE 
or a claim of abbreviated IDE (non -significant risk device), include 
the following information:

Response: [ADDRESS_448482] to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate) .  
Response:  We expect to screen approximately 50-75 individual  patients  in order 
to recruit 12  patient and family member dyads  who complete 75% of their visits.  

 Page 12 of 37  We are planning to enroll 15 dyads, but anticipate that 3 will not complete 75% of 
their visits.  
7.[ADDRESS_448483] access to? What percentage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit?  
Response: The NAVIGATE program admits [ADDRESS_448484] an additional 10 -15 patients. 
Assuming that 50% of the patients are eligible and interested, we would have 
approximately 25 -30 patients available for the study.

10.0 Eligibility Screening * 
10.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects’ eligibility.  
Screening refers to determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   
Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  
Response:   All patients in NAVIGATE meet the inclusion criteria of first epi[INVESTIGATOR_359474] a criteria for program entry.  These patients are almost 
always  on an antipsychotic medication.    Co-investigator [CONTACT_359492] , who 
is the director of the NAVIGATE program,  will determine from medical records 
whether patients meet criteria for age  and antipsychotic medication . She will also 
determine whether the patient has a substance use disorder or an eating disorder 
on the basis of the medical records.   [CONTACT_359493] will determine if the patient and a 
family member involved in the treatment woul d be interested in the program.  
Interested patients and family members will  be asked to sign a permission form 
for the research staff to contact [CONTACT_359485] .  Research staff will contact [CONTACT_359486], d escribe the program, determine their continued 
interest, and screen the family member with respect to residing with the patient, 
willingness to partic ipate in the program activities .  They will also screen the 
family member with respect to current substance use, ability to use technology, 
ability to weight themselves daily, and if female, whether they are currently 
pregnant or planning to be.  Demographic factors including education will be 
assessed.  If patients or family members did not complete high school, they will 
be told that there are written materials and they will need to complete a brief 
reading assessment at the first session.    
 
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part of this protocol.   
Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be

11.0 Procedures Involved * 
11.[ADDRESS_448489] is screened and 
determined to be eligible . Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and includ e enough detail 
so that another investigator could pi[INVESTIGATOR_10698] .  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response . 
Response: Participants and a household family member  will have a 
baseline session .  In this session, they will be asked to sign the consent and 
assent forms.  They will be given a brief reading test to ensure they can 
read at the 8th grade level.  They will then  complete the Behavioral Choice 
Questionnaire that assesses the reinforcing value of food. They  will also 
complete questionnaires regarding time perspective, consideration of 
future consequences, and have their height and weight measured.  
Following the baseline assessment, daily weights  will be collected over a 
two month period, and then families will be randomized to staggered 
initiation of treatment in blocks of [ADDRESS_448490] epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743]. 
This will be delivered in 12 weekly meetings with a trained case manager 
and two “eating plan” education sessions. Both the patient with psychosis 
and parents are targeted for eating and activity/exercise change to ensure a 
change in the shared family environment, which will also help weight 
control in both sets of participants, as well as medical issues that 
accompany obesity, including glycemic control, hypertension and 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_110259] a. If parents are not overweight/obese, they will still target 
improved health behaviors. They will learn about GREEN, YELLOW, and 
RED foods (healthy vs. unhealthy foods), energy density, glycemic index 
of foods, reducing serving sizes, eating less, health y lifestyle and 
programmed activity programs and recording their diets and activity. 
Weekly sessions will involve discussion of weight loss principles 
presented in modules in the weight control manual, and coaching parents 
and patients how to implement the  Traffic Light Eating Plan and healthy 
lifestyle techniques. At each session, participants meet with staff and 
attend a brief problem solving session with their case manager where they 
will troubleshoot any expected or encountered issues with implementing 
the program. As part of treatment, participants will weigh themselves daily 
with a Bluetooth scale. Contingency management ($1 per completed 
weighing) will be used to facilitate adherence to this weighing schedule.  
An innovative aspect of this treatment is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_359475]. The first step 
is to identify alternative activities th at have a higher reinforcement value 
than the patients’ favorite foods. First, participants will identify potential 
alternatives from the [ADDRESS_448491] then works with the patient to better specify the behavio r, ensure 
its feasibility and describe the  parameters of the behavior (e.g. duration). 
After the participant and case manager agree on a list of alternatives (at 
least 5), the participant will complete the Behavioral Choice Questionnaire 
that assesses the reinforcing value of that activity in compa rison to food. 
The most reinforcing food to be used to assess behavioral substitutes will 
be chosen from a list of usual meals that can be obtained from home 
cooked, fast food or casual dining restaurants. These alternative 
reinforcements are used non -contingently by [CONTACT_13935]/parents to 
provide highly desirable activities that compete with excessive food 
consumption.  
At the end of treatment, the patient and family member will receive the 
same assessment battery that they completed for the baseline session. 
They will also provide information on the implementation of the diet, 
exercise, and alternative reinforcement procedures.  
After an additional 2 months, the patient and family member  will return 
for the final assessment using the same assessment battery, as well as the 
 Page 18 of 37  implementation data. Families will be compensated for completing the 
assessment, sign their payment form, and be debriefed.

17.0 Data Management  and Analysis * 
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.   This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response : The project is a multiple baseline single case experimental design, with a [ADDRESS_448500] cohort will be randomly assigned to start 
the baseline from 1 to 9 weeks after entry. This will provide a significant basel ine (2 
months) for all participants with different initial points for the study.  
Analysis of the daily weights will involve discontinuous growth curve analysis 
using multi -level modeling (Singer and Willet, 2003). Separate models are 
developed for each participant which include the daily weights from the baseline 
(60 days), treatment ( 90 days) and follow -up (60 days) phases. Given the nature 
of the data, we would hypothesize significantly different slopes for the baseline vs 
treatment phases. We would also expect no significant differences between the 
slopes for the treatment phase and the follow -up phase. The primary analysis 
involves modeling each individual as a level one variable.  
 
17.2 If applicable, p rovide a power analysis.

Non-Technical Summary
Although surgery and anesthesia have become much safer on average, many patients still 
experience complications after surgery. Some of these complications are likely to be avoided or 
less severe with early detection and treatment. Barnes-Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807786] (ACT), which is a remote group lead by [CONTACT_807796]-practices treatments. The ACT also
uses machine learning (ML) to calculate patient risks during surgery as a way of measuring 
when the patient is doing better or worse.
We think that many times the right interpretation of the data or the right treatment to give isn’t 
clear until the surgery is nearly finished. The medical team in the recovery room (post-
anesthesia care unit, PACU) and surgical wards is responsible for deciding the treatment 
strategy, but they don’t have all the information available from the intraoperative monitors and 
events. The patient may still be too sedated or confused from the anesthesia to explain much 
about their preoperative history. Our goal is to use ML to create a report card for each patient 
that summarizes the preoperative assessment and intraoperative data in a way that is useful for 
postoperative providers. In addition to communicating specific facts and risks, the report card 
may cause the postoperative provider to ask different questions at handoff and spend more time
with vulnerable patients.
The goal of this study is to integrate these ML reports into the clinical workflow and to determine
if it does affect handoff behavior. The screened patients will be all adults having surgery at BJH 
with the division of Acute and Critical Care Surgery, Otolaryngology, Hepato-biliary Surgery, and
Abdominal Transplant Surgery with elevated risk of unplanned ICU admission. Exclusion criteria
are a planned ICU admission or outpatient surgery (no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]).
For each included patient, the ACT clinician will review the report card information, and the 
postoperative providers will receive it via a print-out or an Epic Best Practices Advisory 
integrated into their workflow. Our study will include 3 phases: (1) pre-intervention observation 
of handoff practices, (2) education and workflow adaptation of the intervention, and (3) non-
randomized evaluation. During the education and non-randomized evaluation phases, some 
days will be without-intervention and others with-intervention. On with-intervention days, all 
eligible patients on a given day will receive the intervention. On without-intervention days no 
patients will receive the intervention, but handoff outcome measures will be assessed. The main
comparison will be between with-intervention and without-intervention days in the evaluation 
phase. The primary outcome measure we will study is handoff effectiveness in the recovery 
room or wards. We will also survey providers on any inaccurate items, or major omissions.
This study will be conducted with a waiver of informed consent. It offers non-significant risk to 
patients. The ML report card will not recommend specific treatments, and decisions will remain 
in the hands of the supervising physician in all phases of care. The postoperative provider will 
also be given information about the report card and its limitations.
1 Background and Rationale
The operating room (OR) to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) handoff is a challenging 
transition for patients where communication errors frequently occur (Segall et al., 2012); 
subsequent adverse events are common and contribute substantially to mortality, costs, and 
other patient harms (Hines et al., 1992; Pearse et al., 2006; Story et al., 2010). Preventing loss 
of information during handoff is an important need to allow accurate early intervention in newly 
admitted patients. Handoff research has almost exclusively focused on checklists of expert-
specified topi[INVESTIGATOR_807787]. These checklists by [CONTACT_807797], and there is a tradeoff between checklist length-thoroughness and user fatigue-
compliance. Machine learning risk prediction has been widely recognized for its potential to 
decrease medical errors and failure to rescue (Xiao et al., 2018). However, provider uptake has 
been slow, often preferring simple scoring systems (Sanchez-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_36654]., 2018).  Providers 
skepticism of black box predictions and the difficulty of interpreting ML outputs has been 
suggested to be a major hindrance (Maddox et al., 2018). As a result, no published research 
explores the ability of ML to augment information transfer during handoff. Additionally, few 
clinical ML projects have been rigorously evaluated for changes in user behavior or designed for
end-user comprehension; development has focused on raw predictive accuracy, despi[INVESTIGATOR_807788] “interpretable” ML. Innovations in ML reports that improve the adoption and 
provider-understanding of ML predictions are a scalable, low-cost intervention to address the
need for improved information transfer and identification of at-risk patients in the postoperative 
setting.
At BJH, ML-assisted telemedicine for intraoperative providers is provided by [CONTACT_807798] (ACT) to allow early identification of errors, optimize early treatments, and 
prevent lapses in standard of care. The ACT includes ML-based predictions of multiple 
postoperative complications to identify at-risk and deteriorating patients; the intraoperative 
provider has indirect access to these predictions via a clinician in the ACT who filters the raw 
output and considers the ML prediction in their clinical context.
However, the core ACT clinical protocol does not contemplate providing the data summary and 
ML-prediction information to the receiving provider in the PACU or surgical wards. The 
proposed Outcome predictions, Data summaries, and Interpretive Notes Report (ODIN-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) 
study will provide a "report card" containing automatically generated summaries of pre- and 
intraoperative data along with ML output. This information will be presented to multiple 
postoperative providers with different contexts and use cases. PACU physicians and registered 
nurses (RNs) receive handoff from the intraoperative team and assume care for the patient in 
the immediate postoperative phase (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 45 minutes to several hours). They observe for 
appropriate recovery from anesthesia, surveil for developi[INVESTIGATOR_124923], treat common side 
effects of anesthesia. When the patient is ready to leave the PACU and communicate their
findings to the wards (surgical inpatient unit) RN. The PACU team also communicates to the 
intraoperative surgical team, who communicates to the wards "midlevel" (advanced practice 
nurse or resident MD) responsible for routine medical oversight, modifying medication 
strategies, and ordering additional diagnostic studies if necessary.
We hypothesize several mechanisms by [CONTACT_807799]. First, the report card will function as an “alert” for patients at high risk and direct 
attention to them. This additional review may reduce postoperative complications. Second, the 
report card may frame handoff communications around important data and issues relevant to 
the patient. By [CONTACT_807800], it may improve 
anticipatory guidance between the intraoperative, supervisory, and frontline team members.
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_807789], but will attempt to measure these potential 
mechanisms. We will survey postoperative providers to measure perceived handoff quality and 
coverage of important topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. We will validate these surveys with direct observations, debriefing 
interviews, and structured handoff evaluation tools.
The second objective of this study is to improve the usability of the ML report card and 
determine the rate at which clinicians believe the information it contains to be inaccurate. 
Clinical data is often "messy," and it is possible that the mechanisms we use to filter data may 
make mistakes. We will survey providers on errors (including omissions) to determine the 
"safety" of our implementation of the postoperative ML report card.
1.[ADDRESS_1116498], we will measure 
handoff and usability outcomes on alternating days with and without the intervention. (2:1 
intervention to non-intervention). We anticipate the number of intervention-deliver and education
days to be 30, but may have to periodically update the report card delivery requiring an 
additional delivery-testing period. During the entire study, we will accept and record any safety 
concerns from participants.
Methods
4 Participants, Interventions, Outcomes
4.1 Study Setting
This will be a single center, non-randomized clinical trial at Barnes Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BJH) in St. 
Louis, a large tertiary care academic medical center affiliated with Washington University in St 
Louis (WUSTL).
4.2 Participants and Eligibility
4.2.1 Inclusion criteriaAdults undergoing OR procedures in BJH South campus, including all of "Pod 2", "Pod 
3", "Pod 5" and excluding all procedure suites such as Interventional Radiology, 
Parkview Tower "Pod 1", Center for Advanced Medicine "Pod 4", Labor and Delivery 
suites.Surgical service is “Acute and Critical Care Surgery”, Otolaryngology, Hepato-biliary, 
Vascular, or Abdominal TransplantPlanned non-ICU disposition ("floor" and "observation unit" collectively "ward" patients).Calculated risk of unplanned ICU admission in the first 7 postoperative days in the top 
15% of historical records.
Risk of unplanned ICU admission will use the same calculator currently employed in the ACT. 
Risk factors considered include the surgery performed, demographics, laboratory values, 
comorbidities, vital signs, and medications.
Although patients are exposed to effects of the intervention, data is obtained from healthcare 
providers. Included providers are PACU nurses, PACU anesthesiology physicians, wards 
nurses, and wards midlevel providers (resident physicians, physician assistants, and advanced 
practice nurses) who are involved in a postoperative handoff for these patients.
4.2.2 Durations and sample sizes
The planned duration and size of each phase isPre-intervention observation: 60 working days, 50 patientsEducation and intervention delivery testing: 30 working days, 50 patientsIntervention evaluation: [ADDRESS_1116499] two enrollment criteriaAdults undergoing OR procedures in BJH South campus, including all of "Pod 2", "Pod

is taken from (1) the procedure schedule request , (2) the anesthesiologist day-of-service 
anesthesia plan documentation, (3) a predictive model based on the scheduled surgery. Cases 
with > 75% likelihood of direct ICU admission or outpatient discharge are automatically

is calculated using the same model described in 4.3.[ADDRESS_1116500], where final eligibility is confirmed.
During the intervention evaluation (phase 3), each day will be with or without intervention for all 
eligible patients. These will rotate 2:1 over work days , eg week 1 = (with, with, without, with, 
with), week 2= (without, with, with, without, with), week 3 = ( with, without, with, with, without)

code study links to an anonymous survey (no patient or provider information) for problems with 
the report card for the education and testing phase. The evaluation phase survey includes the 
additional questions in the appendix (triggered on date.
The ML risk profile generated for each patient will include risk of 30 day mortality, pulmonary 
complications and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute kidney failure, transfusion, deep venous thrombosis,
cardiac complications, and unplanned ICU admission. Additional predicted outcomes may be 
added based on feedback from healthcare team members. Risk profiles will display the average
for all patients undergoing the same surgery, the risks calculated using preoperative 
assessments only (i.e. excluding intraoperative data), and the end-of-case values (i.e. including 
preoperative and intraoperative data). Literature-based estimates of probability of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting and severe postoperative pain will also be included where elevated. 
Expert-curated summaries of important variables will be included in the Epic report card, which 
include: estimated blood loss, fluids given, opi[INVESTIGATOR_401372], duration of anesthesia, antibiotics 
given. Explanatory tools for the risk profile will also be generated based on SHAP values 
[Lundberg 2017] identifying the variables with greatest influence on predictions
Figure 4:  Example ML report card
The ACT detects that cases are near completion and that a report card should be triggered in 
two ways. First, the circulating nurse in each room electronically marks that a room is “close” in 
the EHR, usually during closure, to ensure that subsequent patients are called to the
preoperative area and supplies for the next case are readied. This is performed with high fidelity
as it is considered important to prevent case delays. The displayed OR schedule in Epic 
changes color, making this easily recognized. Second, an algorithm detects when changes in 
the anesthesia record suggest that the case is concluding. Both of these features cause the ML 
dashboard in the ACT (Figure 5) to highlight the patient as needing review to validate the report 
card. After manual validation, the report card will print directly in the operating room and a 
notification is sent to the circulating nurse to add it to the chart and provide it to the anesthesia 
team for handoff. The risk profile is then made active in a Best Practice Advisory in Epic.

Communicating from the ACT to the PACU physicians presents several advantages. First, the 
ACT clinician is familiar with the general model of ML output generated by [CONTACT_807802], 
minimizing risk to participants. Second, because on a given day a single attending physician 
and resident oversees the PACU at BJH South Campus, friction related to communication 
between the ACT and these providers will be minimized as these contacts become routine. Both
parties will have the opportunity to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_807791]. Third, because the ACT-postop communication happens 
before  formal handoff, it will allow these providers to look into higher risk cases before they 
arrive and ask more detailed questions during handoff. We anticipate that most interactions will 
consist of simply forwarding the report card. The ACT will not communicate directly to PACU 
nurses or ward providers.
ML output will be generated on a server controlled by [CONTACT_807803]. This is the same server and data access 
mechanism used by [CONTACT_807804]. A feed of preoperative and intraoperative data extracted 
from the Epic EHR designed for use in the AlertWatch system is currently saved in a database 
maintained by [CONTACT_807805], which we will access using
encrypted transport mechanisms. The server will also have a TLS-encrypted and password 
protected web interface (dashboard) for debugging, message generation, and manual end-of-
case triggering. The web interface will allow study technical staff and ACT clinicians to look up 
current and previous risk profiles by [CONTACT_807806], patient identifier and date, or date, time, 
and operating room number. It will also allow them to manually enter that a case is concluding, 
and to mark a day as "with-intervention". The study identifiers, date, time, end of case marker, 
intervention indicator, and ML output will be stored on the WUSTL Research Infrastructure 
Services Data Storage Platform. The RIS Data Storage Platform is a scalable distributed 
storage solution with an integrated long-term archive. It is institutionally approved for protected 
health information, and requires WUSTL-key authentication and 2-factor authentication outside 
WUSTL facilities. Data access is granted only on a per-user basis and logged. The ML server is 
behind the Washington University firewall and inaccessible from off-campus computers.
To avoid misleading postoperative providers, we will create a brief educational sheet explaining 
the purpose of the study and the items included in the risk profile (attached). The educational 
sheet will include the calibration accuracy and other appropriate metrics regarding the 
predictions. For example, at the screening threshold we will use the sensitivity for AKI is about 
50%, meaning that the provider should not be falsely reassured by [CONTACT_807807]. We 
will stress that these risk predictions were formed in the context of usual care at BJH, and that a

lower risk prediction does not justify withholding a therapy that they would otherwise give. These
sheets will be linked in the report card. A draft of the sheet is included with this application, but it
may be modified based on feedback from providers. We also plan to periodically recalibrate the 
ML algorithms based on new data, and will update the accuracy metrics accordingly.
4.3.[ADDRESS_1116502] relevant input variables for ML predicted risks, 
expert-curated important variables, and other “explanatory tools” derived from the ML risk 
prediction method. Transcribed below from the TECTONICS (IRB# 201903026) protocol is the 
method for generating ML risks from preoperative and intraoperative data (internal citations 
omitted):
We are integrating the machine-learning forecasting algorithms for adverse outcomes with our other 
alerting tools, and will be testing and improving them over the co urse of the study. The feasibility of this 
integration is supported by a previous successful trial, where member s of our investigative team, using 
live data from the EHR, implemented machine learning algorithms to gu ide a rapid response team in 
medical wards. Furthermore, the results of the prior study provide  strong support for using the multi-path 
convolutional neural network (MPCNN) model to build and regularly  improve predictive machine-learning 
algorithms that will be used to forecast adverse outcomes (e.g. , renal failure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], delirium, 
death) in the TECTONICS trial. We found that our algorithms, which a re based on extensive patient 
information (i.e., demographic characteristics [including sex as  a biological variable], surgical risk, co-
morbidities) as well as time series physiological data (e.g., blood pr essure, temperature, heart rate) 
predict outcomes such as death with high area under receiver o perator characteristics curve (~90%), 
acceptable sensitivity (~50%) and excellent specificity (~95%). Th ese algorithms will augment dynamic 
risk assessment in the ACT. Our MPCNN algorithms are unusual in th at they are designed to handle 
heterogeneous data types, including numerical features, cat egorical features, and multivariate time 
series. By [CONTACT_807808] g phase together, our algorithms are able 
to jointly learn complex feature interactions among different data ty pes, ultimately improving predictions of
adverse perioperative outcomes (such as in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], po stoperative acute renal failure, 
postoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]). As our models accept raw data  directly, high quality real-time prediction 
can be achieved.
The machine learning algorithms that will be used as part of the TECTONICS trial were developed, 
tested, and validated using multiple studies. We have tried man y other algorithms, including in our 
ACTFAST2 study, and convolutional neural network (CNN) gives th e best overall performance. We 
recently compared our CNN method with more than [ADDRESS_1116503] well-developed sophisticated machine learning te chniques, and the application of our 
algorithms to the intraoperative setting – where changes in patien t trajectory occur very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] – is a 
novel application of this technology.
4.3.3 Other Interventions
We will notify the PACU anesthesiology resident when report cards are generated for high-risk 
patients. This notification will occur by [CONTACT_807809] a BJH-issued phone which is passed between 
residents at each shift. The notification does not contain PHI or PII, only that a particular OR has
a high-risk patient.
Discussed in the Outcomes section, the study also includes a survey for providers, which we 
mention here because of its patient-information security implications. The Epic BPA (and 
printout) will contain a patient-specific link and QR code to a RedCap survey. This survey 
contains no PII, only a randomized study ID.
Information flow and security.  To minimize the risk of protected health information (PHI) or 
personally identifiable information (PII) leaking from the health-care environment, we will restrict 
communications to providers to secure and auditable delivery modes. A diagram of the flow of 
information is included in Figure 6. There are [ADDRESS_1116504] flows of information: from the ML server 
and ACT tower to the PACU provider notifying them that a high-risk patient is emerging (the 
alert), from the ML server and ACT to the healthcare provider in the body of the report card, and
between the postoperative provider to the research coordinator with their survey responses 
(provider survey).
The alert is designed to include minimal potentially sensitive information. It will contain the 
location of the patient (operating room, PACU bay destination) and that the risk of patient 
decompensation is elevated. The name, MRN, date of birth, or other identifiers are not included.
Figure 6: Information flows and security
The only individuals who can access the report card (which contains no PII) are (1) Epic users 
who access the patient's chart (2) pre-approved users in the ACT who log in with their wustl-key
(3) individuals reading the patient's paper chart. The ML server will be behind the WashU-BJH 
firewall, and therefore only accessible from authenticated users on campus or logged in via 
VPN. Access to the report card will be logged by [CONTACT_132379].
The survey is an outcome measurement, discussed in more detail below. The survey link is
patient and date specific using the study ID, but does not contain the patient name [CONTACT_594427]. The survey link will be contained in the Epic BPA and the print-out in the form of a 
QR code; because study IDs are long and randomized they are functionally un-guessable. 
Versions of Android and iOS since [ADDRESS_1116505] the study based on 
feedback from providers and qualitative observations of handoffs conducted as part of other 
research projects. The primary objective (comparison of contact [CONTACT_807810]) will be 
unaffected. The total number of ACT-postoperative provider contacts is limited by [CONTACT_807811]. We may adjust the screening threshold 
to avoid overwhelming either provider. We will record PACU participation, and if participation in 
handoff has been low, or the overall subjective utility is low we will revisit the method of ACT-
postoperative provider communication. We anticipate small improvements and changes to the 
underlying risk prediction algorithm. This is required because of ongoing changes in the data 
sources that feed into the algorithm, changes in documentation practices, and periodic need to 
re-calibrate predictions based on changes in unmeasured risk factors. We will update the 
information provided with the report card to reflect any such changes.
4.3.[ADDRESS_1116506] (failing to contact 
[CONTACT_807812]) will be minimized by [CONTACT_807813].
4.3.[ADDRESS_1116507] will be directed by [CONTACT_807814]. Intra- and postoperative 
care will be directed by [CONTACT_807815].
4.4 Outcomes

[Yes, No]
[If yes, please describe: text box]
[If * yes] How much did the ML report change questions asked or information 
transfer at handoff?
[ Not applicable , Not at all , a little , a fair amount , a great amount ]

injury).
4.5 Sample Size
Precision on the absolute rate of clinician-rated inaccurate reports depends on the rate, but for 
0/150 clinically inaccurate reports, the upper 95% confidence limit is 2.4%. Handoff surveys will 
be dichotomized into (un)acceptable. If the baseline rate of "acceptable" handoff is 70%, 50 
patients without and 100 patients with intervention implies an 18% absolute increase as the 
minimum change with 80% power. The study is designed primarily to assess the perceived 
safety and workflow integration of the report card, not any patient outcomes.
4.7 Recruitment
Because of the nature of the study, recruitment of patients will be automatic.
PACU providers will be determined from the schedule and approached in the morning of their 
shifts for consent for participation.
4.8 Allocation
Allocation is determined solely by [CONTACT_807816].
4.9 Blinding
Patients will not be directly informed of their involvement in ODIN-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], nor are they likely to 
discover this as the intervention occurs while they are under or emerging from anesthesia. 
Clinicians will be unblinded by [CONTACT_807817]; however, they will not know if a
non-contact [CONTACT_807818].
5 Data collection, management, analysis
5.1 Data Collection Methods
Pre- and intraoperative data will be extracted from the EHR and AlertWatch as specified in the 
TECTONICS (IRB# 201903026) protocol identically to the clinical operations of the ACT. 
Postoperative exploratory outcomes and patient demographics will be extracted from the EHR 
by [CONTACT_807819]. Survey instruments are included in the appendix and 
above. Because of the nature of study timing and extraction of data collected during the normal 
clinical process, no additional retention efforts of patient-level communication is planned.
5.[ADDRESS_1116509] will use clinical applications available to all clinicians to monitor ongoing surgical 
procedures. These applications can only be accessed over the secure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_807793]. This arrangement meets and/or exceeds HIPAA standards Patient Health Information 
(PHI) security. AlertWatch® is an approved clinical application at Barnes-Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
therefore maintains these same levels of protection. Access to the data collected in this study 
will be restricted to approved personnel. It is a strict policy that PHI content cannot be reviewed 
outside of this protected environment. When possible, extracts from this project will avoid the 
use of PHI. De-identified patients can be identified using a special, non-PHI primary key which
will be stored on the RIS Data Storage Platform.
Data will be maintained for at least seven years after the close of the study in accordance with 
Washington University guidelines. Further study record retention will be at the discretion of the 
study investigator. Data may be used for future studies not mentioned in the protocol.
  
5.3 Statistical Methods
Differences in the rate of acceptable handoffs will be compared with chi-square contingency 
table tests.
Although the primary analysis is intention to treat (comparing the with- and without-intervention 
groups directly), we will report as exploratory analyses per-protocol analyses in which patients 
whose report card was never accessed (outside of the ACT) are excluded.
5.[ADDRESS_1116510] will be marked as in-testing.
6 Monitoring
6.1 Adverse event and safety monitoring:
No data safety monitoring committee is planned for this sub-study due to the non-significant risk
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_774784]. No external safety monitor is planned, though all adverse events will be 
reported to NCATS (funder of the study).

7 Ethics and Dissemination 
7.1 Ethics review approval
This study has been submitted to the Human Research Protection Office at Washington
University (St. Louis, MO). This study will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov.
7.[ADDRESS_1116512] report template are anticipated 
and will not be regarded as protocol modifications.
7.3 Consent
A waiver of informed consent for patients  is requested.
1) The study presents non-significant risk to participants. The report card is not intended as
an implant and presents no potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a 
subject. The report card is not purported or represented to be for use supporting or 
sustaining human life. The report card is not being used for substantial importance in 
diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of 
human health. Treating physicians retain control over all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and no specific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78739]. The warning may at most “drive” clinical management. The
conditions predicted in PACU are not generally life-threatening and providers have time
to correct any errors that they make. The ACT clinician will screen out grossly incorrect 
alerts. The educational sheet presented prior to the report card will remind providers that
the report card is intended to cause them to seek out additional information and draw 
their own conclusions about the best course of action for a particular patient; it is not an 
alarm intended to provoke immediate clinical action.
There is no obvious mechanism for physical, psychological, financial, or legal harm. 
Patients in the usual care (non-contact) period remain in the current standard of care 
with critical-care level oversight by [CONTACT_807820]-one recovery. It is 
unlikely that physicians would take harmful action based on the information in the 
contact-arm report as it does not recommend specific actions. Because the education for
providers will include the ~50% sensitivity of the alert, they will be aware not be falsely 
reassured by [CONTACT_807821], the minimal necessary amount of information about subjects is 
collected, and best practices are used to secure it.
2) The project is not scientifically feasible without a waiver of consent. At the time when 
eligibility can be determined, the patient has undergone anesthesia or sedation, and 
would need to have been consented in preop (or preferably sooner). Difficulty with 
obtaining same-day consent would lead to a much more selected population and not 
answer the pragmatic scientific question. It would also lead to a much slower 
recruitment, making it likely that the trial would fail to complete in a timely fashion and 
“wasting” the effort.
3) Because of the need to link intraoperative risk models to patient locations and outcomes,
it is not possible to conduct it without identifiable private information.
4) The waiver will not affect the rights or welfare of the participants. As the Secretary’s 
Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections notes in 2008, this requirement 
related to any other legal consent requirements, which are not present in this case. 
Additionally, we should consider if the population would object to the waiver if informed 
of it or believe that it could cause them harm. We believe that due to the novel nature of 
the technology, standard-of-care control arm, minimal risk, and diversity of successful 
PACU staffing models participants would not object to participation.
5) There are no special circumstances necessitating post-facto information provision to the 
patient. This requirement is intended for research involving deception.
A participation document will be included at the beginning of the workday for PACU physicians 
and postoperative providers receiving messages describing the study.
A partial  waiver of informed consent for providers is requested. Providers are exposed to the 
report card and may optionally complete the above survey reporting inaccurate data.  Because 
(1) surveys do not collect identifying information and participation requires active effort, (2) 
predicting the applicable providers is impossible, separate consent forms will not be obtained 
and we request a waiver of consent .  Study information is included in the survey link which 
includes that their participation is completely voluntary, that no communication is made to the 
institutional leadership, and that all stored information is anonymized to the extent possible.
1) The study presents non-significant risk to participants. Survey responses are securely 
stored and contain no identifying information. Providers can skip the survey without any 
harm.
2) The project is not scientifically feasible without a waiver of consent. Because the 
midlevel and nursing providers for this subset of patients are not knowable ahead of 
time, we would need to consent every possible nurse and midlevel provider.
3) No identifiable private information is requested.
4) There is no foreseeable effect on the rights or welfare of the participants. Because it is 
unidentified, there is no mechanism for (non) participation to affect the providers.
5) There are no special circumstances necessitating post-facto information provision to the 
patient. This requirement is intended for research involving deception.
For direct handoff observations, participants will be approached and provided with study 
information before handoff begins. We will identify the relevant OR cases and approach the OR 
staff during emergence from anesthesia. Because the participating PACU and ward nurse is 
impossible to identify ahead of time (these are assigned throughout the day), we will approach 
and ask for written consent shortly before handoff begins. We will attempt to approach the pool 
of PACU nurses with study information during the morning of days on which we plan direct 
observations, with the goal of having discussed the study with participants before the patient 
arrives.
Because many PACU nurse to ward nurse handoffs occur over phone calls, having obtained 
consent to observed the handoff observation from the PACU nurse, we will disclose our 
observation of the PACU nurse to any party on the phone, allowing them to request privacy if 
needed.
No consent will be recorded for the education phase in which we notify staff members how to 
use the intervention as all information collected in that phase is completely anonymous.
Because of the nature of the intervention. no provisions are made for ancillary post-trial care or 
participants who are harmed. Participants will receive appropriate care at BJH prior to 
discharge.

This protocol was written in compliance with the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_807794].
7.[ADDRESS_1116514] observations of handoffs. The study 
personnel will be screened by [CONTACT_807822], use appropriate face 
coverings, and practice physical distancing. During obtaining consent to observe, hand hygiene 
will be observed with disposable pens and paper records stored in a daily "used documents" 
cardboard folder to minimize accidental fomites. During observation of handoff the assistant will 
maximize physical distance while being able to overhear the conversation. This activity will not 
continue during any time of increased community transmission (e.g. cancellation of elective 
surgery).
The personnel in the ACT, PACU providers, and wards providers are all present at BJH as part 
of their usual clinical activity with no modification. Individuals are contact[CONTACT_807823].
Electronic informed consent is used, creating no additional risk of exposure.
Patients are exposed to no increased risk of exposure; no study personnel directly interact with 
the patient.

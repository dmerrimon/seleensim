6 This protocol is an open label, single arm, non- randomized, phase I /  II clinical trial 
investigating the use of  commercially available pegylated interferon alpha- 2a (peg -IFN-α, 
Pegasys®, Genentech) for prevention of relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  at very 
high risk for relapse or  not in remission at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT). The inability to attain remission status following induction therapy 
for AML remains a significant problem and is associated with poor outcomes. While HCT remains a curative option, its effectiveness in the setting of relapsed or  primary  refractory 
AML is significantly diminished due to high rates of  relapse.  
The anti -leukemic properties of HCT are primarily attributed to the combined effects of 1) 
pre – transplant chemotherapy (termed conditioning) and 2) the immunologic effects of 
donor cells (termed graft -versus -leukemia or GVL). While increasing the intensity of 
conditioning reduces relapse, this strategy has historically been associated with greater toxicity. Alternatively, improving GVL without added toxicity (particularly graft -versus -host 
disease) represents an alternative strategy for limiting relapse and improving outcomes, 
which is the  primary  aim of this protocol.  
IFN-α, FDA approved for viral hepatitis, has demonstrated anti -tumor activity in several 
hematologic malignancies including myeloproliferative diseases and CML. . IFN -α has 
also shown feasibility in the treatment of post HCT relapse by [CONTACT_306819], without significant toxicity. Recent insights from pre- clinical studies in HCT 
have now identified a central role of IFN -α in enhancing tumor cell  antigen presentation, 
thereby [CONTACT_306820] T cell responses (GVL) without GVH D. In this 
protocol, we propose to administer peg- IFN-α to prevent relapse by [CONTACT_306821].

August [ADDRESS_375603] for AML not in remission 
Allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative therapy for  many 
high risk hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1). In recent 
years, t he number s of HCT have increased to greater  than 20,[ADDRESS_375604] common indication ( 2, 3). Although outcomes  have improved by 
[CONTACT_306823] , infection, and  acute graft-versus -host disease (a GVHD); 
relapse remains the princ iple cause of treatment failure (2, 4)(FIGURE  1). Relapse rates  
after HCT range from  25 - 65% in patients  with AML and is  determined by a number of  
factors including conditioning intensity, cytogenetic  risk, molecular profile and status of 
disease ( 5-10). Patient s with AML not in remission (e.g. relapsed or refractory to induction 
therapy)  consistently have the highest incidence of relapse, exceeding  50% in the first 
year after HCT  (8, 11, 12). Likewise, detection of minimal residual disease by  [CONTACT_306824]  (< 5% myeloblasts)  
have similarly correlated with high post HCT 
relapse rates  and poor surviva l(13, 14). 
More recently , adverse cytogenetic and / or 
molecular  risk by  [CONTACT_306825] (15, 16). In these 
settings, h igh relapse  together  with 
common ly encountered HCT related 
mortality have resulted in disease free 
survival s of approximately 10 – 20% (12, 
17). Furthermore,  the median survival is [ADDRESS_375605] due to 
ineffective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (18). Considering 30 - 40% of AML patients  do not obtain remission 
after induction therapy, the scope of this problem is significant . Thus, while  HCT remains 
the lone curative therapy for  relapsed and refractory  AML (11), treatment strategies that 
limit relapse  after HCT  are urgently needed  to improve outcomes . 
 
3.2 Approac h 
to relapse for  AML not in remission: conditioning therapy  
We have previously approached the problem of  relapse after HCT by  [CONTACT_306826] -leukemic properties  without adding significant  toxicity to myeloablative 
transplant  conditioning . Clofarabine, a second generation purine nucleoside analog, had

 previously demonstrated potent anti -leukemic properties in treatment of relapsed AML 
(19, 20). Patients with relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies, predominantly  
AML not in remission at HCT  (N = 31) , were treated on a phase I/II clinical trial with 
myeloablative clofarabine and busulfan (C loBu4) (21). This regimen demonstrated  
signif icant  early  activity  in AML w ith 94%  of patient s achieving remission post HCT. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_306778] , 44% of patient s eventually relapsed after HCT . The two-year 
overall survival (OS)  was 35%, which compared favorably to historical outcomes  of 
approximately 10 - 15% for  AML patients  with similar characteristics treated with  
conventional myeloablative conditioning ( 17). In order to confirm these observations, 
CloBu4 was tested in a multicenter trial of  relapsed / refractory  AML (22). This trial has 
now completed accrual (N =  74) and again  demonstrated a very high day [ADDRESS_375606] 
CR rate of  90%, with relatively low  toxicity  (non-relapse mortality  of 20% at one year) . 
However,  at early follow up the incidence of  relapse was  higher  than in our  initial  phase I 
/ II experience, estimated to be 50 % at six months and 60% at one year  (FIGURE 2) . 
Therefore, although CloBu4 may be  associated with higher  CR r ates, less toxicity and 
possibly  improved overall survival when compared to traditional myeloablative regimens , 
ultimately a pattern of high early  relapse is observed ( 9). This suggests that myeloablative 
conditioning may be  effec tive at  inducing initial leukemia free states  in patients with 
refractory AML, unfortunately , in many instances these remission s cannot be sustained . 
3.[ADDRESS_375607].  In our combined experience 
using CloBu4 conditioning  (N = 105 ), 60% of  all 
relapses occurr ed within [ADDRESS_375608], and 
82% by [CONTACT_306827], and 91% by [CONTACT_306828]. Therefore, although late events  occur,  
estimating early  relapse (e.g. six months)  
appears to be a good predictor of  overall  rates . 
Furthermore, c onsidering these kinetics , 
therapeutic strategies aimed at  preventing 
relapse might ideally have the greatest impact if  administered 
very early after HCT.

the graft -versus- leukemia (GVL ) effects of HCT to limit relapse  
3.4.1 Biolo gy of GVL  
The clinical observation of high remission rates after myeloablative conditioning coupled 
with subsequent relapse suggests the occurrence of a transient minimal residual disease

August [ADDRESS_375609] recognize both tumor specific 
antigens (TSAs) and alloantigens  (23). However,  naïve donor T cells  initially administered 
in the HCT inoculum  are not activated (or primed) against TSAs  and are easily  rendered 
tolerant (24, 25). Although tumor  cells themselves may illicit immune  responses, we have  
shown that  antigen presenting cells (APCs)  play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_306779] T 
cell specific  responses against tumor cells , Reddy, Nat Med. 2005 Nov;11(11):1244- 9 
and Toubai, Blood. 2013 May 16;121(20):4231- 41 (23, 26 ). 
3.4.[ADDRESS_375610] and donor APCs play important  roles in mediating GVHD (27, 28), but APCs of 
host origin ar e particularly implicated in GVL  (23, 26, 28). These interactions facilitate 
potent CD8+ T cell responses that can be directed at both allo- antigens and TSAs (23, 
29). Specifically, a subset of  host APCs, CD8α+ DCs , are among st the most  specialized  
at presenting exogenous antigens in the context of  class I  major histocompatibility 
complex  (MHC  class I), a process termed cross -priming or cross -presentation that is 
crucial for inducing cytotoxic T cell responses  (30). Due to their similar specialization in  
cross- presentation of soluble and cell associated antigens to CD8+ T cells,  human blood 
DC antigen 3 (BDCA3 +) DCs or CD141+ DCs are putative human homologs to murine 
CD8α+ DCs (31, 32 ). 
Host DCs persist early after HCT, but  are 
eventually  replaced by  [CONTACT_306829]  (33-35). Experimental 
models of donor lymphocyte infusion indicate 
that GVL responses  are optimized in the mixed  
host / donor  chimer ic state ; presumably due to 
DC presentation of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306780] -antigens and 
TSAs (36). This suggests that in addition to the 
rapid pace of relapse, there is a biologic basis for 
early post HCT interventions that promote GVL 
through DC cross- presentation. Although ex vivo  
activation of T cells  to TSAs  may circumvent the 
requirement for host DCs and generate effective 
GVL, significant cost and infrast ructure are 
needed for clinical translation ( 37). There also  
remains  limit
ed knowledge as to whether  ex vivo  approaches  will mimic the  robust 
memory responses observed with in vivo  activation. 
3.4.3 Methods to enhance cross presentation: Polyl:C and Type I Interferon. 
We have shown that host CD8α+ DCs play a critical role in mediating murine GVL (26). 
In multiple models of HCT, allogeneic mice deficient in CD8α+ DCs (Batf3-/-) consistently

August [ADDRESS_375611] rated significantly impaired tumor clearance compared to allogeneic and 
syngeneic controls , despi[INVESTIGATOR_306781]-type 
animals ( FIGURE 3 ). Thus, CD8α+ DCs  appear necessary  for generating effective GVL  
responses , but distinct from the generalized alloreactivity of HCT . Likewise , we have 
shown in subsequent experiments that  loss of CD8α+ DCs coincided with a concomitant 
decline in  tumor specific  CD8+ T cells . Additional signals acting upon DCs can 
significantly  influence whether cross  presentation res ults in T cell responses or 
inactivation ( tolerance) . Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), expressed predominantly on CD8α+ 
DCs, represents one signal that has been shown to greatly amplify  the cross- presentation 
of exogenous  viral antigens  and promote  cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses  (38). We 
treate d HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306782]:polycytidylic acid 
(polyI:C), a Toll -like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist,  to increase DC cross presentation. In 
these models of GVL we observed a significant increase in GVL effects  without 
aggravati ng GVHD ( FIGURE 4 ). Importantly, anti -tumor effects were optimized in the 
context of simultaneous alloantigen responses and were not observed in the 
syngeneic controls.  Collectively, these results confirm the relevance of cross -
presentation by  [CONTACT_306830]8α+ DCs for  mediating experimental GVL, in the context of 
allogeneic HCT .  
Multi ple lines of evidence suggest type I 
interferons  (e.g. IFN-α/β), long available 
clinically , mediate their  anti-tumor  effects  in 
part through  cross-p resentation by [CONTACT_398]8 α+ 
DCs and subsequent antigen specific CD8+ 
T cell responses (39). Type I IFNs  released 
by [CONTACT_306831], 
differentiation, co-stimulatory molecule 
expression and cross- presentation ( 40, 41). 
Notably, PolyI:C  itself is a potent inducer of 
type I IFN  secretion by [CONTACT_167301]  (42). Likewise, 
type I IFN signaling is necessary for DC 
activation f ollowing PolyI:C ( 43). In the 
absence of type I IFN signaling, CD8 α+ DC 
priming of T cells and anti -tumor responses  
are markedly  impaired. This was 
demonstrated in experiments using c onditional knockouts of  the IFN receptor (IFN AR1), 
where the absence of IFN- α/β signaling  in CD8 α + DCs  resulted in loss of anti-tumor 
activity and cross- present ation to CD8+ T cells (44). Furthermore, in murine HCT models  
similar  interruption  of IFN signaling unexpectedly increased GVHD , but as expected, 
abrogated anti-tumor immunity.  In contrast , administration of  exogenous type I IFN  
lessened GVHD and enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses (45). Taken together, 
these resu lts suggest that  signaling by  [CONTACT_24975] I IFN  is critical for  CD8α + DC cross -
presentation . Therefore, careful administration of  exogenous type I IFN early after 
allogeneic HCT in patients with AML  not in remission might  enhance GVL  effects  
by [CONTACT_306832]-presentation by [CONTACT_167301] .

August [ADDRESS_375612].  
IFN-α is a type I interferon that  is FDA approved for chronic hepatitis B and C and has 
been used in the treatment of several solid and hematologic malignancies including 
chronic myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasm s and AML ( 46-49). In AML , IFN -
α has been used primary  alone or in combination for  remission induction or maintenance 
after remission.  IFN-α has also been studied  in a limited fashion as  treatment for  post 
HCT relapse  in AML, with several reports  of patients achieving  durable remissions (50). 
To date, experiences in AML after HCT have been exclusively  with unmodified  IFN 
preparations  which possess a very short  biologic  half-life. Because patients with post HCT 
relapse often harbor a  large  burden of  disease , it is postulated that  immune interventions 
that promote  GVT may be best optimized in minimal residual disease states; such as the 
early post  HCT period. To our knowledge, only  two examples of IFN -α prophylaxis  exist 
after HCT , but none specifically  for enhancement of GVL . In one study, leukocyte IFN 
was administered after engraftment to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)  
to prevent CMV reactivation (51). While CMV  rates were similar  between groups , relapse 
in IFN treated patients  was lower . In another study , eleven patients (two with AML) 
received IFN-α at various doses  in the contex t of T cell depleted HCT (52). Importantly, 
and consistent with pre- clinical evidence, neither study reported an increased risk for 
GVHD. Thus, while clinical experience with IFN-α for relapse prevention after HCT is 
limited,  these studies suggest  feasibility . 
3.[ADDRESS_375613] contributed to varied results  (50). IFN-α dose and duration of 
activity  may be  relevant  for optimizing  in vivo  activity (either direct or immunologic) . For 
example, higher serum levels of IFN -α (>3000  IU/ml) may correlate with clinical response 
in AML (53). More recently,  in vivo  models of AML show  prolonged IFN-α exposure 
improved activity  but the underlying mechanisms of these effects are yet to be described  
(54). At approved doses, modern  polyethylene glycol -conjugated ( pegylated) 
formulations now used clinically  provide reliable and evenly  sustained IFN -α exposure at  
serum levels known to exert  anti-leukemic activity  (55). In the clinic, there is  now 
considerable exper
ience with peg -IFN-α formulations  for treatment of advanced  
myeloproliferative neoplasms . In one  report of AML arising from antecedent 
myelofibrosis, p eg-IFN-α (without chemotherapy)  induced a durable remission last ing > 
18 months  (56). These observations suggest a potential benefit in anti -tumor activity with 
use of peg-IFN-α and suggest  modern long -acting formulations may be optimal for 
enhancing GVL after HCT . 
In general, due to their improved efficacy, ease of administration and tolerability at 
approved dosages commercially available peg-IFN-α preparations  (peginterferon alfa- 2a; 
PEGASYS® , Genentech, Inc. and peginterferon alfa- 2a; PEGINTRON® , [COMPANY_006]  & Co, 
Inc.) have largely replaced short acting preparations in the clinic.  In studies of patients 
with viral hepatitis and myeloproliferative neoplasms, a dverse events are  typi[INVESTIGATOR_306783] 2018

(48, 49, 57). Pertinent f or HCT, b one marrow suppressi on did occur but  was uncommon, 
and predominantly affected  neutrophils.  Serious adverse events were reported in 10% of 
chronic hepatitis C  patient s receiv ing long term therapy, but only 3% of patients receiving 
short term administration (24 weeks) . The proposed duration of treatment for the current 
study is [ADDRESS_375614] 
We propose administering commercially available pegylated IFN -α2a or PEGASYS®  
(herein referred to as peg -IFN-α) as a strategy to prevent relapse after HCT. AML not in 
remission  is the population to be studied, which is a frequently  encountered clinical 
problem  associated  with very poor outcomes, primarily due to  high rates of  relapse . While 
HCT is the only known curative therapy, additional strategies that  improve disease control  
in this setting  are urgently  needed. New insights in to the underlying immune biology of 
HCT suggest  sustained  exogenous  administration  of IFN -α will promote cross 
presentation by [CONTACT_167301] , thereby [CONTACT_306833]. We hypothesize that peg-IFN-α will limit 
early relapse after HCT  for AML not in remission . Peg-IFN-α, administered at approved 
dosages over  short durations has been  associated with good safety, tolerability, and  the 
sustained bioavailibility  necessary to best assess  IFN mediated DC cross- presentation 
and prevention of  relapse. 
Thusfar , in this clinical trial IFN-α, has been escalated to and remains at  the maximum  
planed dosage (180mcg) , with ongoing assessments for DLT by [CONTACT_306834] [CONTACT_8345] (section 
16.2) . During an interim  analysis for safety (section 16.3)  at 24 patients,  no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306784], non- relapse mortality or acute GVHD.    
 
3.8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bone marrow with parametric response 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (PRM).  
MRI is sensitive to the fat and water composition of bone marrow using quantitative 
methods such as multi -echo Dixon sequences that separate signals from fat and water 
with relaxation correction. These methods allow computational analyses for percentages and volumes of fat and water within each volume element of an image. Normal 
hematopoietic bone marrow in adults is composed primarily of fat signal as detected by [CONTACT_306835] (water signal). Increases 
in percent fat indicate a l oss of cellularity  and vice versa. We propose that quantitative 
changes in bone marrow fat  can measure spatial and temporal dynamics of bone marrow 
ablation and repopulation after HCT for AML.  
 MRI also provides quantitative measurements of mobility of water  (diffusion) and 
heterogeneity of tissue composition (susceptibility  and cross relaxation transfer 
techniques). Mobility of water in living tissue is affected by [CONTACT_306836], intercellular interactions, cell size, and extracellular matrix. Our group and 
others have shown that quantitative changes in mobility of water in a tissue or tumor 
August [ADDRESS_375615] (58-
60). Susceptibility and cross relaxation transfer methods for MRI, such as susceptibility 
weighted imaging, T2* decay, and chemical exchange saturation transfer, detect 
heterogeneity of anatomic environments . As examples, these MRI methods have been 
used to measure trabecular bone structure and extracellular matrix, which we propose will provide a non- invasive assessment of the bone marrow microenvironment in AML 
and HCT.  
MRI data typi[INVESTIGATOR_306785], such as bone marrow within an entire bone.  While simple to implement, these whole tissue analyses inherently lose information about heterogeneous composition of tissues and non- unifor m responses to treatment.  To capture the spatial localization of disease 
extent and treatment responses, we will use an image analysis technique, parametric response mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (PRM) that precisely maps each imaging volume element (voxel) to the same site over sequential imaging studies (61).  By [CONTACT_3252] -registering identical voxels 
from MRI studies performed before and during therapy, we can determine changes in imaging parameters, such as diffusion and proton density fat fraction (PDFF), with much finer spatial and temporal resolution.  In the context of cancer therapy, this voxel -wise 
image analysis method substantially improves accuracy for identifying response to therapy early in the course of treatment.  We propose that this voxel -wise image analysis 
technique also will improve the ability to use MRI to quantify the extent of bone marrow 
ablation after pre- HCT conditioning, dynamics of bone marrow engraftment and 
repopulation after HCT, and potentially relapse of AML.  
4.0 STUDY POPULATION 
4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
4.1.1 Disease criteria  and status:  
To be eligible for this protocol the patient must have AML not in remission  or at very high 
risk for post HCT relapse . This will generally  be defined as greater than ≥ 5% myeloblasts 
by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_306786] a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_306787] 2 weeks of study registration.  The following scenarios  indicate  exceptions to the 
requirement for ≥ 5% myeloblasts : 
a) In the event induction treatment results in a hypoplastic bone marrow status (< 
10% cellularity), precluding accurate enumeration of blast percentages, the patient 
is still eligible if the preceding bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_306788] ≥ 5% myeloblasts. 
To meet this condition, prior induction therapy must have been completed a minimum of 21 day s prior to this result.  
b) In the event < 5% myeloblasts by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_306789]. This can be defined as 
clear  (probable or definite) flow cytometric persistence of the leukemia associated 
clone defined at time of diagnosis. Alternatively, persistence of cytogenetic abnormalities by [CONTACT_306837].  
August 2018  
15 
 
 c) The patient has evidence at diagnosis of poor cytog enetic  or molecular  risk 
associated with very high risk for relapse after HCT. Adverse cytogenetic risk is 
defined as complex karyotype with ≥ 4 clonal abnormalities , inv(3) / t(3;3) , and 
t(6;9) . Monosomal karyotype is defined as  the presence of two or more aut osomal 
chromosome monosomies or one single autosomal monosomy in the presence of 
one or  more  struct ural chromosomal abnormalities, excluding marker and ring 
chromosomes.  Poor molecular risk is defined as the presence of FLT3- ITD 
mutation.  
4.1.2 Prior Treatment (one of the following scenarios):  To be eligible  the patient must  
have received previous therapy in one of the following scenarios:    
1) Primary refractory:  for newly diagnosed AML, patients must have achieved two 
consecutive induction attempts  without achieving complete remission.  
 
2) Relapsed  / refractory:  for patients initially in complete remission whose AML 
relapses  > [ADDRESS_375616] be 
attempted to be eligible  
 
3) Relapsed /  untreated:  for AML patients  with early  relapse,  in whom the preceding 
remission is shorter than 6 months duration, no re- induction regimen is necessary 
to be eligible . 
 
4) Patients with antecedent MDS  (or CMML)  who progress to AML:  may have 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_306790]. For example, a patient with MDS (RAEB -II) receives hypomethylating agent or other 
induction therapy that progresses to AML.  In such cases regimens administered 
prior to tra nsformation can be counted.  
5)  
6) Patients with poor cytogenetic or molecular risk : associated with very high risk 
for relapse after HCT  (Section 4.1.1 C) may proceed without provisions for prior 
treatment as listed above. However, they must have received at l east one induction 
attempt.  Note: Hypoplastic bone marrow status (section 4.1.1 A) and persistence 
of low level AML (section 4.1.1 B ) do not constitute achieving complete remission.   
 
4.1.3 Donor s and Stem Cell Source :  
1) Availability of an  8/[ADDRESS_375617]  loci. Note: 
Mismatchs at HLA DQ  and/or  HLA DPB1  are permissible.  
2) Availability of a HLA -haploidentical donor  from a first degree relative (parents, children 
or sibling) . In this context, HLA matching at  only one haplotype is acceptable according 
to usual BMT program practice guildelines.    
3) Peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells are acceptable.

 4.1.4 Age:  Patient s must be ≥ [ADDRESS_375618] (see exception of haplo- identical donors  in section 5.4). 
4.1.5 Performance status: Karnofsky ≥ 70% (see APPENDIX A ) 
4.1.6 Organ function: Patients must meet acceptable organ function criteria for 
allogeneic transplant per institutional guidelines.  A summary of these guidelines are 
shown in Table 1 below and may also be found at the following URL:

5.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, non-r andomized, phase I/II study of  commercially available peg-
IFN-α (peginterferon alfa- 2a; PEGASYS®, Genentech, Inc.) for prevention of relapse in 
AML patients not in remission undergoing HCT. The pre transplant chemotherapy will consist of myeloablative conditioning  per investigator. HCT will be administered on day 
0. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate per institutional guidelines.  An overview of the study is shown  below in FIGURE  5.

prior to the initiation of treatment on this protocol. Patient demographics , including 
underlying disease, donor type, and eligibility criteria will be recorded at entry into the 
study. All screening evaluations will be completed as part of the standard work up for HCT. 
5.2 peg- IFN-α: Is the study agent and will be administered prior to HCT  (donor stem cell 
infusion)  and at three  subsequent  time points  post HCT .  (Maximum of  4 doses)  
5.2.1 Timing of dosing:  peg-IFN-α will be administered by [CONTACT_306838] [ADDRESS_375622] day to administer (if delay)

A maximum of four doses will be administered.  If dosing is postponed for any 
reason  on its scheduled day of administration, it can be given for up to 7 days. 
Subsequent doses should be administered as per the above schedule . There 
should always be a  minimum of 7 days between doses. No doses will be 
administered beyond day + 49.

 5.2.2 Determination of dose level:  The first patient will be assigned to  dose level 
1 (90 mcg) and subsequent dose assignment s for future patient s will be 
determined using the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) , based on the 
occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Briefly, if minimal toxicity  is 
encountered, dose level 2 will be employed (180mcg), which is the FDA approved 
starting dose of peg -IFN-α. If excessive toxicity, we will de- escalate dose level -1 
(45mcg).  If excessive toxicity occurs at dose level -1, the study  will be halted to 
determine if the trial should be amended or closed. The  study is also subject to 
termination according to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306791] [ADDRESS_375623] of patient safety. Note, s pecifics of this design and dose assignment are 
described in the statistical section of this protoc ol (section 16).  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_375624] according to the current institutional BMT program 
clinical practice guidelines. The specific agents used for  myeloablative conditioning  will 
not be mandated, and  will be  determined by [CONTACT_102] ’s primary physician and BMT 
team  at weekly clinical consensus meetings . Reduced intensity conditioning regimens 
are prohibited with the exceptio n of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306792]- identical donor HCT. In 
haplo- identical  contexts , conditioning intensity  and regimen will be  selected  the 
patient’s investigator .   5.[ADDRESS_375625] Disease (GVHD) Prophylaxis  
Eligible patients will receive a standard GVHD prevention regimen according to the current institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines. This  will include a 
calcineurin- inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) based regimen. Calcineurin- inhibitor will 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_306793]- dose methotrexate (MTX). Combination with 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an alternative option. The preferred calcineurin- inhibitor 
is tacrolimus, but cyclosporine can be substituted if patients cannot tolerate tacrolimus. In patients who are unable to tolerate tacrolimus or cyclosporine, sirolimus may be substituted.  
 
August 2018  
20 
 
 5.6.1 Tacrolimus  
Tacrolimus begins on day -3 and is dosed IV or orally according to BMT program 
clinical p ractice g uidelines, with a desired trough level of 5- 15 ng/ml.  When 
cyclosporine is substituted for tacrolimus a desired trough level is 200- 300 ng/ml. 
It is suggested that tacrolimus be tapered below therapeutic range starting around 
day [ADDRESS_375626]-transplant,  per current  institutional practice,  provided the patient has 
no evidence of GVHD. The recommended taper is approximately 20% of the daily 
tacrolimus dose at the time of initiating taper. In the absence of GVHD, tapers are suggested every 14 - 28 days with goal of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306794] + 180.  
5.6.2 Methotrexate  
If methotrexate is administered as part of GVHD prophylaxis it will be given as an intravenous infusion at 5- 15 mg/m
2 on day +1,  and 5- 10mg/m2 +3, + 6, and + [ADDRESS_375627] criteria for administration will be followed as outlined in the institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines.  
5.6.3 Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF or CellCept)  
If mycophenolate is administered as part of GVHD prophylaxis it will be given as [ADDRESS_375628] . 
Mycophenolate can also be given intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg/dose maximum 1 gram/dose), administered every 8 hours if the patient is unable to tolerate oral medications. The conversion is 100% of the oral dose.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_375629]- transplant supportive care, including infection prophylaxis will generally be 
conducted as per the BMT program Clinical Practice Guidelines.  
Micafungin 50 mg IV  once daily is recommended for fungal prophylaxis  from admission  
until day +[ADDRESS_375630] transplant to minimize potential interaction with hepatic function, 
especially if using clofarabine x busulfan based conditioning (ie. CloBu4).  Anti-fungal 
coverage with mold activity (Voriconazole or Pozaconazole) are recommended starting  
at day + 5.  
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF, Neupogen) will be administered post -
transplant per institutional Clinical Practice Guidelines.  
 
6.0 MANAGING ACUTE GVHD 
6.1 Assessment and treatment:  The absence or presence of clinical Acute GVHD 
(aGVHD) , including severity,  should be clinically evaluated  within [ADDRESS_375631] 2018  
21 
 
 BMT program clinical practice guidelines, which including clinical grading once weekly.  
aGVHD severity will be determined clinically (see APPENDIX B ). Biopsies  of affected 
organs are strongly encouraged whenever possible.  
6.2 Dose modification  of peg- IFN-α: Although pre-clinical and clinical data suggest peg -
IFN-α will not  significantly  increase aGVHD, this remains a potential risk of enhancing 
post HCT immune responses. Thus , the parameters  in Table 3 are designed to enable 
patient s with very high risk  for relapse to remain on study therapy , but without  excessive 
exposure to risk.  
 TABLE 3: DOSE MODIFICATION ACCORDING TO  ACUTE GVHD  
GVHD Grade  Dose Modification of peg-IFN-α 
Grade I  continue  without modification  
Grade II  Hold further doses (1)  
Grade III – IV  Stop further doses (2)  
 
(1) Grade II a GVHD : peg- IFN-α should be  temporally  held pending  observation 
of clinical response . If the patient is responding  well to GVHD directed therapy , 
has been tapered to a corticosteroid dose of ≤ 0.5 mg/kg, and remains within 
the study treatment period (e.g. < [ADDRESS_375632]), peg -IFN-α can be 
resumed at discretion of primary BMT physician. For example, a patient 
develops grade II aGVHD of the skin with 60% body surface area (BSA) 
involvement, and after two weeks of tr eatmen t has < 25% BSA involvement. 
Co-enrollment on acute GVHD treatment trials is permitted . 
 
(2) G rade III -IV aGVHD: no further doses of peg- IFN-α will be administered , 
The patient will be removed from further study  treatment . In cases of grade III -
IV or steroid refractory GVHD, in addition to treatment with standard of care, co-enrollment on acute GVHD treatment trials is permitted.  
 
7.0 ASSESSMENT AND MANAGING  AML RELAPSE 
7.1 Scheduled disease assessments : are per  standard BMT clinical practice guidelines  
for AML not in remission. Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_306795]-transplant  
(within 14 days of study registration) and post -transplant on  day 28 (±7), day 100 (± 14),  
and day 180 (± 28 ). Additional  assessments of relapse can be performed at any time 
there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_306796] . 
7.2 Definition s: 
7.2.1 Remission:  
For the purposes of this study, we define remission as  achieving  a morphologic 
leukemia free state by [CONTACT_306839]: bone marrow 
August 2018  
22 
 
 myeloblasts < 5% by [CONTACT_306840]; AND  absence of  circulating  blasts  
with phenotypic or morphologic features of leukemia (e.g. A uer rods) AND  no 
evidence of extramedulary disease ( 62). Note, since these assessments are 
occurring in the early post HCT period where numerous factors can affect  blood 
counts, full hematologic recovery is not  a required component  for remission . 
7.2.2 Relapse or Progressio n: 
We define relapse by [CONTACT_306841]: Bone marrow myeloblasts  
≥ 5% by [CONTACT_306842] (e.g., bone 
marrow regeneration, G -CSF adminis tration within previous 7 days)  OR 
reappearance or persistence  of circulating  blasts  with phenotypic or morphologic 
features of leukemia  OR the development or persistence of  extramedullary 
leukemia.  Note, due to the large leukemic burden of patients  at time of HCT , 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_306797] (MRD) by [CONTACT_306843], 
flow cytometric abberency , or molecular methods will not be counted as a relapse 
event, but will be recorded. The presence of these features  will be later correlated 
with occurrence of hematologic relapse. 
7.3 D osing of peg- IFN-α after relapse : 
Patients with documented relapse or disease persistence as defined in section 7.2.2  may 
continue to receive peg-IFN-α at the discretion of their primary BMT attending . Rapid 
tapering and / or withdrawal  of immunosuppression to illicit aGVHD is a standard practice 
in the setting of relapse  and is allowed.  However,  if additional  leukemia directed  treatment 
is initiated  (e.g. re -induction chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion, or clinical trial) 
the patient will be removed from  this study.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_375633] – engraftment  doses of 
peg-IFN-α (i.e. doses administered on or after day + 28)  
If platelet < 20,000 will hold dose, may resume once platelet >20,000 without transfusion 
in the preceding 72 hrs.   
If ANC < 0.5 ul / mm2 will hold dose, may resume when ANC > 0.5 ul / mm2. Use of G -
CSF is allowed.  
8.2 Renal function  
If GFR is less than 30 mL/min and patient is assigned to dose level 2 ( 180 mcg), the 
patient should have their dose reduced to [ADDRESS_375634] is  greater than 10 
times above the upper limit of normal  OR total bilirubin ≥ 8 mg/dl,  treatment will  be 
temporarily suspended. If ALT or AST fall to  < [ADDRESS_375635]  and total bilirubin < 8 mg/dl , 
peg-IFN-α can be resumed.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_375636] be ruled out, particularly in 
patients with neutropenia.  There are no specific dose modifications for fever.   
9.0 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS  (STUDY CALANDER) : 
In general pre and post HCT care will follow BMT program  clinical practice guidelines . 
For example, routine history, physical, organ function testing (PFT, Echocardogram) , and 
laboratory evaluations (including serologic and/or PCR based viral studies ) will follow  
institutional practice guidelines. The following studies will b e obtained pre- therapy and 
post-therapy  (TABLE 4) . These studies will be collected as required observ ations for

[ADDRESS_375639] be within two weeks of study registration.  
NOTE: r equired observations: Patient ’s medical condition and scheduling issues may 
impact the timing  and acquisition of post-HCT observations. The acceptable time frame 
for completing these observations is ± 10 days for observations  prior to day 56 and ± 14 
days for observations including and after day + 56. Failure to obtain research blood 
collections  or MRI  in accordance with the above schedule will not be considered a 
protocol deviation.  The day -[ADDRESS_375640] occur before infusion of donor cells 
on day 0 or will be omitted.   
 
10.0 RESEARCH SAMPLES 
10.1 Research blood samples  
We will obtain perip heral blood samples in 5 heparinized tubes (green top), [ADDRESS_375641]® (“Streck”) tubes, and 1 EDTA tube  (purple top)  (approximately 50 mL 
total) from each patient at [ADDRESS_375642] 
bone marrow examinations. Finally, one hepariniz ed blood sample (approximately 2-3ml 
mL) will be taken from the donor stem cell grafts prior to patient administration.  Note: 
Donors must sign and additional separate consent for this donor stem cell research 
specimens to be collected.  Subjects participation in the collection of research samples is 
optional.  
Samples will be obtained at baseline (day -7) prior to conditioning, study drug, and stem 
cell infusion and then on day 28 (after 2 doses of peg -IFN-α), day + 56 (after 4 doses 
peg-IFN-α), day + 100 and day +180. PBMCs and serum will be isolated and frozen for 
future analysis. All blood samples will be processed, frozen, and banked in the 
Immunology Core Lab at the University of Michigan with the exception of the Streck tube 
and EDTA tube, which will be processed, frozen, and banked in the laborator y of [CONTACT_306863] , respectively.  All urine samples will be processed, frozen, and stored in the 
laboratory of [CONTACT_306864].  
10.1.[ADDRESS_375643] demonstrated that nucleic acid and other analytes in urine may 
serve as markers for systemic (i.e. non- urinary tract) disease status. This includes 
microRNA, cell- free (cf) trans -renal DNA fragments, potentially other diverse species of 
RNA, and other biomarker types. In this study, we plan to study blood and urine cfDNA and microRNA as potential biomarkers for GVHD in AML patients undergoing HCT, and 
to compare the concordance of biomarkers between blood and urine.  
August [ADDRESS_375644] instructions. (Please see Appendix A below for Subject Instructions for urine collection.) Ideally within 30 minutes  of urination, the urine will be transferred to a 
collection container with EDTA solution. Samples will be collected coincident with 
routine blood draws or other routine patient care.  
 
10.2 Correlative  studies  
The primary aim of the correlative studies is  to assess DC mediated  cross presentation  
by [CONTACT_306844] . Generation of  T cells directed 
towards  tumor  associated antigens ( TAA)  commonly over expressed by [CONTACT_306845] , such as  WT1, Pr3, NE, MAGE- A3, PRAME, will be measured by [CONTACT_306846] I  tetramer staining . T cells  specific for TAA will be 
measured  before HCT (donor cell graft) and serially after HCT following  exposure to AML 
antigens. Tetramer staining will be restricted to HLA-A*[ADDRESS_375645]. Pavan Reddy (Univ. of Michigan)  but in 
collaboration with [CONTACT_306865] (National Institute of Heath) and  / or [CONTACT_306866] (MD Anderson Cancer Center)  who have extensive expertise in these methods.  
Any human samples sent for such analysis  by [CONTACT_306847]. All other  experiments will be performed  
solely  at the University of  Michigan  in the laboratory of Pavan Reddy . These experiments 
will include phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_306798]3 A+ DCs , functional assays, pharmacodynamic assessment of IFNα signaling, 
and cytokine profiles.  
Furthermore, the secondary aim of the correlative studies is to determine the dynamics 
of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) during and after treatment and to 
characterize genomic and transcriptomic features of non- remission AML and any 
subsequent relapses after the experimental treatment.  MRD will be measured in bone marrow and peripheral blood cell -based genomic  DNA as well as plasma -based cell -free 
DNA using a combination of droplet digital PCR and third- generation DNA sequencing to 
detect mutations previously identified in the pretreatment specimen.  Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of pre- treatment and pos t-relapse specimens will include whole 
exome sequencing, total mRNA sequencing, and determination of DNA copy number/LO H with genome- wide SNP arrays. These experiments will be performed at the 
University of Michigan in the laboratory of Drs. Sami Malek and  [CONTACT_129336].  
Pharmacodynamic (PD)  targets  of peg -IFN-α signaling  will be assessed including , but not 
limited to , components of  JAK,  Tyk2, and STAT  pathway s. Serum measurements of 
inflammatory cytokines  will be analyzed. Finally, the laboratory will perform in vitro  assays 
to evaluate DC, tumor and viral specific  T cell responses  (proliferation, Elispot for cytokine 
production) . 
August [ADDRESS_375646] to participate in the correlative MRI studies are: 1) no contraindications to MRI, such as a pacemaker; and 2) able to undergo MRI without general anesthesia and 3) medical condition sufficiently stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_306799] . This is particularly relevant to plan imaging on Day -1  
MRI examinations of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], pelvis, and proximal femora will be performed with a 6-channel torso coil, body coil, or dedicated surface coil as determined by [CONTACT_306848]. Survey scans will be performed for patient positioning and defining anatomic sites for subsequent  scans. We will perform MRI sequences for quantitative fat and water imaging, 
cross relaxation transfer, T2* decay, susceptibility, and mobility of water. Specific sequence parameters will be adjusted within FDA -approved safety parameters for 
individual patients. No intravenous contrast material will be used. Anticipated duration of each MRI study is approximately [ADDRESS_375647] a research sample drawn at any time point 
will not be considered a protocol violation.  
11.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
11.1 Peginterferon alfa -2a (peg- IFN-α, PEGASYS®)  
11.1.1 Formulation 
The chemical structure for peg-IFN-α is made by [CONTACT_29499] a single branched 
polyethylene glycol chain (PEG) of approximate molecular weight of 40 kilodaltons (kD) 
to interferon alfa- 2a (20 kD) via a stable amide bond. The combination of PEG and 
interferon alfa- 2a forms an intact active molecule known as peginterferon alfa- 2a, having 
an approximate molecular weight of 60 kD. Chemically, it is a bis -(N-
monomethoxypolyethylene- glycol -urethanyl) lysyl interferon alfa- 2a. 
 
11.1.2 Availability  
Peg-IFN-α is a sterile ready -to-use solution for subcutaneous injection. It is available as 
autoinjectors in two strengths, 135 mcg/0.5 mL and 180 mcg/0.5 mL, as prefilled syringes 
containing 180 mcg/0.5 mL, or as single- use vials containing 180 mcg/1.[ADDRESS_375648] 2018  
27 
 
 peg-IFN-α is expressed as the amount of interferon alfa- 2a, with excipi[INVESTIGATOR_306800], benzyl alcohol, sodium acetate, acetic acid, polysorbate 80 and water for 
injections.  
 
11.1.3 Storage and stability  
The samples will be stored per the manufacturer’s recommendation.  
 11.1.4 Pharmacokinetics  
Time to Peak Concentration:  The absorption of peg-IFN-α is sustained with peak serum 
concentrations reached 72 – 96 h after dosing. Serum concentrations are measurable 
within 3 – 6 h of a single subcutaneous injection of peg-IFN-α 180 mcg. Within 24 h, about 
80% of the peak serum concentration is reached. The absolute bioavailability of peg-IFN-
α is 84% and is similar to that seen with interferon alfa- 2a 
Peak Concentration:  The peak concentrations (Cmax) after single administration of 180 
mcg dose of peginterferon alfa- 2a, was 14 ± 5 ng/ml.  
 Elimination half-life: A mean elimination half -life of 160 h (84 – 353 h) at primary 
elimination phase was observed in patients after subcutaneous (SC) administration of 
peg-IFN-α. The elimination half -life determined after SC administration may not only 
reflect the elimination phase of the compound, but may also reflect the sustained absorption of peg-IFN-α. 
Distribution:  Peg-IFN-α is found predominately in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid 
as seen by [CONTACT_306849] -state (Vss) of 6 – 14 L after intravenous 
(IV) dosing in humans. Based on studies in rats, peg-IFN-α is distributed to the liver, 
kidney, and bone marrow in addition to being highly concentrated in the blood.  
Area Under the Curve:  The mean area under the curve (AUC), after single 
administration of 180 mcg dose of peg-IFN-α, was 92 hrs ± 27. 
 Metabolism:  The metabolic profile of peg-IFN-α is not fully characterized.

 Use in hepatitis C and B:  The principal adverse reactions listed below are primar ily from 
clinical studies  in patients who received peg-IFN-α at 180m cg once weekly for 24 - 48 
weeks for treatment of  chronic hepatitis  B or C with or without evidence of compensated 
cirrhosis. ( adapted per PEGYSUS package insert, 2013 Genentech, Inc. ) 
In general, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 40%) are 
fatigue/asthenia, pyrexia, myalgia, and headache. The most common life- threatening or 
fatal events induced or aggravated by [CONTACT_306850], suicide, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, and bacterial infections, each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Hepatic decompensation occurred in 2% (10/574) of CHC/HIV subjects . 
The most common serious adverse reactions (3% in CHC and 5% in CHC/HIV) was bacterial infection (e.g., sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia). 
Other SAEs occurred at a frequency of less than 1% and included: suicide, suicidal 
ideation, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic 
dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, 
coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic 
disorder, and hallucination.  
 
In clinical trials, [ADDRESS_375650] commonly reported adverse reactions were psychiatric reacti ons, including d epression  (18%) , insomnia  (19%) , irritability  (19%),  and flu- like 
symptoms such as fatigue (56%) , pyrexia (37%) , myalgia  (37%) , headache (54%) , and 
rigors  (35%) . Other common reactions were anorexia (17%) , nausea and vomiting  (24%) , 
diarrhea (16%) , arthralgia (28%), injection site reactions  (22%) , alopecia (23%) , and 
pruritus  (12%) . 
 Chronic hepatitis C monoinfected subjects treated for 24 weeks with PEGASYS and 800 
mg COPEGUS  (PEGASYS + Ribaviron)  were observed to have lower incidence of 
serious adverse reactions (3% vs. 10%), Hgb less than 10 g/dL (3% vs. 15%), dose 
modification of PEGASYS (30% vs. 36%) and of withdrawal from treatment (5% vs. 15%) 
compared to subjects treated for [ADDRESS_375651] common reasons for dose modification of PEGASYS in C HC and CHC/HIV subjects was for neutropenia (20%) and 
thrombocytopenia (4% ). 
 The following serious conditions, some of which may become life threatening, have been reported have been observed in patients treated with PEGASYS. Hypertension, 
supraventricular arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial infarction. Development or 
exacerbation of autoimmune disorders including myositis, hepatitis, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial nephritis, thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have been 
reported in patients receiving al pha interferon. PEGASYS causes or aggravates 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes 
August [ADDRESS_375652] been observed to develop in patients treated with PEGASYS. Acute 
hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and 
anaphylaxis) have been observed during alpha interferon . Pancreatitis, sometimes fatal, 
has occurred during alpha i nterferon. Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, 
bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension and sarcoidosis, 
some resulting in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1444]/or patient deaths, may  be induced or aggravated 
by [CONTACT_306851]:  A phase II study of  weekly  PEGASYS in 79 
patients was conducted in patients with advanced essential thrombosis or polycythemia vera exploring dosages ranging from  45mcg to 450mcg ( 48). Patients received therapy 
indefinitely as long as  they deriving clinical benefit. At a median follow up was  22 mo nths 
79% of patients  remained on thera py. Ninety -six percent of patients developed some 
toxicity, generally grade [ADDRESS_375653] frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicity was  neutropenia, 
which occurred in 20%, others  included elevated LFTs (6%), fatigue (4%), pain (3%), 
depression (3%) . The toxicity profile of peg-IFN-α was significantly more benign in the 28 
patients who started at 90mcg weekly.  The 90mcg weekly  schedule resulted in no gr ade 
4 toxicities and a low rate of grade 3 toxicities, including neutropenia in two patients (7%) and infection, diarrhea, depression, and elevated liver function  tests in one patient (4%) 
each.  
Use of IFN after HCT  in AML . Data in the post HCT setting i s limited to multiple case 
series and reports of  short acting IFN preparations  for treatment of post – HCT relapse  
(63-67). IFN has been administered in combination with complete cessation of 
immunosuppression together with either chemotherapy, DLI, or  additional cytokines 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (e.g. IL -2) to illicit GVHD. All reports suggest  that the  use of IFN was  feasible 
and tolerable, but assessment of adverse events are limited by [CONTACT_306852]. Under these conditions aGVHD occurred in approximately 60% of 
patients. The use of IFN  was not  associated with more severe aGVHD or death.  While 
the presence of  GVHD may be  assoc iated with increased likelihood of achieving  durable 
remission . In a  small  randomized study  of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) , human 
leukocyte IFN was administered prophylactically  after HCT  to prevent CMV reactiv ation. 
Compared to control patients CMV  rates were similar , but relapse was lower  in the IFN 
treated  patients and  there was no difference in the probability or  severity of aGVHD  (51). 
 
11.2 Methotrexate  
11.2.1 Formulation 
Chemically methotrexate is N - [4 - [[(2, 4 – diamino – 6 – pteridinyl) methyl] 
methylaminolbenzoyl] – L - glutamic acid. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the 
treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and 
prevention of acute GVHD. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by [CONTACT_306853]- carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and 
August 2018  
30 
 
 thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular 
replication.  
11.2.2 Availability and administration  
Methotrexate sodium for injection is available in 25mg/ml solution. The appropriate amount is drawn into a syringe for administration.   Store at controlled room temperature, 
20°-25° C (68° -77° F); excursions permitted to 15° -30° C (59° -86° F). Protect from light.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_375654] frequently reported adverse reactions associated with methotrexate use as 
GVHD prophylaxis include ulcerative stomatitis, leucopenia and suppressed hematopoiesis, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse effects are malaise, undue fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness and decreased resistance to infection. Methotrexate may be associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications after transplantation. The risk of infections is due to the suppression of hematopoiesis after transplantation.  
11.2.4 Potential Drug Interactions  
Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be increased because of displacement by [CONTACT_115143], such as salicylates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is also diminished by [CONTACT_115144]; use of methotrexate with this drug should be carefully monitored. Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable broad- spectrum antibiotics, may 
decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by [CONTACT_115145]. Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with high and low dose methotrexate. Use of methotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.  
 
 
11.3 Mycophenol ate (CellCept)  
11.3.1 Formulation and mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2- morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA), 
animmunosuppressive agent; inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor. 
Mycophenolate mofetil is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_306801], which is the active metabolite. MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without 
August 2018  
31 
 
 incorporation into DNA. Because T - and Blymphocytes are critically dependent for their 
proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage 
pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T - and B -lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. 
Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody  formation by B -lymphocytes. MPA prevents 
the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin- 1 and interleukin- 2, but did block the coupling of these events to DNA 
synthesis and proliferation.  
11.3.2 Availability  
CellCept is available for intravenous or oral administration as capsules containing 250 mg of mycophenolate mofetil, tablets containing 500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil, and as a powder for oral suspension, which when constituted contains 200 mg/mL mycophenolate mofetil. CellCept Intravenous is the hydrochloride salt of mycophenolate mofetil. CellCept 
Intravenous is available as a sterile white to off -white lyophilized powder in vials 
containing mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride for adminis tration by [CONTACT_306854]. Each vial of CellCept Intravenous contains the equivalent of [ADDRESS_375655] the pH. Reconstitution and dilution with 5% dextrose injection USP yields a slightly yellow solution of mycophenolate mofetil, 6mg/mL.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_375656] 250 mg. The oral solution (200 mg/ml) may be substituted for capsules or tablets at patient preference or physician discretion, in which case, the dose should be rounded to the nearest 100 mg (0.5 ml).  
 
11.3.4 Adverse events 
The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include 
diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and a higher frequency of infections, including opportunistic infection. The adverse event profile is similar regardless of the form 
administered.  
11.4 Tacrolimus (Prograf, FK506)  
11.4.[ADDRESS_375657] may prevent the generation of nuclear factor of activated T -cells (NF -AT), a nuclear component thought to 
initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines (interleukin- 2, gamma 
interferon). The net result is the inhibi tion of T -lymphocyte activation (i.e., 
immunosuppression).  
11.4.2 Availability and administration  
Prograf is available for oral administration as capsules (tacrolimus capsules) containing the equivalent of 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 5 mg of anhydrous tacrolimus. Inactive ingredients include lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The 1- mg capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide, and the 0.5 mg 
and 5- mg capsules shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and ferric oxide. Prograf is also 
available as a sterile solution (tacrolimus injection) containing the equivalent of 5 mg anhydrous tacrolimus in 1 mL for administration by [CONTACT_306855]. Each mL contains polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil (HCO -60), 200 mg, and dehydrated alcohol, 
USP, 80.0% v/v. Prograf injection must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection before use. Intravenous administration will be given by [CONTACT_3365]. Oral preparation will be administered on empty stomach every 12 hours.  
11.4.3 Potential Side Effects  
a. Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression.  
b. Nephrotoxicity has been noted in 40% and 33% of liver transplantation patients 
receiving Prograf in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. A lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) related to Epstein - 
Barr virus (EBV) infection has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The risk of LPD appears greatest in young children who are at risk for primary EBV infection while immunosuppressed or who are switched to Prograf following long -
term immunosuppression therapy.  
c. Mild to severe hyperkalemia has been noted in 44% and 10% of liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306802] U.S. and European randomized trials and may require treatment.  
d. Neurotoxicity, including tremor, headache, and other changes in motor function, mental status, and sensory function were reported in approximately 55% of liver transplant 
August [ADDRESS_375658] of Prograf therapy. Mild or moderate 
hypertension is more frequently reported than severe hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy may be required; the control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents. Since tacrolimus can cause hyperkalemia, potassium -sparing diuretics should be avoided. While calcium -channel blocking agents 
can be effective in treating Prograf -associated hypertension, care should be taken since 
interference with tacrolimus metabolism may require a dosage reduction.  
f. Hyperglycemia was associated with the use of Prograf in 47% and 29% of liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_306803] U.S. and European randomized studies, respectively and may require treatment.  
11.[ADDRESS_375659] 
is very minimal.   
12.0 STUDY DEFINITIONS  
12.1 Definition of “screening”:  A patient is considered to be in the screening period 
from the time they signed consent until the date their eligibility criteria have been 
determined as either  “eligible” or “ineligible (screen fail).  
12.2 Definition of “Enrolled”:  A patient is considered to be enrolled onto the study once 
they have signed consent and have successfully met all screening criteria, as documented by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion document., and the eligibility criteria has been reviewed and accepted by [CONTACT_28261] P.I. or a Co- I. Th e date of enrollment will be 
documented as the date the P.I. or Co- I. has reviewed and approved eligibility.  
12.3 Treatment Period:  The study treatment period is defined as the first day of treatment 
with peg-IFN-α through the last day of treatment with peg-IFN-α. This period is expected 
to last from day -1 through day 56 ( or two weeks after last dosage of peg-IFN-α, whichever 
occurs later ). Thus, this period may be extended, due to a postponement of the patient’s 
BMT procedure  or peg-IFN-α dosing , without constituting a deviation.  Patients who 
develop stage III -IV acute GVHD will be considered “off treatment”  (see Section 6.2).  
12.4 Follow Up Period:  A patient is considered to be in the “follow up period” from the 
14 day s after  they no longer receive peg-IFN-α therapy  (~ day 56)  through day +[ADDRESS_375660] 2018  
34 
 
 transplant  (primary endpoint) . After day 180 there are no additional study required 
protocol observations  (sec. 9.0), and subjects will be  only be monitored for routine clinical 
endpoints of GVHD,  relaps e, and survival for at least one  year or  until the study is 
terminated.  More detailed o utcome information after day 180  may be  collected from 
clinical databases on other BMT research studies  (HUM00043287, HUM00048885 , if the 
subject has  consented  to these ancillary studies, and may be analyzed in relation to 
patients participating in this study  (e.g for determination of long -term outcomes) .  
12.5 On Study:  Patients are considered “On Study” from the time they are enrolled until 
they meet  one of the “Off Study” criteria listed below.  
12.6 Off Study:  Patients are considered “Off study” if they  meet one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up 
• Entry onto a competing trial (e.g. AML therapeutic trial) 
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_306856]  
• Relapse of underlying malignancy and receiving AML directed therapy other than peg-IFN-α-2a 
• D evelopment of new malignancy  
• Unacceptable or dose limiting toxicity or complication  
Patients  off study (who do not withdrawal consent) will still be followed for  routine HCT  
clinical endpoints  (e.g. GVHD, Relapse)  and survival.  Patients  who develop AML relapse 
or GVHD may have collection of planned research samples.  Patients  have the ri ght to 
withdraw from the study  or refuse research samples  at any time for any reason. The 
investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study in the event of illness, adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violation, or other reasons. Should a patient decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. A complete final evaluation should be made at the time of the patient’s withdrawal with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing and every effort should be made to perform follow -up evaluations. The assessment and reporting period 
for all adverse events, reportable under this protocol, will occur from the first day the treatment with peg-IFN-α is administered until day +[ADDRESS_375661] .  
12.7 Definition of an “evaluable” patient:  Patients removed from study who receive 
peg-IFN-α for at least one dose will be considered fully evaluable for toxicity. The number 
of patients removed from study prior to being fully evaluable will be monitored regularly by [CONTACT_1758]’s DSMB in order to identify and address problems that may develop with respect to patient acc rual. We estimate that < 5 subjects may need to be replaced.  
 
12.8 Definition of engraftment and delayed engraftment:  
August 2018  
35 
 
 12.8.1 Engraftment:  Engraftment for neutrophils is defined as the first of three 
consecutive days in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is > 500/uL. 
Engraftment for platelets is defined as the first of three consecutive days in which the platelet count is > 20,000/uL,  without transfusion support.  
12.8.2 E ngraftment  failure : will be defined as ongoing ANC <500/uL. Patients 
who engraft prior to day [ADDRESS_375662] delayed engraftment.  
 13.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING CRITERIA  
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an investigational study or protocol regardless of causality assessment. An adverse event 
can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product. As such, the AEs will be followed and reported after the study subjects have been started 
on the investigational drug.  
 
These events may be:  
• Definitely related: clearly associated with study drug/treatment  
• Probably related : likely associated with study drug/treatment  
• Possibly related: may be associated with study drug or other treatment  
• Unlikely to be related, or  
• Definitely not related to the study drug/treatment  
 
For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as definitely or probably related to the 
regimen if the investigator believes that at least one of following criteria are met:  
• There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and the administration of the study drug or treatment.  
• There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study drug or treatment causing or contributing to the AE.  
• The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.  
• A potential alternative cause does not exist.  
 Serious Adverse Drug Experience: Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose 
that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• a life -threatening adverse drug experience,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• a persistent  or significant disability/incapacity,  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
August [ADDRESS_375663] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Expected Event : - An event that is expected in that it has been addressed or described 
in one or more of the following: Informed consent document(s) for this study, IRB 
application for this study, grant application or study agreement, protocol or procedures for this study, investigators' brochure or equivalent (for FDA regulated drugs or devices), DSMB/DSC Reports, published literature, other documentation, or characteristics of the study population.  
 Unexpected adverse events are those that:  
• those that do not fall in to the above criteria  
• are not  described in the  package insert  as far as peg-IFN-α is concerned.  
• are not anticipated in the study informed consent or the BMT Program clinical transplant  consent. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or 
severity is not consistent with 
• the description in the informed cons ent. 
 The severity or grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following definitions:  
 Mild:  Noticeable to the subject, but does not interfere with the subject’s expected daily 
activities, usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study. In the transplant setting CTC AE v. 4.0  grades 1 and 2.  
 Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some 
additional therapy or intervention but does not require discontinuation of the study. In the transpl ant setting using the CTCAE v. [ADDRESS_375664] grade 3.  
 Severe:  Extremely limits the subject’s daily activities and may require discontinuation of 
study therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention to resolve. In the transplant 
setting using the CTCAE v . 4.[ADDRESS_375665] safety. In order to achieve this goal, the DSM plan for 
this study will focus on rapid and specific identification of SAEs  as follows : 
 
a. Adverse events with severity grades 1, 2, 3, and all expected grade 4 toxicities will 
not be reported to the IRB, so long as they are expec ted for patients undergoing 
stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies.  
b. Grade 4 events which are serious and likely (probably or definitely)  related to the 
investigational component of study therapy will be reported to the IRB.  
c. Events occurring at unusual frequency or severity in study  subjects compared to 
non-study subjects  undergoing similar transplants will be reported to the IRB.  
d. Events resulting in death (other than relapse or  GVHD) regardless of attribution.  
 Therefore, we will not report as SAEs events that are expected and coincident with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_306804].  
 Event grading:  The NCI Common  Terminology Criteria (Version 4.0) will be used to 
grade intensity of adverse events and assist in reporting adverse events.  
 Events not reported:  
The large majority of patients undergoing unrelated stem cell transplant will frequently experience hematologic events (i.e. anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia), infections, electrolyte abnormalities, and organ toxicities. Given the frequency with which these occur in transplant patients, we will not report events that coincide with events that typi[INVESTIGATOR_306805]- and post transplant related therapy 
regardless of severity unless they otherwise meet the criteria for reporting as detailed above and below. An event is regarded as typi[INVESTIGATOR_306806] / or it occurs in more than 5% of transplant patients.  
 Events reported as adverse events in tabular format annually:  
Events that are classified as severe (all CTCAE  v.4 grade 4) will be reported to the Cancer 
Center DSMB with each routine report (quarterly) and in the annual IRB report so long as the events do not meet the criteria for expedited reporting as defined above. E vents 
determined to be a CTCAEv4.0 grade 1 or 2 will not be captured as part of this protocol.  
   14.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP)  
 The following are the procedures for data and safety monitoring of this clinical trial to be conducted within the Blood and Marrow Transplant program. This is to insure the safety of participants, the validity of research data, and the appropriate termination of studies for 
August [ADDRESS_375666] data or subjects’ research samples have completed training in the protection of human research participants per guidelines issued by [CONTACT_941] U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections. The documentation of completion of the certification is maintained in the UMCCC Clinical Trials Office or the Blood and Marrow Transplantation Office. The investigator  and designated associates have attended an IRB 
sponsored HIPAA research presentation in accordance with the policy of the study site. Each participant in this research trial will be listed by [CONTACT_166232], without initials or date of birth; however, the date of transplant may be included when corresponding with the IRB or outside agencies.  
 Designation of Responsibilities: The Principal investigator(s)  are solely responsible for 
the implementation and conduct of this trial. The principal inves tigator has however, 
designated associates to assist with the protocol implementation which includes but is not 
limited to the following:  
 1. BMT Physicians – have been designated to assist with participant education, informed 
consent process, study implementation and compliance, recording of primary source 
documentation, AE assessment and reporting, adherence to all regulations.  
2. BMT Research Nurse(s) - have been designated to assist with participant education, 
informed consent process, study implementation and compliance, recording of primary 
source documentation and adherence to all regulations.  
3. BMT Data Manager(s) - have been designated to assist with patient 
enrollment/eligibility, verification of protocol compliance, all data collection and recording  
from primary source, AE reporting, DSM reports and adherence to all regulations.  
4. BMT Clinical Team - The members of the BMT clinical team that have been designated 
to assist the investigator in any aspect of this protocol will be listed on the protocol  specific 
designation log.  
5. The BMT internal Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DS MC) will meet monthly  to 
review the data, safety and monitoring reports and all SAEs that have been filed. The report will be submitted to the UMCCC DSMB and to the UM I RB at least  monthly . 
Whenever an unanticipated data, safety and monitoring board meeting takes place or when a new development occurs the IRB will be notified of the occurrence.  
  14.2 Storage and Dissemination of Reports  
 The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) is responsible for collating all  the Data and safety 
Monitoring Reports and providing the information to Data Safety Monitoring Board. The 
CTO will coordinate the reporting process between the Investigator and the IRBMED and 
August 2018

  14.[ADDRESS_375667] once every  12 months, or once 
during the course of the study if the study duration is less than 12 months. The purpose 
is to verify:  
 a. Adherence to the protocol  
b. Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected  
c. Proper storage, dispensing, and inventory of study medication  
d. Compliance with regulations  
 Monitoring may be in the form of a site visit or a review of the documents at the CTO. 
During a monitoring, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306808]. While most patient cases will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any patient case has the potential for review. At least one or more unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total accruals warrant selection of unannounced cases.  
 The CTO expects the relevant investigational staff to be available to facilitate the conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. Any issues identified 
August [ADDRESS_375668] of the study will occur, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_306809] / her ongoing responsibilities. In general, close- out is conducted during a site visit. 
However, a site close- out can occur without a site visit if all of the following apply:  
 a. No patient has signed the Informed Consent Form  
b. Investigational agent ( peg-IFN-α) has not been dispensed  
c. All investigational agent (agent) and materials have been returned as defined for the study or destroyed and accounted for properly.  
 14.4 Quality Assurance and Audits  
The Quality Assurance Review Committee (QARC) of the UMCCC performs quality assurance audits of investigator -initiated clinical trials. Audits provide assurance that trials 
are conducted in compliance with the protocol. Further, they ensure that study dat a are 
collected, documented and reported in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) 
Guidelines and regulatory requirements. A QARC audit of each clinical trial is conducted 
annually. Audits occur within the month of  the study’s initial IRB approval. All audit findings 
are reported by [CONTACT_306859]. The DSMB can also request QARC for a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related issues. A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an 
inspection of the study, during its conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection 
has been requested by a regulatory authority, the site investigator must immediately 
inform the Clinical Trial s Office that such a request has been made.  
   15.[ADDRESS_375669] the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_306810], adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violation, or other reasons. Should a patient (or a patient’s legally authorized guardian or representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. A complete final evaluation should be made at the time of the patient’s withdrawal with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing and every effort should be made to perform follow -up evaluations. Patients may be removed from the study treat ment if one or more 
of the following events occur:  
• Significant protocol violation or noncompliance, either on the part of the patient or the PI.  
• Refusal of the patient to continue treatment and / or observations.  
• Unacceptable or dose- limiting toxicity  
• Decision by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_166153]’s medical interest.  
• Unrelated medical illness or complication.  
August 2018

 • Lost to follow -up. 
• Disease relapse or progression.  
 
Patients removed from the study who have received one or  no doses of peg-IFN-α  will 
be evaluable for toxicity only and will therefore be replaced. The number of patients removed from the study prior to being fully evaluable will be monitored regularly by [CONTACT_1758]’s DSMB in order to identify and address problems that may develop with respect to patient accrual. We estimate that <10% of subjects may need to be replaced because 
they encounter toxicity from relapsed AML prior to HCT or during conditioning therapy . 
Patients who die before day +[ADDRESS_375670] the endpoints but additional 
patients will be enrolled to make up for the very short follow up on such patients.  
 16.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 16.1 Study Endpoints  
 
16.1.1 Phase I:  The primary endpoint of phase I is to determine a tolerable  dose of peg-
IFN-α for phase II study  in patients with AML not in remission at HCT.  
 
16.1.2 Phase II:  The primary endpoint is to determine the cumulative incidence of rel apse 
at six months  post-HCT in patients receiving the phase II dose of  peg-IFN-α. All patients 
who have persistent AML or relapse between day 0 and day 180 will be counted towards 
this endpoint.  
  16.2 Study Design and Sample Size Justification  16.2.1 Phase I:  The aim of the dose finding portion of this study is to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of peg-IFN-α among two dose levels: [ADDRESS_375671] patient will be assigned to 90 mcg and the dose assignment of each future patient will be determined using the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) des ign (68). If 90 mcg proves to be overly toxic, a lower dose 
of 45 mcg will be included as a “fall -back” dose and be assigned to the next patient to 
avoid closure of the study.  If [ADDRESS_375672] patients will be selected as the MTD.  
 
16.2.2  Definitions of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The following events with be 
considered DLTs:  
• Unexpected Grade 4 CTCAE v. 4, non- hematologic toxicity , considered probably 
or definitely related to the study drug.  
• Any death not related to relapse of AML or GVHD.  
• Graft failure defined as ANC < 500 by [CONTACT_4475] + 28, not related to persistent  AML.  
August [ADDRESS_375673] (or 14 
days after final treatment, whichever comes later), will be counted . DLTs after the 
treatment period will be counted only  if they reflect an ongoing toxicity that initiated in the 
treatment period. 
16.2.3 Dose Assignment : Dose assignments for the mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_306811] [ADDRESS_375674] patient (who is assigned to 90 mcg) does not experience DLT, the 
next patient will be assigned to [ADDRESS_375675] patient experiences DLT, the next patient will be assigned to 45 mcg.  
 Based upon simulations, with a sample size of 35 patients, if the true DLT rates of the three doses are 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 (90 mcg is the MTD), we have a probability of 50% of selecti ng 90 mcg as the MTD and 50% of patients will be assigned to 90 mcg on 
average.  If the true DLT rates of the three doses are 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 (180 mcg is the MTD), we have a probability of 80% of selecting 180 mcg as the MTD and over 90% of patients w ill be assigned to [ADDRESS_375676] 80% power, assuming a Type I error rate of 0.05, to show a differe nce between a promising six month relapse rate of 40% versus a relapse rate of 
60%,  which is the primary aim of the phase II portion of this study.

 16.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
 16.3.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306812]-R elapse mortality:  
Once [ADDRESS_375677] developed Grades III -IV aGVHD that is 
refractory  to corticosteroid therapy  (methylprednisone 2mg/kg or equivalent)  before day 
[ADDRESS_375678] (GVHD100). Independent from the occurrence of GVHD100, the study will also stop if [ADDRESS_375679] (NRM100).  
Although our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306813] [ADDRESS_375680], we will not  
halt accrual to wait for full follow -up of previously -enrolled subjects unless there is  
potential for an ‘early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ condition. For example, we will enroll the 13th subject  as 
August [ADDRESS_375681] already  experienced GVHD100 or NRM100 
event. As a result, there is a possibility of enrolling additional subjects on this study before 
we discover the ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]’/halt on accrual condition has been met.  
If less than [ADDRESS_375682] either these events, 12 more patients will be enrolled, for a total of 24 patients.  At this point, the study will stop if 12 or more patients (out of 24) have 
developed GVHD100 or NRM100. If less than [ADDRESS_375683] either of these events, the study will continue to enroll the remaining subjects.  (See TABLE 5 ) If the true 
rate of grades III -IV acute GVHD or non- relapse mortality within 100 days of transplant is 
40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%, the study will stop with probability of 0.13, 0.44, 0.80, or 0.97, respectively.  
16.3.[ADDRESS_375684] 24 patients experience graft 
failure within 28 days of transplant  (EF28) .  If the true ra te of graft failure within 28 days 
of transplant is 5%, 10%, or 15%, the study will stop with probability of 0.17, 0.50, or 0.75, respectively.

16.4 Data Analysis Methods 
16.4.1 Primary Outcome:  
The cumulative incidence for relapse will be estimated using proportional hazard model 
for the competing risk of non -relapse mortality (NRM) (69). 
16.4.2 Secondary Outcomes:  
The cumulative incidence of NRM and GVHD will be calculated using proportional hazard models methods. Overall survival (OS) will be calculated from the day of transplantation (day 0) until death. Event free survival (DFS) will calculated from the day of transplantation until death or post HCT detection of relapsed or persistent AML. OS and DFS will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methods.

 16.4.3 Biologic Outcomes:  
 
The frequency and absolute numbers of tumor antigen  specific T cells  (peptide 
responsive or Tetramer + cells), BDC3A+ DCs,  ex vivo  PBMC responses and other 
cellular immune subsets measured serially will be used to generate kinetic curves that will be correlated with pharmacodynamic markers, serum inflammatory markers, and the 
primary clinical endpoint of relapse. These secondary endpoint analyses are 
descriptive (e.g. means and standard errors) and preclude formal hypothesis testing . Due to the small sample size, they will be used primarily for hypothesis 
generation and design of future studies.  
 The optional MRI component of the proposal is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_306815]. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no formal sample size or power calculations will be performed, and there will be no formal testing of statistical hypotheses.  We will compute summary statistics of data for groups  
of patients including PRM scatterplots, image overlays of PRM data, mean values, 
medians, range, quartiles and standard deviations . These data will be used primarily to 
generate hypotheses and design future studies.  
16.5 Projected Accrual:    
Based upon review of our programs clinical database over the past [ADDRESS_375685] accrued similar numbers in this timeframe  (UMCC 2007.055). We will monitor enrollment rates 
closely in the first six months and make adjustments to eligibility as necessary including expansion to other centers. There are currently no competing protocols .

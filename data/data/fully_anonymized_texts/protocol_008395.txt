Document Release Date 06/28/[ADDRESS_302459] common non-skin cancer. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_248750], approximately 30% of breast cancer patients develop disease 
recurrence requiring additional treatment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_248751], overall survival has changed little over the past 
few decades. 
1.[ADDRESS_302460] isolated from the marine sponge 
Halichondria okadai. 
Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening 
phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects 
via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, 
disruption of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged 
mitotic blockage. 
In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration approved eribulin mesylate under the trade 
name [CONTACT_248774]. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane 
in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
2. Rationale 
Anti-tubulin therapy is an established cornerstone of chemotherapeutics for MBC. 
Work at our center and others has shown a favorable therapeutic index for weekly 
metronomic vinorelbine (1-4). Given the efficacy and tolerability, including lack of 
alopecia and nausea, many clinicians use vinorelbine early in therapy for metastatic 
breast cancer. Eribulin (HalavenC) is the first new therapeutic in breast cancer to 
show a survival advantage in salvage therapy. However, the tolerability of the FDA 
approved dose and schedule may limit its use in clinical practice, the number of 
patients offered the therapy, and the number of doses administered (duration of use) 
in metastatic breast cancer. The history of other effective and tolerable agents, 
including paclitaxel, capecitabine, as well as, vinorelbine, suggest that a low dose 
metronomic schedule of eribulin would be effective, well tolerated and result in a 
longer time to progression (UP), and higher quality of life during therapy as has been 
seen clinically with low dose metronomic programs of capecitabine (5). In phase I 
studies, Eribulin showed activity at doses well below the maximally tolerated 
4 Printed on 6/6/2019 
8093 IRB Approved 
Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
1.4mg/m 2  given 2/3 weeks, suggesting a lower metronomic schedule would not 
compromise efficacy. 
Eribulin has a novel mechanism of microtubule inhibition providing dynamic inhibition 
which is irreversible (6-7). Eribulin was studied in two phase [ADDRESS_302461] (8), patients with prior anthracyclines and 
taxanes exposure were given eribulin at 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day 
cycle, subsequently modified to days 1 and 8 of a q 21-day cycle due neutropenia 
seen on day 15; the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4. A partial 
response (PR) rate of 11.5% was seen, with median progression free survival of 2.6 
months and median survival of 9 months. Grade 3 of 4 neutropenia was appreciated 
in 64%, febrile neutropenia in 4%, and peripheral neuropathy in 5%. In the second 
trial (9) prior capecitabine, anthracycline and taxane exposure were required. The 
same dose was given on the q 21-day cycle. The median number of prior 
chemotherapy regimens was 4. The response rate was 9.3% (investigator-reported, 
14%), median progression-free survival was 2.6 months, and median survival was 10.4 
months. Grade 3 of 4 neutropenia was seen in 54%, febrile neutropenia in 5.5%, and 
grade 3 neuropathy in 6.9%. 
These phase II studies set the stage for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_248752], comparing 
eribulin in the same dose and schedule (days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) to physician's 
choice of salvage therapy among anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated MBC patients, 
with at least two prior regimens for advanced disease. In a major advance in 
metastatic breast cancer, overall survival, the primary endpoint, was improved from 
9.3 months to 13.1 months in patients receiving eribulin (4). There was a longer but 
not significant difference in progression free survival (3.7 vs 2.2 months), and the 
response rate was higher for eribulin (12.2 vs. 4.7%, p=.002). Similar to the findings in 
phase II, the dominant grade 3 of 4 toxicity was neutropenia (45%) for eribulin, which 
was higher than in the control arm. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8.2%. The 
overall incidence of reported treatment-related serious adverse events was 12% for 
eribulin and 7% for the control treatments. Based on the outcome of EMBRACE, 
eribulin is now an FDA- approved therapy in the salvage setting for MBC. 
We believe that the optimal schedule of eribulin has yet to be defined and that an 
approach similar to that used with vinorelbine could improve the tolerability of the 
agent without sacrificing efficacy. A lower dose metronomic schedule would allow 
responding patients to remain on treatment, resulting in a longer time to progression, 
and greater use of the drug in practice. Based on the phase I studies of eribulin we 
propose a dose of 0.9 mg/m 2  on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks as a metronomic 
schedule in a phase II trial, with the hope of averting alopecia and significant 
cytopenias. Given the lack of pharmacologic interaction between the drugs and the 
efficacy of vinorelbine with anti-HER2 agents(2, 10), we would propose to allow 
inclusion of HER2 positive patients with concomitant use of trastuzumab.

3. Trial Objectives 
Primary: 
• Progression free survival (PFS). We hypothesize that metronomic dosing of 
eribulin will result in a PFS of 4-6 months. 
Secondary: 
• Frequency of alopecia with absence or decrease to <50% 
• Incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia of <30% 
• Incidence of sensory neuropathy (all grades) to <25% 
Exploratory: 
• Assess the role of circulating endothelial cell precursors (CEPs) and apoptotic 
CECs, in predicting early response to treatment. 
4. Trial Design 
This is an open-label, multi-center, phase II study of eribulin for patients with 
metastatic breast cancer. 
Patients will receive eribulin 0.9 mg/m [ADDRESS_302462] cancer (MBC) whose disease has progressed following 
at least one prior regimen of chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic breast cancer 
will be recruited from the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), University of Arizona

There should always be a two week treatment free interval between cycles when the 
patient criteria is not met (as above) and the dose is omitted. 
Non toxicity related treatment delays/omissions will be considered on a case by [CONTACT_248757] P.I. 
If a delay of > 3 weeks is required, the patient should be removed from study 
treatment and continue to be treated in accordance with the Investigator's standard 
clinical practice. 
6.2.2 Eribulin administration 
Eribulin will be administered at 0.9 mg/m 2  on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks. 
Treatment will continue until patient develops disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or chooses to stop study treatment. 
Guidelines for dose modification and dose interruption of study drug are described in 
Table 6-1. 
6.2.3 Dose Modifications 
Any dose reduction or dose delay of study drug is based upon the severity of toxicity 
as graded by [CONTACT_248758] (NCI-CTCAE, 
version 4.0). Once a dose has been reduced during a treatment cycle, re-escalation 
will not be permitted during any subsequent cycles.

documents. 
6.3 	Concomitant Medications 
Other systemic antitumor therapy is not allowed except for: 
a. Trastuzumab, at standard doses, as this is standard of care for HER2 positive 
tumors. 
b. Denosumab or bisphosphonates to treat metastatic bone disease, as these are 
also standard of care. 
Radiation therapy may have been administered previously. However, concurrent 
radiation therapy or its institution to treat progressive symptoms during treatment is 
not permitted. Patients who require palliative radiation must discontinue eribulin for 
7-14 days and wait 7-14 days after completing radiation before resuming eribulin 
therapy.

Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
Endocrine therapy is not permitted during the study. However, good clinical practice 
would imply that for ER+ patients, endocrine therapy will previously have been given 
unless contraindicated in the judgment of the treating physician (e.g., for significant 
visceral involvement). 
Patients should also be screened for concomitant use of drugs that prolong QT 
interval. If identified, these drugs should be discontinued. A list of drugs that prolong 
QT interval is available at http:/ /www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/printable-
drug-list.cfm . Please note that low dose Zofran is allowed because QT safety issues 
are associated with high dose Zofran. The expectation is that sites will use the list 
together with the same good medical practice procedures used for patients who are 
not on a study. This may involve consultation with the site's pharmacist. 
7. Trial Procedures 
Prior to undergoing any study-specific procedure, patients must read and sign 
the current Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form.

8.1.1 Definition of Measurable and Non-Measurable Disease 
Measurable disease: The presence of at least one lesion (non-lymph node) that is 
>10mm in longest diameter on an axial image on CT or MRI with < 5 mm 
reconstruction interval (if slice thickness is > 5mm, the longest diameter must be at 
least two times the thickness) or a lymph node that is > 15 mm in short axis. Skin 
lesions > [ADDRESS_302479] diameter on clinical exam (photo) are considered 
measurable. The photo should include a ruler. 
Non-measureable disease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria (includes bone only disease and 
lesions < 10 mm or lymph nodes < 15 mm in short axis) with rising serum CA15-[ADDRESS_302480] a 20% increase over 
the first and for CA 15-3 or CA 27.29 be greater than or equal to 40 units/mL or for 
CEA be greater than or equal to 4 ng/mL.

Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
8.1.2 Baseline Documentation of Tumor Burden 
• Target lesions: A maximum of five target lesions in total (up to two per organ) 
will be identified. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum longest diameter (SLD). The baseline SLD will be used as the reference by 
[CONTACT_14218]. 
• Nontarget lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as 
nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow-up. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_302481] 1.1 criteria. Treatment 
outcomes will be defined as: 
• Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all extranodal target and 
non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to <1mm 
in short axis. 
• Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum of diameters. 
• Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD. 
• Progressive disease (PD): Sum of diameters increased by [CONTACT_2669] 20% from the 
smallest value on study (including baseline if that is the smallest). The sum of 
diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Two 
lesions increasing from 2mm to 3mm, for example, does not qualify). 
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions also constitutes disease 
progression as does the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
FDG-PET can be used to complement CT scanning. A positive FDG-PET scan is one 
which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on 
the attenuation corrected images. Progressive disease by [CONTACT_6789]-PET: Negative FDG-PET 
at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up based on a new lesion, or No FDG-
PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up. Either of these findings should 
be correlated with CT scan imaging as described in RECIST 1.1 but date of progression 
is assigned to the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan. 
Tumor Marker (CEA and either CA 27.29 or CA 15-3) Response:  
• Tumor Marker Complete Response: Reduction in CEA and CA 15-[ADDRESS_302482] 
Tumor Marker Partial Response: Greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in 
CEA and CA 15-3 or CA 27.29 from baseline, but not qualifying as CR.

Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
• Tumor Marker Progression: Greater than or equal to a 50% increase in CEA and 
CA 15-3 or CA 27.29 from baseline. 
• Tumor Marker Stable Disease: or CEA and CA 15-3 or CA 27.29 response not 
qualifying as CR, PR, or Progression. 
• Tumor Marker Inadequate Assessment, response unknown: CEA and CA 15-3 or 
CA 27.29 response has not been adequately assessed. 
8.2 Time-to-Event Measures 
The following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply: 
• Duration of Tumor Response is measured from the date of the first objective 
assessment of PR or CR to the first date of disease relapse or death from any 
cause. 
• Progression-free survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the first 
date of radiographic progression of disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death. 
8.3 Correlative Science 
Research blood samples will be collected to explore markers that may be related to 
eribulin's antitumor and antiangiogenic activity. Circulating endothelial cell (CEC), 
circulating endothelial precursor cell (CEP) and apoptotic CEC assays are among the 
markers that will be assessed. Other markers may also be explored. 
The role of CEPs in predicting early response will be examined by [CONTACT_248764]. Alison Stopeck at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. 
CECs have been shown to decrease in response to anti-angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (11, 12). 
CEPs have also been shown to correlate with increased angiogenesis and can increase 
in response to growth factor use with G-CSF (13, 14). One mechanism by [CONTACT_248765] G-CSF use to prevent increases in CEPs, a precursor for 
tumor induced angiogenesis. In advanced breast cancer patients receiving metronomic 
chemotherapy, an increase in apoptoic CECs after 2 months of therapy was associated 
with prolonged progression-free and overall survival with follow up of greater than 2 
years (15). In this trial we propose to measure levels of CEPs, and apoptotic CECs, at 
baseline and in response to eribulin therapy in an effort to validate metronomic 
dosing as having both antitumor as well as antiangiogenic effects.

Document Release Date: 06/28/[ADDRESS_302484] 
in accordance with the IRB policy. Examples of unanticipated events are (1) adverse 
events, (2) breach of confidentiality, (3) accidental or unintentional change to the IRB 
approved protocol that harmed participants, (4) incarceration of a study patient, (5) 
study patient complaint. 
The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patients during the 
study. The investigator remains responsible to follow, through an appropriate health 
care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue 
study treatment. The patient should be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. 
Safety measurements that will be used in the study include physical examinations and 
clinical laboratory tests. Clinical exam by [CONTACT_248766], absolute neutrophil 
count, platelet count and serum chemistry to include sodium, potassium, chloride, 
carbon dioxide, creatinine, BUN, glucose, calcium, LDH, albumin, bilirubin, AST, ALT, 
total protein, alkaline phosphatase and magnesium will be performed after recovery 
from the previous cycle and prior to the start of each subsequent treatment cycle. 
CBC, absolute neutrophil count and platelet count will be done prior to each dose of 
planned chemotherapy (days 1, 8, 15 of each cycle). 
Adverse events will be graded for toxicity using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Toxicity assessments will be performed based 
on procedures outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. Any adverse events leading to 
a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all adverse events that are 
grade 3 and higher will be recorded in the CRF. 	
9.2 	Definition of an Adverse Event 
The definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) are given 
below. 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. 
An undesirable medical condition can be a symptom (e.g., nausea, chest pain), or a 
sign (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver). 	
9.[ADDRESS_302485] one of the following criteria will be designated a serious 
adverse event (SAE). SAEs will be reported to the Coordinating Center, Eisai and the 
IRB of record according to the IRB's policy/procedure. 
• Results in death 
• Requires initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
• Is immediately life-threatening 
• Results in severe or permanent disability or incapacity 
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
16 	Printed on 6/6/2019 I 
8093 IRB Approved 
Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
• Any other important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or requires 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Reportable Serious Adverse Event (SAE) - Any event that is unequivocally 
unrelated to study drug or is due to progression of disease should not be reported 
as an SAE. 
9.[ADDRESS_302486] dose of study drug or until another anti-cancer 
therapy is initiated. 
Prior to beginning study treatment, study site personnel will note the occurrence and 
nature of each patient's medical condition(s). During the study, site personnel will 
again note any change in the condition(s) and/or the occurrence and nature of any 
adverse events. Adverse events are to be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 
4.0. 
A description of the event, including its date of onset, date of resolution and any 
action taken should be provided along with the investigator's assessment of causality. 
An event that is due to unequivocal progression of disease should not be reported as 
an AE. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along 
with all grades [ADDRESS_302487] be recorded on a case report form 
(CRF). 
Any SAE that is NOT unequivocally unrelated to study drug or due to progression of 
disease must be reported to EISAI and the appropriate IRB. Reportable SAEs 
experienced within 30-days after the patient has stopped study treatment must be 
reported. For enrollments from SCCA main campus, SCCA at Evergreen and the SCCA 
Network sites SAE reports should be submitted to the Consortium IRB. Reportable 
SAEs occurring at Arizona Cancer Center (AZCC) will be reported to their IRB. 
10. Data Analysis/Statistical Methods 
Patients must meet all eligible criteria and receive at least one full cycle of protocol 
directed therapy to be included in the efficacy analysis. All treated patients will be 
included in the assessment of adverse events. 
10.1 Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint is progression free survival. 
Progression free survival (PFS) will be measured as the time from study enrollment 
until the earliest date of disease progression or death. PFS will be censored at last 
radiographic assessment for patients who discontinue study therapy for reasons other 
than disease progression. 	Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to describe 
progression-free survival, overall and stratified by [CONTACT_248767]. A 95% confidence interval for the median PFS will be calculated 
17 	Printed on 6/6/2019 
8093 IRB Approved 
Document Release Date: 06/28/2017 
using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. The sample size of 60 eligible and 
evaluable patients has 99% power for the lower bound of the confidence interval to be 
greater than 2.2 months (the median PFS in the physician's discretion arm of the 
EMBRACE trial), assuming that the true median PFS is 4 months, comparable to or an 
incremental improvement over the median PFS for the eribulin arm of the EMBRACE 
trial (3.7 months). 
Based on the eribulin arm of the EMBRACE trial, median progression free survival is 
expected to be approximately 3.[ADDRESS_302488] an improvement in median progression 
free survival from 3.7 to 4 months. 
10.2 Analysis of Other Endpoints 
Demographic characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor type, and [COG 
performance status will be tabulated. All continuous data will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values). All categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. 
The prevalence of key adverse events will be calculated and 95% Wilson (score) 
confidence intervals reported for each. 	With a sample size of n=60, power is 
approximately 88% to produce confidence intervals with an upper bound lower than 
the rate reported in the EMBRACE trial, assuming that the rate of the adverse event is 
[ADDRESS_302489] participates in the trial, the investigator or delegate (as allowed by 
[CONTACT_60683]) is responsible for obtaining written informed consent after 
adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, subject 
responsibilities including the use of adequate methods to prevent pregnancy, and 
potential hazards of the study and before any protocol-specific screening procedures 
or any study medications are administered. 
All patients must be registered before the start of treatment. To register a patient,

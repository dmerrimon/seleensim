Study Name:  [CONTACT_338868]:  Safety and Effectiveness Evaluation of the Multi -Electrode Radiofrequency 
Balloon Catheter for the Treatment of Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.  
 
Study 
Number:  
 BWI_2017_04  
Study  
Description:  This clinical study is a prospective, multicenter, single -arm cl inical evaluation of 
the Multi-E lectrode Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon catheter  (HELIOSTARTM). The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall  safety and effectiveness of the 
HELIOSTARTM catheter , in conjunction with the Multi -Electrode Circular 
Diagnostic catheter (LassoStarTM) and Multi -Channel RF Generator,  for the 
treatment of drug refractory P aroxysmal A trial Fibrillation  (PAF).  Embedded 
within the Main Study will be a Neurological Assessment Evaluable (NAE) subset 
and a Cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) image (CT/MRA) subset with consecutive enrollment and a prospective 
design.  The same subject  can participate in both  the NAE and cardiac CT/MRA  
subsets.  
 
The study will enroll subjects with drug refractory, symptomatic PAF who are 
candidates for catheter ablation. The first [ADDRESS_418858]/MRA  subset , or in 
the primary endpoint  analys es. The roll-in phase will include a maximum of [ADDRESS_418859] procedure at 7 days  (7-14 days) , 1 month  (23-37 days) , 3 months  (76-
104 days) , 6 months  (150-210 days), and 12 months  (315- 405 days)  unless 
otherwise specified in the protocol. 
 
Objective:  Primary Objective:  
To demonstrate the safety and 12 -month effectiveness of the HELIOSTARTM 
catheter for the treatment of drug refractory PAF.  Specifically:  
• To demonstrate the safety based on the incidence of early -onset (within 7 
days of ablation procedure) primary adverse events.  
• To demonstrate the 12-month  effectiveness based on the proportion of 
subjects with  freedom from documented asymptomatic and symptomatic 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Atrial Tachycardia (AT), or Atrial Flutter (AFL, of unknown origin
+) epi[INVESTIGATOR_338800] (day [ADDRESS_418860] index procedure).  
+AFL of unknown origin is defined as all AFL except those cavo -tricuspid isthmus ( CTI) 
dependent AFL as confirmed by [CONTACT_338829] (e.g. entrainment  or activation 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) in an EP study

Biosense Webster, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL       Page [ADDRESS_418872] common sustained arrhythmia in humans.  It affects anywhere 
from 0.4% to 1% of the general population, and increases in prevalence with age to 
approximately 10% in patients over 80 years of age.1-3 The primary clinical benefit of AF 
ablation is improvement i n quality of life ( QoL) resulting from the elimination of arrhythmia-
related symptoms such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, or effort intolerance.3,4  In recognition of 
this, the elimination of symptomatic atrial arrhythmias was recommended by [CONTACT_941] 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS and 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE Consensus 
Statements on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation.
3,5 The opi[INVESTIGATOR_338809]  (ESC), as expressed in their 2016 AF Management 
Guidelines , is that “Catheter ablation of symptomatic paroxysmal AF is recommended to 
improve AF symptoms in patients who have symptomatic recurrences of AF on antiarrhythmic drug therapy and who prefer further rhythm control therapy, when 
performed by [CONTACT_338832].”
2,6 
 
The 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE consensus statement states that “PVI is 
now widely accepted as the cornerstone of AF ablation procedures ” and that “electrical 
isolation of the PVs is recommended during all AF ablation procedures .”3   Point -by-point 
ablation with RF catheters has provided positive results for treating many types of supraventricular arrhythmias,
7,8 including PAF.7-13 However, the procedure is technically 
complex and has a long learning curve. Radiofrequency ablation success is highly 
dependent on operator skill and is associated with a high degree of PV reconnection.14-16 
Additionally, RF ablation carries a major complication rate of roughly 4.5%.17   
 
In order to reduce technical complexity and potentially decrease major complications, balloon ablation catheters were developed. Balloon catheters use tissue cooling 
(cryoballoon), heating (hot balloon) or selective destruction with a laser (laser balloon) to 
create lesions and isolate PVs.  
 The second -generation cryoballoon (CB -2), so- called because of design improvements 
over the original first -generation cryoballoon, uses injected refrigerant to ablate tissue that 
comes in contact [CONTACT_338833] (cooling zone).   While the CB -
2 often allows single- shot pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI),
18-[ADDRESS_418873] developed a pull -back technique (incomplete 
occlusion at the beginning of freezing) to minimize phrenic nerve (PN) injury.20-23 In 
addition, PN pacing is required throughout the procedure on the right side so freezing can 
be immediately aborted if PN palsy (PNP) is observed.21,22,24- 26  Because of this, there is 
a greater rate of reconduction in the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV).27  Investigators 
who use the CB- 2 differ in their recommendation of a “bonus freeze”,27-30 optimal dosing 
of cryoenergy (240 sec18,24 vs. 180 sec20,31 or even less,26,28), minimum temperature32, the 
need for an endoluminal esophageal temperature cutoff26,33,34, and whether both sizes (23 
mm and 28 mm35) should be used versus using the larger balloon exclusively.19,25,30,34,[ADDRESS_418874] 
investigators seem to prefer35, may not fit an especially narrow PV ostium.   
 
The hot balloon (HB) is a compliant balloon that uses a heated saline/contrast mixture to heat the surrounding tissue and generate thermal lesions. Advantages of the HB system 
over conventional RF ablation are the possibility of single- shot PVI

still requires a fair amount of operator skill and finesse,39,40 and the balloon position should 
be checked often by [CONTACT_338834].40,41  The need 
for esophageal temperature monitoring and, when applicable, cooling41 also increases 
procedural complexity. The need for PN pacing and/or fluoroscopic monitoring of the 
diaphragm is still paramount with this system in order to prevent PNP.40,41  Because central 
balloon temperature, RF time, and the diameter to which the balloon is inflated are all 
dependent upon the thickness of the target ablation tissue (each PV, e.g.),40,41 extensive 
pre-procedure imaging (intracardiac echocardiography 12 or 3-D Computed Tomography) 
is required.40,41 Like the CB -2, HB is not useful for focal touchups or repeat ablation of 
gaps/ sites of reconduction. To ablate such areas, a conventional irrigated tip RF catheter 
is still needed.40 
 The laser balloon (LB) is a compliant balloon that can be inflated to a broad range of 
diameters and contains a central catheter shaft with a fiberoptic endoscope and a second 
fiber for laser energy delivery.  Applications of laser energy last 20- 30 seconds and cover 
a 30
o arc with the aim of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_338810] 30- 50% to achieve transmurality.42,43  
Esophageal temperature monitoring and PN pacing are still necessary.  Ablation in or near the blood source requires decreased energy output;

deflated; therefore electrical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_338811].42,[ADDRESS_418876] with the

1.5.1.  Known Potential Risks  
Pericarditis: With any balloon- based ablation, pericarditis can occur due to mechanical 
or thermal irritation of the myocardium.49  This tends to be underreported47 as it is usually 
transient and resolves without intervention. 
 
Phrenic nerve palsy : While the reported incidence of PNP following HB ablation (<  4%)39-
41,55 or LB ablation (≤  6%)42-50,52,53,56 is low, the incidence of PNP with CB -2 ablation was 
reported to range from <  1%18,27 -30,34 -36 to 27%,19-23,25,28,32,[ADDRESS_418877] cases, PNP with CB -2 is a transient complication,24 recovering before the 
end of the procedure,22,25,32,36 or, if not, by [CONTACT_316290].19,21,26,28,35,58  However, in

Biosense Webster, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL       Page [ADDRESS_418878] for 1019,29,30 to 2020,23 months, suggesting that 
the injury is permanent.  
 
Injury to the PN may occur as a result of RF application in the region of the right pulmonary 
veins. The reported incidence of PNP varies from 0% to 0.48% when RF energy is used 
for point -by-point ablation.59,60   
 
Atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) : AEF is a  rare but catastrophic complication of AF ablation 
that can occur due to the anatomical proximity of the esophagus to the posterior wall of the LA and that is associated with a high mortality rate.
61  AEF has not been observed in 
clinical experience with the HB or LB.  Only one patient (1.8% of 55 patients) presented with AEF in one prospective observational study with the CB -2
25 and this was the only 
case found in 18 series of consecutive procedures totaling over 2000 patients.18-23,25,26,28 -
30,32,34 -36,56 -58   
 
While AEF is uncommon with balloon- based ablation systems, damage to the esophagus 
is fairly common.  One study found that superficial thermal lesions developed in 2% of 
patients and thermal ulcerations in 10% of patients following CB -2 ablation.34  Another 
study showed an incidence of esophageal lesions of 3.19% with CB -2.26  Esophageal 
lesions were reported in 1- 10% of patients following ablation with the HB.40,41,[ADDRESS_418879] often found after LB 
ablation, with mild thermal lesions found in 7%42 to 8%51 of patients and more severe 
ulcerations found in 5% to 15%.42,51,56  The severity of esophageal lesions was greater 
with LB compared to RF catheter ablation in a head -to-head study.51 Moreover, 
esophageal temperatures in excess of 38.5o-39oC necessitating cessation of energy 
delivery and/or repositioning of the balloon occur more than half of the time with LB ablation.
42,43,46  The clinical significance of esophageal lesions, if any, is not known.20,33,34  
 
Many electrophysiologists attempt to mitigate esophageal damage by [CONTACT_338835]. A cutoff temperature of 3oC has 
100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for predicting esophageal thermal lesions following 
CB-2 ablation.29  However, esophageal temperature during LB ablation has poor 
specificity for e sophageal injury, with no significant correlation between maximal 
esophageal temperature and incidence and severity of esophageal thermal lesions.51 
 
Pulmonary vein stenosis:  PV stenosis has not been reported following CB -2 ablation.  
In clinical experience with HB ablation, PV stenosis  was reported in <  2-5% of patients,39-
41,62 and was usually asymptomatic.41  Similarly, with LB ablation, PV stenosis is rarely 
reported.  In one study, mild stenosis (up to 25% narrowing of the PVs) was found in 44% of patients and moderate stenosis (26- 50% narrowing) in 6%; there were no cases of 
severe stenos is (> 50% narrowing).
48  The risk of pulmonary adverse events (e.g., PV 
stenosis, thrombus and hypertension) associated with an RF ablation procedure targeting 
the pulmonary veins is considered small (<  4%).11,12,63 -66 
 
Thrombus formation: A thrombus may form on the ablation electrode during the 
application of RF current that could become dislodged and embolize to produce stroke, myocardial infarction, or other ischemic injury. The risk of thrombus is minimal with CB -2, 
but microthrombi were found in preclinical studies following HB ablation.
37  In the clinical 
setting with HB, 5 patients of 238 (2.1%) developed a cerebral infarction.  However, in 
each case, this was attributed to arrhythmia recurrence and insufficient anticoagulation.40

Biosense Webster, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL       Page [ADDRESS_418880] that more energy applications and higher energy output facilitate 
thermocoagulation.45,54 Thrombus formation following ablation may also occur on the 
endocardium may produce arterial or pulmonary embolus.  
 
Pericardial effusion/ cardiac tamponade: Cardiac perforation may result in cardiac tamponade and may require percutaneous pericardial drainage or surgical repair.  
Pericardial effusion was reported in 0.6% - 7.3% of patients ablated with CB -2,
22,35,36,57 
and cardiac tamponade in 0.2% - 3%.18,20,23,32  Pericardial effusion may occur at a rate of 
15% in patients treated with the HB.[ADDRESS_418881] the LA roof after balloon 
retraction.42,52 Aside from these reports, the incidence of pericardial effusion has been <  
2%48,49 and cardiac tamponade ≤5%47-49,[ADDRESS_418882] in a thin- walled 
chamber (ie, right atrium , LA, or right ventricle ).  However, the risk of perforation due to 
steam pop is reduced when the minimum amount of energy output required to achieve transmurality is used.
46   
 
Cerebral ischemic lesions: The incidence of TIA is <  3% following CB -2 ablation;20,28,[ADDRESS_418883] procedural imaging was obtained, 13.6% of LB -treated patients 
were observed to have new embolic brain lesions, and another 2.3% had diplopia 
secondary to an ischemic lesion.45  There were similar findings of diplopia due t o a 
suspected ischemic event (1.4%) in another LB study.[ADDRESS_418884] -procedure in a randomized controlled study 
was 24% for LB, which was not significantly different from RF catheter ablation or first -
generation CB.54   
 
According to the 2017 HRS guidelines, the incidence of ACE lesions can vary  from 2% -
15% as  a complication to AF ablation.3  It is defined as an occlusion of a blood vessel in 
the brain due to an embolus that does not result in any acute clinical symptoms and is 
therefore ‘silent’. Emboli can result from a thrombus, gas, air, tissue or fat. Source of micro-
emboli include thrombi, which can develop on sheaths, materials, air introduction through 
sheath or during catheter exchange.  
 
Coronary artery  occlusion: RF current may cause occlusion of a coronary artery, either 
by [CONTACT_338836], spasm, or thrombosis. Research suggests that the risk of 
coronary occlusion is less than 0.5%.67,68 Because coronary arterial occlusion could 
produce myocardial infarction, angina or death, the physician will attempt to restore 
coronary blood flow through pharmacological, catheter and/or surgical intervention as 
medically indicated.  
 
Heart block : The application of RF current close to the atrioventricular (AV) node or HIS 
bundle could damage or destroy the normal AV conduction system, producing complete heart block and requiring implantation of a permanent pacemaker.  
 
Cardiac perforati on: Cardiac perforation may result from catheter manipulation or 
application of RF current (risk is <  1%).67,68  This may result in cardiac tamponade and 
may require percutaneous pericardial drainage or surgical repair.  However, the risk of perforation related to a deep steam pop is reduced if RF energy is not delivered 
perpendicular to the wall at power above 35 or 40 watts. If the lesion is deeper, the risk of 
steam pop is higher above 35- 40 watts.

possibly require surgical valve replacement.  
 
Vascular access / bleeding complication: Vascular access complication, femoral 
arteriovenous fistula, hematoma, and pseudoaneurysm are commonly reported following 
CB-2 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] <  4%),18-22,25,28,32,35,36,56 -58 or LB ablation (< 6%).47,50,69,70 Arterial or venous

8. Study Schedule , Procedures, and Assessments  
8.1. Screening and Informed Consent  
The Patient ICFs used must have approval from Biosense Webster and the study site's 
IRB/EC prior to patient enrollment in the study. An approved Patient ICF may be translated 
as appropriate.  A copy of a blank  approved Patient ICF must be maintained by [CONTACT_338844] a designated study administrative file.  
 
Patients presenting to the institution with symptomatic PAF and who are considered for 
an ablation procedure should be pre-screened by [CONTACT_338845]’  standard of care. Sites should pre-screen all 
patients who require a documented ablation procedure for symptomatic PAF without 
regard to sex or race.  A pre-screening log will be used to document all patients who were 
reviewed for potential inclusion into the study . 
 
The study investigator or designee will obtain written informed consent from the patient , 
or patient’s legal representative if applic able,  prior to the patient’s participation in the study. 
The patient should NOT undergo any study  specific tests or examinations that fall outside 
the standard of care without first signing the P atient ICF for this clinical investigation. 
Patients should be made aware that by [CONTACT_12568], they are granting approval for 
study personnel to review their medical records and to collect/analyze personal medical 
information. Patients should also be informed that study personnel will maintain 
confidentiality of the medical records at all times. The background of the proposed study and the potential benefits and risks of the study should be explained to the patient before 
the ICF is signed .  
 If a patient is unable to read or write, informed consent shall be obtained through the aid 
of an independent witness who will be present throughout the process. The written Patient ICF and any other information shall be read aloud and explained to the prospective patient and, whenever possible, the patient shall sign and date the ICF. The independent witness

9.1. Specific Safety Parameters  
⸙ Pursuant MDR 2017/745, in the occasion relevant (local) regulations, guidance(s) and 
processes on safety determinations, definitions and reporting become in full force during 
the course of the study, the Sponsor shall adhere to the applicable definitions and 
processes.  
 
9.2. Adverse Event Definitions 
9.2.1.  Adverse Events (AE)   
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  Specifically, an adverse event (AE) is any undesirable 
experienc e (sign, symptom, illness, abnormal laboratory value, or other medical event) 
occurring to a subject during the course of the study, whether or not it is related to the device or procedure.   
 
The following clinical events will not be considered an adverse  event for this clinical 
study: 
• Any medical condition that is present at the time of screening. Such conditions 
should be added to the medical history, if not previously reported. However, if the study subject’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be 
recorded as an AE.  
• A trace / trivial / minor pericardial effusion that is asymptomatic, requires no medical intervention, and does not extend hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338815]  
• Minor pericarditis attributable to the ablation procedure defined as pleuritic chest 
discomfort with or without pericardial rub and ECG changes.  
• Recurrence of pre -existing AF/AT/AFL  
• AF/AFL/AT recurrence requiring DC cardioversion during the blanking period 
and/or  pharmacological cardioversion at any time throughout the duration of the 
study .  However, new onset of left atrial flutter occurring post -ablation is an AE.  
• Re-ablation for AF or pre- existing AFL/AT itself is not an AE, however any 
complication associated with the repeat ablation procedures  is considered an AE 
and shall be reported within the applicable timelines.  
 
9.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any event that meets one or more of the following 
criteria: 
• Leads to a death  
• Leads to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that resulted in:  
o A life -threatening illness or injury  
o A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
o In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]*  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent l ife-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to body structure or a body function 
o Chronic disease (MDR 2017/745)  ⸙ 
• Leads to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
*Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a condition present prior to the subject’s  enrollment in the study will not 
meet the definition of an SAE. An AE would meet the criterion of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” for seriousness  if 
the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (e.g., an overnight stay).  Emergency

 1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objectives  
 
Part 1:  The primary objective of the phase I portion is to assess safety  of the combination of 
gemcitabine, nab -paclitaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, and irinotecan (GAX -CI) in patients with 
untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) and to determine the maximally tolerate d 
dose (MTD) or the recommended dose for phase II of the combination.   
 
Part 2:  The primary objective of the phase II portion is to assess the efficacy of the combination 
of gemcitabine, nab -paclitaxel, capecitabine,  cisplatin, and irinotecan (GAX -CI) in patients with 
untreated metastatic PDA based on the progression free survival  (PFS).   
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
1.2.1   Part 2 : Continue to assess the safety  of GAX -CI in patients with untreated 
metastatic PDA . 
 
1.3  Exploratory Objectives  
 
1.3.1 Part 2 : To estimate the response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall 
survival (OS) of the combination of gemcitabine, nab -paclitaxel, capecitabine, 
cisplatin, and irinotecan (GAX -CI) in patients with untreated metastatic PDA.   
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_1215081] protein biomarkers such  as 
CA19 -9 and CEA  and exploratory biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA .  
 
1.3.3 To assess baseline characteristic s of the patients enrolled and correlate these 
molecular and clinicopathologic criteria with treatment response and toxicity.  
 
1.3.4 To evaluate molecular determinants of response using next generation sequencing 
and other sequencing techniques.  
 
1.4  Study D esign    
 
This is a two-part, single -institution, open -label, dose -escalation, phase  1/2 study to evaluate the 
clinical activity of gemcitabine, nab -paclitaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, and irinotecan (GAX -CI) 
in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer .  
 
Part 1 of the study is a 3 + 3 dose escalation study designed to evaluate the maximally tolerated 
dose ( MTD ), dose limi ting toxicities (DLTs), and safety  of increasing doses of nab-paclitaxel 
(Abraxane®)  in combination with GX-CI. There will be two cohorts  of dose escalations. The two 
cohorts differ based on the treatment cycle length (28 days for Cohort 1 and 21 days for Cohort 2). 
Dose finding study will be conducted for the 2 cohorts separately. Dose escalation will start with 
Cohort 1. Enrollment for Co hort 2 dose level 1 may start once dose level 2 of Cohort 1 is shown 
to be safe and does not exceed MTD. Dose level s 3-5 (if MTD is not reached ), or any dose levels 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, [ADDRESS_1215082] 1.1 . The recommended dose for phase 2 portion may be a dose 
level at or lower than MTD , and will be determined  based on the review of the safety  and tumor 
response  data. Criteria  for DLTs and dose escalation s are defined in Section 4.3 . 
 
Part 2 is an expansion cohort study for the evaluation of efficacy once the MTD or RDP2 has been 
determined. A dose level from Cohort 1 and/or C ohort [ADDRESS_1215083] 6 patients in that dose level . If enrollment in an 
expansion cohort occurs at the same time as dose escalation , enrollment into the dose escalation 
will take priority.  Due to the COVID 19 situation, version 7 of the protocol is amended to hold 
enrollment into cohort 2 until cohort 1 is complete to decrease the number of in person visits 
required of the patients .  The primary endpoint of Part 2 will be PFS. The treatment regimen would 
be considered of insufficient activity for further study in th is population if the PFS rate at 6 months 
is 44% or less, and the minimum required level of efficacy that would warrant further study with 
the proposed regimen is  a 65% PFS rate at 6 months  (Section 12 ). 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1215084] new cases of pancreatic cancer are advanced with extensive tumor growth 
usually due to the lack of symptoms during the early stages of the disease. As a result, few patients 
are considered candidates for surgical resection. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are 
usually treated with chemotherapy in an effort to improve survival and alleviate symptoms. 
Median survival time ranges from 4 to 6 months in patients wi th metastatic disease. With 
treatment, survival has improved to 6 to 11 months2,3.  Overall, the 5 -year survival rate is about 
8% for all stages combined and decreases to 3% for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer1. 
Currently, there are a few standard therapy options for patients. Single agent gemcita bine was FDA 
approved based on a comparative study between gemcitabine and 5 -FU.  Gemcitabine produced 
significant improvement in disease -related symptoms and prolonged survival (1 -year survival: 
18% versus 2%, respectively)4.  Subsequently, the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erlotinib, was 
approved in comb ination with gemcitabine based on a slight increase in median survival over 
gemcitabine alone (6.24 months compared to 5.91 months)5.  A randomized phase III study 
performed in [LOCATION_009] comparing FOLFIRINOX (5 -FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin) to gemcitabine 
resulted in an improvement in survival of 6.[ADDRESS_1215085] fit patients. Nab-paclitaxel is approved in combination for 
gemcitabine with a median survival of 8.5 months compared to 6.7 months with gemcitabine 
alone6.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_373331].

be reported on the case report form (CRF). Erythropoietin, G -CSF, or Neulasta may be 
administered at the discretion of the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Investigators.  
 
4.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue indefinitely or 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression : Subjects may be allowed to continue treatment if the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_870249] (e.g. a mixed response).   
However, subjects who continue on study with progressive disease by [CONTACT_870260].  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Subject decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• General or specific changes in the su bject's condition render the subject unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1215118]. Survival status will be collected every 3 months (+/ - 3 
weeks) . Subseq uent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_870250]. Subjects removed from study for 
unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of  the adverse event 
or death . 
 
Subjects who discontinued study treatment without  documented disease progression should 
continue to be monitored for disease status by [CONTACT_70719].  Standard of care scans will be 
collected  until: 1) start of a new anti neoplastic therapy (information of the new cancer therapy will 
be collected), 2) disease progression , 3) death, 4) withdrawal of consent, or 5) study closure, 
whichever occurs first.

Report Form.  
 
5.  DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Allowance of chemotherapy breaks of greater than  [ADDRESS_1215120] a longer break from therapy or may need a little extra time for 
clinical and laboratory status to recover. Dose reductions will be managed based on Table 4. 
Additional d ose reductions (depending on starting dose) are up to the discretion of the principal 
investigator. Given that there are certain toxicities that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_870251]  
(for example palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome) , investigat ors may choose to hold the 
capecitabine  and decrease within a cycle  (300mg po bid  and 150mg po bid). In subsequent cycles, 
the capecitabine  will continue at the lower dose  but the other agents do not need to be decreased 
to a lower dose level unless deeme d necessary due to another adverse event. For example, if a 
subject on DL1 (Level 0) develops grade 2 palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome during 
cycle 1, the capecitabine  can be held until < grade [ADDRESS_1215121] should 
receive the next cycle at DL1 (Level 0) except for the capecitabine  would remain at the lower dose  
unless deemed necessary to use DL -1 due to another adverse event . Capecitabine  dose reductions 
can be done independently of the dose reductions for the IV chemotherapy agents .  
 
If patients experience bone marrow toxicity at dose level 3 in Cohort 2, patients may change the 
treatment schedule to the Cohort 1 schedule w ith a cycle length of 28 days after Cycle 6.

6. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
This study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 for adverse 
event reporting . 
 
6.1 Definitions  
 
6.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 
Adverse event  is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring 
after starting the study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to 
the study. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pai n), 
signs (e.g. , tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. , 
laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting the study treatment are only considered adverse events if they wor sen after starting 
the study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring 
before starting the study treatment but after signing the informed consent form will not be 
recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results con stitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy.  
 
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypo thetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] 
(see note below for exceptions) > 24 hours  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital anomalies/birth 
defects must also be reported on the Pregnancy Supplemental Form)  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or  result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention [ e.g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.).  Examples of such events include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the  study)  
• Is associated with an overdose  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:  
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 16 • Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure or to facilitate a 
procedure  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was 
planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is re quired in these 
cases  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention ( e.g., lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, admin istrative).  
• Admissions for monitoring of treatment -related infusion reactions that do not 
otherwise meet the criteria for a SAE.  
 
6.2 Relationship  
 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by [CONTACT_70723]:  
 
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation): The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is 
suspected.  
• Yes (related): The time course between the administration of study drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (conc omitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
 
The following factors should also be considered:  
 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - The event should occur after 
the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should 
be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - Each report should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any ot her 
disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant medication - The other medications the subject is taking or the treatment 
the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be 
recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known respo nse pattern for this class of study drug - Clinical and/or preclinical data 
may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - The exposure to stress might induce 
adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the 
event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug - The known pharmacologic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug 
should be considered.  
 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 17 6.3 Expectedness  
 
Unexpected adverse event:  An adverse event, which varies in nature, intensity or frequency from 
information on the investigational drug/agent provided in the Investigator’s Brochure, package 
insert or safety  reports. Any adverse event that is not included in the informed consent i s 
considered “unexpected”.  
 
Expected (known) adverse event:  An adverse event, which has been reported in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. An adverse event is considered “expected”, only if it is included in the informed consent 
document as a risk.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1215123] dose of the 
investigational combination (GAX -CI), throughout the study, and will only be followed for [ADDRESS_1215124] an ongoing adverse event related to the study procedures and/or medication(s) 
may continue to be periodically contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the study staff until the event is resolved 
or determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_093].  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1215125] be recorded and described on the appropriate Adverse 
Event  Case Report Form (CRF).  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1215126] Abnormalities  
 
Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will be recorded as pre -treatment 
signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, all grade 3 and 4 clinical 
laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline will be r eported as 
adverse events. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an 
adverse event only if it is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
 
In addition, the following laboratory abnormalities should also be captur ed on the AE CRF 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 18 page or SAE Reporting Form ( Appendix D) as appropriate:  
 
▪ Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of 
an SAE  
▪ Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have the investigational 
product discontinued or interrupted  
▪ Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific 
corrective therapy  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term would be 
used by [CONTACT_870261] (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
6.4.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All SAEs (including deaths) occurring from the first dose of the study drug through [ADDRESS_1215127] ed on the Adverse Event 
Case Report Form (CRF)  and SAE Reporting Form ( Appendix D).  
 
SAEs will be reported to the Johns Hopkins  Medicine IRB per institutional guidelines .  
 
Adverse events that are serious, unexpected, and assessed by [CONTACT_870262] [ADDRESS_1215128] -marketing departments of the drug manufacturers  (contact [CONTACT_870263]) . 
 
After the initial SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
and provide further information in regards to the subject’s condition.  
 
All AE(s) and SAE(s) will be followed until:  
 
• Resolution  
• The condition stabilizes  
• The event is otherwise explained  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Death  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1215129] be reported as an SAE.  
 
6.4.5  Pregnancy  
 
Sexually active women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective method 
of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is 
minimized.  
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, [ADDRESS_1215130] they may be pregnant 
(e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
 
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a 
study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of the investigationa l 
product exposure, including during at least [ADDRESS_1215131] unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x-rays studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. Follow -up information 
regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome must be 
reported. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks.  
 
6.4.6  Other Safety  Considerations  
 
Any significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not 
these procedures are required by [CONTACT_990], should also be recorded on the appropriate non -
serious AE or SAE page of the CRF.  
 
7. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
 
7.1  Nab-paclitaxel  (Abraxane ) 
 
For complete details on drug administration, storage, clinical pharmacology, and the human 
pharmacokinetics of nab -paclitaxel please see the nab -paclitaxel prescribing information.  
 
Description, Formulation, and Storage  
 
Nab-paclitaxel (albumin -bound form of paclitaxel) a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the 
assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by [CONTACT_374121].  This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 20 the microtubule network that is essential  for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. 
Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and 
multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel is a white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized p owder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion. Each single -use vial contains 
100 mg of paclitaxel (bound to human albumin) and approximately 900 mg of human albumin 
(containing sodium caprylate and  sodium acetyltryptophanate).  Each milliliter (mL) of 
reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel.  Nab-paclitaxel  is free of solvents.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel  should be stored between 2 0 and 25°C ( 68°F -77°F)  in a secure and dry place . 
Retain in the original package to protect from bright light.   Neither freezing nor refrigeration 
adversely affects the stability of the product.  
 
Preparation and Administration  
 
Nab-paclitaxel reconstitut ion, preparation,  and administ ration  should be completed according to 
the manufacturer’s recommendation.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel  may be administered on an outpatient basis. Nab-paclitaxel  should be administered 
on day [ADDRESS_1215132] whole and half -vial size (50 and 100 mg) and 
within 10% of the patient's ordered dose.  
 
Reconstituted nab -paclitaxel in the vial should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 
2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1215133] any unused portion.  
 
The suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used 
immediately but may be stored at am bient temperature (approximately 25ºC) and lighting 
conditions for up to [ADDRESS_1215134] common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) 
in metastatic pancreas cancer patients are neutropenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, nausea , 
alopecia , peripheral edema, diarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, decreased appetite, rash, and dehydration. 
Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving nab-paclitaxel . 
 
Subject Care Implications   
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 21  
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by [CONTACT_097]2C8 and CYP3A4. In the absence of formal 
clinical drug interaction studies, caution should be exercised when administering nab-paclitaxel  
concomitantly with medicines kn own to inhibit (e.g., ketoconazole and other imidazole 
antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and 
nelfinavir) or induce (e.g., rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, efavirenz, and nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) eithe r 
CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1215135] of adverse events and the human pharmacokinetics of Gemcitabine, please see the Gemcitabine 
prescribing informatio n. 
 
Description, Formulation, and Storage  
 
Gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine ) is a pyrimidine antimetabolite, which is an analogue of 
deoxycytidine. It was initially synthesized as a potential antiviral drug but selected for anticancer 
development because of its activity in in-vivo and in vitro tumors. Gemcitabine is approved for the 
treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer and will be obtained commercially. Gemcitabine is 
commercially supplied as a powder for reconstitution in [ADDRESS_1215136] vials containing sterile powder are stored at room temperature (20° to  25°C) (68° to 77°F). 
Gemcitabine  solutions are stable for 24 hours at controlled room temperature of 20° to 25°C (68° 
to 77°F). Do not refrigerate as crystallization can occur.  The diluted solution should be clear and 
colorless to light straw -colored solution  
 
Preparation and Administration  
 
Reconstitute the 200 mg vial with 5 mL 0.9% NaCl and the 1 g vial with 25 mL 0.9%NaCl. The 
resulting solution is approximately 38 mg/mL, bu t the concentration varies. It is suggested that 
when the desired dose is less than the entire vial, the entire volume be drawn up into a syringe in 
order to determine the actual concentration. Then the desired amount should be measured and 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl for infusion. Reconstituted solution should be further diluted in 100 ml NS 
for intravenous infusion.  
 
In this study, Gemcitabine may be administered on an outpatient basis. Gemcitabine should be 
administered on day 1  and 15 for patients in Cohort 1 a nd day 4 and 11  for patients in Cohort 2  of 
each cycle by [CONTACT_162141] 30 minutes  following the nab -paclitaxel infusion. Infusion 
times are approximate and may need  to be adjusted based on patient tolerability.  
 
Toxicities of Gemcitabine  
 
Please see the Gemcitabine prescribing information for more details on the known precautions, 
warnings, and adverse reactions of Gemcitabine. Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function 
as manifested by [CONTACT_796080], thrombocytopenia and anemia, and myelosupp ression is usually the 
dose-limiting toxicity. Subjects should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy. 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 22 Hemolytic -Uremic Syndrome (HUS) has been reported rarely with the use of Gemcitabine. 
Gemcitabine is a Pregnancy Category D drug. Gemcitabine c an cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal malformations (cleft 
palate, incomplete ossification) at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day in mice (about 1/200 the recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Gemcitabi ne is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations (fused 
pulmonary artery, absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in rabbits (about 1/600 the 
recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Embryotoxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_870264], red uced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. There are no studies of 
Gemcitabine in pregnant women. If Gemcitabine is used during pregnancy, or if the subject 
becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine, the subject should be apprised of the potential h azard 
to the fetus.  
 
7.3  Capecitabine  
 
For complete details on drug administration, storage, clinical pharmacology, and the human 
pharmacokinetics of  capecitabine , please see the capecitabine  prescribing information.  
 
Description, Formulation, and Storage  
 
Capecitabine  is a fluoropyrimidinecarbamate  with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally 
administered systemic prodrug of 5’ -deoxy -5-fluorouridine (5’ -DFUR) which is converted to 5 -
fluorouracil. Normal cells, as well as tumor cells metabolize 5 - Fluorouracil into 5 -fluoro -2’-
deoxyuridine monophosp hate (FdUMP) and 5 -fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). Both are 
metabolites that cause cell injury by [CONTACT_51735].  FdUMP and the folate factor, N5 -
10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to inhibit the formation of 
thym idylate. This deficiency of thymidylate causes cell cycle division to halt. This is because 
thymidalate is necessary for thymidine triphosphate production, which is essential for DNA 
synthesis. FUTP works by [CONTACT_870265].  
 
Capecitabine  is supplied as either 150 mg or 500 mg peach to light peach, oblong, film -coated, 
biconvex tablets for oral administration.  
 
Capecitabine  will be pr ovided as an outpatient prescription. Capecitabine  should be stored at 25oC 
(77oF); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) . Keep tightly closed . 
 
Dosing and Administration of Capecitabine  
 
Capecitabine  will be administered on an outpatient basis. Capecitabine  will be given by [CONTACT_870266] [ADDRESS_1215137] common side e ffects of capecitabine 
are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, abdominal pain, upset stomach, constipation, loss of 
appetite, dehydration, hand -and-foot syndrome (palms of the hands or soles of the feet tingle, 
become numb, painful, swollen or red), ra sh, dry, itchy or discolored skin, nail problems, hair loss, 
tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, fever, pain (including chest, back, joint, and muscle 
pain), trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and taste problems.  Capecitabine  is a Pregnancy Category D drug.  Women 
of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment 
with capecitabine . If capecitabine  is used during pregnancy, or if the subject becomes pregnant 
while taking capecitabine , the subject should be apprised of the p otential hazard to the fetus.  
 
7.4 Cisplatin  
 
For complete details on drug administration, storage, clinical pharmacology, and the human 
pharmacokinetics of Cisplatin, please see the Cisplatin prescribing information.  
 
Description, Formulation, and Storage  
 
Cisplatin (cis -diamminedichloroplatinum) is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of 
platinum surrounded by [CONTACT_870267]. 
Cisplatin inhibits DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_490421] - and intra -strand crosslinks. Other  possible 
mechanisms include chelation of DNA and binding to cell membranes  thereby [CONTACT_870268].  
 
Cisplatin Injection is a sterile aqueous solution, available commercially in 50, 100 and 200 mL 
multiple dose vials, e ach mL containing 1 mg of cisplatin and 9 mg sodium chloride in water for 
injection. HCl and/or sodium hydroxide added to adjust pH to 3.[ADDRESS_1215138] vials should be stored at room temperature and be protected from light.  Solutions diluted in

Cisplatin may be administered on an outpatient basis. Cisplatin should be administered on day [ADDRESS_1215139] with 
cisplatin yields a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  
 
Toxicities of Cisplatin  
 
Please see the Cisplatin  prescribing information for more details on the known precautions, 
warnings, and adverse reactions of Cisplatin. Common side effects include myelosuppression, 
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, elevation of BUN and creatinine, hyperuricemia, renal tubular 
damage,  rare cardiac abnormalities, taste alteration, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, anaphylactoid 
and urticarial reactions (acute), rash, fatigue, otoxicity including hearing loss or tinnitus, and loss 
of muscle function.  Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when ad ministered to a pregnant woman. 
Cisplatin is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue 
culture. In mice, cisplatin is teratogenic  and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or

or SN -38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double -strand breaks.  
 
Irinotecan is a sterile, pale yellow, clear, aqueous solution. It is available in t hree single -dose sizes 
in brown glass vials: 2 mL -fill vials contain 40 mg irinotecan hydrochloride , 5 mL -fill vials contain 
100 mg irinotecan hydrochloride , and 15 mL -fill vials contain 300 mg irinotecan hydrochloride . 
Each milliliter of solution contains 20 mg of irinotecan hydrochloride (on the basis of the trihydrate 
salt), 45 mg of sorbitol, NF, and 0.9 mg of lactic acid, USP. The pH of the solution has been 
adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.  
 
Store at controlle d room temperature 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F). Protect from light. It is 
recommended that the vial should remain in the carton until the time of use.  
 
Preparation and Administration  
 
Dilute irinotecan with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (D5W), or 0.9% Sodium C hloride Injection, 
USP, prior to intravenous infusion. The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 
hours at room temperature and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions diluted in 5% dextrose 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 25 Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2° to 8°C, 36° to 46°F), and 
protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours. Refrigeration of admixtures 
using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, is not recommended due to a low and sporadic 
incidence o f visible particulates. Freezing irinotecan  and admixtures of irinotecan  may result in 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_328788].  
 
The irinotecan i njection solution should be used immediately after reconstitution as it contains no 
antibacterial prese rvative.  Irinotecan may be administered on an outpatient basis and should be 
administered on day 1  and 15 for patients in Cohort 1 and day 4 and 11  for patients in Cohort 2  of 
each cycle  by [CONTACT_162141] 30 minutes following the Cisplatin infusion . Infusion 
times are approximate and may need  to be adjusted based on patient tolerability.  
 
Toxicities of Irinotecan  
 
Please see the Irinotecan prescribing information for more details on the known precautions, 
warnings, and adverse reac tions of Irinotecan.  Common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in 
combination therapy clinical  studies are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,  
anorexia, mucositis, neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia),  anemia, 
thrombocy topenia, asthenia, pain, fever, infection, abnormal bilirubin,  alopecia. Common adverse 
reactions (≥30%) observed in single agent therapy clinical  studies are: nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,  anorexia, neutropenia, leukopenia (inc luding 
lymphocytopenia), anemia,  asthenia, fever, body weight decreasing, alopecia.  
 
Subject Care Implications   
 
Irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN -38, are metabolized via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 
isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate -glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), 
respectively . Patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor, 
have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN -38.  Co -administration of 
Irinotecan  with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) or UGT1A1 (e.g., 
atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN -38.  
Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting Irinotecan  therapy.  Do not 
administer strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors with Irinotecan  unless there are no therapeutic 
alternatives.

and with th e second on study follow -up scan.  An optional off study plasma sample may be 
collected. Whole blood will be collected in two 10 milliliter plasma preparation tubes with EDTA 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022

standard laboratory procedures  within one hour of collection .  Using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], plasma will be 
transferred to sterile  15 mL conical tube and stored at -80oC.  Stored  samples will be used to 
measure circulating tumor DNA10. 
 
8.2 Whole Blood  Studies  
 
To assess the baseline characteristic of the subjects enrolled and to correlate these molecular and 
clinicopathologic criteria with treatment response and toxicity , whole blood will be collected in a 
10 milliliter  plasma preparation tube with EDT A (PPT, BD Vacutainer, Franklin Lakes, NJ).   
Within two hours of collection, aliquots of  1 mL of whole blood will be transferred into 2 mL 
tubes and store d at -80oC.  This will be collected at baseline only. 
 
DNA may be extracted from whole blood and used to evaluate for any germline mutations that 
may correlate with response or toxicity.  These may include, but are not limited to FANC GENES, 
PALB2, BRCA1 and BRCA2.   
 
8.3 Tumor Tissue Studies  
 
Tumor tissue specific so matic genetic changes and aberrations in protein expression may be 
explored in archived tumor tissue obtained prior to treatment on this protocol  if blocks or slides 
are readily available.    
 
8.4  Genomic Analysis  
 
Genomic sequencing library construction,  whole genome/exome sequencing, whole transcriptome 
sequencing, microbial sequencing, neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_178518], mutation burden, and bioinformatic 
analysis will be performed either at an on -campus laboratory or at an off -campus sequencing 
service. All the sam ples will be de -identified before sending to any laboratory for sequencing.   The 
FASTQ files, BAM files and VCF files will be generated and analyzed.  
 
Genomic sequencing data will be stored and computations conducted using a JH IT managed 
subscription of Azure.  
 
Clinical analysis    
 
Several CLIA -certified laboratories now offer molecular profiling of cancer  specimens  in 
commercial and  noncommercial settings and provide these results to patients and their physicians 
(e.g. Foundation Medicine, PGDx,  Michigan Center for Translational Pat hology, or JHU CLIA 
Laboratories). It is possible, therefore, that some of our research analyses will be conducted in 
these CLIA -certified environments.  If tissue or cells are evaluated with next generation 
sequencing strategies to provide a molecular pro file of individual cancer specimens in a CLIA -
certified facility, these results will be made available to the patient and their physician.  Patient 
confidentiality will be maintained, and the patient’s identity will not be publicly linked to any 
study resu lts.  Researchers may use the data set generated in the CLIA assay setting to study 
genetic alterations across a large number of genes important in cancer. Germline mutations are 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 27 only identified in punitive cancer genes. Researchers will use the data set f or exploratory research 
to study cancer cell heterogeneity. Some of the sequencing data obtained from the NGS strategies 
will be uploaded to government sponsored databases, such as GEO and dbGAP.   The results of the 
research studies may be published but su bjects will not be identified in any publication.  
 
If a germline alteration of clinical importance (as judged by [CONTACT_737]) to the subject and his 
or her family members is identified by a CLIA -certified test in the course of this analysis, attempts 
will be made in writing to contact [CONTACT_3184]/or family members for genetic counseling 
referral.

J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, [ADDRESS_1215147] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8  weeks. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (R ECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1)11.  Changes in the largest diameter (un idimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1215148] their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle  1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have ha d their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1215149] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_1215150] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_1215151] scan, or >[ADDRESS_1215152] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the 
condition s under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_1215153] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness r ecommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 33 the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericard ial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measu rability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, represent ative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measu red 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases une quivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
10.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 34  
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered  measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the siz e of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1215154] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum siz e for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are man y image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the sca nning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse s equence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followe d 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  
96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Onco l 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_1215155] -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [ JNCI 92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
10.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, [ADDRESS_1215156] sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or mo re 
new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes 
must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:    Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  
Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status c hange, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should 
be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the obje ctive progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

10.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, [ADDRESS_1215158] date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
10.1.6 Progression -Free Sur vival (PFS)  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first documented 
progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
10.1.7 Overall Survival (OS)  
 
OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death.  
 
11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Data Management  
 
All information will be collected on study -specific case report forms (CRFs) by [CONTACT_464]. These 
data will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_079] .  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1215159] weekly and will include the protocol principal investigator, 
study coordinator(s), data manager(s), sub -investigators (as appropriate), collaborators (as 
appropriate), and biostatisticians (as appropriate) involved with the conduct of the protocol. During 
these meetings matters related to the following will be discussed: safety  of protocol participants, 
validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectat ion, characteristics of 
participants, retention of participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), 
data completeness, and progress of data for objectives.  
 
11.3  Monitoring  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for  AE reporting can be found in Section 7.0  
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  
 
The SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for JHU -affiliated 
sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019).  The SMC Subcommittee will 
determine the level of patient safety  risk and level/frequency of monitoring .  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158303].   Data must be reviewed to assure the validity of 
data, as well as, the safety  of the sub jects.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12762], review 
safety  reports, and clinical trial efficacy endpoints, and confirm that the safety  outcomes favor 
continuation of the study.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The phase I portion will evaluate up to 4 dose levels and 2 dosing schedules of the regimen to 
determine the MTD  or recommended dose for Phase 2 . The dose escalation will commence using 
a 3+3 design  within each dosing schedule . The MTD will be defined as the dose level in which 0 
or 1 of 6 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next higher dose having at 
least [ADDRESS_1215160] . A total of 6 – 77 patients 
will be enrolled, and the actual number will vary depending on the number of DLTs.  
 
The phase II portion will evaluate the efficacy of the regimen.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_870254]. A dose level from cohort 1 and /or cohort 2 may be chosen for expansion. 
If both cohorts move  to expansion, patients will be accrued into expansion cohort 2 and expansion 
Cohort 1 alternately. A block of 4 patients will be enrolled in one cohort and the next 4 patients 
into another cohort.   The primary endpoint of the expansion cohorts will be the PFS. The treatment 
regimen would be considered of insufficient activity for further study in these population if the 
PFS at 6 months is 44% or less  (corresponding to median PFS 5.1 months under the assumption 
of exponen tial distribution) , and the minimum required level of efficacy that would warrant further 
study with the proposed regimen is a 65% PFS at 6 months  (corresponding to median PFS 9.7 
months) .  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_1215161] patient is en rolled. A sample size 22 provides 90% power to detect a 6 -month PFS of 
65% compared to the historical rate of 44%, based on a one -sided log -rank test at a 0.1 significance 
level. The calculation assumes an exponential distribution of the PFS time.  To accou nt for 10% 
loss of follow -up, we may enroll  up to  a total of 25 patients  (including the 6 patients from phase 1 
portion) per expansion cohort in phase II portion.  
 
Genomic sequencing library construction, whole genome/exome sequencing, whole transcriptome  
sequencing, microbial sequencing, neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_178518], mutation burden, and bioinformatic 
analysis will be performed either at an on -campus laboratory or at an off -campus sequencing 
service. All the samples will be de -identified before sending to any la boratory for sequencing.  The 
FASTQ files, BAM files and VCF files will be generated and analyzed.  
 
Genomic sequencing data will be stored and computations conducted using a JH IT managed 
subscription of Azure.  
 
Safety  monitoring  
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 39 The study  will be continuously monitored  for adverse events after the dose escalation  phase. If the 
limiting toxicity events appear to be higher than 33%, we will temporarily halt the study pending 
dose modification. Specifically, we will apply a Bayesian toxicity monitoring rule that suspends 
the enrollment if the  posterior probability of risk being larger than 0.3 3 is 70% or higher. The 
monitoring rule uses beta (1.5, 5.5) as prior distribution. This means that our prior guess at the 
proportion of toxicity is 21%,  and there is 90% probability that this proportion is between 3% and 
49%.  Starting from the 1st patient  enrolled in the phase II portion  (after the 6 patients treated at 
phase II dose in phase I portion) , the decision rule for safety  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_870255] s:

Data analysis  
The primary objective of Part 2 (expansion) of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of G AX-CI in 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. PFS is used as a primary outcome of efficacy. PFS is defined 
as the time from the date of initial dose to the date of d isease progression or to death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor 
assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive and progression 
free. PFS will be summari zed by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. Median PFS and 6 -month PFS will be 
estimated from the Kaplan -Meier curve  with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  PFS 
will be compared with the historical data of 44% [ADDRESS_1215163].  
 
The secondary outcomes include toxicity, OR, DCR, and OS . We will characterize toxicity as 
J1847, Version 9.0, April 8, 2022  
 
 
 40 percentage by [CONTACT_479]. DCR is defined as percentage of patients who achieved complete response 
(CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) among all evaluable patients. 95% CIs will be 
computed. OS is defined as the time from the date of initial dose  to death due to any cause. For 
patients who still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the 
patients are known to be alive. OS will be summarized by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
 
As exploratory analysis, the correlation s between baseline characteristics of subjects and treatment 
response and toxicity will be examined using two -sample t -tests or fisher exact test depending on 
the variable type. To evaluate the correlations between tumor tissue specific somatic mutations 
and treatment response and toxicity, fisher exact test will be performed. In addition, regression 
analysis will be used to include other covariates. P -value less than 0.[ADDRESS_1215164] for multiplicity in the hypothesis testing for these 
exploratory analyses.  
 
12.2 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
12.2.1 Evaluation of toxicity  – All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with GAX-CI. 
 
12.2.2 Evaluation of response  – All p atients who start treatment  must be assessed for 
response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if 
they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  
1) complete response, 2) partial respo nse, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 
5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death 
because of other cause  unless accidental , or 8) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).   
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of 
those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis 
of the response rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_1215165] a treatment failure (diseas e progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment 
schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of 
the response rate.   
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible  and treated  patients.  Subanalyses 
may then be performed o n the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for 
whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other 
reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  
However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions 
concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the 
analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be 
provided.

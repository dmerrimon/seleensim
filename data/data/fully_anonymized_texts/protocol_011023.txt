Protocol document date: 11/18/2016     STUDY SUMMARY 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved the outcome for 
patients with high -risk hematologic malignancies. However, many patients do not have a 
matched sibling donor available or are unable to identify an acceptable unrelated donor in a timely manner. Therefore, many of these patients are unable to undergo allogeneic transplantation, which is the preferred or sole curative treatment for their disorder. 
Haploidentical (HAPLO) HSCT, using a mismatched family member, is another transplantation 
option for these patients. While this method of transplantation has proven curative in many patients, there are significant transplant -related issues that require further study.   
Graft -versus -host disease ( GVHD ), infections due to delayed immune reconstitution, regimen-
related toxicity, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLPD), and relapse have been and continue to be barriers to successful haploidentical transplantation, resulting in death or a poor quality of life in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. To reduce the incidence of severe GVHD, patients 
undergoing HAPLO HSCT must receive grafts depleted of T lymphocytes.  In prior studies at our institution, we demonstrated that HAPLO HSCT with CD34+ selected or CD3- depleted 
grafts is feasible, resulting in prompt engraftment with low rates of PTLPD, which has been treatable in the majority of cases.   
In our first clinical trial, HAPSCT, we used a myeloablative total body irradiation
 (TBI) -based 
regimen for children and young adults with high- risk hematologic malignancies undergoing 
HAPLO HSCT.  All participants engrafted promptly and survival rates were promising, but regimen -related toxicity and disease recurrence were significant problems. Immune 
reconstitution was delayed, and viral reactivation occurred commonly.  A concurrent trial (REFSCT) using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for patients undergoing second allogeneic HSCT or with refractory disease, demonstrated prompt engraftment with low rates of severe GVHD and regimen -related toxicity. When compared with the high -risk patients 
undergoing HAPLO HSCT, the refractory group had more rapid immune reconstitution with 
lower rates of viral reactivation.  Based on these observations, our next generation of clinical trials, HAPREF, used a reduced intensity regimen for both patient populations (high- risk and 
second HSCT/refractory) combined with a higher CD3+ graft content.  However, in this latter study intentionally employing grafts with higher CD3+ graft content to increase anti- leukemia 
effects, we observed that the higher CD3+ graft content was associated with higher rates of overall grade II I-IV acute GVHD.  
In this clinical trial, we aim to improve event- free survival by [CONTACT_851541] -
related mortality by [CONTACT_851542] a reduced intensity -
conditioning regimen.  Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16146] a mismatched family member donor graft partially depleted of T lymphocytes using the investigational CliniMACS device and the anti-CD3 antibody, with a limited number of CD3 cells in the graft.  For participants who meet 
the maximum CD3 dose on the fir st day of collection, the second day of collection will be 
depleted of T lymphocytes by [CONTACT_398]34+ selection using an anti -CD34 antibody and the 
CliniMACS system.  This product manipulation will be used to derive an allogeneic graft with an 
acceptable CD3 content and maximal CD34 content from cytokine -mobilized peripheral blood 
stem cell products. A reduced intensity -conditioning regimen without TBI will be employed in 
an effort to reduce regimen -related toxicity and mortality.

trial will define a platform for performing HAPLO HSCT safely so that future studies of posttransplant immunomodulation designed to improve immune reconstitution and to generate anti-leukemia effects can be employed.  Additional goals of this protocol are to estimate the rates 
of acute and chronic GVHD, graft failure, and peri -transplant morbidity and mortal ity in this 
group of research participants.  We will also explore defined biologic markers as predictive 
factors for the development of acute and chronic GVHD in these participants.  Ultimately, this 
study will serve as a foundation on which to build futur e studies of immunomodulation and 
immune reconstitution in the posttransplant setting with the ultimate goal of identifying strategies that significantly decrease disease recurrence, enhance immune reconstitution, and improve overall treatment outcome for patients with high -risk hematologic malignancies 
undergoing HAPLO HSCT.

1.1 Primary objective:

intensity -conditioning regimen.  
1.2 Secondary objectives:  
1.2.1.. To estimate the one -year overall survival (OS) and disease- free survival (DFS) for 
research participants who receive this study treatment.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1183920] 100 days posttransplant. 
1.3 Exploratory objectives: 
1.3.1  To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin -2 receptor  and 
immunologic  state (quantitative lymphocyte  studies, V beta spectratypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], TREC  
assay) to predict the development of acute and chronic GVHD in these  research 
participants.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1183921] an HLA -
identical sibling donor or an appropriate matched unrelated donor (MUD) identified.   
Furthermore, regimen -related toxicity, acute and chronic GVHD, prolonged immuno-
deficiency, and disease recurrence remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality 
among patients who do undergo transplant .  Thus, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_851444] -related 
toxicity, GVHD, and relapse while promoting immune reconstitution may improve 
disease- free su rvival and quality of life, allowing this treatment to be extended to all 
patients who require it.  Nearly all patients have a readily available mismatched family 
member donor. However, T -cell depletion of these grafts, predominantly by [CONTACT_851543], has been necessary for successful transplantation. Even so, severe 
GVHD, infections, and PTLPD are significant problems.    
Preliminary data suggest  that grafts depleted of CD3+ cells engraft promptly in patients 
receiving stem cell grafts from  alternate donors (unrelated or HAPLO family member 
donors). Therefore, for patients lacking a matched sibling or an available unrelated donor, 
the transplant program at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (St. Jude) plans to utilize

lymphocytes.  The graft will be engineered to the target values using the CliniMACS system  to specifically deplete CD3+ T cells using the OKT -[ADDRESS_1183922] 
Many childhood leukemias that cannot be cured with chemotherapy alone can be effectively treated by [CONTACT_389719].
1,2 Moreover , for patients 
with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML), allogeneic HSCT is the only modality of treatment 
that is curative. Several studies have demonstrated that transplantation from a matched 
sibling donor reduces the risk of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 1st or 2nd  remission and in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL) in 2nd 
remission.  However, although effective at eradicating disease in this context, improvements in survival are limited by [CONTACT_851544].
3-[ADDRESS_1183923] demonstrated that the procedure is curative in 60 -
80% of patients with CML, 50% of patients with standard or high- risk leukemia (AML or 
ALL in 1st remission), 30% of patients with myelodysplasia, and 20- 30% of patients with 
poor-risk leukemia (AML or ALL in second or subsequent remission, AML or ALL in 
relapse and secondary leukemia).10,12,15-17, These data have been corroborated by [CONTACT_851545]. Jude, with standard- risk recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851445] 81% 2- year disease-
free survival (DFS), and a 30% DFS being observed in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_745013]- risk of relapse.[ADDRESS_1183924] and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs or therapeutic cell, T -cell 
infusions) to enhance the graft vs. lymphoma effect.

30% of patients have a suitable matched sibling donor.
25 HAPLO donors share a 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_851446] -haplotype and possibly additional phenotypic identity on the

phenotypic or genotypic HLA identity or near -identity with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851447] 3

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  by [CONTACT_851546] (NMDP)27However, many 
patients do not have an appropriate unrelated donor identified or formally requested for 
donation in a timely manner.  Thus, HAPLO donors are a viable alternative since these family members are highly motivated, easily accessible, and  readily available for most 
patients.  
Transplantation with unmanipulated alternate donor stem cell grafts result in a significant increase in the incidence of GVHD and graft rejection (a form of host -versus -graft or HvG 
disease) when compared to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s of matched sibling donor grafts, particularly with 
respect to HAPLO grafts. Several factors influence graft rejection including the degree of immunosuppression of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the genetic disparity between donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and the decreasing number s of CD3
+, CD34+, and total nucleated cells/kg in the graft.  In 
contrast, the incidence of GVHD is not only associated with the degree of donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851448], the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s age, increasing number s of CD3
+ cells and decreasing numbers of CD34+ cells.[ADDRESS_1183926] been developed to reduce the incidence of GVHD in the HAPLO 
donor setting.  Because larger numbers of T cells (>3 x 106 CD3+ cells/kg) have resulted in 
grade III -IV acute GVHD with significant morbidity and mortality,[ADDRESS_1183927] resulted in an approximately 26 - 35% disease -free survival in high- risk 
leukemia, with a 16 -39% incidence of grade II -IV GVHD and a 5 -10% non -engraftment 
rate.27,46-48However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_851449], 
there have been no demonstrable differences in outcome by [CONTACT_851547].  Overall, 30 -45% of patients succumb to regimen -related toxicity with an additional 30 -40% 
dying from progressive disease or recurrence.
26-28,46-[ADDRESS_1183928] (HUD, 
MISMUD) demonstrate that outcomes following MUD -HSCT (including both 5/6 and 
6/6 MUD as a single group) are simila r to those from HLA -identical siblings.18 These 
studies were based on the infusion of an allograft depleted of T cells for unrelated donors, primarily utilizing a  CD6/CD8 monoclonal antibody/complement cocktail. We observed 
a significant reduction in the incidence of GVHD- related complications utilizing this 
approach, the incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD being 22% with a 19% incidence of 
chronic. Coincidentally, our graft failure incidence remains quite low (less than 5%) in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851450].

Protocol document date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_1183930] available group of donors: mismatched family members.  Previous efforts to overcome this barrier have focused on the eradication of 
residual host -immunocompetent cells, the probable mediators of rejection. These include 
highly immunosuppres sive chemo -radiotherapy conditioning regimens and/or the in vivo  
administration of ATG or monoclonal antibodies.
56-59However , these approaches increase 
the risk of posttransplant infectious complications.   An alternate strategy is derived from 
studies by [CONTACT_851548], suggesting that increasing numbers of CD34
+ hematopoietic cells may enable the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851453].60These results, coupled with studies in the autologous HSCT setting 
which demonstrate that large numbers of CD34+ cells can be harvested by [CONTACT_851549], suggest a new approach to achieving stable engraftment with a reduced incidence of peri -transplant toxicity.  
2.5.Experience at St. Jude using allogeneic HSCT for patients with high- risk hematologic

Unrelated donor matched at 6/6 HLA loci  86 
Unrelated donor matched at 5/[ADDRESS_1183932]. Jude that children should receive grafts from an HLA -identical sibling when one is a vailable. Eighty -four of these patients 
received HLA -identical sibling grafts during the time period.  For patients lacking a 
matched sibling, a search for a MUD was performed.  During this time period, acceptable unrelated donors were those matched at 5 o r 6 HLA loci.  Of these, 86 and 48 patients 
received a 6/6 and 5/6 unrelated donor graft, respectively.  These patients received a graft depleted of T cells using CD6/CD8 monoclonal antibodies plus complement.  In recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851454] 6 HLA loci, grade 0, I, II, III, and IV acute GVHD  
occurred in 34, 38, 7, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Chronic GVHD was seen in 9 of 86 
evaluable patients.  In patients with lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, the overall survival at one year is 49.2 + 10.1% and 55.7 + 6.3%, respectively, for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] 6/6

For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851455] 5/6 HLA loci, grade 0, I, II, III, and IV acute GVHD 
occurred in 15, 19, 3, 5, and 6 patients, respectively.  Chronic GVHD was seen in 9 of 48

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  MUD transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851456] 6/[ADDRESS_1183933] from HAPLO donors. All patients received the same graft manipulation, conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis as those receiving unrelated 
donor grafts.  Fourteen patients had no acute GVHD, 6 experienced overall acute grade I, 
8 grade II, none with grade III, and 3 with grade IV.  Four of 16 evaluable patients had chronic GVHD.  Of the 8 patients transplanted from donors matched at 3/6 HLA loci, 
only 1 survives.  Of the 8 receiving grafts from donors matched at 4/6 HLA loci, 3 survive.  Of 15 patients transplanted from donors matched at 5/[ADDRESS_1183934] an overall survival of 22.2 + 13.9% at one year posttransplant; those 
with myeloid malignancies have an overall survival of 34.5 + 9.9% at this same one year 
posttransplant time period.    
It is important to note several facts about the patient population undergoing HAPLO HSCT at St. Jude between the years of [ADDRESS_1183935] if their only donor were a HAPLO.  Furthermore, from the donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851457], it 
is evident that this is a selected population with f ewer patients transplanted with donors 
matched at 3 HLA loci and a preponderance of those transplanted matching at 4 or 5 HLA loci.   
2.6 Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation utilizing unmanipulated 
grafts  
Initial studies of allogen eic PBSC transplantation have focused predominantly on matched 
sibling allografts. The first report of allogeneic PBSC transplantation from a matched sibling was published in 1989.
[ADDRESS_1183936] demonstrated a similar outcome to that observed for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ).
61-65However, 
several added benefits appear to be inherent to allogeneic PBSC grafts.  These include more rapid engraftment and immune reconstitution, decreased treatment -related mortality and the 
ability to deliver a larger hematopoietic stem cell dose as measured by [CONTACT_677532]34
+ 
cells/kg infused, when compared to other forms of graft manipulation.66-72 In addition, recent 
data suggests that the number of CD34+ cells infused can be related to both the rate of 
engraftment and peritransplant toxicity.73However, GVHD is a concern with this approach 
   HIFLEX 6 
Revision 6. 1 dated: 12/24/2014               IRB Approval date: 12/06/2016  
Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  with the unmanipulated graft containing a 10- 100 fold higher number of CD3+ cells/kg.  
Although no significant increase in acute GVHD in patients receiving matched sibling donor 
grafts has been observed, an increased incidence of chronic GVHD has been reported in this 
population.68,74,  Final ly, a low number of CD3+ cells in the graft has been identified as the 
most important factor for graft failure following PBSCT in this sibling donor product 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506524].75 
2.7 CD34+ positive selection strategies  
The CD34 antigen, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on a small fraction of bone marrow cells, serves as a surrogate marker for the hematopoietic stem cell.  T his population contains  
cells capable of long -term hematopoietic reconstitution of all hematopoietic lineages.
76-
81Several approaches have been utilized to perform CD34+ selection. Two of thes e 
approaches, the Baxter Isolex and CellPro Ceprate systems, have proven invaluable for CD34
+ cell selection and tumor purging of autologous grafts.81-83However, these 
approaches lack the ability to exclude sufficient T cells to allow graft infusion without further graft manipulation.
84In contrast, the Miltenyi CliniMACS CD34+ selection system 
allows the isolation of CD34+ cells in a single procedure with minimal contamination by 
[CONTACT_242810] T - and B cells.85,86In over 70 grafts prepared for infusion, this has resulted in a 
median CD34+ purity of 97% with a yield of 71%, and an associated 99- 99.9% depletion 
of T cells.85,86In contrast, these results are unattainable with other CD34+ selection 
systems. Thus, the reproducible purification of large numbers of CD34+ cells permits a 
precise titration of the number of CD34+ and CD3+ cells in the graft, allowing the 
infusion of a defined graft in all patients. 
2.8 Preliminary studies of CD34+ based allografts obtained from alternate donors 
Studies of HSCT in the HAPLO setting suggest that remo val of T cells reduces the 
incidence of GVHD significantly.  To date, only small studies utilizing CD34+-selected 
HAPLO grafts have been performed.  However, the results are informative and suggest that this approach may be highly beneficial.  In patients with high -risk leukemia, Aversa 
and colleagues have reported successful long- term engraftment with minimal GVHD 
utilizing CD34
+ enriched grafts, purified utilizing positive (CD34+) and negative (lectin 
agglutination) selection.84A disease- free survival of 30% was reported in this study, with 
a similar incidence of relapse and a 40% incidence of transplant -related mortality.  
The Tuebingen group (Handgretinger and col leagues, Tuebingen, [LOCATION_013]) has focused 
their efforts on optimizing the CliniMACS CD34+ positive selection system. Utilizing 
predominantly HAPLO grafts and megadose cell therapy ( >1 x 107 CD34+ cells/kg) to 
overcome engraftment resistance, they have repor ted similar preliminary results in a 
pediatric population.60,85  They initially studied the utility of h ighly purified grafts 
prepared from PBSC products obtained from HAPLO parental donors in a population of patients with high -risk leukemia who lacked matched sibling or matched unrelated 
donors. Using megadoses of CD34
+ cells (20.7 + 9.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/k g), the 
Tuebingen group observed a low incidence of graft failure (7%), a median time to engraftment of [ADDRESS_1183937] 7 patients treated, the 
subsequent 32 patients received no pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis.  
   HIFLEX 7 
Revision 6. 1 dated: 12/24/2014               IRB Approval date: 12/06/2016  
Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  Graft failure appeared to be related to ATG -containing regimens and in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851458]  1.0 x 107 CD34+ cells/kg. Two of these patients re -engrafted after a second 
infusi on of a higher dose of HAPLO CD34+ cells following the administration of the pan 
T cell antibody OKT3 and methlyprednisolone .  In this cohort, 33% of patients have 
relapsed and 10 patients (25%) have died of regimen- related toxicity. Of these 10 deaths , 
5% were related to veno -occlusive disease (VOD), 18% due to viral and fungal 
infections, and 2.5% due to non- engraftment.  Interestingly, neither this cohort, nor 
subsequent patients reported below have experienced Epstein -Barr virus (EBV ) PTLPD, 
a known complication of T -cell depletion methodologies.  This observation is consistent  
with reports of others that this complication is related, at least in part, to the number of 
mature B cells in the infused graft.  
Between 1995 and 2000, the Tuebingen group provided 48 children and adolescents with HAPLO grafts processed on the CliniMACS system.  Thirty -eight of these patients had 
hematologic malignancies and will be discussed more fully in this section (Rupert Handgretinger, unpublished data).  Of these 38, [ADDRESS_1183938]. Jude.   Diagnoses included ALL (5 in CR1, 4 in CR2, 5 in > CR3), NHL (1 in CR2, 1 in CR3, 2 with persistent disease), AML (1 in CR1, 
1 in CR2, 4 with disease); MDS (4 with disease), and CML (4 chronic phase). No patient developed acute GVHD of greater than grade II and none experienced chronic GVHD.  
Twelve of these patients are alive disease- free. Twelve died of relapse, 4 of infection, 2

Several important facts must be noted with this Tuebingen experience. This patient group was indeed high- risk with the majority having sustained s everal prior relapses or having 
active disease at transplant, particularly in those with myeloid diseases.  All patients for whom allogeneic HSCT was indicated underwent the procedure; no patients were denied HSCT due to lack of a donor.  Furthermore, all patients received HAPLO grafts, with

2.9 Evaluation and treatment of mixed chimerism and graft failure after CD34+-enriched 
allografts  
Mixed chimerism (10% -95% donor engraftment), graft failure (<10% donor engraftment) 
and disease recurrence remain common problems after HSCT. The ability to detect these complications and to treat them effectively is an important goal. Preliminary data suggests that monitoring hematopoietic chimerism in a serial fa shion may provide a guide for 
therapeutic intervention .
87-89For example, in 55 allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , those with complete 
donor chimerism experienced a 67% relapse f ree survival rate.  Of these 55, those with 
increasing donor chimerism experienced 100% survival while recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851460] a 10% survival rate.

4 to 1 x 105 CD3+/kg.  These infusions were performed once in 9 
patients, twice in 7, three times in 4 and four times in 1 patient.  Five patients developed grade I -II acute GVHD; only 1 patient developed grade IV disease. Chronic GVHD was 
induced in 1 patient. It is important  to note that the incidence of GVHD was related to T 
cell dose, with those receiving less than 3 x 10
4 CD3+ cells/kg being less likely to 
experience this complication.  
This preliminary experience suggests that the related complication, graft failure, may respond to immunosuppressive reconditioning regimens and infusion of a second CD34

enriched allograft. Of 9 pediatric stem cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851462]34+ 
grafts, 3 did not engraft and 6 rejected their graft after 21 days.  The 4 patients r eceiving 
grafts from an unrelated donor were reconditioned with fludarabine (40 mg/m2/day for 5 
days), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/dose) for 1 day and ATG.  The 5 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851463] (20 mg/kg/day for 4 days) and

92,[ADDRESS_1183944]. Jude has used CD6/CD8 monoclonal antibodies with complement to deplete T lymphocytes from HAPLO and MUD bone marrow grafts.  This result is a graft with a median of 5 x 10
5 T cell s/kg. This antibody is no longer 
available from the manufacturer.  Additionally, antibody -complement depletion 
methodologies do not adequately deplete peripheral blood stem cell grafts (which have a log more T cells than bone marrow) to achieve this target  number of CD3 cells.  
Therefore, we have chosen OKT3 (Orthoclone, Muronomab- CD3), a murine monoclonal 
antibody comprising a purified IgG immunoglobulin that recognizes the CD3 antigen, as a new agent for T -cell depletion by [CONTACT_257481].  We feel that OKT3 is an ideal 
agent for T- cell depletion since it is an antibody with a narrow specificity and can be used 
with either peripheral blood or bone marrow grafts.
[ADDRESS_1183945] used OKT3 for ex vivo  T-cell depletion of mismatched family 
member bone marrow grafts. 48,94 Thirty -one patients were treated in this study with 
donor grafts containing a median of 1.06 x 108 nucleated cells/kg (range, 0.32 -3.21 x 108 
nucleated cells/kg) and 4.27 x 104 CD3+ cells/kg (range, 0.61 -75.5 x 104 CD3+cells/kg).  
The median  log T -cell depletion was 2.48 (range, 1.44- 3.15). The study population also 
included an additional 35 patients receiving grafts T -cell depleted with T10B9 
methodology.  For the entire patient group, the estimated probability of engraftment was 0.96.  Acut e GVHD grade II -IV was observed in 24% and acute grade III -IV in 10%. The 
estimated probability of acute GVHD was not affected by [CONTACT_851550]. The DFS 
at 3 years was 26% and the estimated probability of relapse at 3 years was 41%.  
OKT3 methodology has been used in published studies for the ex vivo  T-cell depletion of 
grafts from mismatched family members. Furthermore, [CONTACT_851586] has used this 
technology in Tuebingen in the mid- 1990s. At that time, only the OKT3 
antibody/microbead conjugates were available and he used his own magnetic system (not the CliniMACS device) for the depletion.  In 3 patients, bone marrow from unrelated donors was depleted.  The log depletion was higher than with PBSC, since the starting number of T cells in bone marro w is lower.  A median log depletion of 4 was achieved.  
All 3 patients engrafted an ANC of 1000/mm
3 at 13, 14, and 16 days.  No acute or 
chronic GVHD  was observed in the absence of GVHD prophylaxis. Two of the patients 
currently survive and are in remission; 1 patient has since relapsed.

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  A problem of the OKT3 depletion methodology is that these grafts contain more B -
lymphocytes than those grafts obtained by [CONTACT_398]34+ positive selection.  EBV -PTLPD, 
which is a potentially life -threatening complication, occurs when EBV, latent in B - cells, 
reactivates.  
In this HIFLEX trial, we plan to T -cell deplete hematopoietic stem cell grafts from 
HAPLO donors using the CliniMACS system with the anti- CD3 antibody OKT3 labeled 
to magnetic microbeads. Mononuclear cells from mobilized peripheral blood (or 
alternatively bone marrow) from HAPLO donors will be incubated with the CliniMACS T cell CD3 microbeads. The depletion will be performed using the automated CliniMACS device with the ‘Depletion’ software. Our institution has perf ormed 190 CD3 
depletion processes on peripheral blood hematopoietic grafts, with a mean 4.15 log depletion of CD3+ cells.  Post -depletion, the CD3+ content is 0.011%, CD19+ content is 
10.84%, and the percentage CD34 recovery is 71.79.  We have used this me thodology 
regardless of graft source (bone marrow or PBSC).   
To achieve the desired dose of HSC, it is anticipated that the HAPLO donors will undergo two sequential collections by [CONTACT_16166]. In the unusual situation of the target dose of T  cells is reache d from the first CD3+ depleted HSC product, the second product 
will be T -cell depleted using positive selection of CD34+ cells.   
Several approaches have been developed to reduce the incidence of GVHD in the HAPLO 
donor setting.  Because larger numbers of T cells (>3 x 10
6 CD3+ cells/kg) has resulted in 
overall grade III -IV acute GVHD  with significant morbidity and mortality22 many 
investi gators have utilized methods to remove T cells from grafts. These methods of T -cell 
depletion are based predominantly on negative selection strategies.  These include physical methods such as T -cell specific lectins in association with sheep RBC rosetting or 
counterflow elutriation.

studies were based on the infusion of an allograft depleted of T cells for unrelated donors, primarily utilizing a CD6/CD8 monoclonal antibody/complement cocktail.  We observed a significant reduction in the incidence of GVHD- related complications utilizing this

(HAPSCT), we enrolled 27 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379392], distributed between two 
types of T -cell depletion:  positive selection with the CD34 antibody and negative 
selection with OKT3.  Of the [ADDRESS_1183950] died (4 relapse and 8 regime -related toxicities). Six experienced acute 
GVHD, of the six 2 were overall grade III -IV.  Chronic GVHD occurred in 4 participants 
(2 limited, 2 extensive).  In addition, [ADDRESS_1183951] protocol, (Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation utilizing T -Cell Depletion as Therapy for 
Patients with Refractory Hematological Malignancies). From this protocol, we have gained substantial knowledge in respect to both the preparative regimen and the negative graft selection methodology  that is , in part, e mployed in this study.  Research participants 
received fludarabine 200 mg/m
2, melphalan 60- 120 mg/m2 depending on marrow aplasia, 
thiotepa 10 mg/kg, escalating and de -escalating doses of OKT3, and a negatively 
selected, CD3 depleted, mo bilized stem cell graft from a HAPLO donor.  GVHD 
prophylaxis consisted primarily of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). 
Conditioning and GVHD  prophylaxis have been well tolerated by [CONTACT_851551], a population who has been heavily pre -treate d prior to initiation of 
this transplant procedure. The 25 evaluable participants experienced a mean time to 
neutrophil engraftment (ANC greater than 500/mm3) of 10.3 days (range 7 -12 days) and 
platelet engraftment (greater than 20,000/mm3 without transfusion support f or the 
preceding 7 days) of 17.7 days (range 12 - 36 days). Two participants experienced non-
engraftment with 1 having autologous reconstitution and the other requiring the infusion 
of their previous unrelated donor’s stored stem cells.  A total of [ADDRESS_1183952] trial, 14 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851466]/progressive disease. No

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  2003, 16 in 2004, 3 in 2005).  These enrollment data demonstrate that accrual to these 
institutional trials has improved over time.  
Our subsequent trial, HAPREF (Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Utilizing Partial T -Cell Depletion as Immunotherapy for Hematologic Malignancies) was 
then activated in 2006.  In this trial, 5 of 9 research participants enrolled in the high- risk 
group (Group A) developed overall grade III -IV acute GVHD.  At the same time point, 4 
of the 8 research participants  enrolled in the refractory Group B had also developed 
overall grade III -IV acute GVHD. These incidences of GVHD in both groups met the 
specified criterion for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851468].  We concluded that the CD3+ dose used in this st udy was associated with excessive rates of acute GVHD.  
For this reason, we altered the T cell (CD3
+) content of the stem cell graft, as this is 
strongly correlated with GVHD risk.  The CD3+ cell dose was reduced to 1.0 x 105 
CD3+/kg in the high -risk Group A. This specified  CD3+ dose is still higher than the 
median CD3+ graft content in the prior HAPSCT (2 x 104 CD3+/kg) and REFSCT (4 x 
104 CD3+/kg) clinical trials, theoretically allowing a more robust graft-versus- leukemia 
effect in this new trial.   
2.11 Importance of donor selection. 
There are several NK inhibitory receptors that recognize MHC class I molecules.  Some of these receptors (KIRs) recognize specific determinants shared by [CONTACT_851552] I alleles, and are clonally distributed among NK cells.  Therefore, in the NK repertoire, some NK 
cells recognize and are blocked by [CONTACT_851553] I alleles. Consequently, these NK cells can mount alloreactions against an allogeneic target if the target does not express the class I allele that blocks them. Rug geri et al.
97 showed these reactions greatly improve 
outcomes of HAPLO tra nsplantation.  For poor risk AML research participants (mostly ≥ 
3rd complete remission or in relapse), the event free survival at 5 years was 5% if 
transplanted from HAPLO donors unable to mount NK alloreactions, but was 60% if transplanted from donors who do mount NK alloreactions.  A recent study by [CONTACT_851554], recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] T cells that cause rejection, and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851469].
[ADDRESS_1183956] developed from the observation of “hybrid 
resistance”, in which lethally irradiated F [ADDRESS_1183957] parental strain bone marrow 
yet tolerate other parental grafts.99Although the explanation of “hybrid resistance” is still 
debated, there is agreement that it is primarily mediated by [CONTACT_33152].  The authors stated that resting host -derived NK cells were capable of mediating resistance to both 
autologous and allogeneic marrow grafts; in addition, the transfer of activated donor NK cells mediated beneficial effects in allogeneic and syngeneic marrow transplantation.  This observation and the generall y recognized anti -tumor properties of NK cells led to 
exploratory studies to define the activity and manipulate the response of NK cells in transplant HSCT participants.   
The Tuebingen group has reported the use of a low dose regimen of IL -2 posttransplant 
in leukemic research participants with high -risk for relapse. While the NK activity was 
low before starting the IL -2 treatment, a considerable increase could be measured during 
the low dose IL -2 treatment.  After 7 weeks of therapy, the NK activity declined to 
starting levels prior to the IL -2 therapy.

Protocol document date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_1183958]. Since the cytotoxic function of NK cells is regulated via KIRs,103 we are 
especially interested in the expression of these KIRs on the NK cells posttransplant.  
KIRs are receptors for HLA class I antigens and binding of these receptors to their 
corresponding ligands results in inhibition of cytotoxicity and other cell functions. 104 
While the cDNA of a number of KIRs is known, only few can be identified via monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry.  Among the identifying receptors are CD94, CD158a, CD158b and DX9; we plan to analyze this surface expression on CD56+ NK 
cells periodically after HSCT.  
From our institutional HAPSCT, MUDSCT and REFSCT protocols as well as from published data,
105it is known that the first cells to reconstitute the immune system 
posttransplant are donor NK cells. Published studies from our institution show that NK -
cell alloreactivity in haploidentical related donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851470].105,[ADDRESS_1183959] commonly used conditioning regimens include combinations of busulfan and cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide and TBI.  Our approach for this protocol will differ in that it prescribes a reduced regimen including melphalan, fludarabine, thiotepa and Campath -1H.   TBI can increase the risk of acute organ toxicities and is also 
associated with an increased risk of second cancers and long- term complications, 
especially in children.
107-110 Avoidance of TBI may also decrease thymic damage and 
allow more rapid immune reconstitution posttransplant.111The use of busulfan is 
associated with risk for veno- occlusive disease of the liver (VOD).112Cyclophosphamide 
is an effective antileukemic drug that the majority of this patient population has already received in the past without benefit.  Our institutional experience with HSCT using a non-TBI containing regimen for children and young adults with relapsed/refractory 
malignancy indicates that it permits engraftment with an acceptable risk of regimen related toxicity.
[ADDRESS_1183960].  In our institutional regimen of fludarabine, thiotepa , and 
melphal an, we reduced the dose of melphalan by 15% to decrease the gastrointestinal 
side effects.  For those who had not recovered from the toxicities of prior therapy at the

Protocol document date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_1183961], we may further reduce the melphalan dose by 50% to lower the risk of 
unacc eptable toxicity and mortality.    
In the REFSCT trial, using melphalan, fludarabine, and thiotepa, [ADDRESS_1183962] reduced the dose of fludarabine in this trial.     
Lastly, regarding conditioning regimen considerations, T -cell reconstitution, as measured 
by [CONTACT_398]3 quantitation in peripheral blood and based on T -cell recep tor excision circles 
(TREC), was found to be more rapid in the more heavily pre -treated patient  population 
on REFSCT trial than those treated on the HAPSCT trial.
[ADDRESS_1183963] similar to OKT3 are 
ATG and Campath -1H. Campath -1H is chosen for Amendment 3.0 because ATG was 
found to be insufficient for engraftment of haploidentical graft and was associated with 
high risk of transplanted related mortality (TRM). Even in infants in whom megadose s of 
stem cells can be ensured, the rejection rate and TRM was still too high with ATG (1/8 engraftment failure rate and 3/8 TRM in our prior infant haploidentical transplant study – 
INFBMT). Furth ermore, we have previously demonstrated that NK cells were highly 
susceptible to lysis by [CONTACT_93115] , even more so than T cells.
[ADDRESS_1183964] heavily expressed on T cells.  CD34+ cells are largely unaffected by [CONTACT_546619] -1H; thus making it an attractive candidate in bone marrow transplant 
settings.  It has been used successfully in preparative regimens for MS D and MUD HCT, 
and in the doses used, Campath- 1H has shown greater immunosuppressive effects in the 
form of decreased GVHD and delayed immune reconstitution.

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  2.14 Rationale for the measurement  of Campath -1H pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Campath- 1H remain incompletely understood.  Although 
Campath -1H was o riginally developed as a lymphocyte -depleting agent for HSCT, the 
majority of available PK data comes from adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
patients.[ADDRESS_1183966] factor in clearance of Campath seems to be the burden of CD52.(Mould 2007)  As such, Campath seems to have two phases  of 
clearance: an initial rapid clearance when lymphoid tissues are being targeted and depleted, and a subsequent slow clearance when lymphoid tissues have been depleted. The half -life of Campath has been estimated to be as long as 15 to 21 days in this sl ow 
phase.
119  In T cell replete (unmanipulated) HSCT, Campath may remain at therapeutic 
levels as far out as [ADDRESS_1183967].125   Because the haploidentical grafts are heavily 
T cell depleted, the lymphoid burden (and consequently the CD52 burden) is pr edicted to 
be lower for the initial post- transplant period in our patients.  Therefore, we propose to 
monitor Campath levels out to [ADDRESS_1183968] and graft lymphocytes, thereby [CONTACT_851555].  Too much exposure to Campath can delay necessary immune reconstitution and increase infection risk, while too little may increase the risk of both rejection or GvHD.
 
2.15 Minimal residual disease  (MRD) 
Approximately 30 to 40 % of patients ultimately relapse after HSCT, despi[INVESTIGATOR_851471]. Alternative approaches are needed to detect the residual leukemic cells that are below the limits of detection by [CONTACT_851556]. This is clinically important as studies confirm that, at least in CML, posttransplant relapse can be cured by [CONTACT_851557], and the chance of cure is higher when t he patients are still in MRD status.  
By [CONTACT_175712] (PCR) amplification of antigen receptor genes in tandem, investigators at our institution have been able to conduct MRD studies in [ADDRESS_1183969] and chimerism in this large cohort of patients. The

therapeutic interventions. 
2.16 Rationale for decreasing CD3+ graft content 
Due to the unacceptable rate of overall grade III -IV acute GVHD  in the HAPREF trial 
(8/17, 47%) we have decreased the T cell c ontent of the stem cell graft in this study, as 
we believe this was strongly correlated with GVHD risk. The CD3+ dose of 1.5 x 105 
CD3+/kg used in the HAPREF study has been decreased to 1.0 x 105 CD3+/kg.  In [ADDRESS_1183970] protocols (HAPSCT [N = 20], REFSCT [N = 25], and HAPREF [n = 17]), one 
participant  (3%) receiving  a CD3 dose of < 1.5 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg experienced overall 
grade III -IV acute GVHD  compared to 36% of those with a dose > 1.5 x 105 CD3+ 
cells/kg (p=0.0002, Table 1 ).

48 to 72 hours to perform.   
2.18 Predictive factors to identify risk for non-relapse morbidity and mortality 
Non-relapse morbidity and mortality (NRM) is an important cause of transplant failure.  
NRM includes illness and death resulting from infection, acute and chronic GVHD, and 
organ failure not due to the underlying disease. Although HLA disparity is a major factor -identifying patients at risk for GVHD, other non- HLA factors have been 
demonstrated to be important in regimen -related toxicities.  The inflammatory state of the 
patient before, during and shortly after conditioning may establish an environment in the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851474], leading to GVHD or other transplant toxicities.
[ADDRESS_1183973] been performed in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851475]; near ly all studies have been done in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16483]-T- cell depleted grafts. For 
example, in animal studies, elevated tumor necrosis factor levels at day +[ADDRESS_1183974] is complicated by [CONTACT_112800] T -cell depletion of grafts due to the 
unacceptably high rates of severe acut e GVHD when non-T- cell depleted products are 
used.  However, this graft processing may lead to graft failure and delayed immune reconstitution.  Our institutional experience suggests that a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen that omits total body irrad iation and ATG may lead to a more rapid immune 
reconstitution and fewer infectious complications.  Furthermore, a reduction in the CD3+ content of the graft will still allow engraftment, with more immunotherapeutic cells (monocytes, natural killer cells) b eing infused in the graft, potentially resulting in a graft -
versus- malignancy effect and providing cells to fight infection, while potentially 
lowering the risk of GVHD observed when grafts of higher CD3
+ content are infused.  
Therefore, in this trial we will employ a reduced intensity -conditioning regimen of 
fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa with a graft depleted of T cells using the anti -CD3 
monoclonal antibody OKT3 on the CliniMACS system.  Conditioning regimens that 
utilize this backbone, while avoiding TBI and ATG, enable a more rapid immune

overall survival using a multimodal approach to reduce GVHD, enhance immune reconstitution, and reduce non- relapse mortality, ultimately establishing a platform on 
which to build posttransplant immunomodulatory strategies.

GENERAL STUDY TREATMENT PLAN SCHEMA 
Day Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851476] -14 Initiate conditioning regimen  
Day -5  Begin 6 days of HSC mobilization. 
Day -1  Undergo day 1of apheresis.  
Day  0  HSC infusion #1 Undergo day 2 of apheresis. Donor stem 
cells from day 1 of apheresis are processed using CliniMACS system.  
Day +1  HSC infusion #[ADDRESS_1183982] blood 
graft will be defined as  a minimum of 90 days from the time of obtaining the patient’s 
HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_851477].  Patients who have no potential cord 
blood or volunteer unrelated donor identified in the registr ies on the initial search will 
proceed to HAPLO transplant providing all inclusion/exclusion criteria met. Those whose 
potential cord product or unrelated donors are completely typed and found not suita ble 
and for whom no other suitable cord product or donors remain on the registr ies list may  
proceed to HAPLO transplant when indicated, even if prior to the [ADDRESS_1183983], donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851478], and donor 
health screen and examination.  
Donor eligibility for stem cell collection will be  determined through the use of the 
guidelines outlined in 21 CFR 1271 and the draft Guidance for Industry: Eligibility 
Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue -Based 
Products (HCT/Ps) .  Potential donors will undergo a screening process which will include at 
least a physical examination, history and testing for relevant communicable diseases.  The 
physical examinations to evaluate donor candidacy will be conducted by a non- transplant 
physician (St. Jude or non- St. Jude). A repeat physical exam is required prior to the boost 
stem cell collection process if there is no change in the health status of the donor and the initial physical exam was conducted greater than [ADDRESS_1183984] stem cell collection pr ocess.   
If a donor is determined to be ineligible, the donor is not automatically excluded.  Part 21 CFR 1271.65 (b)(1)(i) allows for the use of ineligible donors who are first or second degree blood relatives. In this situation, the physician will document the necessity of using the ineligible donor by [CONTACT_1541] a statement of "Urgent Medical Need" as explained in the 21 CFR 1271.3 (u).  The cell therapy products will be labeled as required in 21 CFR 1271.65

4.2 Donor mobilization and donor stem cell graft collections  
A mobilization regimen of granulocyte colony stimulating factor  (G-CSF) will be used to 
obtain a PBSC product from the donor.  The desired target goal will be ≥ 5 - 10 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg, represen ting the total number infused in the transplant infusion 
irrespective of the number of days. This number of cells will be necessary to provide an adequate graft following the various ex vivo  manipulations for prompt reconstitution.  
The donor mobilization guidelines are as follows:  
        
Days  Mobilization regimen  
 1, 2, 3, and 4 G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous. 
        5 and 6  G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous. Apheresis in St. Jude Donor Room.   
It is anticipated that apheresis will be performed for a minimum of two days.  Additional 
days of apheresis will be done at the transplant or apheresis physician’s discretion.  
However, some donors may be able to provide the needed graft stem cell count after only one day of apheresis. If the donor is unwilling or unable to complete the mobilization process or apheresis procedure, a bone marrow product may be used.  The bone marrow product will be processed using the same cell selection methodology on the CliniMACS device.  Every effort will be made to infuse a f resh stem cell product; however, a frozen 
product may be infused when necessary. 
All PBSC products will be collected as per American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) guidelines. Donors will be monitored during the time period of the mobilization and apheresis procedure with appropriate laboratory evaluation (see Appendix D ).   
4.[ADDRESS_1183986] in the Human Applications Laboratory (HAL) in the Department of Therapeutics Production and Quality (TPQ) of St. Jude using established 
Standard Operating Procedures. The hematopoietic stem cell graft product will be T -cell 
depleted using the investigational CliniMACS device and CD3 Microbead reagent (OKT3 antibody conjugated iron- dextran beads) as directed by [CONTACT_3455]

adjusted to an appropriate cell concentration for incubation with the CliniMACS CD3 Microbead reagent in the manufacturer provided media.  The cells will be washed to remove unbound microbeads.  The cells will be applied to the CliniMACS device and the depletion will be performed using the "Depletion 2.1" software as described by [CONTACT_3455].  After depletion is complete, the cells will be washed and resuspended in an infusion grade solution.  The graft product will be enumerated and assessed for vi able

product will be infused fresh after completion of release testing and evaluation.   
Under the unusual situation that the target number of CD3+ cells is reached on the firs t 
day of T -cell depletion, then the graft collected on subsequent days will be processed 
using CD34+ selection on the CliniMACS device. In rare circumstances, the product may 
be cryopreserved for later infusion to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The processing of the graft  on the 
CliniMACS for CD34+ selection is similar to the processing steps for CD3+ depletion. In this case, the cells are positively selected with the “CD34 Enrichment” program on the CliniMACS after labeling with CD34 Microbead reagent per manufacturer’s i nstructions. 
Cell dose parameters for the primary HSC  infusion donor graft are as follows.  The cell 
doses noted are defined as the total CD3+ and CD34+ counts contained in the one donor stem cell product, irrespective of the number of infusions/days needed for the product to be administered (meaning that one final donor product is generally divided into [ADDRESS_1183988] cell count). 
• The target HSC dose is 10 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg.  The m inimum cell dose will be 
2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg with a maximum of 100 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.   
• The total T cell dose content in this primary infusion donor product will be < 1.0 
x 105 CD3+ cells/kg and ≥ 0.01 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the total graft will be provided with two sequential T -cell depleted HPC -A cell 
infusions. In rare situations, the minimum T  cell dose may b e achieved by [CONTACT_1121] 
T cells to the final graft product to reach the minimum dose of ≥ 0.01 x 105 CD3+ 
cells/kg.

endotoxin. Culture and endotoxin results are not available before infusion of fresh cell products.  If the gram stain is positive, the research participant/parent and/or guardian will be informed of this event and of the risks of proceeding prior to infusion.  Positive results will be investigated as per the variance procedures of the Human Applications Laboratory. The IRB and FDA will be notified, if at any  time after infusion, cell product 
has been determined to be contaminated or endotoxin results exceed release limits.

4.7 Additional stem cell administration (“stem cell boost”)  
Infusions of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the original donor may be performed for participants when clinically indicated for such conditions as graft failure, graft rejection, 
delayed hematopoietic recover y, or delayed immune reconstitution.  Should the originally 
selected donor be unwilling or unable to donate cells following enrollment, an alternative haploidentical donor will be considered for the purposes of  rescue. The boost will be 
processed on the CliniMACS
TM device using CD3 depletion methodology.  The boost target 
doses will be > 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg with a CD3+ cell/kg dose of ≤ 1.0 x 105 CD3+ 
cells/kg.  These doses represent the total number of cells infused with the boost process, irrespective of the number of days the infusion.   
Research participants for whom a graft processed with  CD3+ depletion may not be 
clinically appropriate, such as in the case of active bronchiolitis obliterans organizing 
pneumonia or active acute GVHD, a graft from the original donor processed on the 
CliniMACSTM device using CD34+ selection will be infused. The boost target dose for 
these participants is >10 x 106 CD34+cells/kg with a CD3+ cell/kg dose of ≤ 5.0 x 104 
CD3+ cells/kg.  
In the event of graft failure or graft rejection, the following regimen will be provided 
prior to infusion of the stem cell boost product  and a separate informed consent will be 
required .  This regimen will be used regardless of the selection methodology used for the 
boost donor product.

We propose to T -cell deplete hematopoietic stem cell grafts from HAPLO donors using 
the CliniMACS system. Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_513203] a CD3 + depleted graft for an 
additional stem cell boost infusion will receive MMF prophylaxis beginning on day –2.  
Research participants who receive ≤ 2. 5 x 10
4 CD3+ cells/kg will have MMF 
discontinued on the last day of stem cell infusion.  In  general, for research participants 
without GVHD, MMF will be discontinued by [CONTACT_137455] + 60. Research 
participants who require an additional stem cell boost using a CD34+ positive selection methodology will not require administration of GVHD proph ylactic medication.  
4.9 Donor Lymphocyte Infusions (DLIs)/therapeutic cell, T cell infusions  
DLIs may be administered from the original HSC donor for decreasing donor chimerism, 
serious viral infections or reactivations, or evidence of recurrent disease ( including MRD or 
frank relapse) . The DLI collected may be collected as a whole blood unit donation or by 
[CONTACT_74886].  If the DLI is collected by [CONTACT_175724], the volume to be collected 
would be approximately [ADDRESS_1183997] no active serious GVHD.  The initial dose will be 2.5 x 10
4 CD3+/kg.  
Subsequent doses may be escalated to 5 x 104 CD3+/kg and then 1 x 105 CD3+/kg if no 
moderate or severe GVHD occurs with the prior DLIs. No prophylactic immunosuppression 
will be administered with the DLI.   The typi[INVESTIGATOR_175641]:

Although this algorithm will be appropriate for a majority, the treating transplant 
attending physician may alter the dose and/or interval of DLI based on response to previous DLI, the severity of the clinical situation, and the condition of the patient.  There is a low threshold for  providing an initial dose of 2.5 x 10

into growing DNA chains as a false base, thus interfering with chain elongation and halting DNA synthesis.  Fludarabine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_851483] a carrier -mediated process.  It is then phosphoryla ted 
intracellularly by [CONTACT_175730].  Approximately 23% of the dose is excreted as the active metabolite in the urine (with dosages of 18-25 mg/m
2/day for 5 days).  Renal clearance appears to become more important at  higher 
doses, with approximately 41- 60% of the dose being excreted as the active metabolite in 
the urine with dosages of 80-260 mg/m2. 
Formulation and Stability:  Fludarabine is supplied in single -dose vials containing [ADDRESS_1183999] vials should be stored under refrigeration.  Each vial can be reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 2 ml of sterile water for injection resulting in a final concentration of 25mg/ml. Because the reconstituted solution contains no antimicrobial preservative, the manufacturer recommends that it should be used within 8 hours of preparation.  The solution should be further diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl prior to administration. 
 Supplier: Commercially available.  
 Toxicity: The major dose -limiting toxicity of fludarabine is myelosuppression.  Nausea 
and vomiting are usually mild.  Side effects reported commonly include anorexia, fever and chills, alopecia and rash.  Neurotoxicity can be manifested by [CONTACT_586372], fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, mental status changes, cortical blindness and coma and is more 
common at high doses.  Neurotoxicity is usually delayed, occurring 21- [ADDRESS_1184000] 
or later course of therapy.  Administration of corticosteroids usually results in resolution of these symptoms. 
Route of Administration: Intravenous.

Source and Pharmacology: Thiotepa is a cell -cycle nonspecific polyfunctional alkylating 
agent.  It reacts with DNA phosphate groups to produce cross -linking of DNA strands 
leading to inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.  Thiotepa is extensively 
metabolized in the liver to metabolites that retain activity, primarily triethylene -
phosphoramide (TEPA).  The main route of elimination is via the urine, mainly as metabolites; the elimination half -life of the thiotepa is 2.5 hours, and that of TEPA is 17.6 
hours. 
Formulation and Stability: Thiotepa is supplied in single -use vials containing [ADDRESS_1184001] vials should be stored 
under refrigeration and protected from light.  Each vial should be reconstituted with 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection to yield a concentration of 10 mg/ml.  Further dilution with sterile water for injection to a concentration of 1 mg/ml yields an isotonic solution; if larger volumes ar e desired for intracavitary, intravenous infusion, or perfusion therapy, 
this solution may then be diluted with 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing solutions.  The 10 mg/ml reconstituted solution is chemically stable when stored in the refrigerator for up to [ADDRESS_1184002] prior to administration since they do not contain a preservative.  Reconstituted solutions should be clear to slightly opaque: the solutions may be filtered through a 0.22 micron filter to 
eliminate haze.  
Supplier:  Commercially available; manufactured by [CONTACT_764768].  
Toxicity: Dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression.  The leukocyte nadir may occur at any time from 10 to >[ADDRESS_1184003] occurred.  Thiotepa is mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic in animals.  Pregnancy category D.

 Source and Pharmacology: Melphalan, a derivative of nitrogen mustard, is a bifunctional alkylating agent.  Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4 -[bis(2 -chloroethyl)amino]-L- phenylalanine, and 
it has a molecular weight  of 305.20.  Melphalan is active against tumor cells that are 
actively dividing or at rest.  Its cytotoxicity is thought to be due to inter -strand cross -
linking with DNA, probably by [CONTACT_46599] N7 position of guanine.  Melphalan is highly protein bound and does not penetrate well into the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. 
Elimination half -life after intravenous administration in adults is approximately 75 
minutes. Elimination appears to be primarily by [CONTACT_175732], but caution should be used in patients wi th renal impairment.  Plasma concentrations of melphalan  after oral 
administration are highly variable, possibly due to incomplete absorption, variable “first pass” hepatic metabolism  or rapid hydrolysis. Area under the plasma concentration- time

The dose should then be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection to a final concentration of not greater than 0.45 mg/ml. The resulting admixture should be infused over a minimum of 15 minutes.  The infusion should be completed within 60 minutes of reconstitution.  Do Not Refrigerate the Reconstituted Melphalan.    
Supplier: Commercially available.  
  Toxicity: Melphalan is cytotoxic an d caution should be used in handling and preparing 
the solution or administering the tablets. Use of gloves is recommended, and if contact [CONTACT_851560], immediately wash thoroughly. Second cancers such as acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, myelo proliferative syndrome, and carcinoma have been 
reported in patients taking melphalan alone or in combination with other chemotherapy or radiation. Melphalan causes suppression of ovarian function in premenopausal women, with a significant number of patien ts having amenorrhea. Testicular suppression 
(reversible and irreversible) has been reported.  The most common adverse reaction is myelosuppression. Irreversible bone marrow failure has been reported. Gastrointestinal side effects reported include nausea/v omiting, diarrhea and oral mucosa ulceration.  
Hepatic toxicity has occurred, including veno- occlusive disease.  Acute hypersensitivity 
reactions occur in about 2.4% of patients, and can include anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity reactions were characterized by  [CONTACT_22815], pruritus, and edema.  Some patients exhibited 
tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea and hypotension that responded to antihistamines and corticosteroids. Other side effects that have been reported include skin ulceration or necrosis at injection s ite, vasculitis, alopecia, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and 
interstitial pneumonitis.

MPA is conjugated in the liver by [CONTACT_851561] (MPAG) that is excreted in the urine and feces.  Time to peak plasma concentration is 0.8 – 1.3 hours, and the mean elimination half -life is 17.9 hours. 
Enterohepatic recirculatio n of MPA contributes to plasma concentrations. Administration 
of cholestyramine interrupts the enterohepatic recirculation and can decrease bioavailability by [CONTACT_45848] 40%.  Patients with renal insufficiency have increased plasma concentrations of MPA an d MPAG.  Acyclovir and ganciclovir may compete 
with MPAG for renal tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs.   
Formulation and Stability: Mycophenolate mofetil is commercially available as 250 mg 
capsules, 500 mg tablets, 200 mg/ml powder for oral suspension, and 500 mg vials of powder for injection.  
Supplier: Hoffmann La [COMPANY_002], Inc.

arthralgias, asthenia, and throat irritation.  
 Route of Administration: Intravenous.  Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.  
 
5.6 Alemtuzumab ( Campath -1H, Campath) 
Source and Pharmacology:  Alemtuzumab is an unconjugated, humanized monoclonal antibody against the CD52 antigen, which is expressed on the surface of B -lymphocytes, 
T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets but not hematopoietic stem cells. It has 
preferential effects in the blood and bone marrow as opposed to the spleen or lymph nodes. Alemtuzumab is associated with profound T-lymphocyte depletion. It mediates the lysis of lymphocytes via complement and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms. Alemtuzumab is associated with the release of tumor necros is factor (TNF), 
interleukin -6, and interferon gamma. 
Formulation and Stability:  Alemtuzumab is available as a clear, colorless, isotonic, sterile phosphate buffered saline solution at 10 mg/ml in [ADDRESS_1184006] 12 months if refrigerated and protected from light. After dilution in NS or 5% dextrose, alemtuzumab is physically and chemically stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours. The manufacturer recommends use within 8 hours of preparation due to absence of a preservative. At co ncentrations above 20 mcg/ml, there was no detectable loss of drug 
associated with IV administration sets. A sterile, low -protein binding, non -fiber releasing 
5 micron filter should be use when removing the medication from the ampule. The medication ampule  should not be shaken. The admixture should be mixed by [CONTACT_851562].  
Toxicity: Infusion related reactions occur in most patients, and commonly include rigors, 
fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, pruritis, dyspnea and hypotension. Also reported are chills, abdominal and back pain, bronchospasm, angioedema, and tachyarrhythmias. These reactions are most common during the first week of treatment, and usually improve with subsequent doses. Other expecte d adverse events are anemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged and profound lymphopenia, and bacterial and opportunistic infections. Also reported are fatigue, hypertension, angina and myocardial infarction, peripheral vasoconstriction, anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, liver function abnormality, DIC, hemolysis, eosinophil disorder, bleeding (GI, gum, ecchymosis), myalgia, arthritis, bone pain, hypotonia, tremor, tumor lysis syndrome, acidosis, dizziness, confusion, somnolence, peripheral neuropath y, cerebral hemorrhage, speech

Dosage and Route of Administration: Alemtuzumab is associated with infusion related reactions, especially with the first dose. The severity of these reactions can be decreased by [CONTACT_851564] 30 minutes prior to infusion, 
and by [CONTACT_108355] a low dose and gradually increasing to the target dose. The dose should be mixed in NS or 5% dextrose at a concentration greater than 20 mcg/ml and administered over 2 hours through a 0.22 micron filter. Alemtuzumab can be administered subcutaneously.  
5.7 Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 
 Source and Pharmacology: Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard derivative.  It acts as 
an alkylating agent that causes cross -linking of DNA strands by [CONTACT_851565], thus interfering with the normal function of DNA. It is cell cycle, phase non -specific. Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed from the GI tract 
with a bioavailability of >75%.   It is a p rodrug that requires activation. It is metabolized 
by [CONTACT_175727] 4- hydroxycyclo -phosphamide, which is in 
equilibrium with aldophosfamide. Aldofosfamide spontaneously splits into nitrogen mustard, which is considered to be the major active metabolite, and acrolein. In addition, 4-hydroxycy- clophosphamide may be enzymatically metabolized to 4-
ketocyclophosphamide and aldophosfamide may be enzymatically metabolized to carboxyphosphamide that is generally considered inactive.  Cyclo phosphamide and its 
metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine.  Dos e adjustments should be made in 
patients  with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min.     
 Formulation and Stability: Cyclophosphamide is available in vials containing 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000mg of lyophilized drug and 75 mg mannitol per 100 mg of cyclophosphamide.  Both forms of the drug can be stored at room temperature. The vials are reconstituted with 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 ml of sterile water for injection, respectively, to yield a f inal concentration of 20 mg/ml.  Reconstituted solutions may be further diluted 
in either 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing solutions.  Diluted solutions are physically stable for 24 hours at room temperature and 6 days if refrigerated, but contain no preservative, so it is recommended that they be used within 24 hours of preparation. 
 Supplier:  Commercially available  
 Toxicity: Dose limiting toxicities of cyclophosphamide includes bone marrow suppression and cardiac toxicity.  Cardiac toxicity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_851486], cardiac necrosis or hemorrhagic myocarditis and can be fatal.  Hemorrhagic cystitis may occur and necessitates withholding therapy. The incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis is related to cyclo -phosphamide dose and duration of therapy. Forced fluid intake 
and/or the administration of mesna decreases the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis.  Other toxicities reported commonly include nausea and vomiting (may be mild to severe depending on dosage), diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, immunosuppression and sterility.  Pulmonary fibrosis, SIADH, anaphylaxis and secondary neoplasms have been reported rarely.

bioavailability is 50%. Upon injection into the blood, mesna is oxidized to mesna disulfide, a totally inert compound.  Following glomerular filtration, mesna disulfide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_851487], the active form of the drug.  Mesna and mesna disulfide are excreted primarily via t he urine. 
 Formulation and Stability: Mesna is available in 2 ml, 4 ml and 100 ml amps containing 100 mg/ml of mesna solution.  The intact vials can be stored at room temperature.  Mesna may be further diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing solutions.  Diluted solutions are physically and chemically stable for at least 24 hours under refrigeration.   
 Supplier:  Commercially available  
 Toxicity:  Mesna is generally well tolerated.  Nausea and vomiting, headache, diarrhea, rash, transient hypotension and allergic reactions have been reported.  Patients may 
complain of a bitter taste in their mouth during administration. Mesna may cause false positive urine dipstick readings for ketones.   
Dosage and Administration: Mesna is generally dosed at approximately 25% of the 
cyclo -phosphamide dose.  It is normally ordered to be given intravenously prior to and 
again at 3, 6 and 9 hours following each dose of cyclophosphamide.

cytotoxicity.  
Formulation and Stability:  G -CSF is supplied in vials containing 300 mcg and 480 mcg 
of G -CSF at a concentration of 300mcg/ml. The intact vials should be stored under 
refrigeration.  The vials can be left out  of refrigeration for 24 hours, but should be 
discarded if left at room temperature for longer periods of time.  G -CSF can be drawn up 
into tuberculin syringes for administration and stored under refrigeration for up to 7 days prior to usage.  G-CSF can be further diluted for intravenous infusion in 5% dextrose.  Do not dilute in saline ---precipi[INVESTIGATOR_314963]. If the final concentration of this product is 
<15 mcg/ml, it is recommended that albumin be added to a final concentration of 2mg/ml (0.2%) to minimize adsorption of the drug to infusion containers and equipment.   
Supplier:  Commercially available.  
Toxicity: G -CSF causes marked leukocytosis.  Adverse reactions reported commonly 
include bone pain, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea, rash, alopecia, fever, anorexia 
and pain or bruising at the injection site.  Allergic reactions, MI, atrial fibrillation, and splenomegaly have been reported rarely. G -CSF is contraindicated in research 
participants with allergy to E. coli  derived products. 
Route of administration: Intravenous or subcutaneous. 
5.11 CliniMACS
TM System using CD3+ depletion 137 
The mechanism of acti on of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic -
activated cell sorting (MACS).  The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products).  These can then be sepa rated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic 
label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.  
The cells to be isolated are specifically labeled with super -paramagnetic particles by [CONTACT_851567]-body directed toward a cell surface antigen.  After magnetic labeling, the cells are 
separated using a high -gradient magnetic separation column as described below.   The 
magnetically labeled cells are retained in the magnetized column while the unlabeled cells flow through the column for colle ction.  The retained cells are eluted by [CONTACT_851568] 35

separate container from the unlabeled cells.  
The super -paramagnetic particles are small in size (about 50 nm in diameter) a nd are 
composed of iron oxide/hydroxide and dextran conjugated to monoclonal antibodies.  These magnetic particles form a stable colloidal solution and do not 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_119755].   The OKT3 antibody used in this system is 
highly spe cific for CD3+ cells. High -gradient MACS technology has been shown to 
achieve rapid and highly specific depletion of large numbers of CD3+ cells from bone marrow, cord blood, and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
The CliniMACS device incorporates  a strong permanent magnet and a separation column 
with a ferromagnetic matrix to separate the cells labeled with the magnetic particles . The 
high-gradient system allows the application of strong magnetic forces and a rapid de -
magnetization. Small ferromag netic structures, such as the column matrix, placed in a 
magnetic field concentrate this homogenous field and thereby [CONTACT_794511]. In their immediate proximity, the ferromagnetic structures generate magnetic forces 10,000- fold greater t han in the absence of those structures  enabling the retention of 
magnetically labeled cells. After removing the column from the magnet, the rapid de -
magnetization of the column matrix allows the release of retained cells.  
The CliniMACS device is comprised  of a computer controlled instrument  incorporating a 
strong permanent magnet, a closed- system sterile tubing set containing columns with a 
coated ferromagnetic matrix and a paramagnetic, cell specific, labeling reagent.  The 
instrument will separate the cells in a fully automated process yielding a cell population highly depleted of CD3+ cells. The CliniMACS device is not licensed by [CONTACT_851569].  
5.12 CliniMACS
TM System for CD34+ positive selection 138 
The CliniMACS device has separate programs that allow cell selection procedures optimized for either a depletion (e.g. CD3 depletion) or a selection of a target cell 
population (e.g. CD34+ cells). The basic mechanism is the same for either application; target cells are "tagged" with super -paramagnetic particles and eventually separated from 
the unlabeled cells using the CliniM ACS device as described above. The desired target 
cells can either be infused or discarded appropriately.  In this protocol, if required, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the original donor will be positively selected with the CliniMACS and used as the graft.

Protocol document date: 11/18/2016  with refractory disea se or who required second (or subsequent) allogeneic HSCT to receive a 
reduced intensity conditioning regimen of melphalan, fludarabine and thiotepa .  MMF was 
used as the GVHD prophylaxis.  Following the completion of both trials and the analysis of 
data revealed that the research participants treated on REFSCT has a more rapid immune 
reconstitution, a lower rate of viral reactivation and a lower regimen -related toxicity as 
compared to those on HAPSCT.  Both trials had low rates of overall grade III -IV acut e 
GVHD.  
Because of the promising results of REFSCT, a trial (HAPREF) was initiated to treat both 
groups of research participants.  These participants with hematological malignancies were treated on two strata: Arm A -high-risk (“like HAPSCT”), and Arm B -refractory and/or 
second (or subsequent) transplant (“like REFSCT”). All participants received a non- TBI 
based less intensive conditioning regimen, the same GVHD prophylaxis but a higher CD3+ 
cell dose in the graft (the primary transplant infusion donor product) with the expectation that it would significantly reduce the relapse rate.  However, most likely, this higher T cell dose resulted in significantly higher grade III -IV acute GVHD  in both strata and the protocol was 
closed after reaching the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
Thus, in proposing a new trial for the high -risk patient population (i.e. those treated on 
HAPSCT and those in Arm A of the HAPREF protocol), a major change from HAPREF protocol has been made to reduce the total T cell dose in this primary donor graft product 
from 1.5 x 10
5 to a total dose of ≤  1.0 x 105 cells/kg.  The justification for the choice of this T 
cell dose is based on the analysis of previous protocols.  We analyzed the data of the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851505] T trial (N = 20), all participants 
in the REFSCT (N = 25) and HAPREF studies (N = 17 total for both arms) to better understand the relationship between total T cell dose in the primary donor product infused and incidence of acute GVHD.  The findings are re ported in the following Table 3:

It is seen from the above table (Table 3) that 1 of the 21 (5%) participants who received a  
total T - cell dose of ≤1.0 x 105 developed grade III -IV overall acute GVHD, whereas 12 of 
the 41 (29%) who received the total T cell dose of  >1.0 x 105 had grade III -IV. This was

Protocol document date: 11/18/[ADDRESS_1184030] p -value, based on binomial distribution, of .0445.  However, a lower 
rate of occurrence of grade III -IV acute GVHD would be suggestive of a higher relapse rate 
and it was seen that relapse rate was 7/21 (33%) and 14/41(34%) in the two T cells groups.  
The exact p -value of 1.0 suggests that there is no significant difference in the incidence of 
relapse between those who received a lower T cell dose and those who received a higher T cell dose.  In addition, the p- value for the incidence of graft failure and the need for DLIs for 
the two groups do not appear  to be significantly different with p -values of 0.5987 and 0.25, 
respectively. Thus, in this new protocol with the modifications suggested (for details see Section 4.0) it is expected that the overall grade III -IV acute GVHD  rate would be 
significantly red uced.  Further, with the use of non- TBI based and less myeloablative 
conditioning, we expect to reduce regimen -related toxicity, have faster immune 
reconstitution and also have a lower infection rate. Thus, with this approach we expect to significantly imp rove the outcome in terms of event free survival ( EFS) in transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_851507].  
A similar analysis for the research participants with these high -risk hematologic 
malignancies treated in Arm A of HAPREF (N = 9) and those who received negativ ely 
depleted graft on the HAPSCT (N = 20) suggested similar findings as depi[INVESTIGATOR_380871]:

It is seen from the above table that 1 out of 11 patients (9%) who received a total T cell dose 
of ≤1.0 x 105 cells/kg  developed grade III -IV overall acute GVHD, whereas 6 of the 18 
(33%) who received the total T cell dose of > 1.0 x 105 cells/kg  had grade III -IV. This was 
not statistically significant with an exact p -value, based on binomial distribution, of 0.[ADDRESS_1184031] more GVHD. Also, the relapse rate was 2/11 (18%) and 4/18 (22%) i n the two T cells 
groups. There does not appear to any statistically significant difference in the incidence of relapse, incidence of graft failure or need for DLIs with exact p -values of 1.0 for all 3 
comparisons. Because of the small sample sizes the res ults should be interpreted with

received a total T cell dose of ≤ [ADDRESS_1184032] that administering a total T cell dose of ≤1 x 10

Further, focusing only on these [ADDRESS_1184033] and Arm A of HAPREF, it is seen that one -

Furthermore, since the HAPREF protocol was closed prema turely, it makes sense to assess 
the effectiveness of the proposed treatment plan by [CONTACT_851574] (EFS) of this

approach would be to use the methods for analyzing survival data and propose the sample size based on comparing the EFS of the current protocol to the historical control group (HAPSCT).  However, there is no good way to incorporate interim analysis to monitor for inferior EFS on the current protocol.  
It may further be noted that on HAPSCT protocol there was no research participant censored 
within one -year of follow -up.  Thus, with no censoring expected during one -year time period 
we can approximate the EFS at one -year using a Binomial distribution. That is, each research 
participant will be followed for one -year and will be counted as a success if the research 
participant survived without any  events (death due to any  cause or relapse).  Denote by P the 
proportion of participants surviving at one -year without these events mentioned. Then using 
a more flexible phase II design such as the one proposed by [CONTACT_851575], we can assess if 
the proportion of participants surviving is in the desired range and if a larger clinical trial is warranted to validate the findings.
[ADDRESS_1184038] protocol to be 
roughly 40%, we would like to see if that proportion could be improved to 60%, i.e. an increase of 20%. Then using the optimal flexible phase II design proposed by [CONTACT_851576] 20%, with 80%  power and type I error control at level α=.05, 
we would enroll [ADDRESS_1184039] phase and 44 - 51 in the second.

Because Amendment 3.0 includes a substantial change in conditioning (with the replacement 
of OKT3  by [CONTACT_546619] -1H), we will restart counting of enrollment beginning from the first

be reported separately .  The enrollment goal remains the same for this new cohort of patients 
as originally written, as does the statistical design.  
The flexible stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851510] :

From the above Table 7 it is clear that the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851511] a range of 12 - 19 and stop the trial if the number 
of participants surviving without any event is fewer than those listed in the table. For example, if at any point we see seven or more (≥ 7 ) relapses and/or deaths  within  one- year in

In addition, we will closely monitor for acute GVHD  and TRM (Transplant Related 
Mortality as defined as death while in remissio n) for at least [ADDRESS_1184041] 100 days, as this was considered to be 
rare.  However, after amen dment 3.0 substituted Campath for OKT3 (due to OKT3 being no 
longer available), it became clear after the first [ADDRESS_1184042] 14 patients evaluable at day 100 had developed Grade 
III-IV GV HD – and all of them had received multiple escalating DLI for post -transplant 
complications (see Section 4.9).  Importantly, the use of DLI as described in this protocol has 
been largely successful (manuscript in preparation).  So, continued use of DLI rem ains 
integral therapy on this protocol.  Therefore with amendment 6.0, the toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851512] (including DLI).  Although the [ADDRESS_1184043] cell therapy (including any stem cell 
boost and/or DLI) will count towards the GVHD stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].

However, these are justified on the basis of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851519] a rate of acute grade III -IV GVHD or TRM higher than 20%.  Also, the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_851520]’s evaluation.   
However, in estimating the incidence of overall grade III -IV acute GVHD or TRM, the 
estimates may be biased, as there are competing risks such as death due to causes other than acute GVHD or the transplant .  Once the study is completed we will use more appropriate 
approaches, e.g. those based on Gray’s approach to estimate the incidence of overall grade 
III-IV acute GVHD and provide confidence intervals.

Secondary Objectives:  
Objective 1.2.[ADDRESS_1184049] an-Meier estimates along with their 
confidence intervals will be provided for EFS, OS, and DFS.  The terms EFS, DFS and OS 
are further defined below: LFU stands for “last follow-up date.” 
EFS = min(LFU, date of relapse, date of death due to any cause)  - da te of transplant and all 
participants surviving at the time of analysis would be considered as censored. 
DFS = min(LFU, date of relapse, date of death due to relapse)  - date of transplant and all 
participants surviving at the time of analysis and those who die due to other causes will be 
censored at the time of their event.  
OS = min(LFU, date of death) – date of transplant and all patients surviving at the time of 
analysis will be considered as censored.   
A historical comparison with the HAPSCT protocol will also be undertaken to see if the 
outcome on the current therapy has improved.  Further a Cox’s proportional hazards model will be used to assess the affect of several characteristics of the graft and disease status on the outcome measures such as EFS, DFS and OS.
141 
Objective 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.  The estimates of cumulative incidence of relapse, acute and 
chronic GVHD will be estimated using Prentice’s approach and compared with the historical 
HAPSCT data using the approaches proposed in Gray and Fine and Gray.140, 142,143,[ADDRESS_1184050] eligibility (donor and transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), potential participan ts will be registered by [CONTACT_851578] 51

Notes:  
• Liver GVHD is downgraded one stage if an additional cause(s) of an elevated bilirubin is 
documented.  
• Gut GVHD  is downgraded one stage if additional cause(s) of increased diarrhea/loose stool 
volume is documented.  
• Specified stool volumes noted for gut GVHD applies to adult range body weights.  For 
pediatric patients, the volume of stool should generally be based on body surface area.   
• Stool/urine mixture cannot be considered total stool volume. Stool volume needs to be 
unmixed stool without urine volume factored into volume total.  
• Abdominal pains secondary to other etiologies need to be ruled out or factored into abdominal GVHD assessments accordingly.

Research Study Evaluation Target Windows  
Several laboratory tests can only be processed on weekdays; therefore, if the scheduled 
evaluation falls on a weekend, or during a holiday period, an adjustment in the follow -up visit is 
expected and would not be noted as a protocol variation.  Additionally, in order to accommodate 
such logistic al constraints, evaluation/collection dates of all protocol assessments  (required and 
optional research), may be performed within a reasonable window of the intended date  following 
the guidelines provided in the table below:

APPENDIX F 
 
Dose modification and off treatment criteria for Campath -1H toxicity  
 
Recommended pre-medication to be given with Campath- 1H: 
 
First doses should be timed approximately 30 minut es prior to daily Campath -1H dose. 
Diphenhydramine: 1mg/kg IV or PO q 8hr (max dose 50mg) 
Acetaminophen: 10-15mg/kg PO q 6hr (max 4gm/day) Hydrocortisone: 2mg/kg IV q 6 hr (when Campath is given SQ, may use 1mg/kg q 6 hr) Meperidine: 0.5mg/kg IV q 4hr PRN rigors  
 
Modifications in the event of an adverse reaction during test dose administration: 
 
• If the reaction is mild (Grade 1), such that no intervention is required, and the infusion is not interrupted; proceed with subsequent dosing as planned.  Examples of grade 1 
reactions are: Transient flushing, rash, and/or low grade fever that resolve promptly and without intervention. 
• If the reaction requires therapy (such as additional antihistamine or acetaminophen) or a brief interruption of infusion, and responds promptly (Grade 2); proceed with dosing as planned.  Depending on the seriousness of the adverse reaction, consider alteration of premedication (e.g., change steroid to methylprednisolone 2mg/kg q 6hr), and/or a reduction in the planned infusion rate. 
• If the reaction is prolonged (i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or 
brief interruption of infusion) but improves prior to next dose (24hr), recurs following initial improvement but improves prior to next dose, or is serious (i.e. symptomatic bronchospasm, significant hypotension) but improves with intervention (Grade 3); notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_851533]:  At a minimum, increase dose and/or frequency of supportive medications (corticosteroids, antihistamines, acetaminophen), and ensure infusion is begun at a reduced rate.  Depending on the seriousness of the reaction, consider discontinuation of Campath- 1H with substitution of ATG as alternative 
therapy.  
• If the reaction is life threatening (Grade 4), notify the PI, disc ontinue Campath- 1H, and 
use ATG as alternative therapy if possible.  
 
For adverse reactions which occur during/following standard dose administration: 
 
• If the reaction is mild (Grade 1), such that no intervention is required, and the infusion is 
not interrupted; proceed with subsequent dosing as planned.  Examples of grade 1 
reactions are: Transient flushing, rash, or a low grade fever that resolve quickly without 
intervention. 
• If the reaction requires therapy (such as additional antihistamines or acetaminop hen) or a 
brief interruption of infusion, and responds promptly (Grade 2); may proceed with dosing 
as planned.  Consider alteration of premedication (e.g, change to methylprednisolone ), 
and/or a reduction in the planned infusion rate.

• If the reaction is prolonged (i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or 
brief interruption of infusion) but improves prior to next dose (24hr), recurs following initial improvement but improves prior to next dose, or is serious (i.e. symptomatic bronchospas m, significant hypotension) but improves with intervention (Grade 3); notify 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_851533]:  Increase dose and/or reduce interval on supportive medications (corticosteroids, antihistamines, acetaminophen).  Ensure infusion is begun at a reduced rate.  No further dose escalation is permitted, and depending on the 
seriousness of the reaction consider a reduction in subsequent doses.  
• If the reaction is prolonged and does NOT improve with intervention prior to the next scheduled dose (Grade 3), notify the PI, discontinue Campath- 1H, and use ATG as 
alternative therapy if possible.   
• If the reaction is life threatening or requires intensive support (Grade 4), notify the PI, discontinue Campath- 1H, and use ATG as alternative therapy if possible.  May consider 
reduction of subsequent dosing and escalation of supporting medications, ONLY if a lower dose was previously tolerated, AND symptoms resolve entirely prior to next dose, AND no suitable alternative is available.  
  
Substitution of ATG if Campath -1H intolerance:  
 
If the patient received less than 50% of the planned Campath- 1H dose, efforts should be made 
to give ATG in substitute.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_851534] 3mg/kg/day for 3 days. In the event the patient received less th an 50% of the planned Campath dose, and ATG is 
contraindicated, the patient will be removed from study.

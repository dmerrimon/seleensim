Lay Summary
1 * Provide a summary of the background and purpose of the study in language that can be understood by a person without a
medical degree.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_150220], 25%-50% of patients with clots in the deep veins of the arms and legs progress to chronic post-clot problems resulting in significant disability , loss
of productivity, and healthcare costs. Reverse flow in the veins from an organizing clot is the primary cause of post-clot problems. Veins with early clot breakdown have a
lower incidence of reverse flow. We have observed that clot breakdown is enhanced by [CONTACT_509088]. Hence, we predict that a supervised exercise program in patients with deep vein clots could increase leg vein blood flow, accelerate clot breakdown,
and decrease the risk of post clot problems. The primary hypothesis is that increased blood flow across the clot (induced by [CONTACT_509089]) will increase clot
breakdown and decrease severity of post clot problems. The overall purpose is to determine whether a progressive exercise training program can lower the risk of post
clot problems in patients with sudden deep vein clots, and to investigate possible ways by [CONTACT_288694]. W e propose a randomized clinical trial of standard therapy
compared to progressive exercise training in patients with leg deep vein clots.
Aim [ADDRESS_658226] therapy alone (blood thinning medication, compression stockings on the legs, and movement
allowed at will), OR to exercise plus standard therapy. [ADDRESS_658227] clot problems.

If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research. State the hypothesis to be tested:
Standard anti-coagulation therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) reflects the current short term focus on preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT .
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_150220], 25% to 50% of patients with DVT progress to the chronic post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity,
and healthcare costs.
Venous valvular reflux resulting from chronic injury and entrapment by [CONTACT_509090]. Patients with spontaneous early thrombus
resolution have a lower incidence of valvular reflux. We have observed that venous thrombus resolution is enhanced in a mouse model of thrombosis with increased
blood flow, compared to models with reduced flow or no flow. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_509071]. Hence, we postulate that a supervised exercise program in patients with acute DVT  could increase lower extremity venous flow,
accelerate thrombus resolution, and thereby [CONTACT_509091].
The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that increased blood flow across the thrombus (induced by [CONTACT_509089]) will accelerate thrombus resolution and
decrease the prevalence and severity of PTS. However, exercise does have additional physiologic actions that may enhance thrombus resolution. We have found that
exercise increases systemic fibrinolytic activity and circulating endothelial progenitor cells. The overall purpose of this proposal is to determine whether a progressive
exercise training program can lower the risk of PTS in patients with acute DVT , and to investigate possible mechanisms by [CONTACT_288694].
The potential benefit of supervised exercise in preventing PTS has not been systematically studied in patients with acute DVT , perhaps for fear of causing a new DVT or
PE. However, randomized and cohort studies confirm the safety of ambulating patients as early as [ADDRESS_658228] therapy alone (anticoagulation,
compression, ambulation ad-lib) , VERSUS exercise plus standard therapy to determine the following:
Aim [ADDRESS_658229] whether a 3-month exercise program has long-term clinical benefits in acute DVT . The primary outcome measures will be Villalta score for PTS and
VEINS-QOL score (Venous Insufficiency Epi[INVESTIGATOR_509072]-QOL) for venous quality of life at 2 years of follow-up.
Aim 2 will evaluate whether exercise therapy in patients with acute DVT  enhances thrombus resolution through increased fibrinolysis and venous flow . Fibrinolysis (blood
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1] and tissue-type plasminogen activator [t-PA]), post-exercise venous volume flow, and percent change in thrombus volume will be
measured at regular intervals as specified in the schedule of events.
Aim [ADDRESS_658230] whether exercise improves venous hemodynamics (valvular
reflux, and calf muscle pump function) by [CONTACT_509092] (lower extremity muscle strength, flexibility , and aerobic capacity).
Collectively, the proposed studies will define the role of increased blood flow as a novel therapy to accelerate thrombus resolution and prevent PTS. We will also define
the effects of exercise on systemic inflammation, fibrinolytic and vascular repair, calf muscle pump action, and functional ability in patients with venous thrombosis.2 * Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probabilit y of group assignment, potential for subject
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.:
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded trial enrolling [ADDRESS_658231] care alone (anticoagulation, compression,
ambulation ad-lib) or standard care plus a 3 month exercise program. Patients will be followed for 2 years. Patients with acute DVT  will be randomized to their assigned
treatment groups and undergo baseline study evaluations. The Villalta score for PTS and QOL measures will serve as the primary and secondary endpoints respectively.
Testing for venous flow, thrombus resolution, venous hemodynamic function and functional capacity will be performed serially.
3 * Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. Describe any relevant preliminary data:
The continued presence of thrombus within the venous system after acute DVT  is an important risk factor for PTS. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_509073], incomplete clearance of thrombus after acute DVT is common. PTS develops more frequently in DVT patients that have residual venous thrombus (47% vs.
23%, p≤0.01). Conversely, valvular reflux and PTS develop much less frequently in veins with rapid thrombus resolution (26-35% vs. 61-80%, p≤0.005). Disturbed
venous blood flow with attendant low shear rates resulting from venous reflux, outflow obstruction, and/or stasis leads to venous thrombosis. This explains the efficacy of
sequential compression devices (that intermittently increase lower extremity venous flow) in preventing venous thrombosis. W e show a novel finding in that enhancing
venous flow not only prevents thrombus formation, but also enhances thrombus resolution in both animals and humans.
Supervised exercise therapy has not been implemented in patients with acute DVT  perhaps for fear of causing a new DVT or dislodging an unstable thrombus and
causing a PE. In fact, patients with acute DVT were traditionally treated with strict bed rest for the first 5-[ADDRESS_658232] 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
and additional cohort studies confirm that early ambulation after the diagnosis of DVT  does not increase the risk for PE. There may in fact be a reduced risk of PE and an
improvement in leg pain/swelling. In the current (American College of Chest Physicians’  (ACCP) guidelines “early ambulation in preference to initial bed rest” is a Grade
1A recommendation for acute DVT.
Regular exercise activates systemic fibrinolysis cascades while significantly strenuous exercise (e.g. marathon running) generates a procoagulant profile. W e have found
that even a single bout of low-moderate intensity treadmill walking in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease results in increased tP A activity and reduced PAI-[ADDRESS_658233] evaluated whether supervised exercise training prescribed in the acute phase of DVT  will lyse the thrombus, preserve venous
hemodynamics, prevent pump failure and reduce long-term complications in these patients. 4 * Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of the research and how it will add to existing
knowledge:
Chronic sequelae of acute DVT. DVT is traditionally viewed as an acute condition with a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE), followed by a progressively reducing risk
of adverse events over time. Early diagnosis and effective anticoagulation can prevent PE and acute mortality. Anticoagulation does not accelerate thrombus resolution
which can result in chronic sequelae.
A significant proportion of patients with PE have residual organizing thrombus leading to macrovascular obstruction, small-vessel arteriopathy, and vasoconstriction. As
many as 10% of such patients will develop pulmonary artery hypertension with hypoxemia and progressive right heart failure. The only effective treatment for this chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) is thromboendarterectomy , a major operation with high peri-operative mortality (5% to 10%).
Incomplete clearance of thrombus in the lower extremities after acute DVT  is extremely common. Failure of complete resolution can trap venous valves in an organizing
thrombus causing valvular reflux. Residual thrombus may also organize and cause vein wall stricture (obstruction). Reflux or obstruction leads to venous hypertension
and calf muscle pump failure with consequent post thrombotic syndrome (PTS). PTS is characterized by [CONTACT_509093], dermatitis, fibrosis, and skin ulceration. Graduated elastic compression stockings and early ambulation after acute DVT  can reduce the incidence of PTS
and are Grade 1A recommendations by [CONTACT_223769] (ACCP). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_11920], 25% to 50% of patients develop PTS within two
years after symptomatic DVT with as many as 1/3rd progressing to venous ulcers. Since there is no cure for PTS, patients can only be managed with supportive care.
There are over 500,000 patients with PTS in the [LOCATION_002].
Clearly, achieving the “modern” therapeutic goal still does not provide optimal clinical outcomes for a large subset of patients with DVT. The treatment of DVT needs to be
expanded substantially to include the prevention of health and functional impairment caused by [CONTACT_7620]-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There is a clinical need to identify
more effective methods of preventing PTS and its accompanying morbidity, disability, and economic burden. We propose to address this clinical need by [CONTACT_509094] a unique progressive exercise rehabilitation program as an adjuvant to current acute DVT  therapy to prevent PTS and improve QOL. Similar exercise
programs that are widely used in the rehabilitation of cardiac and arterial diseases may be helpful in chronic venous disease, yet have not been systematically evaluated
in acute venous thrombosis. Understanding the efficacy of exercise for reducing PTS and its complications may lead to the incorporation of exercise rehabilitation into
standard care for DVT, significantly improve health and QOL, and have implications in the prevention of CTPH.
How big is the problem? Quality of life (QOL). PTS affects ambulatory ability resulting in severe limitations in daily activities. PTS also leads to venous leg ulcers that are
difficult to treat and often recur. The reduction in QOL is similar to that of patients with chronic heart, lung, or arthritic disease. PTS is the leading predictor of QOL two
years after a DVT epi[INVESTIGATOR_509074]-[ADDRESS_658234] 90% of patients are disabled or unable to
work because of leg symptoms ten or more years after iliofemoral DVT .
Economic impact. PTS imposes a large cost on society from direct health care expenditures, as well as lost productivity . In one study, the annualized median cost for
treating PTS was $20,569, while the additional cost of treating venous ulcers was estimated to be $10,[ADDRESS_658235] of treating PTS exceeded
$300 million per year in the 1990s and is likely now well over $[ADDRESS_658236] of this study. About 350,000 to 600,000 individuals develop DVT every year. If our proposed intervention of supervised exercise therapy reduces the
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_509075] 10% (our anticipated ef fect size with exercise is larger) this will translate into a savings of $58 million/year [(10/100) X
500,000 X 11,667]. Therefore the total cost of the proposed study could be returned in ~[ADDRESS_658237] implications for the management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) and other venous thrombotic conditions.
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that increased flow may be a logical mechanism to exploit for acceleration of thrombus resolution in acute DVT . This proposal will be
the first human application of a standardized exercise training program designed to safely increase venous flow and enhance thrombus resolution. It is also the first
human study to test the hypothesis that accelerated thrombus resolution prevents PTS. The exercise program will be implemented for the first [ADDRESS_658238]
the potential to revolutionize the assessment of acute DVT patients and their risk stratification for future PTS as these innovative protocols are incorporated into clinical
practice.

Study Procedures
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below. (If this study is a collaborative UM/VA
study please list each procedure that is being conducted and the locations where it is being conducted.)
1 * Describe all procedures being performed for research purposes only (these procedures would not be done if individuals were
not in the study) and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safet y or to
minimize risks:
Study Visit Windows:
Baseline visit must occur within 28 days from the diagnosis of the DVT
1 Month visit ± 7 days
3 Month visit ± 14 days (optional visit)
6 Month visit ± 14 days (optional visit)
1 Year visit ± 28 days
2 Year visit ± [ADDRESS_658292] the option of telehealth visits if they are unable to come onsite for follow-up visits.
Telehealth visits will include medical history, questionnaires, and Villalta through VA approved communication platform (Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video
chat, Google Hangouts video, Skype, or WhatsApp). Questionnaires (with no PII or PHI) may be mailed to the participants with pre-stamped/pre-addressed envelopes for
completion at the participant's homes. To better document Villalta testing during a telehealth visit, a photograph/shot will be taken of the affected lower extremity through
the selected communication platform.
Patients choosing to continue to come onsite will complete medical history , questionnaires, Villalta, exercise testing, and ultrasound imaging, described below.
The following study related activities will be preformed/conducted at UMMC:
3D Ultrasound for thrombus volume, vein wall elasticity, and venous flow. The non-invasive test will be performed while lying down with
minimal discomfort using a clinical ultrasound machine.
The following study related activities will be preformed/conducted at V AMHCS:
Questionnaires for Quality of Life (VEINS-QOL & SF-36), post thrombotic syndrome severity (Villalta score). There are no significant
risks to the subjects, except for potential anxiety while answering questions regarding their symptoms and signs. Every ef fort will be
made to ensure patient comfort during the testing.
Blood draw (10 teaspoons) for markers of fibrinolysis, inflammation and angiogenesis. This may be accompanied by [CONTACT_509101], bruising and bleeding. Phlebotomy will be explained carefully and will be conducted according to clinical standard of care
using standard aseptic technique.
Supervised upper and lower body exercise:
Exercise Phase 1 (Day 1 - Day 7/Discharge): After initiation of anticoagulation therapy, we will begin upper body exercise that will last
approximately 7 days of the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509081], if that
is earlier than 7 days.
A) For those patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Subjects will complete [ADDRESS_658293] of three intermittent 30-second bouts of upper body cycling at approximately 5W and 75-85 rpm;
each bout will be followed by a [ADDRESS_658294] period.
B) If the patient is unable to perform upper body ergometry, NMES will be used to induce contraction of the plantar flexors and
dorsi flexors of both lower extremities. The FDA has cleared the device for this purpose. This device is routinely used in clinical care
and has been used in other studies at UMB. Electrodes will be placed over the plantar and dorsi flexors of each leg. The stimulator’s
parameters setting will be adjusted to elicit contraction while maintaining participant comfort. Stimulation will be provided for
approximately 15-30 minutes daily as tolerated by [CONTACT_509102] 2 (Day 7/Discharge–Month 1): Phase 2 will begin immediately after discharge. Subjects will perform aerobic exercise
(supervised treadmill walking) at the VA facility once a week and will walk twice a week at home (for a total
walking exercise of 3 times a week). Participants do not have to come to the V A gym on a weekly basis and can choose to exercise at home only.
If participants choose to exercise at home only, they will be required to walk at least [ADDRESS_658295] a medical event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509082], to refrain from the study exercise program until
they speak with the study team and/or are given medical clearance by [CONTACT_509103].
Training on the treadmill will start at a very low intensity (approximately 40-50% age-predicted
heart-rate [HR]-reserve for 20 min) and progress to approximately 60-70% HR-reserve for [ADDRESS_658296]’s tolerance. Subjects will also begin a supervised flexibilty training program consisting of a stretching regimen
with a focus on improving knee and ankle flexibilty. After each aerobic exercise session subjects will perform 8 lowerbody stretching
exercises ( 1- dorsiflexion, 2- strainght leg plantar flexion, 3 -bent knee plantar flexion, 4- knee flexion, 5- hip extension, 6- hip
abduction, 7- hip adduction, 8- hamstring stretch). Subjects will repeat the same exercise regimen at least [ADDRESS_658297] objective and quantifiable data on compliance to the exercise
program. The research coordinator will track each patient. We will provide subjects with an exercise logbook to maintain, which will be
reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_464]. We will download HR data periodically for review.
If the patient is unable to perform walking exercise, NMES will be used to induce contraction of the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors of
both lower extremities as described above. Participants will be taught how to safely use the device and take the device home to use. If
a participant becomes able to perform walking exercise, he or she will be transitioned to the aerobic exercise described above.
All subjects will also begin a supervised flexibilty training program consisting of a stretching regimen with a focus on improving knee
and ankle flexibilty. After each aerobic exercise session subjects will perform 8 lowerbody stretching exercises ( 1- dorsiflexion, 2-
strainght leg plantar flexion, 3 -bent knee plantar flexion, 4- knee flexion, 5- hip extension, 6- hip abduction, 7- hip adduction, 8-
hamstring stretch). Subjects will repeat the same exercise regimen at least 4 days per week at home.
Exercise Phase 3 (Month 2- Month 3): Subjects will continue their weekly supervised exercise at the V A facility (1 x
30min/week @ approximately 60-70% HR-reserve), but will extend the walking program at home to [ADDRESS_658298] a medical event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_509082], to refrain from the study exercise program until
they speak with the study team and/or are given medical clearance by [CONTACT_509103].
B) If the subject is performing passive (NMES) exercise, they will continue, but will increase the frequency to 5 days per week.
Exercise Testing: Subjects will undergo a [ADDRESS_658299], wherein time to walk 400 meters is measured. Subjects are instructed
to walk as quickly as possible over a flat surface of premeasured distance, while timed by a stop watch. The 400 meter walk is
strongly correlated with peak VO2 and may be a better measure of capacity than specific time to walk tests (Simonsick EM, J Am
Geriatrics Soc 54:127-132) . We will also measure plantar flexion strength using a hand held dynamometer.2 * Describe all procedures already being performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes (if not applicable to the study , enter
"N/A"):
Physical examination for DVT risk factors and venous disease severity assessment
Duplex ultrasound for diagnosis of DVT
Anticoagulation (per treating physician recommendations; not altered by [CONTACT_1758])
Compression stockings3 * Describe the duration of an individual participant's participation in the study:
All enrolled subjects are expected to participate in the study for two years
4 * Describe the amount of time it will take to complete the entire study:
The study will conclude enrollment and follow-up activities by 6.30.2020
5 * Describe any additional participant requirements:
No additional participation requirements.
HP-00049880 Sample Size and Data Analysis_V2
Sample Size and Data Analysis
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Provide the rationale and sample size calculations for the proposed target population:
For the randomized trial, we have calculated sample size based on our primary endpoint to reduce the prevalence of PTS at two years. Our sample size calculations
were performed for a two-tailed type I error rate of ≤5% and ≥80% power . Most publications provide conservative estimates of the prevalence of PTS as most studies
under-report prevalence.The best estimate of prevalence was 25-50%, although several studies reported an even higher prevalence. Our first sample size calculation
assumes a prevalence of 40% in control subjects and 20% in our exercise subjects. To show the reduction in prevalence we will need 164 subjects (82 in each group) in
the randomized segment of the study.
Incorporating patients enrolled in the prior observational EFFOR T protocol, plus anticipated attrition in the randomized trial (from loss to follow-up and deaths) we
anticipate enrolling a total of 260 subjects in the entire EFFOR T proposal.
2* Provide the plan for data analysis. Include in the description the types of comparisons that are planned (e.g., comparison of
means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance, etc.),  which is the primary comparison/analysis, and
how the analyses proposed will relate to the primary purposes of the study:
We will use exploratory data analyses (EDA) to review our data looking for extreme values which will be checked for transcription or other errors. Because our outcome
measures will be measured multiple times (up to seven times, table I), we will use repeat measures ANOVA (SAS procedures PROC MIXED and PROC GLIMMIX) to
compare outcome measures in the standard treatment and exercise groups. Both procedures allow for unbalanced and incomplete data, and will work when subjects are
missing data at some time points. GLIMMIX allows for the selection of a link and response distribution and thus can be used to model counts (Poisson distribution with
log link) or perform a logistic regression for binary outcomes (binomial distribution, logit link). W e will use AICC (a variation of Akaike’s information criterion) to select the
covariance structure (unstructured, compound symmetry, first-order auto regressive) that best accounts for the serial autocorrelation of our repeated measures data. We
will use random effects regression to compare the rate of change in our outcome variables in the standard treatment and exercise groups. Subject and time will be
random effects (i.e. each subject will have his own intercept and slope). We will use regression analyses to compare the rates of change in key outcome variables in
each of the Aims 11, 2 & 3 e.g. volume flow, systemic markers, venous hemodynamics, to the rate of change in the thrombus characteristics (volume, re-canalization
score, elasticity).
We will use multiple imputation to produce estimates that account for missing values. Standard analyses assume that data are missing completely at random. Multiple
imputation provides more efficient estimates for when data are missing completely at random, provides unbiased estimates (standard methods produce biased estimates
in this situation), and provides estimates that are no worse than standard methods with non-ignorable missing data. Analysis results will be presented as point estimates
±95% confidence intervals. Analyses will follow an intent-to-treat paradigm and will be two-tailed. Prior to accepting the results of an analysis, we will check (e.g. examine
residual plots) to make sure the data conform to the assumptions of the statistical method used to analyze the data.

1 * Describe plans for recruitment, including the identification of potential participants (or acquisition of charts/records/samples)
and initial interactions with them: (If this study involves the VA please list all sites at which recruitment will take place.):
Subjects will be recruited from the UMMS Vascular Clinic and the UMMS and VAMHCS Vascular Labs. The UMMS Vascular clinic and the UMMS and VA Vascular Labs
have a substantial referral base and are currently diagnosing approximately 500 such patients per year who could be enrolled in the study . Patients will be identified on
presenting to the clinic leg pain and/or swelling. The Vascular Clinic and Labs receive referrals from multiple sub-specialties such as the Anti-coagulation Clinic and
primary care physicians.
2 * Describe measures that will be implemented to avoid participant coercion or undue influence (if not applicable to the study,
enter "N/A"):
The study purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits will be explained to the patient. Patients who wish to speak with their own physician will be encouraged to do so. They
will be informed that they are at liberty to refuse participation or to withdraw at any time. W ritten informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study .

HP-00049880 Research Related Risk_V2
Research Related Risks
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer box below.
1 * Individually list each research-related risk, using a separate line for each.  Next to each risk, delineate the
likelihood/seriousness of the risk, and the provisions for minimizing the risk:
3D Ultrasound for thrombus volume, vein wall elasticity, and venous flow. The non-invasive test will be performed while lying down with minimal discomfort using a
clinical ultrasound machine.
Questionnaires for Quality of Life (VEINS-QOL & SF-36), post thrombotic syndrome severity (Villalta score). There are no significant risks to the subjects, except for
potential anxiety while answering questions regarding their symptoms and signs. Every ef fort will be made to ensure patient comfort during testing.
Blood draw (10 tea spoons) for markers of fibrinolysis, inflammation and angiogenesis. This will be accompanied by [CONTACT_509105], bruising and
bleeding. Phlebotomy will be explained carefully and will be conducted according to clinical standard of care using standard aseptic technique.
Supervised upper and lower body exercise and exercise testing. The risks for exercise testing and training are minimal, but occasionally include fainting, dizziness, chest
pain, irregular heartbeats or sudden death, and complications related to stress and strain of a muscle, twisted ankles, and/or falls. The American Heart Association
estimates the risk of a heart attack to be very low at about [ADDRESS_658308] immediately after DVT (until the clot becomes stabilized). During this time period we will not have our subjects
exercise their lower extremities. We have our subjects exercise only their upper body, which we have shown increases venous flow to both the upper and lower extremity.
NMES. Risks associated with NMES include skin irritation and muscle soreness. The risk of skin irritation will be minimized by [CONTACT_509106], ensuring that electrodes are properly moistened and applied, and by [CONTACT_509107]. If skin irritation is
present, study staff will advise the participant on how to care for the irritation under [CONTACT_509116]’s supervision. The risk of muscle soreness, either acute or delayed, will be
minimized by [CONTACT_509108]-in the time and intensity of stimulation, starting at a low level and gradually increasing as tolerated. If soreness does occur , participants will be
informed on how to minimize and treat the soreness.
HP-00049880 Potential Benefits_V2
Potential Benefits and Alternatives
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Describe the potential direct benefit(s) to participants:
There may be no guaranteed direct benefit to the patient in the study , although many patients involved in studies of this type feel their care is improved by [CONTACT_509109]-up and examinations as part of the study. However, the study could identify that exercise enhances thrombus resolution and that it prevents PTS. We anticipate
that knowledge gained from this study will provide additional treatment options for patients at risk of PTS to enhance their rate and completeness of recovery . Therefore,
this study could potentially provide highly significant information by [CONTACT_509110], non-invasive testing, and exercise.
2 * Describe the importance of the knowledge expected to result from the study:
This project is intended to provide crucial knowledge about the contribution of enhanced venous flow to accelerating thrombus resolution in the deep venous system.
This could in turn result in reduced incidence and severity of PTS.
3* Describe how the potential risks to participants are reasonable in relationship to the potential benefits:
There are minimal risks associated with this research protocol. There are no invasive interventions planned. With that in mind, all knowledge gained by [CONTACT_509111].
4 * Describe the alternatives to participation in this study. If there are no alternatives, state that participation is voluntary and
the alternative is not to participate. For intervention studies, describe appropriate alternative clinical procedures or courses of
treatment available to subjects.
Participation is voluntary and the alternative is to not participate.
HP-00049880 Withdrawal of Participants_V2
Withdrawal of Participants
If the questions below are not applicable to the research (i.e., chart review), enter "N/A".
1 * Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdr awn from the research without their agreement:
The person in charge of the research study can remove the participant from the research study without their approval. A possible reason for removal is failure to follow
instructions of the research staff or the signed consent form. In addition, if the person in charge decides that the research study is no longer in the participant's best
interest, the participant may be removed. The sponsor can also end the research study early. The study doctor will tell the participant about his/her decision and give
them the chance to ask questions if this were to happen.
2* Describe procedures for orderly termination:
Participants will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_509085]. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_509086] a study participant, that participant will be
contact[CONTACT_509112].
3* Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial withdrawal from
procedures with continued data collection:
Data and samples collected prior to withdrawal (or from continued data collection in the case of partial withdrawal) will be kept in a secured database. Samples are coded
and the key to the code is kept separately in a secured location by [CONTACT_093] .

2/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 2 
Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized as 
follows: 
• Patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
will receive polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide in combination with rituximab 
instead of obinutuzumab (see Section 3.1.3).  The rationale for this change is based 
on the results from the Phase III GOYA study (BO21005) showing that the addition of obinutuzumab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or 
prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy in patient s with previously untreated DLBCL did 
not improve the primary endpoint of progr ession-free survival compared with the 
standard regimen of rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy. 
The background (Sections 1.2 and 1.3), rationale (Sections 1.4 and 3.3), study 
objectives (Section 2), study design (Section 3), eligibility criteria (Section 4.1), and 
statistical plan (Section 6) have been updated accordingly.   
The updated study design includes a dose-escalation phase in R/R DLBCL patients 
to assess the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when combined with 
rituximab (375 mg/m
2) and polatuzumab vedotin at the 1.8-mg/kg dose 
(Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3). 
• Rituximab will be provided by [CONTACT_491848].  
This information has been reflected throughout the protocol in corresponding 
sections.  Rituximab risks have been added (see Section 5.1.2), and the risks of 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844885] (Section 5.1.5).   
• Obinutuzumab exposure data (Section 1.2) have been updated to reflect the most 
up-to-date information on clinical studies based on the latest Obinutuzumab 
Investigator’s Brochure, Version 11 (September 2016). 
• Text regarding polatuzumab vedotin (Section 1.3) has been updated to reflect the 
most up-to-date information on clinical studies, based on the latest Polatuzumab 
Vedotin Investigator’s Brochure, Version 7 (July 2016). 
• Collection of human anti-chimeric antibodies in relation to rituximab has been added 
as immunogenicity objective (Section 2.4, Section 4.5.6, and Appendix 2).  
• Clarification has been made that patients who experience a dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT) during the DLT observation period may continue treatment if determined by 
[CONTACT_844920] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• The definitions of DLT criteria around non-hematologic toxicities have been clarified, 
including exceptions for events that are considered predictable, manageable per 
standard of care, and reversible on the basis of experience with individual study 
medications (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). 
• Enrollment rules into the dose-escalation phase have been updated for patients’ 
safety considerations.  A sequential enrollment instead of a parallel enrollment will be used for each of the 2 dosing groups (i.e., the [ADDRESS_1174059] 48 hours apart; Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
3/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • Inclusion criteria have been clarified for patients with R/R DLBCL who have been 
treated with a chemoimmunotherapy regimen that included an anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody (Section 4.1.1). 
• The pregnancy prevention plan guidelines have been clarified for patients using 
lenalidomide (Section 4.1.1).  
• The period for contraception has been updated to align with each individual 
molecule (Section 4.1.1).  
• The exclusion of patients with Grade 3b follicular lymphoma and a history of 
transformation of indolent disease to DLBCL has been added in order to focus on a 
more homogenous patient population (Section 4.1.2). 
• The exclusion criteria of abnormal laboratory values for calculated creatinine 
clearance has been changed from 60 mL/min to 50 mL/min to allow patients with mild renal insufficiency to be enrolled (Section 4.1.2).   
• The classification of second malignancy has been changed from a selected adverse 
event to an adverse event of special interest in order to more closely monitor this 
adverse event.  The duration of reporting has been extended (Sections 5.3.1 
and 5.6).   
• The adverse event reporting period for Grade 3 and 4 infections has been clarified:   
up to [ADDRESS_1174060] dose of study treatment only for patients receiving obinutuzumab (Section 5.3.1).   
• Guidelines for the second and subsequent infusion of obinutuzumab have been 
clarified (i.e., patients with no infusion-related reaction during prior infusion will 
receive only an analgesic/antipyretic as premedication).  Figure [ADDRESS_1174061] been updated accordingly.  
• Thyroid hormone monitoring (thyroid-s timulating hormone, triiodothyronine, 
thyroxine) has been added at baseline and every 3 months (Section 4.5.6, Appendix 1, and Appendix 2).  
• Recommendations on management of dermatologic toxicities has been updated to 
consider lenalidomide dose reduction or allow resuming current dose in the case of 
a Grade 2 or Grade 3 rash without blistering (Table 19).  
• Reasons for permanent discontinuation of all drugs in the event of certain 
dermatologic toxicities have been updated to align with lenalidomide labeling 
recommendations (Table 19).  
• Populations to be analyzed have been defined (Section 6.2). 
• Interim analysis has been clarified, including specification that enrollment would not 
be stopped in the case of higher-than-expected efficacy (Section 6.10). 
 
Clarifications to the protocol are summarized as follows:   
• The safety objective has been clarified:  RP2D will not be determined for 
polatuzumab vedotin in patients with R/R DLBCL, as it will be a fixed dose 
(Section 2.1). 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
4/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • The secondary efficacy objective has been clarified:   Complete response (CR) at 
end of induction (EOI) on the basis of computed tomography (CT) alone is to be 
determined by [CONTACT_844921] 
(Sections 2.2.2 and 6.6.2). 
• The exploratory efficacy objective has been clarified:   If a patient with DLBCL has a 
positive positron emission tomography ( PET)-CT scan at EOI, then they should 
have PET-CT scan repeated at end of consolidation (Section 2.2.3, Section 6.6.3, 
and footnote ”jj” in Appendix 2). 
• The number of patients in the study has been updated (Sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 
and 6.1). 
• The prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844886] B-cell recovery (Section 4.4.2). 
• Clarification has been made that tumor tissue samples at time of progression are 
only optional if investigator is unable to access the tumor site in order to promote obtaining samples (Section 4.5.6).  
• The Modified Lugano Criteria has been clarified for designation of PET-CT on the 
basis of partial response (PR) to also include requirement of a CR or PR on 
CT-based response criteria (Section 4.5.5; Appendix 5). 
• Post-treatment pregnancy testing time window has been clarified for lenalidomide at 
Days [ADDRESS_1174062] dose of study treatment (footnote ”p” in 
Appendix 1; footnote ”p” in Appendix 2). 
• Time window has been clarified for drawing β
2 microglobiulin and quantitative IgA, 
IgG, and IgM as predose collections on C1D1 (footnote ”m” in Appendix 1; footnote 
”m” in Appendix 2). 
• Timing of when CBC should be monitored has been clarified to every week for first 
8 weeks of lenalidomide treatment (footnote ” m” in Appendix 1; footnote ”m” in 
Appendix 2).  
• Timing of when interim scan should be done has been clarified to within 7 days prior 
to Day 1 of Cycle 3 (footnote ”ff” in Appendix 1; footnote ”dd” in Appendix 2).   
• Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity sampling schedule time windows have been 
clarified (Appendix 3 and Appendix 4).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS   
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 1.2:  BACKGROUND ON OBINUTUZUMAB 
Obinutuzumab is approved for use in combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of 
patients with previously untreated ch ronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).   Obinutuzumab 
is also approved for use in combination with bendamustine followed by [CONTACT_844922] a rituxima b-containing regimen.
  
Obinutuzumab is currently being investigated in a large clinical program, including 
multiple head tohead Phase III studies versus rituximab in indolent B cell lymphoma 
and DLBCL . 
SECTION 1.2.2:  Clinical Studies with Obinutuzumab  
To date,  As of 4 July 2016 , clinical data from [COMPANY_002]-sponsored studies on 
obinutuzumab are available from 13 clinical studies:   8 Phase I or II studies (BO20999, 
BO21003, JO21900, BO21000, GAO4915g, GAO4779g, YP25623, and GAO4768g), 
and 5 Phase III studies (GAO4735g, BO21004 /CLL11, MO28543, BO21223, and 
BO21005).   Available efficacy results from t he non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cohorts 
in these studies and available safety results from all patients are summarized below.  In 
addition, tw o Phase III studies in patients with pr eviously untreated CLL (Study BO21004) 
or rituximab refractory iNHL (Study  GAO4753g) have reached their primary endpoint 
PFS.  Studies  BO21223 (in previously untreated iNHL) and BO21005 (in previously 
untreated DLBCL)  have passed futility analyses on efficacy, are ongoing, and remain 
blinded.    
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Clinical Efficacy of  Obinutuzumab in Patients with B-Cell 
Lymphoma 
In early studies of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (e.g., CHOP, 
bendamustine) in patients with previously unt reated, or R/R B-cell lymphoma (Studies 
BO21000, GAO4915g, and GAO4753g), the proportion of patients with a CR or PR at 
the end of induction (EOI) treatment ranged from 69% to 96%.  The CR rate was higher with combination therapy (35% −39% in previously untreated FL, 39%− 50% in R/R FL, 
and 55% in previously untreated DLBCL) than with monotherapy. 
Phase III Study GAO4753g investigated obin utuzumab plus bend amustine (G-benda) 
compared with bendamustine alone in patients  with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL 
(iNHL; n
 = 396).  Patients in the G-benda arm  who had not experienced disease 
progression at EOI received obinutuzumab monotherapy every 2 months for up to 
2 years.  On the basis of positive result s from this study, demonstrating significant 
improvement in PFS in the G-benda arm, with  a median investigator-assessed PFS of 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
6/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 29 versus 14 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; p < 0.0001; 
Sehn et al. 2015), obinutuzum ab was granted approval for use in patients with FL who 
did not respond to or who progressed during or after treatment with rituximab or a 
rituximab-containing regimen (see Section 1.2).   
Phase III Study BO21223 investigated obi nutuzumab plus chemotherapy (G-benda, 
obinutuzumab plus CVP [G-CVP], obinutuzumab plus CHOP [G-CHOP]) compared 
with rituximab plus chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_844923] (FL cohort, n
 = 1202).  On the 
basis of positive results that demonstrated significant improvement in PFS in the obinutuzumab chemotherapy arm, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study be unblinded to the Sponsor at a pre-planned interim analysis (Marcus et al. 2016). 
Phase III Study BO21005 investigated G-CHOP  compared with rituximab plus CHOP 
(R-CHOP) in patients with previously untre ated DLBCL.  The study did not meet its 
primary endpoint of PFS at final analysis.  Based upon  the BO21005 efficacy results, 
this study protocol is amended to cease eval uating obinutuzumab in patients with R/R 
DLBCL; these patients will receive instead rituximab in combination with polatuzumab 
vedotin and lenalidomide (Vitolo et al. 2016).   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Clinical  Safety of Obinutuzumab 
As of 4 July 2016  To date , an estimated 36363484  patients with B-cell lymphoma 
(including DLBCL, indolent B-cell lymphoma, and CLL) had been treated with 
obinutuzumab given as monotherapy or in combination with CHOP, bendamustine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil, at doses ranging from 50 to 2000 mg.  Overall, the safety of obinutuzumab monotherapy and obinutuzumab combination therapy was manageable. 
SECTION 1.3.2:  Clinical St udies with Polatuzumab Vedotin  
To date, clinical data on polatuzumab vedotin are available from one completed Phase I/Ib study (DCS4968g) one ongoing Phase
 Ib/II study (GO27834), and from one 
ongoing Ib/II study (GO29044) and the ongoing Phase Ib/II Studies GO27834, GO29044, 
GO29833, BO29561, and GO29365  in patients with B-cell lymphoma or CLL .   
DCS4968g evaluated polatu zumab vedotin as a single agent and in combination with 
rituximab in patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma.   
GO27834 is evaluating polatuzu mab vedotin in combination with either obinutuzumab 
or rituximab in patients with R/R FL or DLBCL. GO29044 is evaluating polatu zumab vedotin in combinat ion with rituximab plus 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab plus 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (G-CHP) in patients with newly diagnosed or R/R B-cell lymphoma.   
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
7/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 GO29365 is evaluating polatuzu mab vedotin in combination with bendamustine plus 
rituximab or obinutuzumab in patients with R/R FL or DLBCL.   
Available efficacy and safety results from these studies are summarized in 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  Data  have been generated in these studies 
for patients treated at the 2.4 mg/kg dose; however, further investigation focusing on the 
1.8mg/kg dose is ongoing.  
For more detailed clinical information on polatuzumab vedotin, including clinical pharmacology data, refer to the polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator’s Brochure. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Clinical Efficacy of  Polatuzumab Vedotin in Patients with 
B-Cell Lymphoma 
Polatuzumab vedotin demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent.  In Study DCS4968g, at the 2.4-mg/kg dose, objective responses (CR or PR) were observed in 7 of 16 patients (44%) with R/R indolent B-cell lymphoma (FL, marginal zone lymphoma [MZL], or small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL]) and 14 of 27 patients 
(52%) with R/R DLBCL.  At a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, a PR was observed in 2 of 4 patients 
with DLBCL and in 2 of 2 patients with MCL, and no objective responses were observed in the 5 patients with CLL.  The median duration of response was 6.2 months (95% CI: 3.3, 19.3 months) for the 2.4-mg/kg dose an d 6.6 months (95% CI: 2.3, 11.4 months) 
for the 1.8-mg/kg dose.  At the 2.4-mg/kg dose, median PFS was 7.9 months (95% CI: 3.0, 11.6 months) for patients with indolent B-cell lympho ma and 5.0 months (95% CI: 
2.3, 6.8 months) for patients with DLBCL.  Median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 13.9 months) for patients with DLBC L treated at the 1.8-mg/kg dose. 
No objective responses were observed in patients with CLL at doses of up to 1.8 mg/kg.  
Median PFS at doses of ≥ 1.8 mg/kg was 7.9 months (95%  CI:  3 months , not evaluable 
[NE]) for patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B cell lymphoma (FL, MZL, or SLL) 
and 4.9  months (95% CI:  2.5, 6.7 months) for patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL.  
Polatuzumab vedotin also demonstrated clinical activity when administered in combination with rituximab.  In Study DCS 4968g, at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg, objective 
responses were observed in 7 of 9 patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL, or MCL (78%); 2 of those 7 patients had CRs.  Median duration of response among these patients was 12.3 months (95% CI: 4.3, not estimable [NE]).  Median PFS was 12.5 months (95% CI:  6.9, 17.4 months). 
 Preliminary data show that for patients in Study GO27834 who received polatuzumab 
vedotin (2.4 mg/kg) in combination with rituximab overall responses were observed in 
14 of 20 patients with R/R FL (70%; 9 8
 patients with CRs) and 21 22 of 39 patients with 
R/R DLBCL ( 54 56%;8 6 patients with CRs).  For patients who received polatuzumab 
vedotin (1.8mg/kg) in combination with rituximab, objective responses were observed in 
15 of 20 patients with FL (75%; 6 patients with CRs).   
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
8/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Median duration of response was 12.9 mont hs (95% CI: 6.7, NE) and 13.2 months 
(95% CI: 7.2, 21.2) for pati ents who received polatuzumab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg (FL) or 
2.4 mg/kg (FL or DLBCL), respectively.  At the 2.4 mg/kg dose, median PFS was 
15.1 months (95% CI: 11.8, NE) among the 20 patients with FL and 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, 12.7 months) among the 39 patients with DLBCL.  Among the 20 patients with 
R/RFL treated with 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab, the median PFS was 18.1 months (95% CI: 9.9, NE).   
For patients in Study GO27834 who received polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in 
combination with obinutuzumab, overall responses were observed in 8 of 12 patients 
with R/R FL (67%; 1 patient with CR) and 3 of 15 patients with R/R DLBCL (20%; 0 
patients with CR).   
Preliminary data from  Study GO29044 in patients trea ted with polatuzumab vedotin 
(1.0
−1.8 mg/kg) in combination with R-CHP showed overall responses in 29 of 
31 patients (94%; 24 patients with CRs).  Wh en polatuzumab vedotin (1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg) 
was combined with G-CHP, overall responses were seen in 10 of 12 patients (83%; 
10 patients with CRs).   
Preliminary data f rom GO29365 in FL patients treate d with polatuzumab vedotin 
(1.8 mg/kg) in combination with bendamustine showed overall responses in 7 of 
7 patients (100%; 2 patients with CRs) when combined with rituximab and in 3 of 
4 patients (75%; 1 patient with CR) when combined with obinutuzumab.  Patients with DLBCL treated with polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in combination with bendamustine showed overall responses in 3 of 7 patients (43%; 2 patients with CRs) when combined with rituximab and in 6 of 8 patients (75%; 2 patient with CR) when 
combined with obinutuzumab. 
For patients in Study DCS4968g who received polatuzumab vedotin (2.4 mg/kg) in 
combination with rituximab (all histologies), median PFS was 12.5 months 
(95%  CI: 6.9, 17.3 months).  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Clinical Sa fety of Polatuzumab Vedotin 
Clinical safety data are available from 180 327 patients with B-cell lymphoma or CLL who 
received polatuzumab vedotin as a single  agent (DCS4968g), in  combination with 
rituximab (DCS4968g and GO27834), in combination with obinutuzumab (GO27834), 
in combination with G-CHP or R-CHP (GO29044), or in combination with 
obinutuzumab or rituximab plus bendamusti ne (GO29365).  
86 patients treated with single −agent polatuzumab vedotin (doses ranging from 0.1 to 
2.4 mg/kg) in Study  DCS4968g; 88  patients tr eated with polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg 
and 2.4  mg/kg) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2) in Studies DCS4968g and 
GO27834; and 6  patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin (1.0 and 1.4 mg/kg) in 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
9/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 combination with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, dox orubicin, and prednisone 
(RCHP ) in Study GO29044.  Efficacy data from Study GO29044 are not yet available . 
[…] 
In the dose-escalation phase of Study DCS4968g, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 of 10 DLT-evaluable patients treated with 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin and 1 of 9 DLT-evaluable patients treated with 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab.  Polatuzumab vedoti n at a dose of 
2.4 mg/kg given every 3 weeks (Q3W) was chosen as the recommended Phase II dose 
(RP2D) when administered as a single agent and in combination with rituximab.  Due to 
additional information about the benefit-risk profile of polatuzumab vedotin at the 
2.4 mg/kg dose, the Sponsor is no longer pu rsuing the clinical development of the 2.4-
mg/kg dose of polatuzumab vedotin. 
[…] 
In Study GO29044, Grade 
≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 19 of 40 patients (48%) 
with B-cell lymphoma who received polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in combination 
with G-CHP or R-CHP.  The most frequent events ( ≥ 10% of patients) were fatigue 
(33%), diarrhea (33%), and nausea (30%).  Serious adverse events were reported for 33% of patients in this treatment group. 
In Study GO29365, Grade  
≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 11 of 21 patients (52%) 
with B-cell lymphoma who received polatuzumab vedotin in combination with 
rituximab plus bendamustine and in 17 of 28 patients (61%) who received polatuzumab 
vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine.  The most frequent events (
≥ 10% of patients) were nausea (43%), diarrhea (41%), and fatigue (35%).  
Serious adverse events were reported for 33% of patients receiving polatuzumab vedotin in combination with  rituximab plus bendamusti ne and 39% of patients 
receiving polatuzumab vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine.   
A total of [ADDRESS_1174063] been reported:  11 de aths in patients trea ted with single-agent 
polatuzumab vedotin and 33 de aths in patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin 
combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab.  The majority of deaths were judged as 
related to disease progression. 
Limited safety data from 7 patients receiving single
agent polatuzumab vedotin in an 
ongoing Phase I study (JO29138) are provided in the polatuzumab vedotin Investigator's 
Brochure.

Obinutuzumab has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III study in first-line CLL 
(Goede et al. 2014).    Obinutuzumab is being compared with rituximab in two large 
Phase III studies in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (Study  BO21005) or 
previously untreated indolent B cell lymphomas, including FL (Study BO21223).  
Assuming these studies demonstrate greater clinical benefit with obinutuzumab  versus 
rituximab containing regimens, potentially altering the standard of care in B cell 
lymphoma, it will be important to also assess the safety and efficacy of inc orporating 
obinutuzumab into treatment regimens.  A fourth Obinutuzumab showed clinical benefit 
compared to rituximab when combined with chemotherapy in a Phase III trial (BO21223) in patients with previously untreated indolent B-cell lymphomas, including 
FL (Marcus et al. 2016).  A Phase III study, GAO4753g, evaluated patients with 
rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma, including patients with FL, and showed improvement in PFS with  obinutuzumab  added to bendamustine followed by 
[CONTACT_844924] (Sehn et al. 2015). Obinutuzumab will be included as the anti-CD20 backbone for patients with R/R FL in this study.   
Obinutuzumab did not show superiority compared to rituximab in the Phase III trial 
(BO21005) comparing R-CHOP to  G-CHOP in patients wi th previously untreated 
DLBLC (Vitolo et al. 2016).  Based upon the BO21005 efficacy results, this study 
protocol is amended, and patients with R/R DLBCL will receive rituximab as the anti-CD20 backbone in combinat ion with polatuzumab ve dotin and lenalidomide.   
[…] 
On the basis of the distinct mechanisms of action (MOAs) for each molecule and the current available clinical data, there is a strong rationale to expect an improved 
benefit-risk profile with the triplet combination of obinutuzumab or rituximab plus  
polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide.  Thi s novel triplet regimen may have the 
potential to extend treatment-free remissions an d to decrease toxicity by [CONTACT_844925], which includes traditional chemotherapy.  Early clinical data that evaluated obinutuzumab , rituximab , 
polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide each as single-agents has been associated with 
neutropenia.  Rituximab and polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab and lenalidomide 
doublet combinations have also been associated with neutropenia.  The replacement of rituximab with obinutuzumab (Study GO27834 [obinutuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin {G
 + Pola}] and GALEN [obinutuzumab plus lenalidomide {G  + Len}]) in these doublets is 
anticipated to be associated with treatment-related neutropenia.  Patients with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844887]; such events are expected to be manageable in the clinical setting, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are unlikely to occur (see Sections 5.1.5 and 5.1.6).

changes to this section are summarized as follows. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dose-Escalation Phase 
The purpose of the FL dose-escalation phase is to identify the RP2D for polatuzumab 
vedotin and the RP2D for lenalidomide when combined with a fixed dose  of 
obinutuzumab as induction treatment.  This These  dose-escalation phase will include 
FL patients only; these patients may receive post-induction treatment if eligible (see Section 3.3.1).   
Approximately 18 −33
30 patients will be enrolled in the FL dose-escalation phase.  
Cohorts of 3− 6 patients each will be treated in accordance with the treatment regimens 
and dose-escalation rules described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3. 
Patients will be closely monitored for adv erse events during the DLT assessment 
window, defined as the first treatment cycle (from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to Day 1 of Cycle 2).  
Adverse events meeting the criteria for DLT, as defined below (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1), will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 5.4.2).

discontinue study treatment. may continue receiving study treatment once the event has 
resolved, if determined by [CONTACT_844929] r clinical benefit in their judgment.   
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window 
for reasons other than a DLT will be considered non-evaluable for dose-escalation decisions and RP2D assessments and will be replaced by [CONTACT_844930].  Patients who miss one or more doses of polatuzumab vedotin or 
obinutuzumab  or five consecutive daily doses of lenalidomide during the DLT 
assessment window for reasons other than a DLT will also be replaced and considered 
non-evaluable for dose-escalation decisions.   Patients who do not receive all study 
treatment for any reason will also be replaced.  Patients who receive supportive care 
during the DLT assessment window that may confound the evaluation of DLTs may be 
replaced at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Definiti on of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
In this study, a DLT is defined as any one  of the following events occurring during the 
first cycle of treatment and assessed by [CONTACT_844931] :

Cohort 1 are 1.4 mg/kg for polatuzumab vedotin and 10 mg for lenalidomide.  In Cohorts 2 −6, dose escalation of polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide will proceed in 
increments that parallel the magnitude of dose increases tested in ongoing Phase Ib studies (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].2).  For polatuzumab vedotin, there are two 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
16/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 possible dose levels:  1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg.  For lenalidomide, there are three possible dose 
levels (10, 15, or 20 mg).  Intrapatient dose escalation is not allowed.  The overall  FL 
dose-escalation plan is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2, and the doses for each cohort are 
summarized in Table 3.   
[…] 
Dose escalation will occur in accordance with the rules listed below. 
• A minimum of [ADDRESS_1174071] 48 hours apart.

Relevant demographic, adverse event, laboratory, dose administration/intensity, and PK 
(if available) data will be reviewed throughout the study by [CONTACT_844932]-escalation decisions, which will be made by [CONTACT_844933] [INVESTIGATOR_816985].    
Although the DLT assessment window is defined as the first treatment cycle, cumulative or late  toxicities occurring beyond the first cycle may be considered when determining 
the RP2Ds.  Prior to opening the R/R FL expansion phase, the Clinical Study Team and 
the Medical Monitor will review the cumulative data, recommend the RP2D, and review this with the IMC for approval.

SECTION 3.1.3:  Rituximab plus   Polatuzumab Vedotin plus   Lenalidomide 
Treatment Group (Patients with Relapsed or Refractory  
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma) (NEW SECTION)  
Based on the safety and efficacy results from  the Phase III BO21005 study in patients 
with DLBCL, the protocol has been amended to explore dose-finding of lenalidomide in 
combination with fixed doses of polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab instead of obinutuzumab for patients with R/R DLBCL.     
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dose-Escalation Phase (NEW SECTION)  
The DLBCL dose-escalation phase will open with the purpose of identifying the RP2D for lenalidomide when combined with polatu zumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg and rituximab 
at 375 mg/m
2 as induction treatment in patients with R/R DLBCL.  The dose escalation 
will initiate at the lenalidomide 10-mg dose  level and increase through Cohorts A, B, 
and C (see Figure 3).   
Approximately 12 −18 patients will be enrolled in the R/R DLBCL dose-escalation phase.  
Cohorts of 3 −[ADDRESS_1174073] treatment cycle (from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to Day 1 of Cycle 2).  Adverse events meeting the criteria for DLT,  as defined below (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1), 
will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 5.4.2).  
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment 
window for reasons other than a DLT will be considered non-evaluable for dose-escalation decisions and RP2D assessments and will be replaced by [CONTACT_817038].  Patients who miss one or more doses of polatuzumab vedotin or rituximab or five consecutive daily doses of lenalidomide during the DLT assessment window for reasons other than a DLT will also be replaced and considered non-evaluable for dose-escalation decisions.  Patients who receive supportive care

18/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 during the DLT assessment window that may co nfound the evaluation of DLTs may be 
replaced at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. 
Patients will receive induction treatment with R  + Pola  + Len for a total of six cycles.  
Patients achieving a CR or PR at EOI will be  eligible to receive consolidation treatment 
with R  + Len.  A study schema is provided in Figure 1.   
Treatment Regimens for DL BCL Dose-Escalation Phase 
Patients enrolled in the DLBCL-dose-escalation phase will receive induction treatment, 
administered in 28-day cycles as shown in Ta ble 6.  When study treatments are given 
on the same day, they will be administered sequentially in the following order:  lenalidomide, rituximab, and polatuzumab vedotin.   
Patients who achieve a CR or PR at EOI will receive consolidation treatment with 
R
 + Len, as outlined in Table 7.  Polatuzumab vedotin will not be given as maintenance 
treatment.  Consolidation treatment should start 8 weeks ( ± 1 week) after Day [ADDRESS_1174074] 3  + 3 dose-escalation schema will be used.  The rituximab and polatuzumab 
dose levels will remain fixed during the dose-escalation phase, and only the lenalidomide will be dose escalated.  The polatuzumab dose of 1.8 mg/kg is based on ongoing Phase II trials (see Sections 1.3.2 an d [IP_ADDRESS]).  Intrapatient dose escalation is 
not allowed.  The overall DLBCL dose-escalation plan is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 3.   
Dose escalation will occur in accordance with the rules listed below. 
• A minimum of [ADDRESS_1174075] 48 hours 
apart.   
• If none of the first 3 DLT-evaluable patients experiences a DLT, the doses in that cohort will be deemed safe and tolerable, and escalation may continue per the 
dose-escalation plan described above. 
• If [ADDRESS_1174076] 
6 DLT-evaluable patients, the doses in that co hort will be deemed safe and tolerable, 
and escalation may continue per the dose-escalation plan described above. 
• If a DLT is observed in 
≥ 33% of patients (e.g., 2 or m ore of up to 6 DLT-evaluable 
patients), the dose combination at which th is occurs will be considered intolerable 
and the MTD will have been exceeded for lenalidomide in the R  + Pola  + Len 
treatment combination.   
• If the MTD is exceeded in any cohort, the highest dose combination at which < 33% 
of patients (e.g., 2 of 6 DLT-evaluable patients) experience a DLT will be declared 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
19/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 the combination MTD (i.e., the MTDs lenalidomide in the R  + Pola  + Len treatment 
combination). 
• If the MTD is not exceeded at any dose level, the highest dose combination 
administered in this study will be declared the maximum administered dose for 
polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide in the R  + Pola  + Len treatment combination. 
 
If the MTD is exceeded in any cohort, de-escalation of the lenalidomide dose and/or 
polatuzumab vedotin dose, and/or adjustment  of treatment schedules (e.g., lenalidomide 
treatment on Days 1 −10) may occur.  Additional patients may be enrolled in a given 
cohort in the absence of DLTs to acquire additional safety data for the appropriate dose levels in the expansion phase of the study. 
On the basis of a review of real-time safety data and available preliminary PK data, 
dose escalation may be halted or modified by [CONTACT_422872]. 
Relevant demographic, advers e event, laboratory, dose administration/intensity, and 
PK (if available) data will be reviewed prior to dose-escalation decisions, which will be 
objectively reviewed throughout the study by [CONTACT_844934]-escalation decisions, which will be made by [CONTACT_844935] [INVESTIGATOR_816985].    
Although the DLT assessment window is de fined as the first treatment cycle, 
cumulative or late toxicities occurring beyond the first cycle may be considered when determining the RP2Ds.  Prior to opening the R/R DLBCL expansion phase, the Clinical Study Team and the Medical Moni tor will review the cumulative data, 
determine the RP2D, and review this with the IMC for approval.

SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  DLBCL Expansion Phase (NEW SECTION)  
The expansion phase is designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide when combined with a fixed dose of ri tuximab and polatuzuma b vedotin in DLBCL 
patients.  
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
20/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Approximately 40 patients with DLBCL will be enrolled during the expansion phase 
and treated as described below. 
All patients enrolled in the expansion phase will receive induction treatment as 
outlined in Table 9.  When study treatments  are given on the same day, they will be 
administered sequentially in the followin g order:  lenalidomide, rituximab, and 
polatuzumab vedotin. 
Patients with DLBCL who achieve a CR or PR at EOI will receive post-induction 
treatment (referred to as consolidation) with rituximab and lenalidomide as outlined in Table 10.  Polatuzumab vedotin will not be given during the post-induction phase.  Post-induction treatment should start 8 weeks (
± 1 week) after Day 1 of the final cycle 
of induction and will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for up 
to 6 months for consolidation treatment.

SECTION 3.2:  End of St udy and Length of Study 
The end of this study is defined as the time when both of the following criteria are met: 
• All enrolled patients with FL have been followed for at least [ADDRESS_1174083]  
completed or discontinued study treatment (including induction treatment and 
maintenance treatment as applicable).  
 
SECTION 3.3.1:  Rationale  for Patient Population  
On the basis of a compelling biologic and clinical rationale, as presented in Section 1.4, 
the addition of polatuzumab vedotin to obinutuzumab or rituximab  and lenalidomide is a 
promising approach to expand the number of patients with R/R FL and DLBCL who 
achieve remission and to prolong response duration in these patients. 
The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342].  
The objective of the dose-escalation phase is to define the RP2D for lenalidomide and 
the RP2D dose for polatuzumab vedotin when given with obinutuzumab  in patients with 
R/R FL and the RP2D for lenalidomide when given in combination with polatuzumab 
at 1.8 mg/kg and rituximab at 375 mg/m2 in patients with R/R DLBCL.  Although the 
DLT assessment window is the first cycle of treatment, long-term or cumulative toxicities will also be assessed and considered for the dose definition.  As relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL has a more aggressive course, with an expected higher risk of early progression 
than FL, patients with DLBCL will not be enrolled in the dose escalation phase in an 
attempt to minimize the number of patients not evaluable for DLTs and increase the 
chances for assessing toxicities with later onset during treatment.   The doses identified 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
21/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 in patients with FL during the dose escalation phase will then be applied to patients in 
the expansion phase (including patients with FL and DLBCL), where efficacy data will be 
collected and safety will be continually monitored.  
SECTION 3.3.2:  Rationale for the Triplet Combination  
As discussed in Section 1.4, there is a strong MOA and clinical rationale to expect an 
improved benefit-risk profile with the triplet combination of obinutuzumab  or rituximab , 
polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide over standard immunochemotherapy regimens.  
The hypothesis is that this novel triplet regimen may have the potential to extend treatment-free remissions and decrease toxicity by [CONTACT_844936].  Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844888] (see Section 5.1.5).  
As discussed in Section 1.4, the development of obinutuzumab in B-cell malignancies is 
based on the hypothesis that obinutuzumab will be a superior anti-CD20 agent 
compared to rituximab in patients with FL .  This has been demonstrated in CLL 
(Goede et al. 2014) and has been studied in is anticipated to be demonstrated in
 two 
additional Phase III studies in DLBCL and FL.   
Study BO21223 investigated obinutuzumab plus  chemotherapy (G-benda, G-CVP, 
G-CHOP) compared with rituximab plus chem otherapy, followed by [CONTACT_844937] (FL cohort, 
n = 1202) and demonstrated positive results, showing a significant improvement in PFS 
in the obinutuzumab chemotherapy arm. 
Study BO21005, investigated G-CHOP comp ared with R-CHOP in patients with 
previously untreated DLBCL and this study did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS 
at final analysis.   
On the basis of the results of these Phase III studies evaluating obinutuzumab in 
combination with chemotherapy in both FL an d DLBCL, patients with R/R FL in this 
current protocol amendment will continue to receive obinutuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide, while patients with R/R DLBCL will instead receive rituximab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rituximab and Polatuzumab Vedotin Combination 
During its early development, polatuzumab vedotin treatment has been investigated as a single agent and in combination with rituximab.  On the basis of available Phase I and II data (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 11), polatuzumab vedotin as a single agent and combined with rituximab has shown clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma  (Palanca-Wessels et al. 2012; Morschhauser et al. 2014a).  In 
both studies, patients received rituximab 375 mg/m
2 and polatuzumab vedotin up to 2.4 
mg/kg Q3W for up to 1 year, progression, or unacceptable toxicity .  The ongoing Study 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
22/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 GO27834 has also shown preliminary safety and efficacy results evaluating the 
combination of rituximab and polatuzumab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg.    
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Obinutuzumab a nd Polatuzumab Vedotin Combination 
The combination of obinutuzumab with polatuzumab vedotin is being evaluated in 
several ongoing studies (see Table 11), including two Phase Ib/II trials in patients with R/R FL.   and relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in relapsed or refractory B
cell 
lymphoma an d previously untreated DLBCL.    As these new data emerge, these will be 
assessed and applied to update this study, if required.  Preliminary results from these 
studies show safety and efficacy at the polatuzumab vedotin 1.8-mg/kg dose level when combined with obinutuzumab, every 3 weeks for 6
−8 cycles as described in Section 
1.3.2.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rationale for Obinutuzumab Dose and Schedule  in 
Patients with Folli cular Lymp homa   
The dose and schedule for obinutuzumab in this study will be fixed for the induction and the maintenance (FL) or consolidation (DLBCL)
 components of the study, and 
obinutuzumab will not be dose-escalated.  This is based on the recommended dose and 
schedule (6 −8 cycles depending on the trial) of obinutuzumab in the ongoing  from the  
Phase III program in patients with B-cell lymphoma.   
[…] 
The dose and schedule of obinutuzumab in the maintenance regimen (FL) will be 
1000 mg IV administered every 2 months for 2 years.  This dosing administration is based on the obinutuzumab maintenance regimen that was administered in the Phase III Study GAO4753g (Sehn et al. 2015).  The dose and schedule of obinutuzumab in the 
consolidation regimen (DLBCL) will be 1000 mg  IV administered every 2 months for a 
total of 3  doses.  The consolidation regi men was modeled after the FL maintenance 
therapy.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Rationale for Polatuzumab Ve dotin Dose in Patients 
with Follicular Lymphoma    
For this study, dose escalation of polatuzumab vedotin for patients with R/R FL  will 
begin at a dose level of 1.4 mg/kg (one dose level below the highest allowed 
polatuzumab vedotin dose currently under development ) and will escalate to a final 
dose of 1.8 mg/kg, if tolerated.  The  initial  polatuzumab vedotin dose and schedule for 
this study were based on the experience from the Phase I study (DCS4968g) with 
single-agent polatuzumab vedotin and the P hase II study (GO27834) with polatuzumab 
vedotin in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma, the majority of which had FL or DLBCL.  Most evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed at doses 
 ≥ 1.8 mg/kg alone or in combination with rituximab.  
[…] 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
23/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 The combination of obinutuzumab with polatuzumab vedotin is being evaluated in 
several ongoing studies (see Table 11), including two Phase Ib/II trials in patients with R/R FL. and relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in relapsed or refractory B
cell lymphoma 
and previously untreated DLBCL.    
[…] 
In Study GO29044, the starting dose of polatuzumab vedotin is  was 1.4 mg/kg and will 
be was escalated to 1.8 mg/kg, if tolerated, when combined in combination  with G-CHP.  
In Study GO29365, the starting dose of polatuzumab vedotin is 1.8 mg/kg when combined with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.  Since polatuzumab vedotin is being combined with obinutuzumab and chemotherapy (CHP or bendamustine) at 1.4 or 
1.8 mg/kg, for patients with R/R FL in this study,  dose escalation of polatuzumab 
vedotin will begin at a dose level of 1.4 mg/kg (one dose level below the highest allowed 
polatuzumab vedotin dose level in clinical development ) and will escalate to a final dose 
of 1.8 mg/kg, if tolerated.  This novel triplet, G  + Pola  + Len, substitutes out the standard 
chemotherapy components with lenalidomide, which in this combination may have the 
potential to extend treatment-free remissions and decrease toxicity, compared to combinations with standard chemotherapy components.

for the Treatment of Follicular Lymphoma  
Table [ADDRESS_1174084] been renumbered accordingly. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].2:  Rationale for Polatuzumab Ve dotin Dose in Patients 
with DLBCL (NEW SECTION) 
On the basis of the preliminary data f rom the patients with DLBCL treated in 
Studies GO29044 and GO29365, the dose level of polatuzumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg 
has been shown to be safe and tolerable in combination with rituximab and chemotherapy.   
Due to the aggressive nature of DLBCL and the evidence that anti-tumor activity was 
observed at doses  
≥ 1.8 mg/kg alone or in combination with rituximab, the higher dose 
level of polatuzumab vedotin is preferred to maximize clinical benefit for the R/R DLBCL population, which has no standard of care.   
The safety profile of rituximab differs slightly in comparison with obinutuzumab and is 
expected to be tolerated when combined with polatuzumab vedo tin at 1.8 mg/kg and 
lenalidomide; hence, in this amendment, the R/R DLBCL dose-escalation phase will 
start at the dose level of 1.8 mg/kg and only the lenalidomide dose will be escalated to determine an RP2D in this population.    
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
24/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS].3:  Rationale for Polatuzumab Vedotin Dosing Schedule 
in Patients with Follicul ar Lymphoma and DLBCL  
The number of induction cycles (six 21 28-day cycles) of the G  + Pola  + Len regimen that 
will be evaluated in this study is consistent with rituximab plus lenalidomide and 
obinutuzumab plus lenalidomide regimens used to treat B cell lymphoma.  is in line with 
other anti-CD20 plus polatuzumab vedoti n regimens studied in R/R NHL.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rationale  for Treatment Duration 
Patients with R/R DLBCL who are not suitable  for or do not benefit from consolidative 
autologous transplantation exhibit a poor prognosis.  Responses obtained with different 
rituximab treatment regimens tested in clin ical trials (e.g., ritu ximab in combination 
with bendamustine, with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, or with lenalidomide) have been of short duration, with the longest report ed median PFS of approximately 7 months 
observed in one study of BR (Ohmachi et al. 2013).  Thus, 6 months of consolidation treatment, for a total treatment duration of approximately 12 months, is considered to be a reasonable exploratory therapeutic app roach in patients with R/R DLBCL with an 
anticipated positive benefit-risk ratio.  On the basis of the complementary mechanism of action between all three study drugs and considering the aggressiveness of R/R DLBCL, the study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the triple combination in the consolidation setting.  
SECTION 4.1.1:  Inclusion Criteria  
• For patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase  For G  + Pola  + Len treatment 
group :  R/R  FL after treatment with at least one prior chemoimmunotherapy 
regimen that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and for which no other 
more appropriate treatment option exists as determined by [CONTACT_093] 
• For patients enrolled in the expansion phase lymphoma classified as either of the 
following: For R  + Pola  + Len treatment group :   
Relapsed or refractory FL after treatment with at least one prior 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen that included an anti CD20 monoclonal 
antibody and for  which no other more appropriate treatment option exists as

recent available biopsy and initiation of study treatment, a repeat core-needle 
biopsy is strongly recommended.   
Further details are provided in Section 4.5.6.   
• Agreement to comply with all local requirements of the lenalidomide risk 
minimization plan 
In every country where lenalidomide has been approved, a risk minimization 
plan, which includes a pregnancy prevention program, is in place.  The risk 
minimization plan should be followed by [CONTACT_844938]. 
US sites only:   Per standard Revlimid REMS™ requirements, all physicians 
who prescribe lenalidomide for research subjects enrolled in this study and all 
research subjects enrolled in this study must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the Revlimid REMS™ program.  
For Ex-US sites only:   Subjects will be counseled on pregnancy prevention 
prior to medication being dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied 
with all requirements, including use of birth control and pregnancy testing, 
and that the subject understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step will be documented with a completed Education and Counseling Guidance 
Document (refer to Lenalidomide Preg nancy Prevention Risk Management 
Plans), and no drug will be dispensed until this step occurs.  Counseling 
includes verification with the subject that required pregnancy testing was 
performed and results were negative.  A Lenalidomide Information Sheet (refer 
to Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention  Risk Management Plans) will be 
supplied with each medication dispensed.  All requirements must be followed 
by [CONTACT_844939]. 
In addition, because lenalidomide will be administered in combination with 
obinutuzumab, rituximab, and polatuzumab vedotin, patients must comply with 
contraceptive measures designed to ensure safe administration of all three
 
study treatments as outlined below.  
• For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use two  adequate methods of contraception, including 
at least one method with a failure rate of < 1% per year, for at least 28 days prior to 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, during the treatment period (including periods of treatment 
interruption), and for at least [ADDRESS_1174086] dose of obinutuzumab  study treatment  
• The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive 
measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a 
failure rate of <  1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 
[ADDRESS_1174088] dose of obinutuzumab or rituximab study treatment  to avoid 
exposing the embryo. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

27/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 assigned to cohorts with varying polatuzumab vedotin (R/R FL dose-finding only)  and 
lenalidomide dose combinations, through use of an interactive voice or web-based 
response system (IxRS).  During the FL expansion phase, all patients with R/R FL will 
receive obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide at the FL RP2D and 
polatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D as induction treatment.  During the DLBCL 
expansion phase, patients with R/R DLBCL will receive rituximab and polatuzumab in 
combination with lenalidomide at the DLBCL RP2D.   Post-induction treatment (for 
eligible patients only) will depend on lymphoma histology.  Patients with FL will receive maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide, and patients with DLBCL 
will receive consolidation treatment with obinutuzumab
rituximab  and lenalidomide (see 
Section 3.1.1 for details). 
SECTION 4.3:  STUDY TREATMENT 
The investigational medicinal products (IMPs) for this study are obinutuzumab, rituximab,  polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Rituximab (NEW SECTION) 
Rituximab will be supplied by [CONTACT_491849].  Rituximab is packaged in 10-mL 
(100-mg) and 50-mL (500-mg) single-dose,  pharmaceutical-grade glass vials at a 
concentration of 10 mg/mL of protein.  The antibody is formulated for IV injection as a sterile product in a solution of sodium chloride (pH 6.5) containing polysorbate 80 and sodium citrate.  For information on the formulation and handling of rituximab, see the pharmacy manual and the Rituximab Investigator's Brochure. 
SECTION 4.3.2:  Dosage, Ad ministration, and Compliance  
Patients enrolled in the dose-escalation phase or the expansion phase will receive six 
28-day cycles of induction treatment with obinutuzumab  or rituximab , polatuzumab 
vedotin, and lenalidomide.  When study treatme nts are given on the same day, they will 
be administered sequentially in the following order:  lenalidomide, obinutuzumab or 
rituximab , and polatuzumab vedotin.  
Patients with DLBCL who achieve a CR or PR at EOI will receive post-induction treatment (referred to as consolidation) with lenalidomide and  obinutuzumab
rituximab , 
and patients with FL who achieve a CR, PR, or SD at EOI will receive post-induction 
treatment (referred to as maintenance) with lenalidomide and obinutuzumab.  When study treatments are given on the same day, lenalidomide will be administered prior to 
obinutuzumab  or rituximab . 
Post-induction treatment should start 8 weeks ( ±
 1 week) after Day 1 of the final cycle of 
induction and will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 
2 years for maintenance treatment or 1 year 6 months for consolidation treatment.

Cycles 1−6 during induction treatment and on Day 1 of every other month (i.e., every 
2 months) during consolidation treatmen t for patients with R/R DLBCL.   
Body surface area (BSA) will be determined  at screening and should be used to 
calculate the dose of rituximab throughout the study unless the patient’s weight increases or decreases by 
> 10% from screening, in which case BSA should be 
recalculated and used for subsequent dosing.  In obese patients (defined as body mass index 
≥ 30 kg/m2), there is no BSA cap and actual body weight, not adjusted weight, is 
recommended.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_844889]. 
The infusion of rituximab may be split over 2 days if the patient is at increased risk for 
an IRR (high tumor burden or high peripheral lymphocyte count).  Administration of rituximab may be continued on the following day, if needed, for patients who experience an adverse event during the rituximab infusion.  
If a dose of rituximab is split over [ADDRESS_1174090] occur with appropriate 
premedication (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and at the first infusion rate (see Table 12). 
Rituximab infusions will be administered according to the instructions in Table 12.  
During the treatment period, rituximab must be administered to patients in a setting where full emergency resuscitation facilities are immediately available.  Patients should be under close supervision of the investigator at all times.  
Rituximab should be administered as a slow IV  infusion through a dedicated line.  After 
the end of the first infusion, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in

SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Polatuzumab Vedotin 
For R/R FL, during During  the dose-escalation phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin 
for each patient will depend on dose assignment (1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg).  During the expansion phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin for each patient will depend on the 
RP2D established during the dose-escalation phase.  For R/R DLBCL, during the dose-
escalation phase and the expansion phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin will be fixed 
at 1.8 mg/kg.   Polatuzumab vedotin will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 of each 
cycle, during induction treatment only. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Premedicati on and Other Required Medication

receiving at least one dose of each component of the combination will be replaced. 
 
SECTION 5.1:  SAFETY PLAN 
Polatuzumab vedotin is not a marketed product, and obinutuzumab and  lenalidomide 
isare not approved for the treatment of patients with R/R FL.  Obinutuzumab is only 
approved in combination with bendamustine for the treatment of R/R FL.  Rituximab 
and lenalidomide are not approved for the treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL .  
Clinical development is ongoing.  The safety plan for patients in this study is based on 
clinical experience with obinutuzumab, rituximab, polatuzumab vedotin, and 
lenalidomide in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety risks 
of obinutuzumab, rituximab,  polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide are outlined below.  
Please refer to the Obinutuzumab, Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator’s 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
34/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174098] Characteristics (SmPC) for a 
complete summary of safety information.  
SECTION 5.1.1:  Risks Asso ciated with Obinutuzumab  
To date, the following adverse events are considered to be important identified risks 
associated with obinutuzumab:  IRRs, TLS, thrombocytopenia (including acute 
thrombocytopenia), neutropenia (including prolonged and late onset neutropenia), infections (including PML and HBV reactivation), prolonged B-cell depletion, impaired immunization response, worsening of preexisting cardiac conditions, and gastrointestinal perforation. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Immunizations  
The safety of immunization with live or attenuated viral  virus  vaccines following 
obinutuzumab therapy has not been studied  and .  Thus,  vaccination with live virus 
vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell recovery. 
SECTION 5.1.2:  Risks Associated with Rituximab (NEW SECTION) 
The following adverse events are considered to be important risks associated or potentially associated with rituximab:  IRRs , infections (including severe infections), 
PML, hepatitis B reactivation, neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia), TLS, impaired immunization response, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS]/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] [TEN]), and GI perforation.  Details for these risks are provided below; refer to the Rituximab Investigator’s Brochure for full information. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Infusion-Related Reactions (NEW SECTION) 
Acute IRRs are very common in patients receiving rituximab (occurring in ≥ 10% of 
patients) based on clinical trial experience.  However, serious IRRs are uncommonly reported (occurring in 
≥ 1 of 1,000 and < 1 of 100 patients) and are rarely fatal 
(occurring in ≥ 1 of 10,000 and < 1 of 1,000 patients).  Most  IRRs occur with the first 
administration of rituximab.  Most IRRs are mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 or 2) and can be managed by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_844890].  IRRs can be severe and, in rare cases, can result in death.  Rituximab-induced IRRs consist of a cluster of symptoms and signs occurring during or within 24 hours of a rituximab infusion that may be related to cytokine release and/or other chemical mediators, and these acute IRRs overlap with “cytokine release syndrome.”  Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions  have been reported followin g rituximab administration, and 
clinical manifestations of these reactions are similar to cytokine release syndrome.  In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true  hypersensitivity reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_844891].

35/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Infections (Including Serious Infections)  
(NEW SECTION) 
Serious infections, including fatal bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral 
infections, can occur during and up to 1 year following completion of rituximab-based therapy.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hepatitis B Reactivation (NEW SECTION) 
Reactivation of hepatitis B ranges from asymptomatic reactivations (detected by 
[CONTACT_491863]) to fulminant liver failure and death.  Patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) viral infection are at risk for reactivation and will be excluded from the study.  Patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B exposure or who are carriers (defined as HBsAg negative and anti-HBcAb positive) are at a lower risk for reactivation.  Patients who demonstrate evidence of reactivation while receiving an appropriate anti-viral therapy will be discontinued from study 
treatment. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (NEW 
SECTION)  
Rare cases of PML have also been reported in  patients treated with rituximab alone or 
in combination with other immunosuppressive medication s (Goldberg et al. 2002; 
Calabrese et al. 2007; Carson  and Bennett 2009).  In a review of [ADDRESS_1174099] cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the patients ’ last infusion of rituximab. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Neutropenia (Including Prolonged Neutropenia ) (NEW 
SECTION) 
Neutropenia is very common in patients  receiving rituximab (occurring in ≥ 10% of 
patients) based on clinical trial experience.  However, delayed onset neutropenia is very rare (occurring in 
< 1 of 10,000 patients), and the in cidence of prolonged neutropenia 
is unknown.  Neutropenia may lead to seriou s or overwhelming infection, especially if 
profound (Grades 3 −4), prolonged, associated with breaches in natural mucosal barriers 
(e.g., diarrhea and/or mucositis), and/or ot her immunological defects (e.g., lymphopenia, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, and ac quired immunodeficiency syndrome).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_816990] 3 −[ADDRESS_1174100] not reported a significant increase in serious neutropenic 
infections. 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
36/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (NEW SECTION) 
Patients treated with rituximab may be at risk for TLS.  Severe tumor TLS is very rare 
in patients receiving rituximab (occurring in < 1 of 10,000 patients), based on 
postmarketing experience.  Signs and symp toms (e.g., hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, acute rena l failure, and elevat ed LDH) that are 
consistent with TLS have been reported to occur after the first rituximab IV infusion in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant lymphocytes.  A high number of circulating malignant cells (
≥ 25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden confers a greater risk 
of TLS.  For patients with evidence of TLS, rituximab should be discontinued, and the patient should be treated as clinically indicated. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Impaired Immunization Response (NEW SECTION) 
B-cell depletion is expected (and desired) during rituximab therapy and is directly related to its mechanism of action.  In theory, peripheral B-cell depletion may reduce the effectiveness of immunization, as patients may not be able to mount an effective humoral immune response to foreign antigens. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Severe Skin Reactions:  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and 
Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19342]  (NEW SECTION) 
Severe reactions, including fatal mucocutaneous reactions, can occur in patients receiving rituximab.  The onset of these reactions in patients treated with rituximab has varied from 1to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure.  The majority of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_77116] (TEN) cases reported with 
rituximab were associated with additional risk factors.  Fatal outcome also appeared to increase in patients who were exposed to multiple risk factors for SJS/TEN. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Gastrointestinal Perforation (NEW SECTION) 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  In postmarketing reports of rituximab, the m ean time to documented GI perforation was 
6 days (range: 1
−77 days) in patients with NHL. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]: Identified Risks Known Risks Associated with 
Polatuzumab Vedotin  
The title of this section was revised. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Potential Risks Associated with Polatuzumab Vedotin  
Infections 
Neutropenia is a known risk for polatuzumab vedotin.  Reports in the literature state that granulocytopenia is a major predisposing factor to infections in patients with B-cell lymphoma.  Patients receiving chemotherapy  for B-cell lymphoma with a granulocyte 
count of 
 < 500 cells/μ L experienced a higher incidence of infections than those with a 
count of  > 500 cells/μ L.

37/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (NEW SECTION) 
One case of PML was reported in an -year-old female with R/R FL after receiving one 
cycle of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.  MRI showed changes suggestive of PML. Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_844892].  Confounders included previous lines of anti-CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844893].  Additional details of the case can be found in the Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure.  
Infusion-Related Events 
Because of the potential for infusion reactions, administration of polatuzumab vedotin will be performed in a setting with access to emergency equipment and staff who are trained to monitor and respond to medical emergencies.  All patients will be monitored for infusion reactions during the infusion and immediately afterward (for additional 
instructions on the monitoring and management of infusion reactions, see 
Section  4.3.2. 3).  Precautions for suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug 
infusions are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The initial dose of polatuzumab vedotin may be administered with premedication with acetaminophen, antihistamines, or corticosteroids per institutional standard practice at the discretion of the Investigator.  Premedication should be instituted for subsequent doses if IRRs are observed in patients who receive their first dose of polatuzumab vedotin without premedications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Significant issues with polatuzumab vedotin IRRs have not been 
observed. 
Similar considerations regarding infusion reactions are applicable for obinutuzumab.  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional information.   
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
There is the potential theoretical risk of TLS if treatment with polatuzumab vedotin 
results in the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  If any evidence of this 
occurs during the study, tumor lysis prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count ≥ 25
 × 109/L or 
bulky lymphadenopathy) and who are considered to be at risk for tumor lysis by [CONTACT_570665] (e.g., allopurinol ≥  300 mg/day orally or a 
suitable alternative treatment [according to institutional practice] starting 12 −24 hours 
before study treatment) and must be well hydrated before the initiation of study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration before each subsequent infusion, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].    
One case of TLS attributed to  polatuzumab vedotin has b een reported (Study GO27834); 
however, the laboratory elevations did no t meet the Howard cr iteria for TLS (see 
Appendix 12).  The suspected TLS event resolved after 3 days of supportive care.  One case of Grade 3 Laboratory TLS was reported in the ongoing Phase Ib/II Study GO29833 combining polatuzumab vedotin, obinutuzumab, and venetolax.  

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
38/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 The patient was at high risk for TLS due to bulky disease and decreased renal function.  
Potassium and phosphorous levels were elevated, while serum creatinine levels remained normal and the patient was asymptomatic.  The TLS event was considered related to all three study treatments and resolved in 4 days with supportive care (see Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure  for case details.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
Lenalidomide must not be taken by [CONTACT_844943].  In every country where lenalidomide has been approved, a risk minimization plan, which includes a pregnancy prevention program, is in place.  Investigators must ensure that all specific local requirements that are applicable to the safe and effective use of lenalidomide are fulfilled prior to administration to patients.  The risk minimization plan should be followed by [CONTACT_844944], with one exception:  Because lenalidomide will be administered in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and 
obinutuzumab  or rituximab, patients must comply with contraceptive measures 
designed to ensure safe administration of all four three
 study treatments, as outlined in 
Section 4.1.1.  Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or has unusual /irregular  menstrual bleeding.  Treatment with 
lenalidomide must be discontinued until it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Renal Impairment 
Lenalidomide is substantially excreted by [CONTACT_10521].  Patients with renal impairment (i.e., calculated creatinine clearance <60
 50 mL/min) will not be enrolled in this study.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Cardiovascular Reactions (NEW SECTION)  
Cases of serious adverse cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial 
infarction, and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in patients with CLL treated with lenalidomide compared to single agent chlorambucil.  Patients will be monitored 
for the development of cardiac toxicities.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization (NEW SECTION)  
Patients have been reported to show a decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment with lenalidomide.  Early referral to a transplant center is recommended in patients who are autologous SCT candidates.   
SECTION 5.1.5:  Risk of Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844894].  
[…] 
Both rituximab and lenalidomide have been asso ciated with dermatologic reactions such 
as SJS and TEN, and the risk of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844895].  Guidelines 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
39/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 for management of patients who develop dermatologic toxicities are provided in 
Table 19.   
SECTION 5.1.6:  Risk of Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844896].  First, 
obinutuzumab, rituximab, and polatuzumab vedotin are not anticipated to interact 
directly with CYP isoforms or other drug–metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters.  
Cytokine modulation may be considered as an indirect mechanism through which a monoclonal antibody could alter CYP expression.  However, treatment with obinutuzumab results in only transient increases in cytokine levels after the first infusion, and no increases are observed after subsequent infusions.  In vitro (human PBMCs) and in vivo (cynomolgus monkeys) treatment with anti-CD79 antibodies (i.e., the same antigen target as polatuzumab vedotin) showed a low risk for release of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines.  Taken together, these results suggest that both obinutuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin are unlikely to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_242960] e DDIs via indirect effects on cytokines.   
Second, lenalidomide is primarily excreted in the urine.  Lenalidomide is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the CYP group of enzymes (Kumar et al. 2009).  In vitro, the MMAE component of polatuzumab vedotin is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and it is mainly eliminated by [CONTACT_844945].  Both lenalidomide and MMAE are substrates but not inhibitors of P-gp.  Owing to the different elimination pathways for lenalidomide and MMAE, the risk of CYP-mediated and transporter-mediated DDI risk is low when polatuzumab vedotin is combined with lenalidomide.   
In addition, simulation results suggest that unconjugated MMAE exposure is likely to be 
altered by 
 < 50% when polatuzumab vedotin is co-administered with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors or inducers.  Therefore, patients who receive concomitant medications that are strong CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
In summary, clinically relevant PK DDIs are unlikely to occur between lenalidomide, 
obinutuzumab, rituximab, and polatuzumab vedotin.  
SECTION 5.1.7:  Management of Specific Adverse Events  
Treatment delays apply to all toxicities described below; dose modifications apply only to 
toxicities that are considered to be related to lenalidomide or polatuzumab vedotin (only 
for peripheral neuropathy).  There will be no dose reductions of obinutuzumab  or 
rituximab.  For patients receiving obinutuzumab, if toxicity occurs before Cycle 1 
Day 8 or Cycle 1 Day 15, these doses of obin utuzumab will not be skipped but given 
after resolution of toxicity.    
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Polatuzuma b Vedotin Dose-Reduction Steps 
The dose of polatuzumab vedotin may be reduced due to neurotoxicity  only  according 
to the following dose reduction steps based on the starting dose (see Table 15 and Table 19). 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
40/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Lenalidomide Dose-Reduction Steps 
The dose of lenalidomide may be reduced in 5-mg increments one or two times  during 
induction or post-induction , depending on the starting dose, as outlined in Table 16.  
There will be no more than one dose reduction per treatment cycle.  If the lenalidomide 
dose is reduced to  [ADDRESS_1174101]-induction if considered safe per investigator 
judgment in consultation with the Sponsor.  In all other cases, i f the lenalidomide dose 
is reduced, re-escalation is not permitted. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Hematologic Tox icities during Induction Treatment 
Hematologic toxicity is defined as neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.  Lymphopenia is not considered a hematologic toxicity, but rather an expected outcome of therapy.   Table 16 provides guidelines for management of hematologic toxicities that 
occur during induction treatment, with the exception of Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 for 
patients receiving obinutuzumab.   Table 17 provides guidelines for management of 
hematologic toxicities that occur at Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, when patients are to receive treatment with obinutuzumab only. 
TABLE 17:  Guidelines for Manageme nt of Hematologic Toxicities That 
Occur during Induction Treatment (Except Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1  for 
Patients Receiving Obinutuzumab ) 
The Table 17 title has been revised to specify the cohort of patients receiving obinutuzumab.  The table has also been revised to include rituximab.

41/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION 5.2.3:  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Second malignancies 
 
SECTION 5.2.5:  Selected Adverse Events   
The following adverse events are considered selected adverse events: 
[…] 
• Secondary malignancies  
 
Events for which additional data collection will be required are PML and, hepatitis B 
reactivation, and secondary malignancies . 
SECTION 5.3.1:  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_1174102] dose of study treatment.  After this period, the investigator should report 
any serious adverse events that are belie ved to be related to prior study treatment and 
events of second malignancies for patients who received obinutuzumab (see 
Section 5.6). 
An exception is for the FL patients, where Grade 3 and 4 infections (both related and 
unrelated), which should be reported until up to [ADDRESS_1174103] dose of s tudy 
treatment . obinutuzumab.    
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1) that are attributed by [CONTACT_844946]/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All other on-study deaths, regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).  An independent monitoring 
committee ( IMC)  will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term 
"sudden death"  should be used only for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac c auses in a patient with or 
without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_1174104] seen alive 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
42/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death"  should not 
be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac 
death").  During survival follow up, deaths attributed to progression of lymphoma should 
be recorded only on the Study Completion/Early Dis continuation eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6.

SECTION 5.4:  IMMEDIATE RE PORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_1174105] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to any of the study treatments: 
• Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) 
• Non
serious  Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) 
• Dose-limiting toxicities (see Sect ion 5.4.2 for further details) 
• Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details) 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Events that O ccur after Study Treatment Initiation 
After initiation of study treatment, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until [ADDRESS_1174106] dose of study treatment.  After this 
period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be 
related to prior study treatment (see Section 5.6).  DLTs will be reported during the DLT 
assessment window.  Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
43/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A report will be 
generated and sent to [COMPANY_002] Safety Risk Management by [CONTACT_27950]. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_25750].  Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting events after the  post
study adverse events reporting period  are 
provided in Section 5.6. 
SECTION 5.6:  POST STUDY  ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER 
THE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING PERIOD   
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as [ADDRESS_1174107] dose of study treatment), if the event is believed to be related to 
prior study treatment.  The sponsor should also be notified of events of second 
malignancies after the end of the adverse event reporting period for patients who received obinutuzumab.   
An exception is for patients receiving obinutuzumab, where  Grade 3–4 infections (both 
related and unrelated), which 
should be reported until up to [ADDRESS_1174108] dose of 
study treatment. 
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either 
by [CONTACT_25752]/Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Form eCRF  using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.   
During survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of lymphoma should be 
recorded only on the Study Completion/Early Discontinuation eCRF. 
SECTION 5.7:  EXPEDITED REPORT ING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND ETHICS 
COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all seri ous adverse events and non-serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document: 
• Obinutuzumab Investigator's Brochure (Oncology) 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
44/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • Rituximab Investigator’s Brochure (Oncology) 
• Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure 
• Lenalidomide SmPC  
 
SECTION 6:  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non -randomized study will evaluate the safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of G  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R FL and 
R + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R or DLBCL . 
The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342].  
The dose-escalation phase will include  in FL patients only, and it  is designed to 
determine the RP2Ds for both polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide when combined with fixed doses  of obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory FL.
  The 
dose-escalation phase in DLBCL patients is designed to determine the RP2D of 
lenalidomide when combined with fixed doses  of polatuzumab vedo tin (1.8 mg/kg) and 
rituximab (375 mg/m2).  During the expansion phase, additional patients with R/R FL or 
DLBCL will undergo treatment with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomi de at their 
respective RP2Ds in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab . 
Study data will be summarized separately for each phase.  Data from the dose-escalation phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084] (assigned dose level).  Data from the expansion phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719] (i.e., FL or DLBCL).  Data will be summarized as warranted, and listings will be used in place of tables when the sample sizes are small. 
SECTION 6.1:  DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Limited dose finding will be conducted during the dose-escalation phase of this study.  The estimated sample size follows from the dose-escalation rules for a standard 3
 + 3 algorithm, as outlined in Section 3.1.  It is anticipated that enrollment of 5 or six 
cohorts of 3 −6 patients each, for a total of 18− 30 36 patients, will be required to establish 
the RP2D during the dose-escalation phase for patients with R/R FL.  An additional 3 possible cohorts of 3
−6 patients each, for a total of 12 −18 patients will be required to 
establish the RP2D during the dose-escalation phase for patients with R/R DLBCL.  
Approximately 80 patients (40 patients with FL and 40 patients with DLBCL) will be 
enrolled during the expansion phase.  Overall, approximately 110−128 98 −[ADDRESS_1174109] −defined CR at EOI. 
Data from completed and ongoing studies in similar disease settings will be used as historical controls for comparison.  Currently available data indicate that the historical CR rate based on PET-CT scans is 40% for R/R FL and DLBCL.   
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
45/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision for the 
point estimate and for the lower bound of the two-sided 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting probability of response of <
 55%, assuming an observed PET-CT −defined 
CR rate of 65% −70%.   
SECTION 6.2:  DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATION  
The following populations are defined: 
• The primary safety and efficacy populations will include patients who received at 
least one dose of any component of the combination.   
• The intent-to-treat population will includ e all patients enrolled in the study. 
 
SECTION 6.5:  SAFETY ANALYSES 
The safety analyses will include all treated patients (i.e., patients who received any 
amount of study treatment).  Data for patients in the dose-escalation phase will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_844947] , and data for patients in the expansion phase 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719] (FL or DLBCL).   
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events and changes from 
baseline in laboratory test results, shift-tables of ECGs findings, and vital signs. 
All adverse events occurring on or after fi rst study treatment will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_27940], appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE, Version 4.[ADDRESS_1174110]-treatment follow-up will be 
listed and summarized . 
Relevant laboratory and vital sign (temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood 
pressure) data results will be displayed by [CONTACT_5586], with Grade 3 and 4 values identified as 
appropriate. 
SECTION 6.6:  EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the primary efficacy 
population and the intent-to-treat population for  all patients enrolled in the expansion 
phase, with patients grouped according to histologic subtype , and will be performed by 
[CONTACT_1570].  In addition, patients with FL and DLBCL who received polatuzumab 
vedotin and lenalidomide at the RP2D during the dose-escalation phases will be pooled for analysis by [CONTACT_844948]. 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
46/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 SECTION 6.6.2:  Sec ondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The secondary efficacy analyses will be estimation of the proportion of patients 
achieving each of the following endpoints:  
• CR at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_817001]-CT scans 
• CR at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844949] 
• Objective response (defined as a CR or PR) at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844950]-CT scans 
• Objective response (defined as a CR or PR) at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844951] 
• Best response of CR or PR during the study, as determined by [CONTACT_844952], along with the corresponding two-sided 90% 
Clopper-Pearson exact CIs.  Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders. 
SECTION 6.6.3:  Explor atory Efficacy Endpoints  
Exploratory efficacy analyses will include estimation of the proportion of patients achieving each of the following endpoints:  
• For patients who have positive PET scans at EOI:   
– CR at [ADDRESS_1174111] scans , in FL patients 
– CR at EOC, as determined by [CONTACT_844953]-CT scans, in DLBCL patients 
 
SECTION 6.7:  PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES 
Plasma/serum concentrations of obinutuzumab, rituximab,  polatuzumab vedotin, and 
lenalidomide will be tabulated, summarized, and plotted after appropriate groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  As 
appropriate, PK parameters (e.g., area under the curve [AUC], time to maximum concentration [t
max], maximum concentration [C max], half-life [t 1/2]) may also be calculated, 
tabulated, and summarized after appropriate groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Additional PK and PK/PD analyses (e.g., population modelling including pooled analyses across studies) may also be performed as appropriate.  If done, these additional analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  At the discretion of the Sponsor, all analyses may be extended to include relevant biotransformat ion products of polatuzumab vedotin or 
lenalidomide. 
SECTION 6.8:  IMMU NOGENICITY ANALYSES 
The numbers and proportions of post-treatment HAHA-  or HACA-, and ATA-positive 
patients and HAHA-  or HACA-, and ATA-negative patients at baseline and during both 
the treatment and follow-up periods will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719].  Patients 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
47/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 are considered to be ATA positive if they are ATA negative at baseline but develop an 
ATA response following study treatment administration (treatment-induced ATA response) or if they are ATA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post-baseline samples is at least 4-fold greater (i.e., 
 ≥ 0.60 titer units) than the titer of the 
baseline sample (treatment-enhanced ATA response).  Patients are considered to be ATA negative if they are ATA negative at baseline and all post-baseline samples are negative or if they are ATA positive at baseline but do not have any post-baseline samples with a titer that is at least 4-fold greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). 
The relationship between HAHA  or HACA,  and ATA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and 
biomarker endpoints will be explored as appropriate. 
SECTION 6.10:  INTERIM ANALYSES 
It is anticipated that at least two interim analyses, one per histology, will be conducted 
during the expansion phase of the study, when at least [ADDRESS_1174112] −defined CR at EOI.  Additional analyses may be 
conducted to guide early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_844901]. 
During the expansion phase, a modified version of the predictive probability design 
(Lee and Lui 2008) may be used to guide early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_491790] a PET-CT −defined CR at EOI in each 
indication-specific expansion cohort  with that in historical controls.  Updated estimates 
for the assumed historical control PET-CT −defined CR rate will be available from 
currently ongoing studies by [CONTACT_844954].  The earliest interim 
analysis would occur after at least [ADDRESS_1174113]−defined 
CR at EOI   The design is based on Lee and Lui 2008, with the modification that the 
uncertainty in the historical control data is fully taken into account by [CONTACT_14662] a beta 
posterior on the control response rate.  Inte rim analysis decision rules will be based on 
the predicative probability that the trial will have a positive outcome if carried out to completion and will use the historical control data available at the time of analysis.   
If, at any time, an interim analysis suggests that the proportion of patients achieving a 
PET-CT −defined CR for one of the indication-specific expansion cohorts is lower or 
higher  than expected, the IMC will review the data and decide whether to recommend an 
early decision to stop enrollment in that subgroup.  Interim analysis decision rules will be 
based on the predictive proba bility that the trial will have a positive outcome if carried out 
to completion and will use the most current historical control data available at the time of 
analysis.  
Additional review of safety and/or effica cy data by [CONTACT_844955].  Further details regarding the rules and guidelines of data review will be provided to the IMC in an IMC charter.

Study Design  
Description of Study 
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, mu lticenter, non-randomized, dose-e scalation study will evaluate 
the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of G  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R FL and 
R + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R DLBCL .  The study will include an initial dose-escalation 
phase, followed by [CONTACT_171342], during which polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide 
will be given at their RP2Ds.   
All patients will be closely monitored for adverse  events throughout the study and for at least 
[ADDRESS_1174135] dose of study treatment.  Adverse events will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 
Version 4.0.  An Internal Monitoring Committ ee (IMC) will be establishe d to monitor patient 
safety throughout the study.   
To characterize the PK properties of obinutuzumab, rituximab,  polatuzumab vedotin, and 
lenalidomide, blood samples will be obtained at various timepoints before and during study 
treatment administration. 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
63/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Response will be determined by [CONTACT_844966] 2014 criteria.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be bas ed on IRC assessment of response.   
Number of Patients 
Approximately 110 −128 patients are expected be enrolled in  this study, at approximately 
20−[ADDRESS_1174136] meet the following criteria for study entry:

• For G  + Pola  + Len treatment group :  R/R  FL after treatment with at least one prior 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and 
for which no other more appropriate treatm ent option exists as determined by [CONTACT_1275] 
• For R  + Pola  + Len treatment group :  R/R DLBCL after treatment with at least one prior 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen  that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody  in 
patients who are not eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation or who have

autologous stem-cell transplantation 
• Histologically documented CD20-positive B- cell lymphoma as determined by [CONTACT_27396] 
• Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymphoma (i.e., PET-positive lymphoma) 
• At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion ( > 1.[ADDRESS_1174137] 
scan or magnetic resonance imaging) 
• Availability of a representative tumor spec imen and the corresponding pathology report for 
retrospective central confirmation of  the diagnosis of FL or DLBCL 
If the archival tissue is unavailable or unacceptable, a pretreatment core-needle, 
excisional, or incisional tumor biopsy is requi red.  Cytological or fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_844902].  
If the patient received anti-lymphoma treatment between the time of the most recent 
available biopsy and initiation of study treatment, a repeat core-needle biopsy is 
strongly recommended.   
• Agreement to abstain from donating blood durin g the treatment period (including periods of 
treatment interruption) and for [ADDRESS_1174138] dose of study treatment  
• Agreement not to share study medication with another person 
• Agreement to comply with all local requirements of the lenalidomide risk minimization plan 
In every country where lenalidomide has been approved, a risk minimization plan, 
which includes a pregnancy prevention program, is in place.  The risk minimization plan 
should be followed by [CONTACT_844938].   
US sites only:   Per standard Revlimid REMS™ requirements, all physicians who 
prescribe lenalidomide for research subjects en rolled into this study, and all research 
subjects enrolled into this study, must be  registered in and must comply with all 
requirements of the Revlimid REMS™ program.  
For Ex-US sites only:   Subjects will be counseled on pregnancy prevention prior to 
medication being dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied with all 
requirements including use of birth control and pregnancy testing and that the 
subject understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step will be 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
64/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 documented with a completed Education and Counseling Guidance Document (refer 
to Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plans), and no drug will be 
dispensed until this step occurs.  Counselin g includes verification with the subject 
that required pregnancy testing was pe rformed and results were negative.  A 
Lenalidomide Information Sheet (refer to Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk 
Management Plans) will be supplied with ea ch medication dispense.  All requirements 
must be followed by [CONTACT_844967]. 
In addition, because lenalidomide will be administered in combination with 
obinutuzumab,  rituximab,  and polatuzumab vedotin, patients must comply with 
contraceptive measures designed to ensure safe administration of all study treatments 
as outlined below.  
• For women of childbearing potential:  agr eement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use two  adequate methods of contraception, including at least 
one method with a failure rate of  < 1% per year, for at least [ADDRESS_1174139] dose of rituximab, and 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, during the treatment period 
(including periods of treatment interruption), and for at least [ADDRESS_1174140] dose of 
obinutuzumab.   
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( ≥
 24 continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus). 
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of   < 1% per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of progestogen-only hormonal 
contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and 
copper intrauterine devices.  Combined oral contraceptives are not recommended 
because of the increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism (TE) in patients 
taking lenalidomide. 
Barrier methods may be used as the second contraceptive method but must always be 
supplemented with the use of a spermicide. 
• The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.   For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain 
from heterosexual intercourse) or use contra ceptive measures and agreement to refrain 
from donating sperm, as defined below: 
With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of 
<
 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1174141] dose of 
obinutuzumab or rituximab  to avoid exposing the embryo.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifes tyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
Safety  
The safety analyses will include all treated pati ents (i.e., patients who received any amount of 
study treatment).  Data for pat ients in the dose-escalation pha se will be summarized by [CONTACT_844968] , and data for patients in the expansion phase will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_505719] (FL or DLBCL).  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events and changes from baseline in 
laboratory test results, shift-tables of ECGs findings, and vital signs. 
All adverse events occurring on or after first study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_335586], appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CT CAE, Version 4.[ADDRESS_1174151]-based Lugano 2014 criteria.  Point 
estimates will be presented, along with the corresponding two-sided 90% Clopper-Pearson 
exact CIs.  Patients without a post-baseli ne tumor assessment will be considered non 
responders. 
Determination of Sample Size   
Limited dose finding will be cond ucted during the dose-escalati on phase of this study.  The 
estimated sample size follows from the dose-escalation rules for a standard 3  + 3 algorithm.  It is 
anticipated that enrollment of 5 cohorts of 3 −6 patients each, for a total of 18 −30 patients, will 
be required to establish the RP2D during the dose-escalation phase  for patients with R/R FL.  
An additional 3 possible cohorts of 3 −6 patients each, for a total of 12 −18 patients will be 
required to establish the RP2D during the dose- escalation phase for patients with R/R DLBCL . 
Approximately 80 patients (40 patients with FL and 40 patients with DLBCL) will be enrolled 
during the expansion phase.  Overall, approximately 110−[ADDRESS_1174152] scans is 40% for R/R FL and DLBCL.   
A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision for the point 
estimate and for the lower bound of the two sided 90 % CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting 
probability of response of   < 55%, assuming an observed PET-CT-defined CR rate of 70%.

were an estimated 69,740 new cases and 19,020 deaths due to the disease in the [LOCATION_002] ( Siegel et al. 2013 ).  In Europe, there were an estimated 93,400 new 
cases and 3
7,900 deaths in 2012 ( Ferlay et al. 2013 ).  Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is most 
often of B-cell origin, including a wid
e range of different subtypes of B-cell lymphoma, 
broadly divided into indolent and aggressive lymphomas, each with unique characteristics. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1174158] of all B-cell lymphomas.  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent B-cell lymphoma, accounting for about 22% of all newly diagnosed cases of B-cell lymphoma (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998 ).  
Approximately 90% of the cases have a t(14:18) translocation, which ju xtaposes BCL2  
with the IgH locus and re
sults in deregulated expression of Bcl-2.  
FL remains an incurable disease with the currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The addition of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to commonly used induction chemotherapy, including CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or prednisone), CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), fludarabine, or bendamustine ( Zelenetz et al. 2014; Dreyling et al. 2014 ), followed by

nd improved patient 
outcomes.  Updated results from Study MO18264 confirmed the benefit of 2-year 
rituximab maintenance in patients responding to first-line immunotherapy, with a 6-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 59.2% compared with 42.7% in the observation arm (p
 < 0.0001) (Salles et al. 2013b). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_844903]-line treatment, most patients will eventually  relapse.  Relapses are characterized by 
[CONTACT_844971].  Thus, new treatments are needed to improve the outcome for these patients. 
1.1.2 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30% of all B-cell lymphomas diagnosed 
annually (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998 ).  The use of immunochemotherapy, most 
co 
mmonly rituximab  + CHOP (R-CHOP), for newly diagnosed DLBCL led to a significant 
improvement in survival in patients of all age groups.  In older patients ( > 60 years), 
R-CHOP was associated with a 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 57% and a 10-year survival rate of 43.5% ( Coiffier et al. 2010 ).  In younger patients (18 −60 years) 
with favorable prognostic features, R-CHOP de
monstrated a 3-year EFS rate of 79% 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
75/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 and survival rates of 93% and 74.3% at 3 and 6 years, respectively ( Pfreundschuh et al. 
2011 ).  However, nearly 40% of patients with DLBCL will eventually die o
f relapsed 
disease or disease that is refractory to first-line therapy.  Patients with a high-risk 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) have a 5-year PFS rate of only 40% following treatment with R-CHOP ( Zhou et al. 2014). 
Second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844904]-d ose chemotherapy regimens such 
as R-ICE 
(rituximab plus ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) or R-DHAP (rituximab plus cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside, and dexamethasone) followed by [CONTACT_20375]-cell transplantation (SCT).  Approximately half of patients do not achieve a complete remission after salvage treatment ( Gisselbrecht et al. 2010 ).  Moreover, elderly patients 
or patients with comorbidities are 
often deemed ineligible for this aggressive therapy. 
Specific molecular subsets of DLBCL are associated with an inferior outcome following R-CHOP therapy.  Patients with germinal center B cell −like (GCB) DLBCL had a better 
prognosis than patients with activated (non-germinal) B cell −like (ABC) DLBCL, with a 
3-year survival rate of 84% versus 56%, respectively (p
 < 0.001) (Lenz et al. 2008).  
Several genetic abnormalities predictive of poor outcome have been identified in DLBCL, including MY
C rearrangement, BCL2  and BCL6 overexpression, and TP53 mutations.  
Rearrangement in MYC  (MYC -positive DLBCL) has been reported in 9% −17% of DLBCL 
cases and often correlates with the GCB DLBCL phenotype (Savage et al. 2009 ; 
Barrans et al. 2010).  Patients with MYC -negative  DLBCL who receive R-CHOP have  a 
5−year survi
val rate that is markedly worse than patients with MYC -positive DLBCL who 
receive R-CHOP (33% vs. 72%, respectively; Savage et al. 2009).  Concurrent MYC  and 
IGH-BCL2 rearrangement ("double-hit" DLBCL), observed in 2% −11% of patients wit h 
DLBCL, represents a DL
BCL subset with an inferior outcome (5-year PFS of 18%; 
5-year survival of 27%) ( Savage et al. 2009 ; Dunleavy et al. 2014 ).  Mutations in TP53 
have been described in approximate
ly 20% of patients with DLBCL ( Lossos and 
Morgensztern 2006 ) and are strong predictors of poor overall survival (OS; Young et al. 
2008 ; X
u-Monette et al. 2012 ). 
DLBCL remains a high unmet medi cal need for 
which novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_491763] R-CHOP. 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON OBINUTUZUMAB 
Obinutuzumab (also known as GA101) is a novel glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 antibody.  Compared with rituximab, obinutuzumab is characterized by [CONTACT_844972] B-cell death induction and increased affinity for Fc γRIII receptors expressed on 
natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and monocytes, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (Beers et al. 2010; Mössner et al. 2010; Herter et al. 2014 ).  Together, these 
characteristics confer ob inutuzumab with
 enhanced immune effector functions and B-cell 
depleting activity compared with rituximab.  

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
76/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Obinutuzumab is approved for use in combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of 
patients with previously untreated ch ronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).   Obinutuzumab 
is also approved for use in combination with bendamustine followed by [CONTACT_844922] a rituxima b-containing regimen.
   
1.2.1 Nonclinical Studi es with Obinutuzumab  
In nonclinical studies, obinutuzumab demonstrat ed superior depletion of normal B cells 
(measured as CD19+ depletion) from the blood of healthy volunteers ( Mössner et al. 
2010 ) as well as malignant B cells from  the blood of patients 
with CLL ( Patz et al. 2011 ).  
Nonclinical xenograft experiments performed wit
h obinutuzumab as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy have consist ently showed promising anti-tumor activity 
of obinutuzumab ( Mössner et al. 2010 ; Dalle et al. 2011) and have demonstrated the 
superiority of obinutuzu m
ab over rituximab ( Herting et al. 2014 ). 
For more detailed nonclinical information on obinutuzumab, please refer to the curre nt 
version of the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.2.2 Clinical Studies with Obinutuzumab  
As of 4 July 2016 , clinical data from [COMPANY_002]-sponsored studies on obinutuzumab are 
available from 13 clinical studies:   8 Phase I or II studies (BO20999, BO21003, 
JO21900, BO21000, GAO4915g, GAO4779g, YP25623, and GAO4768g), and 5 Phase III studies (GAO4735g, BO21004/CLL11, MO28543, BO21223, and BO21005).   
Available efficacy results from the non-H odgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cohorts in these 
studies and available safety results from all patients are summarized below  
For more detailed clinical information on obinutuzumab, including results in the CLL cohorts of the clinical studies and clinical pharmacology data, please refer to the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy of Obinut uzumab in Patients with B-Cell 
Lymphoma 
In studies of obinutuzumab monotherapy in pati ents with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-
cell lymphoma (Studies BO20999, BO21003, and JO21900), the proportion of patients 
who had a response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) at the end of treatment (as determined on the basis of computed tomography [CT] scans alone) ranged from 28% to 58%.  The CR rate ranged from 0% to 19%.  
In early studies of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (e.g., CHOP, 
bendamustine) in patients with previously unt reated, or R/R B-cell lymphoma (Studies 
BO21000, GAO4915g, and GAO4753g), the proportion of patients with a CR or PR at 
the end of induction (EOI) treatment ranged from 69% to 96%.  The CR rate was higher with combination therapy (35% −39% in previously untreated FL, 39%− 50% in R/R FL, 
and 55% in previously untreated DLBCL) than with monotherapy.

77/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Phase III Study GAO4753g investigated obin utuzumab plus bend amustine (G-benda) 
compared with bendamustine alone in patients  with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL 
(iNHL; n  = 396).  Patients in the G-benda arm  who had not experienced disease 
progression at EOI received obinutuzumab monotherapy every 2 months for up to 
2 years.  On the basis of positive result s from this study, demonstrating significant 
improvement in PFS in the G-benda arm, with  a median investigator-assessed PFS of 
29 versus 14 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; p < 0.0001; 
Sehn et al. 2015 ), ob inu tuzumab was granted approval for use in patients with FL who 
did not respond to or who progressed during or after treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (see Section 1.2).   
Phase III Study BO21223 investigated obi nutuz uma
b plus chemotherapy (G-benda, 
obinutuzumab plus CVP [G-CVP], obinutuzumab plus CHOP [G-CHOP]) compared 
with rituximab plus chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_844923] (FL cohort, n
 = 1202).  On the 
basis of positive results that demonstrated significant improvement in PFS in the obinutuzumab chemotherapy arm, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study be unblinded to the Sponsor at a pre-planned interim analysis (Marcus et al. 2016 ). 
Phase III Study BO21005 investigated G-CHOP  comp
ared with rituximab plus CHOP 
(R-CHOP) in patients with previously untre ated DLBCL.  The study did not meet its 
primary endpoint of PFS at final analysis.  Based upon  the BO21005 efficacy results, 
this study protocol is amended to cease eval uating obinutuzumab in patients with R/R 
DLBCL; these patients will receive instead rituximab in combination with polatuzumab 
vedotin and lenalidomide ( Vitolo et al. 2016 ).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety of Obinutuzumab 
As of 4 July 2016 , an estimated 3636 patients with B-cell lymphoma (including DLBCL, 
indolent B-cell lymphoma, and CLL) had been treated with obinutuzumab given as monotherapy or in combination with CHOP, bendamustine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil, at doses ranging from [ADDRESS_1174159] frequent causes of death were disease progression and adverse events 
associated with infectious diseases.  This is consistent with the study population and the disease under treatment.  In Study GAO4768g (obinutuzumab 1000 mg vs. 2000 mg), the incidence of deaths did not increase with increased obinutuzumab dose (7.5% and 2.6%, respectively). 
Of particular interest, a high incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) was observed 
consistently in all obinutuzumab trials.  The reported incidence of IRRs varied across studies.  In the CLL population, the incidence ranged from 66% in previously untreated 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
78/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 patients receiving obinutuzumab plus chlora mbucil (Study BO21004) to 100% in patients 
with R/R disease who received obinutuzumab monotherapy (pooled data from Studies 
BO21003 and BO20999, CLL cohorts).   
In the B-cell lymphoma population, the incidence of IRRs in studies of obinutuzumab 
monotherapy was 75.1% (pooled data from Study BO21003 and from high-dose B-cell lymphoma cohorts from Study BO20999).  In  studies of obinutuzumab in combination 
with either CHOP (Study GAO4915g) or bendamustine (Study BO21000), the incidence of IRRs, regardless the relationship with obinutuzumab, was 70% −78%. 
Other important risks associated or potentially associated with obinutuzumab are tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), thrombocytopeni a (including acute thrombocytopenia), 
neutropenia, prolonged B-cell depletion, infections (including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML] and hepatitis B virus [HBV] reactivation), worsening of preexisting cardiac conditions, gastrointesti nal (GI) perforation, impaired immunization 
response, immunogenicity, and second malignanc ies.  The important identified risks 
associated with obinutuzumab are presented in detail in Section 5.1.1 of this protocol 
and in the Obinutuzumab Investigator's Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmaco kinetics of Obinutuzumab  
A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model composed of a linear clearance pathway and a nonlinear, time-varying clearance pathway adequately described serum obinutuzumab concentration data.  Terminal obinutuzumab clearance and half-life are approximately 0.09 L/day and 28.[ADDRESS_1174160] is consistent with the catabolism of IgG antibodies and is therefore independent of CD20-positive cells.  Additional details can be found in the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3 BACKGROUND ON PO LATUZUMAB VEDOTIN 
CD79b is a cell-surface antigen whose expression is restricted to all mature B cells except plasma cells.  It is expressed in a majority of B-cell-derived malignancies, including nearly all B-cell lymphoma and CLL samples tested ( Dornan et al. 2009 ).  
Antibodies bound to CD79b are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_570580], which makes CD79b ideally suited for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents ( Polson et al. 2007 ; Polson et al.  2009

a humanized IgG1 anti −human CD79b monoclonal antibody (MCDS4409A) and a potent 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
79/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 anti-mitotic agent, mono-methyl auristatin E (MMAE), linked through a protease-labile 
linker, maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl.   
MMAE has a mode of action that is similar to that of vincristine, which is a component of 
standard chemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP used for treatment of lymphoma).  Following binding at the cell-surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_844905], MMAE is released following cleavage of the linker by [CONTACT_570622].  MMAE then binds to tubulin and disrupts the microtubule network, resulting in inhibition of cell 
division and cell growth ( Doronina et al. 2003).  This therapeu tic 
 approach takes 
advantage of the specific targeting capability of the antibody, the cytotoxic activity of MMAE, and the increased potency of MMAE compared with vincristine.  It is hypothesized that polatuzumab vedotin in combination with other novel agents will provide enhanced efficacy and safety to patients with B-cell lymphoma. 
1.3.1 Nonclinical Studies with Polatuzumab Vedotin  
Comprehensive pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicology studies were conducted to support the entry of polatuzumab vedotin into clinical trials.  Because polatuzumab vedotin  specifically recognizes CD79b on B cells of 
humans ⎯but not on those of the cynomolgus monkey, rat, or mouse ⎯a surrogate ADC 
(DCDS5017A) that binds to cynomolgus monkey CD79b was generated to assess the antigen-dependent activities in cynomolgus monkeys.  The structure, binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and binding affinity of the surrogate ADC are similar to that of polatuzumab vedotin.  Polatuzumab vedotin has demonstrated effica cy in nonclinical murine xenograft models 
of human CD79b-positive B-cell lymphoma.  Additionally, when combined with rituximab plus chemotherapy (rituximab in combinati on with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone or prednisolone [CHP] or  bendamustine), polatuzumab vedotin 
demonstrated better anti-tumor activity compar ed with polatuzumab vedotin as single 
agent or compared with a current standard-of-c are regimen (R-CHOP or rituximab plus 
bendamustine) in xenograft models of B- cell lymphoma.  The pharmacokinetics and 
safety of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC were characterized in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  Polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC were well tolerated in both species at the tested doses.  The predominant antigen-independent findings asso ciated with polatuzumab vedotin or the 
surrogate ADC exposure were reversible bone marrow toxicity and associated peripheral blood cell effects in both monkeys and rats.  The PK profiles of polatuzumab vedotin and the surrogate ADC suggested that the pharmacokinetics of the ADC were driven mainly by [CONTACT_570623] (similar serum concentration −time profile between the ADC 
and total monoclonal antibody).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy of Polatuzu mab Vedotin in Patients with B-Cell 
Lymphoma 
Polatuzumab vedotin demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent.  In Study DCS4968g, at the 2.4-mg/kg dose, objective responses (CR or PR) were observed in 7 of 16 patients (44%) with R/R indolent B-cell lymphoma (FL, marginal zone lymphoma [MZL], or small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL]) and 14 of 27 patients 
(52%) with R/R DLBCL.  At a dose of 1.8 mg/kg, a PR was observed in 2 of 4 patients 
with DLBCL and in 2 of 2 patients with MCL, and no objective responses were observed 
in the 5 patients with CLL.  The median duration of response was 6.2 months (95% CI: 3.3, 19.3 months) for the 2.4-mg/kg dose an d 6.6 months (95% CI: 2.3, 11.4 months) 
for the 1.8-mg/kg dose.  At the 2.4-mg/kg dose, median PFS was 7.9 months (95% CI: 3.0, 11.6 months) for patients with indolent B-cell lympho ma and 5.0 months (95% CI: 
2.3, 6.8 months) for patients with DLBCL.  Median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI: 1.4, 13.9 months) for patients with DLBC L treated at the 1.8-mg/kg dose. 
Polatuzumab vedotin also demonstrated clinical activity when administered in combination with rituximab.  In Study DCS 4968g, at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg, objective 
responses were observed in 7 of 9 patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL, or MCL (78%); 2 of those 7 patients had CRs.  Median duration of response among these patients was 12.3 months (95% CI: 4.3, not estimable [NE]).  Median PFS was 12.5 months (95% CI:  6.9, 17.4 months).

81/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Preliminary data show that for patients in Study GO27834 who received polatuzumab 
vedotin (2.4 mg/kg) in combination with rituximab overall responses were observed in 
14 of 20 patients with R/R FL (70%; 9 patients with CRs) and 21 of 39 patients with R/R 
DLBCL ( 54%;8 patients with CRs).  For patients who received polatuzumab vedotin 
(1.8mg/kg) in combination with rituximab, objective responses were observed in 15 of 
20 patients with FL (75%; 6 patients with CRs).   
Median duration of response was 12.9 mont hs (95% CI: 6.7, NE) and 13.2 months 
(95% CI: 7.2, 21.2) for pati ents who received polatuzumab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg (FL) or 
2.4 mg/kg (FL or DLBCL), respectively.  At the 2.4 mg/kg dose, median PFS was 
15.1 months (95% CI: 11.8, NE) among the 20 patients with FL and 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, 12.7 months) among the 39 patients with DLBCL.  Among the 20 patients with 
R/R FL treated with 1.8 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab, the median PFS was 18.1 months (95% CI: 9.9, NE).   
For patients in Study GO27834 who received polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in 
combination with obinutuzumab, overall responses were observed in 8 of 12 patients 
with R/R FL (67%; 1 patient with CR) and 3 of 15 patients with R/R DLBCL (20%; 0 
patients with CR).   
Preliminary data from  Study GO29044 in patients trea ted with polatuzumab vedotin 
(1.0
−1.8 mg/kg) in combination with R-CHP showed overall responses in 29 of 
31 patients (94%; 24 patients with CRs).  Wh en polatuzumab vedotin (1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg) 
was combined with G-CHP, overall responses were seen in 10 of 12 patients (83%; 
10 patients with CRs).   
Preliminary data f rom GO29365 in FL patients treate d with polatuzumab vedotin 
(1.8 mg/kg) in combination with bendamustine showed overall responses in 7 of 
7 patients (100%; 2 patients with CRs) when combined with rituximab and in 3 of 
4 patients (75%; 1 patient with CR) when combined with obinutuzumab.  Patients with DLBCL treated with polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in combination with bendamustine showed overall responses in 3 of 7 patients (43%; 2 patients with CRs) when combined with rituximab and in 6 of 8 patients (75%; 2 patient with CR) when 
combined with obinutuzumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety of Polatuzumab Vedotin 
Clinical safety data are available from 327 patients with B-cell lymphoma or CLL who 
received polatuzumab vedotin as a single  agent (DCS4968g), in  combination with 
rituximab (DCS4968g and GO27834), in combination with obinutuzumab (GO27834), in combination with G-CHP or R-CHP (GO29044), or in combination with 
obinutuzumab or rituximab plus bendamusti ne (GO29365).  
In Study DCS4968g, Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 74% of patients with 
R/R B-cell lymphoma who received single −agent polatuzumab vedotin; the most 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
82/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 common (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients) Grade ≥  3 adverse events were neutropenia 
(38% of patients), anemia and peripheral sensory neuropathy (9% each), and 
leukopenia (6%).   
In the dose-escalation phase of Study DCS4968g, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 of 10 DLT-evaluable patients treated with 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin and 1 of 9 DLT-evaluable patients treated with 2.4 mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab.  Polatuzumab vedoti n at a dose of 
2.4 mg/kg given every 3 weeks (Q3W) was chosen as the recommended Phase II dose 
(RP2D) when administered as a single agent and in combination with rituximab.  Due to 
additional information about the benefit-risk profile of polatuzumab vedotin at the 
2.4 mg/kg dose, the Sponsor is no longer pu rsuing the clinical development of the 2.4-
mg/kg dose of polatuzumab vedotin. 
The overall safety profile of polatuzum ab vedotin (1.8- and 2.4-mg/kg doses) in 
combination with rituximab was comparable to that of single −agent polatuzumab vedotin.  
In Study GO27834, the most frequent ( ≥ 5%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were 
neutropenia (19 of 79 patients [24%]), diarrhea (5 of 79 patients [6%]), and febrile 
neutropenia (4 of 79 patients [5%]).  No fatal adverse events were reported for the combination.   
Serious adverse events were reported for 37% of all patients treated with polatuzumab 
vedotin alone or in combination with rituximab in Studies DCS4968g and GO27834 combined.  The most frequently reported (≥  2%) serious adverse events were febrile 
neutropenia (5%), pyrexia (4%), and diarrhea (2%).  In Studies DCS4968g and GO27834 combined, 33%  to  41% of patients discontinued polatuzumab vedotin 
because of an adverse event.  The most frequently reported adverse events leading to discontinuation were peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral motor neuropathy. 
In Study GO29044, Grade 
≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 19 of 40 patients (48%) 
with B-cell lymphoma who received polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in combination 
with G-CHP or R-CHP.  The most frequent events ( ≥ 10% of patients) were fatigue 
(33%), diarrhea (33%), and nausea (30%).  Serious adverse events were reported for 33% of patients in this treatment group. 
In Study GO29365, Grade  
≥ 3 adverse events were reported in 11 of 21 patients (52%) 
with B-cell lymphoma who received polatuzumab vedotin in combination with 
rituximab plus bendamustine and in 17 of 28 patients (61%) who received polatuzumab 
vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine.  The most frequent events (
≥ 10% of patients) were nausea (43%), diarrhea (41%), and fatigue (35%).  
Serious adverse events were reported for 33% of patients receiving polatuzumab vedotin in combination with  rituximab plus bendamusti ne and 39% of patients 
receiving polatuzumab vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine.

polatuzumab vedotin and 33 de aths in patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin 
combined with rituximab or obinutuzumab.  The majority of deaths were judged as 
related to disease progression. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokine tics of Polatuzumab Vedotin 
The pharmacokinetics of antibody-conjugated MMAE (acMMAE), total antibody (TAb), and unconjugated MMAE appear to be dose-proportional across the dose range of 0.1−2.4 mg/kg of polatuzumab vedotin.  At the polatuzumab vedotin dose level of 
2.4 mg/kg, mean half-life values range from 5.2 to 6.3 days for acMMAE and from 6.2 to 8.1 days for TAb.  The mean clearance values range from 16.2 to 23.8 mL/day/kg for acMMAE and from 11.4 to 28.0 mL/day/kg for TAb, which suggests that the disposition of acMMAE, as characterized by a small steady-state volume of distribution and slow clearance, is largely dominated by [CONTACT_570625].  Across doses tested (0.1−2.4 mg/kg), the exposure of acMMAE (e.g., C
max, AUC inf) is, on average, 100 to 
150- and ~50-fold higher than the corresponding unconjugated MMAE exposure.  MMAE peak concentrations are reached 2 −3 days after dosing.  The mean half-life for 
unconjugated MMAE is 2.9 −6.[ADDRESS_1174162] the PK of acMMAE, TAb, and unconjugated MMAE in the R/R  BCL 
patient population. 
1.4 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Progress has been made in the treatment of  FL and DLBCL; however, a significant 
number of patients will relapse or die of progression or treatment-related toxicity.  
Patients who relapse after receiving several prior treatments may not be able to tolerate 
more bone marrow toxicity, thereby [CONTACT_844973].  There is a need for the continued development of safe and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844906]-line therapy.  
This study will evaluate the activity of a novel triplet combination of obinutuzumab or 
rituximab plus  polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide. 
B-cell lymphomas, including FL and DLBCL,  express the CD20 antigen, and anti-CD20 
therapy (rituximab) has been demonstrated to provide enhanced anti-tumor activity when 
given in combination with other agents, leading to increased response rates, PFS, and OS (Coiffier et al. 2002; Coiffier et al. 2007; Coiffier et al. 2010 ; Feugier et al. 2005; 
Hiddemann et al. 2005 ; Habermann  et  al. 2006; Herold et al. 2007 ; Marcus et al. 2008; 
Pfreundschuh et al. 2008; Salles et al. 2008 ).  This has led to the accept ance of 
rituximab as a standard 
component in initial therapy.   
Obinutuzumab has shown superiority over rituximab in a Phase III study in first-line CLL 
(Goede et al. 2014).  Obinutuz umab  showed clinical benefit compared to rituximab 
when combined with chemotherapy in a Phase III trial (BO21223) in patients with 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
84/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 previously untreated indolent B-cell lymphomas, including FL ( Marcus et al. 2016 ).  A 
Phase III study, GAO475
3g, evaluated patients with rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell 
lymphoma, including patients with FL, and showed improvement in PFS with  
obinutuzumab  added to bendamustine followed by [CONTACT_844974] ( Sehn et al. 2015 ). Obinutuzumab will be included 
as the anti- CD20 backbone for patie
nts with R/R FL in this study.   
Obinutuzumab did not show superiority compared to rituximab in the Phase III trial (BO21005) comparing R-CHOP to  G-CHOP in patients wi th previously untreated 
DLBLC ( Vitolo et al. 2016 ).  Based upon the BO21005 efficacy 
 results, this study 
protocol is amended, and patients with R/R DLBCL will receive rituximab as the anti-CD20 backbone in combinat ion with polatuzumab ve dotin and lenalidomide.   
In addition to the potential for obinutuzumab as the next-generation anti-CD20 therapy to enhance the efficacy of current standard immunochemotherapy regimens in patients with FL, ADCs may have added benefit when combined with standard systemic chemotherapy, or replace these agents, in certain lymphoma combination regimens.  Polatuzumab vedotin is an ADC designed for the targeted delivery of MMAE, a potent microtubule inhibitor to lymphoma cells expressing CD79b.  MMAE has a mechanism of action similar to that of vincristine and is hypothesized to be a more targeted therapy.  To date, Phase Ib/II data suggest that polatuzumab vedotin in combination with rituximab has activity in R/R FL and DLBCL, with a generally acceptable safety and tolerability profile.  Additionally, several ongoing Phase Ib/II studies are assessing the safety and clinical activity of the combination of obinutuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin alone and in combination with chemotherapy (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details).  
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is a pote nt immuno
modulatory agent with activity 
in lymphoid malignancies occurring primarily through immune modulation and direct anti-tumor effects.  Although lenalidomide has not been approved for the treatment of R/R FL and DLBCL, clinical activity has been demonstrated with lenalidomide as a single agent (Wiernik et al. 2008 ; Witzig et al. 2009 , 2011 ) or in combination with 
rituximab ( Zinzani et al. 2011 , 2013 ; Leonard et al. 2012 ; Tuscano et al. 
2014 ; 
Wang et al. 2013 ).  Obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide is currently being 
evaluated in an ongoing Phase Ib/II study sponsored by [CONTACT_844975] (GALEN study) in patients with R/R FL and aggressive lymphoma (DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma  [MCL]).  This study evaluated a fixed 
dose of obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide doses of 10 −25 mg/day.  
Preliminary data indicate a manageable safety profile.  An increased incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported.  Of the 19 evaluable patients, 13 (68%) achieved an overall response (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for details).   
On the basis of the distinct mechanisms of action (MOAs) for each molecule and the current available clin ical 
data, there is a strong rationale to expect an improved 
benefit-risk profile with the triplet combination of obinutuzumab or rituximab plus  

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
85/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174163] also been associated with neutropenia.  The replacement of rituximab with obinutuzumab (Study GO27834 [obinutuzumab plus polatuzumab vedotin {G
 + Pola}] and GALEN [obinutuzumab plus lenalidomide {G  + Len}]) in these doublets is 
anticipated to be associated with treatment-related neutropenia.  Patients with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844887]; such events are expected to be manageable in the clinical setting, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are unlikely to occur (see Sections 5.1.5 and 5.1.6 ).

3.1.1 Overview of Study  
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalation study will 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of G  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R 
FL and R  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R  DLBCL.    
The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342], during which polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide will be given at their RP2Ds (see Sections 3.1.2 and [IP_ADDRESS]).   
Approximately 110
−128 patients are expected be enrolled in this study, at approximately 
20−[ADDRESS_1174165] dose of study treatment (see Section 5.3.1).  Adverse events 
will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Co mmon Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI
 CTCAE), Version 4.0.  An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) 
will be established to monitor patient safety throughout the study (see Section 3.1.4 ).   
To characterize the PK properties of obinutuzumab, ritux i
mab, polatuzumab vedotin, 
and lenalidomide, blood samples will be obtained at various timepoints before and 
during study treatment administration. 
Response will be determined by [CONTACT_26732] (see Section 3.1.5) and the investigator using 
the Lugano 2014 criteria.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on
 IRC 
assessment of response.  Refer to Section 4.5.5 for details on tumor assessments. 
Schedules of assessments are provided in Appendix 1 , Appendix 2
, and Appendix 3.  
The Lugano Response Criteria are provided in Appendix 5 .

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-Escalation Phase 
The purpose of the FL dose-escalation phase is to identify the RP2D for polatuzumab 
vedotin and the RP2D for lenalidomide when combined with a fixed dose  of 
obinutuzumab as induction treatment.  This dose-escalation phase will include 
FL patients only; these patients may receive post-induction treatment if eligible (see 
Section 3.3.1).   
Approximately 18 −30 
patients will be enrolled in the FL dose-escalation phase.  Cohorts 
of 3− 6 patients each will be treated in accordance with the treatment regimens and 
dose-escalation rules described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3. 
Patients will be closely monitored for adv erse events during the DLT asse
ssment 
window, defined as the first treatment cycle (from Day 1 of Cycle 1 to Day 1 of Cycle 2).  Adverse events meeting the criteria for DLT, as defined below (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ), 
will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours ( s 
ee Section 5.4.2).  
Patients experiencing a DLT during the DLT assessment period may co n
tinue receiving 
study treatment once the event has resolved, if determined by [CONTACT_844920].   
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window 
for reasons other than a DLT will be considered non-evaluable for dose-escalation decisions and RP2D assessments and will be replaced by [CONTACT_844930].  Patients who miss 1 or more doses of polatuzumab vedotin or 
obinutuzumab  or 5 consecutive daily doses of lenalidomide during the DLT assessment 
window for reasons other than a DLT will also be replaced and considered non-evaluable 
for dose-escalation decisions.   Patients who receive supportive care during the DLT 
assessment window that may confound the evaluation of DLTs may be replaced at the 
discretion of the Medical Monitor.

a Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 1000 mg.  During 
Cycle 1, obinutuzumab will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15.  During Cycles 2 −6, 
obinutuzumab will be administered on Day 1 only. 
b Polatuzumab vedotin will be administered in travenously on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. 
c Lenalidomide will be administered orally on Days 1 −21 of each 28-day cycle.  
 
Dose escalation will occur in accordance with the rules listed below. 
• A minimum of [ADDRESS_1174173] 48 hours apart.    
• If none of the first 3 DLT-evaluable patients experiences a DLT, the doses in that 
cohort will be deemed safe and tolerable and escalation may continue per the 
dose-escalation plan described above. 
• If [ADDRESS_1174174] 6 DLT-evaluable 
patients, the doses in that cohort will be deemed safe and tolerable and escalation may continue per the dose-escalation plan described above. 
• If a DLT is observed in ≥  33% of patients (e.g., 2 or more of up to 6 DLT-evaluable 
patients), the dose combination at which this occurs will be considered intolerable 
and the MTD will have been exceeded for polatuzumab vedotin and/or lenalidomide 
in the G
 + Pola  + Len treatment combination.  However, enrollment may continue in 
alternative cohorts according to the dose-escalation plan described above. 
• If the MTD is exceeded in any cohort, the highest dose combination at which < 33% 
of patients (e.g., 2 of 6 DLT-evaluable patients) experience a DLT will be declared 
the combination MTD (i.e., the MTDs for polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide in 
the G  + Pola  + Len treatment combination). 
• If the MTD is not exceeded at any dose level, the highest dose combination 
administered in this study will be decla red the maximum administered dose for 
polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide in the G  + Pola  + Len treatment combination. 
 
If the MTD is exceeded in any cohort, de-escalation of the polatuzumab vedotin dose 
and/or the lenalidomide dose and adjustment of treatment schedules (e.g., lenalidomide 
treatment on Days 1− 10) may occur.  It is possible that more than one combination MTD 
(i.e., potential RP2Ds) will be identified, which may consist of different dose or schedule 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
95/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 combinations for polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide that are deemed safe and 
tolerable when combined with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab.  If this occurs, it is possible 
that more than one expansion cohort will be enrolled to gather additional safety, PK, and PD data at these RP2Ds and schedules.  Additional patients may be enrolled in a given cohort in the absence of DLTs to acquire additional safety data for the appropriate dose levels in the expansion phase of the study. 
On the basis of a review of real-time safety data and available preliminary PK data, dose 
escalation may be halted or modified by [CONTACT_422872]. 
Relevant demographic, adverse event, laboratory, dose administration/intensity, and PK 
(if available) data will be reviewed throughout the study by [CONTACT_844932]-escalation decisions, which will be made by [CONTACT_844977]  [INVESTIGATOR_816985].    
Although the DLT assessment window is defined as the first treatment cycle, cumulative or late  toxicities occurring beyond the first cycle may be considered when determining 
the RP2Ds.  Prior to opening the R/R FL expansion phase, the Clinical Study Team and 
the Medical Monitor will review the cumulative data, recommend the RP2D, and review this with the IMC for approval.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Follicular Lymphoma  Expansion Phase 
The expansion phase is designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide at their respective RP2Ds when combined with a 
fixed dose of obinutuzumab in FL patients.  
Approximately 40 patients with FL will be enrolled during the expansion phase and 
treated as described below. 
All patients enrolled in the expansion phase will receive induction treatment as outlined 
in Table 4.  When study treatments are given on the same day, they will be administered 
sequentially in the following order:  le nalidomide, obinutuzumab, and polatuzumab 
vedotin.

during the study.  At the time of each review, the IMC will make appropriate 
recommendations (e.g., the study should continue as planned, additional analyses 
should be performed, or enrollment should be held pending further safety evaluations).  
Decisions will be made in consideration of the totality of the available data.  Ad hoc 
meetings may be called in addition to scheduled meetings, as necessary, to provide 
recommendations on management of any potential new safety signals.  Specific 
operational details such as the committee's composition, frequency and timing of 
meetings, members' roles and responsibilities, and data to be reviewed will be detailed 
in an IMC charter.

Patients who experience disease progression will be evaluated for survival status and initiation of new anti-lymphoma treatm ent every 3 months until the end of the 
study.  Details are provided in the schedules of assessments (see Appendix 1 and 
Appendix 2). 
3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY 
The end of this study is defined as the time when both of the following criteria are met: 
• All enrolled patients with FL have been followed for at least [ADDRESS_1174181]  
completed or discontinued study treatment (including induction treatment and 
maintenance treatment as applicable).  
• All enrolled patients with DLBCL have been followed for at least [ADDRESS_1174182] completed or discontinued study treat ment (including induction treatment and 
consolidation treatment as applicable). 
 
The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is 
expected to be approximately 5 years.

103/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174183]-line treatment, FL remains essentially an incurable 
disease.  Patients invariably relapse, and subse
quent active and well-tolerated agents 
are needed.  DLBCL can be cured in >  50% of cases; however, up to one-third of 
patients have refractory disease of relapse after treatment.  Success rates with salvage therapy and autologous transplantation are poor, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for these patients. 
On the basis of a compelling biologic and clinical rationale, as presented in Section 1.4, 
the addition of polatuzum ab vedotin
 to obinutuzumab or rituximab  and lenalidomide is a 
promising approach to expand the number of patients with R/R FL and DLBCL who 
achieve remission and to prolong response duration in these patients. 
The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342].  
The objective of the dose-escalation phase is to define the RP2D for lenalidomide and 
the RP2D dose for polatuzumab vedotin when given with obinutuzumab  in patients with 
R/R FL and the RP2D for lenalidomide when given in combination with polatuzumab 
at 1.8 mg/kg and rituximab at 375 mg/m2 in patients with R/R DLBCL.  Although the 
DLT assessment window is the first cycle of treatment, long-term or cumulative toxicities will also be assessed and considered for the dose definition.

As discusse d 
in Section 1.4, the development of obinutuzumab in B-cell malignancies is 
based on the hypothesis that obinutuzumab will be a superio r anti-CD20 agent 
compared to rituximab 
in patients with FL .  This has been demonstrated in CLL 
(Goede et al. 2014) and has been  studie d in two additional Phase III studies in DLBCL 
and FL.   
Study BO21223 investigated obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy (G-benda, G-CVP, 
G-CHOP) compared with rituximab plus chem otherapy, followed by [CONTACT_844978] , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

in the obinutuzumab chemotherapy arm. 
Study BO21005, investigated G-CHOP comp ared with R-CHOP in patients with 
previously untreated DLBCL and this study did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS 
at final analysis.   
On the basis of the results of these Phase III studies evaluating obinutuzumab in 
combination with chemotherapy in both FL an d DLBCL, patients with R/R FL in this 
current protocol amendment will continue to receive obinutuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide, while patients with R/R DLBCL will instead receive rituximab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide. 
In the following sections, data generated for rituximab in combination with either 
polatuzumab vedotin or lenalidomide are also provided to further support the combination of an anti-CD20 antibody with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rituximab and Polatu zumab Vedotin Combination 
During its early development, polatuzumab vedotin treatment has been investigated as a single agent and in combination with rituximab.  On the basis of available Phase I and II data (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 11), polatuzumab vedotin as a single agent and 
combined with rituximab has shown clinical activit y
 in heavily pretreated patients with 
R/R B-cell lymphoma  (Palanca-Wessels et al. 2012 ; Morschhauser et al. 2014a).  In 
both studies, patients received rituximab 375 mg/m2 and polatuzumab vedotin up to 2.4 
mg/kg Q3W for up to 1 year, progression, or unacceptable toxicity .  The ongoing Study 
GO27834 has also shown preliminary safety and efficacy results evaluating the 
combination of rituximab and polatuzumab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab and Polatuzumab Vedotin Combination 
The combination of obinutuzumab with polatuzumab vedotin is being evaluated in several ongoing studies (see Table 11), including two Phase Ib/II trials in patients with 
R/R FL.  Preliminary  results 
 from these studie s show safety and efficacy at the 
polatuzumab vedotin 1. 8-mg/kg dose level when combined with obinutuzumab, every 3 
weeks for 6 −8 cycles as described in Section 1.3.2.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rituximab and Le nalidomide Combination 
The thalidomide analogue lenalidomide is currently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, deletion 5q myelodysplastic syndromes, and MCL as Revlimid.  Nonclinical studies demonstrated that T-ce ll immune synapse dysfunction in FL can be 
restored with lenalidomide (Ramsay et al. 2009 ).  In addition, lenalidomid e has been 
shown to reduce T regulatory cells a
nd activate CD8 T cells ( Kater et al. 2014).  E3 
ligase protein cereblon (encoded by [CONTACT_844979]) is the molecular target of 
lenalidomid
e.  Lenalidomide binding to CRBN mediated its direct anti-tumor effects and 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
105/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 is also required for T-cell production of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor α 
(Lopez-Girona et al. 2012).  
In nonclinical studies, len alidomide combined with rituximab resulted in a
nti-tumor 
effects via increased NK-cell function, enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity, and improved NK cell −mediated synapse formation (Wu et al. 2008; 
Zhang et al. 2009 ).   
Although lenalidomide has not been approved for the treatment of R/R FL and DLBCL, 
clinical act i
vity has been demonstrated in the treatment of both R/R indolent and 
aggressive B-cell lymphoma with lenalidomide as a single agent ( Wiernik et al. 2008 ; 
Witzig et al. 2009 , 2011) or in combination with r ituximab ( Zinzani et al. 2011 , 2013 ; 
Leonard et al. 2012 ; Tuscano et al. 2014 ; Wang et al. 2013) or obinutuzum ab 
(
Morschhauser et al. 2014b ) (see Appendix 11). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Obinutuzumab and Lenalidomide Combination 
Because the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab has been shown to be synergistic in nonclinical models and in patients with relapsed and first-line FL, replacing rituximab with obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide might be even more efficient than the lenalidomide and rituximab combination. 
The combination of obinutuzumab with lenalidomide has been evaluated in nonclinical 
studies using the MCL Z138 xenograft model in SCID-beige mice.  Results from these studies demonstrated greater anti-tumor efficacy than either single agent and superior activity to the combination of lenalidomi de with rituximab (data available upon request 
[RDR 1064289]). 
The combination of obinutuzumab with lenalidomide is currently being investigated in an 
ongoing Phase Ib/II study sponsored by [CONTACT_844980] (GALEN study) as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with R/R FL and aggressive lymphoma (DLBCL and MCL).  The recommended dose of lenalidomide was established at 20 mg/day on the basis of an increased incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia between Cycles 2 and 6 at the next higher dose of 25 mg/day (Morschhauser et al. 2014 ).  The most common adverse events observed during the 
dose-escalation phase 
(all grades,  ≥ 20% patients) were neutropenia (10/19; 53%), 
constipation (10/19; 53%) asthenia (7/19; 37%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (7/19; 37%), rash/cutaneous eruption (5/19; 26%), cough (5/19; 26%), diarrhea (4/19; 21%), and fever (4/19, 21%).  Grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in 
 ≥ 2 patients only 
consisted of neutropenia (8/19; 42%).  IRRs occurred in 3 patients and did not exceed Grade 2.  Preliminary efficacy data available from the dose-escalation phase of the study are encouraging, with an overall response according to Cheson et al. 1999 criteria of 
68% (13 of 19 evaluable patients), including 7 patients with a CR; 3 patients with a 
CR, 
unconfirmed; and 3 patients with a PR ( Morschhauser et al. 2014 ).  Enrollment in the 
expansion phase at 20 mg/day (Ph ase II part) 
is in progress.  Available preliminary 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
106/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 unpublished data (cutoff date:  30 September 2014) for 45 patients evaluable for safety 
during the induction period (Cycles 1 −6) show a median of 5 induction cycles (range:  
2−6 cycles) received.  The following hematologic adverse events (all grades) were 
reported:  neutropenia (17/45; 37.8%), febrile neutropenia (3/45; 6.7%), anemia (8/45; 17.8%), and thrombocytopenia (5/45; 11.1%).  The most common (occurring in 
 > 10% of 
patients) non-hematologic adverse events (all grades) were constipation (9/45; 20%); rash (7/45; 15.6%); cough (7/45; 15.6%); asthenia (6/45; 13.3%); and fatigue, diarrhea, and pruritus (5/45; 11.1% each). 
As mentioned in Section 1.4, there is a strong rationale for enhanced activity with 
combination therapy as well as apparent limited additional toxicity that argues that 
exploration of the G
 + Pola  + Len combination is appropriate.  This novel triplet regimen 
may have the potential to extend treatment-free remissions and decrease toxicity by [CONTACT_844981] a targeted chemotherapy regimen. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Dose and Schedule  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Obinutuzumab Dose and Schedule  in Patients 
with Follicular Lymphoma  
The dose and schedule for obinutuzumab in this study will be fixed for the induction and the maintenance components of the study, and obinutuzumab will not be dose-escalated.  This is based on the recommended dose and schedule (6 −8 cycles 
depending on the trial) of obinutuzumab from the  Phase III program in patients with B-
cell lymphoma.   
The dose and schedule of obinutuzumab in the induction regimen will be 1000 mg IV on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle 
(Cycles 2 −6). For this protocol, patients will be treated for 6 cycles during the induction 
phase. 
The dose and schedule of obinutuzumab in the maintenance regimen (FL) will be 
1000 mg IV administered every 2 months for 2 years.  This dosing administration is based on the obinutuzumab maintenance regimen that was administered in the Phase III Study GAO4753g ( Sehn et al. 2015 ).  Study GAO4753g showed that bendamustine and 
obinutuzumab followed by [CONTACT_844982] (median PFS had not been reached in the obinutuzumab and bendamustine followed by [CONTACT_844983]. 14.9 months in the bendamustine arm; stratified hazard ratio [HR]

107/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Polatuzumab Vedotin Dosing Regimen 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Rationale for Polatuzumab Vedot in Dose in Patients with 
Folllicular Lymphoma 
For this study, dose escalation of polatuzumab vedotin for patients with R/R FL  will 
begin at a dose level of 1.4 mg/kg (one dose level below the highest polatuzumab 
vedotin dose currently under development ) and will escalate to a final dose of 1.8 mg/kg, 
if tolerated.  The initial  polatuzumab vedotin dose and schedule for this study were 
based on the experience from the Phase I study (DCS4968g) with single-agent 
polatuzumab vedotin and the Phase II study (GO27834) with polatuzumab vedotin in 
combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma, the majority of which had FL or DLBCL.  Most evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed at doses 
 ≥ 1.8 mg/kg alone or in combination with rituximab.  
Evidence from Study DCS4968g indicated that duration of study treatment might be limited by [CONTACT_844984] a dose of 2.4 mg/kg.  Specifically, peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor) has been identified as a known risk (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Because of the chronic course and incurability of indolent B-cell 
lymphoma, treatment paradigms are increasingl y emphasizin
g tolerability to treatment in 
addition to efficacy.  As polatuzumab vedotin has shown single-agent activity at the 1.8-mg/kg dose level ( Palanca-Wessels et al. 2012 ), an additional cohort was opened 
with the 
purpose of determining whether lower doses of polatuzumab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) 
in combination with standard doses of rituximab result in improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy in FL.   
An analysis comparing the 2.4- and 1.8-mg/kg polatuzumab vedotin dose levels in 
combination with rituximab was reported ( Advani et al. 2015 ).  A high objec tive respon
 se 
rate was observed at both doses (76% at 2.4 mg/kg and 75% at 1.8 mg/kg), with a higher rate of CRs at 2.4 mg/kg (44% at 2.4 mg/kg and 10% at 1.8 mg/kg).  Adverse events and discontinuation rates were reduced at both doses if only the first 8 cycles are considered versus through study completion.  Therefore, to minimize the risk for the potential development of peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), treatment with polatuzumab vedotin was limited to a maximum of 6-month duration, corresponding to 6−8 cycles as defined per the protocol.  Further, in all current studies, the maximum 
dose of polatuzumab vedotin was limited to 1.8 mg/kg per the dose defined in the protocol.   
The combination of obinutuzumab with polatuzumab vedotin is being evaluated in 
several ongoing studies (see Table 11), including two Phase Ib/II trials in patients with 
R/R FL.

d In the Phase Ib portion of the study, 1 patient with R/R FL was treated with polatuzumab 
vedotin at 1.4 mg/kg  and 1 patient with R/R FL was treated with polatuzumab vedotin at 
1.8 mg/kg ( Forero-Torres et al. 2016).   
 
In Study GO29044, the starting dose of polatuzumab vedotin was 1.4 mg/kg and was 
escalated to 1.8 mg/kg, in combination  with G-CHP.  In Study GO29365, the starting 
dose of polatuzumab vedotin is 1.8 mg/kg when combined with obinutuzumab and 
bendamustine.  Since polatuzumab vedotin is being combined with obinutuzumab and 
chemotherapy (CHP or bendamustine) at 1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg, for patients with R/R FL in 
this study,  dose escalation of polatuzumab vedotin will begin at a dose level of 1.4 
mg/kg (one dose level below the highest polatuzumab vedotin dose level in clinical 
development ) and will escalate to a final dose of 1.8 mg/kg, if tolerated.  This novel triplet, 
G + Pola  + Len, substitutes out the standard chemotherapy components with lenalidomide, 
which in this combination may have the potential to extend treatment-free remissions and decrease toxicity, compared to combinations with standard chemotherapy components. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Rationale for Polatuzumab Vedot in Dose in Patients with 
DLBCL 
On the basis of the preliminary data f rom the patients with DLBCL treated in 
Studies GO29044 and GO29365, the dose level of polatuzumab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg 
has been shown to be safe and tolerable in combination with rituximab and chemotherapy.   
Due to the aggressive nature of DLBCL and the evidence that anti-tumor activity was 
observed at doses  
≥ 1.8 mg/kg alone or in combination with rituximab, the higher dose 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
109/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 level of polatuzumab vedotin is preferred to maximize clinical benefit for the R/R 
DLBCL population, which has no standard of care.   
The safety profile of rituximab differs slightly in comparison with obinutuzumab and is 
expected to be tolerated when combined with polatuzumab vedo tin at 1.8 mg/kg and 
lenalidomide; hence, in this amendment, the R/R DLBCL dose-escalation phase will 
start at the dose level of 1.8 mg/kg and only the lenalidomide dose will be escalated to determine an RP2D in this population.    
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Rationale for Polatuzumab Ve dotin Dosing Schedule in 
Patients with Follicula r Lymphoma and DLBCL 
The number of induction cycles (six 28-day cycles) is in line with other anti-CD20 plus 
polatuzumab vedotin regimens  studied in R/R NHL.   
Polatuzumab vedotin will not be administered as post-induction treatment (consolidation for DLBCL or maintenance for FL) owing to the risk of peripheral neuropathy with cumulative dosing.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Lenalidomide Dose and Schedule 
For the induction phase of the dose-escalation study, the lenalidomide starting dose will be 10 mg (two dose levels below the recommended expansion dose in combination with obinutuzumab in Phase Ib study) and will escalate to 15 mg and then to a final dose of 20 mg, if tolerated.  Patients enrolled in the expansion study will receive lenalidomide at the RP2D during induction.  The lenalidomide dose and schedule for this study were primarily based on the experience from the Ph ase Ib study (GALEN) that evaluated the 
combination of lenalidomide with obinutuzumab ( Morschhauser et al. 2014b ).  The MTD 
of lenalidomide was not reached; however, the recommende d dose of le
nalidomide 
established was 20 mg when combined with obinutuzumab for R/R FL or DLBCL on the basis of the increased incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia between Cycles 2 and 6 at 25 mg (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). 
The optimal use of lenalidomide in maintenance/consolidatio n therapy is under active 
investigation
.  In combination with rituximab, the most common schedule of lenalidomide 
has been 20 mg administered on Days 1 −21 of each 28-day cycle in R/R B-cell 
lymphoma ( Leonard et al. 2012 ; Wang et al. 2013; Zinzani et al. 2013 ). 
For the post-induction p hase of this 
study, the lenalidomide dose will be 10 mg 
administered on Days 1 −21 of each month for a maximum of 12 months (additional 
1 year of treatment) for patients with R/R FL and for a maximum of 6 months (total of 1 year of treatment inclusive of induction phase) for patients with R/R DLBCL.  This 
schedule is based on the post-induction schedule administered in the GALEN study.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Treatment Duration 
In this study, patients with R/R FL or DLBCL will receive [ADDRESS_1174185]-induction treatment, with t he objective to improve the response to 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
110/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 induction therapy, either by [CONTACT_491841] a PR to a CR or by [CONTACT_491842] (MRD) to achieve a molecular response in patients with a clinical CR after induction treatment, thus reducing the relapse risk for responders.  In this study, MRD levels will be measured during the post-induction period as an additional means of evaluating the benefits of the triple combination as post-induction treatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_491772], including d e
monstrated benefit from 
2-year rituximab maintenance in patients who responded to first-line immunochemotherapy (Study MO18264), FL is still not considered curable, with a 6-year PFS of 59.2% ( Salles et al. 2013b).  A Phase III study, GAO4753g, investigated 
obinutuzumab plus bendamustine (GB) compared with bendamustine alone in patie nts 
with rituxima 
b-refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma (n  = 396).  Patients in the GB group 
who had not experienced disease progression at EOI received obinutuzumab monotherapy every 2 months for up to 2 years.  On the basis of positive results from this 
study, demonstrating significant improvement in  PFS in the GB arm, with a median PFS 
of 29 versus 14 months (HR
 = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; p  > 0.0001) ( Sehn et al. 2015), 
the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the stud
y be unblinded 
to the Sponsor.  These data support further investigation of obinutuzumab in combination with new targeted drugs in the setting of induction and maintenance treatment for patients with FL. 
The combination of obinutuzumab with lenalidomide is currently being investigated in an 
ongoing Phase Ib/II study (GALEN) as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with R/R FL.  In the GALEN study, maintenance treatment consists of obinutuzumab administered every 2 months for 2 years and lenalidomide administered on Days 1 −21 of 
each 28-day cycle for 1 year, and the same obinutuzumab and lenalidomide dosing schedule will be employed in this study.  
Patients with R/R DLBCL who are not suitable  for or do not benefit from consolidative 
autologous transplantation exhibit a poor prognosis.  Responses obtained with different 
rituximab treatment regimens tested in clin ical trials (e.g., ritu ximab in combination 
with bendamustine, with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, or with lenalidomide) have been of short duration, with the longest report ed median PFS of approximately 7 months 
observed in one study of BR ( Ohmachi et al. 2013 ).  Th
 us, 6 months of consolidation 
treatment, for a total treatment duration of approximately 12 months, is considered to be a reasonable exploratory therapeutic app roach in patients with R/R DLBCL with an 
anticipated positive benefit-risk ratio.  On the basis of the complementary mechanism of action between all three study drugs and considering the aggressiveness of R/R DLBCL, the study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the triple combination in the consolidation setting.

111/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174186]-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT 
scan has been well documented ( Thomas et al. 2010 ; Vitolo et al. 2010 ).  PET-CT scans 
have been implemented in the Luga no 2014 crit
eria ( Cheson et al. 2014 ) and are 
commonly used to asse ss efficacy in medical pr actice and 
clinical trials of lymphoma.  
More recently, the value of post-induction PET-CT status has been investigated as a prognostic marker for long-term outcome in patients with FL.  In the first-line setting, results from a pooled analysis of [ADDRESS_1174187] −positive and PET-CT− negative 
patients of 23.2% (95% CI: 11.1%, 37.9%) versus 63.4% (95% CI: 55.9%, 70.0%; p
 < 0.001), respectively, and a 4-year survival of 87.2% (95% CI: 71.9%, 94.5%) versus 
97.1% (95% CI: 93.2%, 98.8%; p  < 0.0001), respectively ( Trotman et al. 2014).  In the 
relapsed FL setting, results from a preliminary analysis of Ph
ase II study (BO21003) 
comparing obinutuzumab versus rituximab monotherapy demonstrated that the post-induction PET-CT status is strongly prognostic of PFS.  With a median follow-up of 32.[ADDRESS_1174188] −negative patients compared with PET-CT −positive patients, regardless of the 
assessment criteria, either International Harmonization Project criteria (HR
 = 0.25; 
95% CI: 0.191, 0.807; p  = 0.0083) or European Organization for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC) criteria (HR  = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.191, 0.807; p  = 0.0083) 
(Kostakoglu et al. 2014 ). 
In response to developments involving PET-CT status, the 11th Internation al Conference 
of Malignant Lympho
ma imaging group provided an updated guidance for the use of 
PET-CT scan results for lymphoma staging and response assessment (see Appendix 5; 
Cheson et al. 2014 ).  
3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Analysis of DLBCL Subtype, BCL2 , and MYC  
DLBCL cell-of-origin prognostic subgroups (ABC and GCB), defined using gene expression profiling, have been associated with different clinical outcomes in patients receiving R-CHOP for DLBCL, with GCB subgroups demonstrating an improved prognosis than ABC groups (3-year survival rate of 84% vs. 56%, respectively; p
 < 0.001) 
(Lenz et al. 2008 ).  Moreover, non-GCB patients preferentially respond t o lenalidomide 
(Hernandez-Ilizaliturri et al. 2011 ).   
Similarly, Bcl-2 overexpression has been associated with inf erior outcomes in DLBCL 
with standar
d treatment (Iqbal et al. 2006 ).  Next-generation sequencing studies hav e 
shown that BCL2  is the most mutated gene in patients with GCB DLBCL, observed in up 
to 35% of cases ( Schuetz et al. 2012 ).  Approximately 9% −17% of patients with newly 
diagnosed DLBCL harb
or an underlying MYC  rearrangement, and these patients are at 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
112/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 high risk of treatment failure with R-CHOP ( Savage et al. 2009 ).  A subset of patients 
with MYC -positive DLBCL also har
bors an additional BCL2 rearrangement.  These 
"double-hit" lymphomas are associated with a very poor outcome (Dunleavy et al. 2014 ; 
Savage et al. 2009).  Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Myc in DLBCL has also been 
observed in the absence of transloca tion.  This "d
ouble-positive" DLBCL status is also 
associated with worse prognosis ( Green et al. 2012 ; Hu et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2012 ). 
Identification of these molecularly d efined progn
ostic subtypes in DLBCL is critical for 
interpretation of correlative investigations aimed to understand mechanisms of both sensitivity and resistance to study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessment of Therapeutic Target Expression 
CD79b is a signal-transducing subunit of the B-cell receptor that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_844907] ( Jang et al. 2010).  The activity of ADCs like polatuzumab depends 
on the prese nce of the ta 
rget, internalization, and sensitivity to the payload drug 
(Zheng et al. 2009 ).  To ascertain the expressio n of CD79b in this study,  CD79b 
expression will be measured in the mandatory archival tissue. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessment  of Minimal Residual Disease 
MRD measurement is an increasingly recognized tool for response assessment in B-cell malignancies.  Circulating lymphoma cells and circulating tumor DNA can be detected and quantified at low levels as MRD to assess depth of response and monitor patients for possible disease recurrence.  However, there is no scientific proof that MRD is a reliable measure of clinical outcome in NHL, and technical validation of novel technologies for MRD assessment that have clinical utility is still pending. 
In FL, MRD at end of treatment is likely to be prognostic ( Ladetto et al. 2013 ).  In
  DLBCL, 
serum MRD was shown to predict early and late progression after first-line treatment 
(Roschewski et al. 2014).  In addition, MRD asse ssment may complemen t the response 
assessment, particularly in immune treatment −based regimens, and mitigate potential 
false-positive PET-CT results caused by [CONTACT_844985] ( Kurtz et al. 2014 ).  For these reas ons, ini tial MRD analysis will be 
performed in patients with FL, and subsequent analysis in patients with DLBCL may be performed. 
In this study, MRD will be quantified by [CONTACT_844986].  The lymphoma clone will be identified in DNA from the lymphoma tissue specimen.  MRD levels will be determined in blood samples collected prior to dosing and during treatment to explore a pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship.  MRD assessments will be performed at EOI to allow for an evaluation of the depth of response, and during and after post-induction treatment to allow for an evaluation of long-term response or possible disease recurrence.

113/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Assessment  of Lymphoma-Related Genetic 
Changes and Gene Expression  
Measurement of relevant protein, RNA , and DNA from tissue specimens will be 
assessed for biomarkers associated with disease biology (immune gene expression 
profiles and disease subtype gene expression patterns and associated mutations, i.e., MYD88 and CD79b), mechanism of action of study drugs (i.e., including but not limited to regulated substrates of lenalidomide, i.e., CRBN, MYC, IRF4, or immune repertoire signatures), mechanisms of resistance, and improvement of diagnostic assays.

recent available biopsy and initiation of study treatment, a repeat core-needle 
biopsy is strongly recommended.   
Further details are provided in Section 4.5.6 .   
• Agreement to abstain from donating blood during the treatment period (including 
periods of treatment interruption) and for [ADDRESS_1174192] dose of study 
treatment  
• Agreement not to share study medication with another person 
• Agreement to comply with all local requirements of the lenalidomide risk 
minimization plan 
In every country where lenalidomide has been approved, a risk minimization 
plan, which includes a pregnancy prevention program, is in place.  The risk 
minimization plan should be followed by [CONTACT_844938]. 
US sites only:   Per standard Revlimid REMS™ requirements, all physicians 
who prescribe lenalidomide for research subjects enrolled in this study and all 
research subjects enrolled in this study must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the Revlimid REMS™ program.  
For Ex-US sites only:   Subjects will be counseled on pregnancy prevention 
prior to medication being dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied 
with all requirements, including use of birth control and pregnancy testing, 
and that the subject understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step will be documented with a completed Education and Counseling Guidance 
Document (refer to Lenalidomide Preg nancy Prevention Risk Management 
Plans), and no drug will be dispensed until this step occurs.  Counseling 
includes verification with the subject that required pregnancy testing was 
performed and results were negative.  A Lenalidomide Information Sheet (refer 
to Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention  Risk Management Plans) will be 
supplied with each medication dispensed.  All requirements must be followed 
by [CONTACT_844939]. 
In addition, because lenalidomide will be administered in combination with 
obinutuzumab, rituximab, and polatuzumab vedotin, patients must comply with 
contraceptive measures designed to ensure safe administration of all study 
treatments as outlined below.  
• For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use two
 adequate methods of contraception, including 
at least one method with a failure rate of < 1% per year, for at least 28 days prior to 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, during the treatment period (including periods of treatment 
interruption), and for at least [ADDRESS_1174193] dose of obinutuzumab  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( ≥
 24 continuous months of 

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
115/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not 
undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). 
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  < 1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of 
progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, 
hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.  Combined oral contraceptives are not recommended because of the increased 
risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism (TE) in patients taking 
lenalidomide. 
Barrier methods may be used as the second contraceptive method but must 
always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. 
• The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  For men:  agreement to 
remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: 
With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a 
failure rate of <
 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 
[ADDRESS_1174194] dose of obinutuzumab or rituximab to avoid exposing the embryo. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of 
G + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R FL and R  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R  DLBCL.  

Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
118/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 During the dose-escalation phase, patients will be assigned to cohorts with varying 
polatuzumab vedotin (R/R FL dose-finding only)  and lenalidomide dose combinations, 
through use of an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).  During the FL expansion phase, patients with R/R FL will receive obinutuzumab in combination 
with lenalidomide at the FL RP2D and polatuzumab vedotin at the RP2D as induction 
treatment.  During the DLBCL expansion phase, pa tients with R/R DLBCL will receive 
rituximab and polatuzu mab in combination with lena lidomide at the DLBCL RP2D.  
Post-induction treatment (for eligible patients only) will depend on lymphoma histology.  
Patients with FL will receive maintenance tr eatment with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide, 
and patients with DLBCL will receive consolidation treatment with rituximab and 
lenalidomide (see Section 3.1.1 for details). 
Enrollment tracking will be performed through use of the IxRS.  Prior to initiating screening, the study sit e should co
nfirm via the IxRS that slots are available for 
enrollment.  After written informed consent has been obtained and preliminary eligibility has been established, the study site will submit documentation supporting eligibility to the Sponsor and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  Once the Sponsor reviews and approves the patient for enrollment, the patient number will be assigned and the patient will be enrolled via the IxRS.  The Sponsor will communicate to the sites impending closure of screening.

calculate the dose of rituximab throughout the study unless the patient’s weight 
increases or decreases by > 10% from screening, in which case BSA should be 
recalculated and used for subsequent dosing.  In obese patients (defined as body mass index 
≥ 30 kg/m2), there is no BSA cap and actual body weight, not adjusted weight, is 
recommended.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_844889]. 
The infusion of rituximab may be split over 2 days if the patient is at increased risk for 
an IRR (high tumor burden or high peripheral lymphocyte count).  Administration of rituximab may be continued on the following day, if needed, for patients who experience an adverse event during the rituximab infusion.

During th e 
treatment period, rituximab must be administered to patients in a setting 
where full emergency resuscitation facilities are immediately available.  Patients should be under close supervision of the investigator at all times.  
Rituximab should be administered as a slow IV  infusion through a dedicated line.  After 
the end of the first infusion, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in 
place for 
≥ [ADDRESS_1174200] 1 hour after the end of the infusion.  If no adverse events occur after 1 hour, the IV line may be removed or the central venous catheter may be de-accessed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Polatuzumab Vedotin 
For R/R FL, during the dose-escalation phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin for 
each patient will depend on dose assignment (1.4 or 1.8 mg/kg).  During the expansion 
phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin for each patient will depend on the RP2D 
established during the dose-escalation phase.  For R/R DLBCL, during the dose-
escalation phase and the expansion phase, the dose of polatuzumab vedotin will be fixed 
at 1.8 mg/kg.   Polatuzumab vedotin will be administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 of each 
cycle, during induction treatment only. 
The patient’s weight obtained during screening (Days −28 to − 1) should be used for 
dose determination for all treatment cycles.  If the patient’s weight within 96 hours prior 
to Day 1 of a given treatment cycle is > 10% from the weight obtained during screening, 
the new weight should be used to calculate the dose.  The weight that triggered a dose

126/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 adjustment will be taken as the new reference weight for future dose adjustments.  All 
subsequent doses should be modified accordingly. 
After reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) and dilution into IV bags 
containing isotonic sodium chloride solution (0.9% NaCl), polatuzumab vedotin will be administered by [CONTACT_844987] 0.2- or 0.22- μm in-line filters at a final polatuzumab vedotin concentration determined by [CONTACT_4677]-specific dose.  Compatibility of polatuzumab vedotin with IV bags, infusion lines, filters, and other infusion aids has been established with items made of specific materials of construction.  Please consult the pharmacy manual and the Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator’s Brochure for a list of compatible materials and specific dose preparation instructions. 
The initial dose will be administered to patients who are well hydrated over 
90 (±10) minutes.  Premedication (e.g., 500 −1000 mg of oral acetaminophen or 
paracetamol and 50 −[ADDRESS_1174202] practice) 
may be administered to an individual patient before administration of polatuzumab vedotin.  Administration of corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.  If IRRs are observed with the first infusion in the absence of premedication, premedication must be administered before subsequent doses. 
The polatuzumab vedotin infusion may be slowed or interrupted for patients 
experiencing infusion-associated symptoms.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for [ADDRESS_1174203] been well tolerated, subsequent doses of polatuzumab vedotin may be administered over 30 ( ±10) minutes, followed by a 
30-minute observation period after the infusion. 
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are

[IP_ADDRESS] Lenalidomide 
Lenalidomide will be administered orally once daily on Days 1 −21 of Cycles 1 −6 (28-day 
cycles) during induction treatment and on Days 1 −[ADDRESS_1174204] 12 months of maintenance treatment.  During the dose-escalation phase, 
lenalidomide will be administered at a dose of 10, 15, or 20 mg (dose may be de-escalated to 5 mg).  During the expansion phase, lenalidomide will be administered at the RP2D during induction treatment and at 10 mg during consolidation or maintenance treatment. 
Lenalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole with water and should not be broken, 
chewed, or opened.  The capsules may be taken with or without food, except on lenalidomide PK sampling days (see Appendix 3), where the patient should fast (water

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 
[ADDRESS_1174210]-induction 
treatment, whichever occurs later.  All such medications should be reported to the 
investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
TE prophylaxis treatment and premedication should be administered as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Hematopoietic growth factors are allowed if clinically indicat ed and used
 in accordance 
with the prescribing information.  G-CSF may be administered in each cycle of therapy as primary prophylaxis for neutropenia, per American Society of Clinical Oncology 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
130/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 (ASCO), EORTC, and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines 
(Smith et al. 2006) or per each site’s institutional standards. 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy should continu e their use.  
However, it must be noted that 
erythropoietic agents or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as 
estrogen-containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., oral contraceptives), should be used with caution, because of the increased risk of TE in patients taking lenalidomide.  Suitable methods of contraception are presented in Section 4.1.1. 
Patients using concomitant medica tion that could possibly worsen 
thrombocytopenia-relate d events (e.g., platelet inhibitors an
d anticoagulants) may be at 
greater risk of bleeding.  When possible, replace prior vitamin K antagonist therapy with LMWH prior to Day [ADDRESS_1174211] weeks of treatment. 
On the basis of simulations, unconjugated MMAE exposure following polatuzumab 
vedotin administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors  or inducers is unlikely to be altered by 
[CONTACT_726] 50%.  Furthermore, MMAE is unlikely a perpetrator of drug interactions.  The patients who receive strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors in combination with polatuzumab vedotin will be cl osely monitored for adverse reactions if 
any. 
Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics should be administered as per standard practice.   
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the 
study according to institutional standards.

consent, and within the defined window, may be used as screening and baseline assessments (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2); such tests do not need to be repeated 
for screening purposes (e.g., screening tumor assessment).   
Study treat
ment should be initiated within 28 days after the Informed Consent Form has 
been signed. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant  diseases, surgeries, reproductive status, 
smoking history, and alcohol and drug abuse.  In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] 7 days prior to the screening period will be recorded. 
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
132/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 The following clinical parameters relative to disease history, diagnosis, and prognostic 
indices will be recorded at screening:  
• Date of initial diagnosis 
• ECOG Performance Status (see Appendix 6) 
• Ann Arbor staging (see Appendix 9 ) 
•
 For patients with FL:  Follicular Lymphoma International Prog nostic Index
 (FLIPI) 
and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 (FLIPI2) (see 
Appendix 10) 
• For patients with DLBCL:   IPI (see Appendix 10
) 
• B symptoms (unexplained fever > 38°C, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss 
> 10% of body weight over 6 months)  
• Previous lines of anti-lymphoma treatment and response to prior therapy, date of 
disease progression in relation to start date of prior therapy, and date of last dose of prior therapy 
 
4.5.3 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination should be performed at screening and should include 
an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Height and weight will be recorded.   
As part of tumor assessment, the physical examination should include evaluation for the 
presence of enlarged nodes, palpable hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.  This information will be recorded on the appropriate Tumor Assessment eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), targeted (limited, symptom-directed) 
physical examinations should be performed.  Targeted physical examinations should be 
limited to systems of primary relevance (e .g., cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_27441]), 
systems associated with symptoms (newly emergent or monitored from baseline), and 
areas associated with tumor assessment (lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and any other areas identified at baseline) (see Section 4.5.5).   
Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient note
s.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, body temperature, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position.  Vital sign measurements will be performed as out lined in the schedules of assessments

133/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2), but the associated data, other than the data collected 
at screening, do not need to be recorded on the 
eCRF (except in the case of an adverse 
event). 
4.5.[ADDRESS_1174213] −based CR have been slightly 
modified to require normal bone marrow for patients with bone marrow involvement at 
screening.  Additionally, designation of PET-CT-based PR requires that CT-based 
response criteria for a CR or PR be met in addition to the PET-CT-based response 
criteria for a PR (see Appendix 5). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiographic Assessments 
PET scans should include the base of the skull to mid-thigh region.  Full body PET scans 
should be performed when clinically appropriate. 
CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans.  
CT scans of the neck should be included if clinic ally indicated (i.e., if evidence of disease 
upon physical examination) and must be repeated throughout the study if there is disease involvement at baseline.   
PET-CT scans and diagnostic CT scans should be acquired according to a standardized 
imaging manual, which will be provided to all sites. 
If contrast is medically contraindicated (e.g., patients with contrast allergy or impaired 
renal clearance), MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (and neck, if clinically indicated) and a non-contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed.  If MRI scans cannot be obtained, CT scans without contrast are permitted as long as this allows consistent and precise measurement of the targeted lesions during the study treatment period.   
The same radiographic assessment modality must be used for all response evaluations 
to ensure consistency across different timepoints (including unscheduled assessments). 
A full tumor assessment, including radiographic assessment, must be performed any 
time disease progression or relapse is suspected. 
Additional details regarding imaging procedures will be provided in the Imaging Manual.

134/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Bone Marrow Assessments 
Bone marrow examinations are required at screening for staging purposes in all patients 
and should be performed within approximately [ADDRESS_1174214] achieved a CR.  In patients with a PR and continued bone marrow involvement, a subsequent bone marrow examination may be required to confirm a CR at a later timepoint. 
Any additional (unscheduled) bone marrow examinations performed during the study will 
be at the discretion of the investigator.

4.5.8 Samples for [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository 
The [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository (RCR) is a c entrally administered group of facilities used 
for the long-term storage of human biologi c specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection and analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future. 
Specimens for the RCR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RCR specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives: 
• To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression 
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology

139/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Additional Confidentiality for Speci mens Used for Genetic Research 
Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, [COMPANY_002] has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens collected for genetic research.  Upon receipt by [CONTACT_25736], specimens for genetic research are “double-coded” by [CONTACT_25737] a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these specimens and all clinical data transferred from the 
clinical database and considered relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A “linking key” between the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is monitored by [CONTACT_25738].  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee and [COMPANY_002]’s Legal Department, as applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent to Participate in  the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository 
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RCR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a patient’s agreement to provide optional RCR specimens.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_26806].  
In the event of an RCR participant’s death or loss of competence, the participant’s specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal from th e [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository 
Patients who give consent to provide RCR specimens have the right to withdraw their specimens from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in writing of the patient’s wishes through use of the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient’s withdrawal from Study GO29834 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  Likewise, a patient’s withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from Study GO29834. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring  and Oversight

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.[ADDRESS_1174218], and lenalidomide is  not approved for 
the treatment of patients with R/R FL.  Obinutuzumab is only approved in combination 
with bendamustine for the treatment of R/R FL.  Rituximab and lenalidomide are not 
approved for the treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL .  Clinical development is 
ongoing.  The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
obinutuzumab, rituximab, polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide in completed and 
ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety risks of obinutuzumab, rituximab, 
polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide are outlined below.  Please refer to the Obinutuzumab, Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator’s Brochures and the 
 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
142/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174219] Characteristics (SmPC) for a complete summary of 
safety information.  
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial.  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities (see Section 4.1).  Patients will undergo adequate safety monitoring during the study, 
including assessment of  the nature, 
frequency, and severity of adverse events, as 
described in this section and in Section 4.5.  In addition, guidelines for managing 
adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and
 treatment delays or 
discontinuation, have been provided (see Section 5.1.7). 
5.1.1 Risks Associated  with Obinutuzumab  
To date, the following adverse events are considered to be important identified risks 
associated with obinutuzumab:  IRRs, TLS, thrombocytopenia (including acute thrombocytopenia), neutropenia (including prolonged and late onset neutropenia), infections (including PML and HBV reactivation), prolonged B-cell depletion, impaired immunization response, worsening of preexisting cardiac conditions, and gastrointestinal perforation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Reactions 
IRRs have been reported predominantly during the first infusion of obinutuzumab.  The incidence and severity of IRRs decreased substantially with the second and subsequent infusions.  In the majority of patients, IRRs were mild or moderate and resolved with the slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The commonly experienced IRRs have been characterized by [CONTACT_27913], fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, fatigue, and other symptoms.   
IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable fr om IgE-mediated allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions; anaphylaxis has been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.   Hypotension may occur during obinutuzumab IV infusions.  Therefore, withholding of 
antihypertensive treatments should be considered for [ADDRESS_1174220]-infusion period. 
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs and anaphylaxis are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 8.  

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
143/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS, including fatal events, has been repor ted with obinutuzumab administration.  
Patients at risk for TLS (e.g., because of bulky disease or renal insufficiency) should 
receive adequate hydration and premedication with allopurinol or an alternative uricostatic agent as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (see Table 13).  Additional guidelines for 
management of TLS in this study ar e provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
 (see Table 19). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Grade [ADDRESS_1174221] Grade 2.  Cases of late-onset neutropenia (ANC
 < 1000 cells/ μL occurring  ≥ 28 days after obinutuzumab 
treatment has been completed or stopped) or prolonged neutropenia (ANC
 < 1000 cells/ μL that does not resolve after 28 days without obinutuzumab 
treatment) have also been reported.  The use of G-CSF is allowed for treatment of neutropenia in this study.  Prophylactic treatm ent with antibiotics should be administered 
as per standard practice.  Guidelines for primary prophylaxis with G-CSF are provided in Section 4.4.1.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab.  In patients with CLL exposed to obinutuzumab, fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in Cycle 1.  A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients receiving concomitant medication that could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events (e.g., platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants) may be at greater risk of bleeding.  When possible, replace prior vitamin K antagonist therapy with LMWH prior to Day [ADDRESS_1174222] cycle.  For patients who experience throm bocytopenia, regular laboratory tests should 
be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician, according to institutional practice.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections 
On the basis of its mechanism of action, resulting in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Obinutuzumab should not be administered to patients with active infection, and caution should be exercised when including patients with a histor y of recurrent or chronic infections.   
Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of obinutuzumab therapy.  Fatal infections have been reported.

144/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients with chronic hepatitis (HbsAg positive) with 
evidence of prior hepatitis B exposure, or in patients who are carriers (HbsAg negative and anti-HBc positive) has been reported with other anti-CD20 antibodies.  The risk is increased particularly when anti-CD20 antibodies are administered with immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as steroids or chemotherapy.  Patients positive for HbsAg or HbcAb are not eligible for this study. 
JC viral infection resulting in PML has been reported in patients treated with 
obinutuzumab.  The diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of the brain.  Motor symptoms with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_380619] (e.g., muscular weakness, paralysis, and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cerebellar symptoms, and visual field defects are common.  Some signs or symptoms regarded as “cortical” (e.g., aphasia or visual-spatial disorientation) may occur.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_570591]).  Additional guidelines for medical management of PML in this study are provided in Section 5.1.7. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunizations 
The safety of immunization with live or attenuated viral  vaccines following 
obinutuzumab therapy has not been studied  and vaccination with live virus vaccines is 
not recommended during treatment and until B-cell recovery. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Pr eexisting Cardiac Condition 
In patients with underlying cardiac disease and treated with obinutuzumab, adverse events such as angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia, have been observed.  These events may occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal.  Therefore, patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely.  In addition, these patients should be hydrated with caution to prevent a potential fluid overload. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforation 
GI perforation has been reported in patients with B-cell lymphoma treated with obinutuzumab, including fatal events.  Patient s with GI involvement should be monitored 
for signs of GI perforation. 
5.1.2 Risks Associated with Rituximab  
The following adverse events are considered to be important risks associated or potentially associated with rituximab:  IRRs , infections (including severe infections), 
PML, hepatitis B reactivation, neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia), TLS, impaired immunization response, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS]/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] [TEN]), and GI perforation.  Details for these risks are provided below; refer to the Rituximab Investigator’s Brochure for full information. 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
145/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Reactions 
Acute IRRs are very common in patients receiving rituximab (occurring in ≥ 10% of 
patients) based on clinical trial experience.  However, serious IRRs are uncommonly 
reported (occurring in ≥ 1 of 1,000 and < 1 of 100 patients) and are rarely fatal 
(occurring in ≥ 1 of 10,000 and < 1 of 1,000 patients).  Most  IRRs occur with the first 
administration of rituximab.  Most IRRs are mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 or 2) and can be managed by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_844890].  IRRs can be severe and, in rare cases, can result in death.  Rituximab-induced IRRs consist of a cluster of symptoms and signs occurring during or within 24 hours of a rituximab infusion that may be related to cytokine release and/or other chemical mediators, and these acute IRRs overlap with “cytokine release syndrome.”  Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions  have been reported followin g rituximab administration, and 
clinical manifestations of these reactions are similar to cytokine release syndrome.  In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true  hypersensitivity reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_844891].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections (Including  Serious Infections) 
Serious infections, including fatal bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections, can occur during and up to 1 year following completion of rituximab-based therapy.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatitis B Reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B ranges from asymptomatic reactivations (detected by 
[CONTACT_491863]) to fulminant liver failure and death.  Patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) viral infection are at risk for reactivation and will be excluded from the study.  Patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B exposure or who are carriers (defined as HBsAg negative and anti-HBcAb positive) are at a lower risk for reactivation.  Patients who demonstrate evidence of reactivation while receiving an appropriate anti-viral therapy will be discontinued from study 
treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
Rare cases of PML have also been reported in  patients treated with rituximab alone or 
in combination with other immunosuppressive medications ( Goldberg et al. 2002 ; 
Calabrese et al. 2007 ; Carson  and Bennett 2009 ).  In a review o f [ADDRESS_1174223] cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months of the patients ’ last infusion of rituximab. 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
146/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia (Including Prolonged Neutropenia) 
Neutropenia is very common in patients  receiving rituximab (occurring in ≥ 10% of 
patients) based on clinical trial experience.  However, delayed onset neutropenia is very 
rare (occurring in < 1 of 10,000 patients), and the in cidence of prolonged neutropenia 
is unknown.  Neutropenia may lead to seriou s or overwhelming infection, especially if 
profound (Grades 3 −4), prolonged, associated with breaches in natural mucosal barriers 
(e.g., diarrhea and/or mucositis), and/or ot her immunological defects (e.g., lymphopenia, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, and ac quired immunodeficiency syndrome).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_816990] 3 −[ADDRESS_1174224] not reported a significant increase in serious neutropenic 
infections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Patients treated with rituximab may be at risk for TLS.  Severe tumor TLS is very rare in patients receiving rituximab (occurring in 
< 1 of 10,000 patients), based on 
postmarketing experience.  Signs and symp toms (e.g., hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, acute rena l failure, and elevat ed LDH) that are 
consistent with TLS have been reported to occur after the first rituximab IV infusion in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant lymphocytes.  A high number of circulating malignant cells (
≥ 25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden confers a greater risk 
of TLS.  For patients with evidence of TLS, rituximab should be discontinued, and the patient should be treated as clinically indicated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Impaired Immunization Response 
B-cell depletion is expected (and desired) during rituximab therapy and is directly related to its mechanism of action.  In theory, peripheral B-cell depletion may reduce the effectiveness of immunization, as patients may not be able to mount an effective humoral immune response to foreign antigens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Skin Reactions:  Stev ens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_844909], including fatal mucocutaneous reactions, can occur in patients receiving rituximab.  The onset of these reactions in patients treated with rituximab has varied from 1to 13 weeks foll owing rituximab exposure.  The majority of the SJS/TEN 
cases reported with rituximab were associated with additional risk factors.  Fatal outcome also appeared to increase in patients who were exposed to multiple risk factors for SJS/TEN. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforation  
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  In postmarketing reports of rituximab, the m ean time to documented GI perforation was 
6 days (range: 1
−77 days) in patients with NHL.

147/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 5.1.3 Risks Associated with Polatuzumab Vedotin  
The clinical safety profile of polatuzumab vedotin based on clinical data obtained in the 
ongoing Phase I and II studies is summarized in Section 1.3.  On the basis of clinical 
data to date, the following known and suspected risks are de
scribed below.  Guidelines 
around the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are 
described in Section 5.1.7.  Refer also to the current Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator’s 
Brochure for complete and updated details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Identified Risks  
On the basis of clinical experience with polatuzumab vedotin in patients treated in the current Phase I and II studies, neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy are identified risks of polatuzumab vedotin.  
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia and neutropenia-associated events resulted in protocol-mandated dose reductions and/or delays.  Serious neutropenia including febrile neutropenia has been reported during treatment with polatuzumab vedotin.  Patients with inadequate hematologic function will be excluded from this study (see Section 4.1.2).  Patients 
receiving study treatment will be regularly moni tored for evidence of marrow toxicity 
with 
complete blood counts.  Treatment may be delayed for hematologic toxicities as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The use of G-CSF for neutropenia is described in 
Section 4.4.1. 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
Patients receiving polatuzumab vedotin may develop or experience worsening of peripheral neuropathy.  Patients in clinical trials with polatuzumab vedotin should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy (sensory and/or motor), including hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, di scomfort, a burning sensation, weakness, 
gait disturbance, or neuropathic pain.  Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a dose delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of treatment and should be managed according to the protocol.  Study treatment dose and schedule modifications for peripheral neuropathy are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Risks 
Infections 
Neutropenia is a known risk for polatuzumab vedotin.  Reports in the literature state that 
granulocytopenia is a major predisposing factor to infections in patients with B-cell lymphoma.  Patients receiving chemotherapy  for B-cell lymphoma with a granulocyte 
count of 
 < 500 cells/μ L experienced a higher incidence of infections than those with a 
count of  > 500 cells/μ L. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy 
One case of PML was reported in an -year-old female with R/R FL after receiving one cycle of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with obinutuzumab and bendamustine.  

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
148/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174225] for JC virus by [CONTACT_844989].  Confounders included previous lines of anti-CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_844893].  Additional details of the case can be found in the Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure.  
Infusion-Related Events 
Because of the potential for infusion reactions, administration of polatuzumab vedotin will be performed in a setting with access to emergency equipment and staff who are trained to monitor and respond to medical emergencies.  All patients will be monitored for infusion reactions during the infusion and immediately afterward.  Precautions for suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusions are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The initial dose of polatuzumab vedotin may be administered with 
premedication with acetaminophen, antihistamines, or corticosteroids pe r institutio
nal 
standard practice at the discretion of the Investigator.  Premedication should be instituted for subsequent doses if IRRs are observed in patients who receive their first dose of polatuzumab vedotin without premedications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Significant 
issues with polatuzumab vedotin IRRs have not been observed. 
Similar considerations re garding infu
sion reactions are applicable for obinutuzumab.  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional information.   
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
There is the potential risk of TLS if treatment with polatuzumab vedotin results in the 
rapid destruction of a large number of tumor ce lls.  If any evidence of this occurs during 
the study, tumor lysis prophylaxis measures will be instituted.  Patients who are 
considered to have a high tumor burden (e.g., lymphocyte count ≥ 25  × 109/L or bulky 
lymphadenopathy) and who are considered to be at risk for tumor lysis by [CONTACT_844990] (e.g., allopurinol ≥  300 mg/day orally or a 
suitable alternative treatment [according to institutional practice] starting 12 −24 hours 
before study treatment) and must be well hydrated before the initiation of study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis with allopurinol and adequate hydration before each subsequent infusion, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].    
One case of TLS attributed to  polatuzumab vedotin has b een reported (Study GO27834); 
however, the laboratory elevations did no t meet the Howard cr iteria for TLS (see 
Appendix 12 ).  The suspected TLS event resolved after 3 days of supportive care.  
One ca s
e of Grade 3 Laboratory TLS was reported in the ongoing Phase Ib/II 
Study GO29833 combining polatuzumab vedotin, obinutuzumab, and venetolax.  
The patient was at high risk for TLS due to bulky disease and decreased renal function.  Potassium and phosphorous levels were elevated, while serum creatinine levels remained normal and the patient was asymptomatic.  The TLS event was considered related to all three study treatments and resolved in 4 days with supportive care (see Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure  for case details.   

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
149/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 Bone Marrow Toxicity 
Patients with inadequate hematologic function will be excluded from this study (see 
Section 4.1.2).  Patients receiving study treatment will be regularly monitored for 
evidence of marrow toxicity with complete blood counts.  Tr eatment ma
y be delayed for 
hematologic toxicities as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Transfusion support for anemia and thrombocyto penia is also
 permitted at the discretion 
of the treating physician. 
Immunogenicity 
As with any recombinant antibody, polatuzumab vedotin may elicit an  immune response, 
and patients may develop antibodies against polatuzumab vedotin.  Patients will be closely monitored for any potential immune response to polatuzumab vedotin.  Appropriate screening, confirmatory, and char acterization assays will be employed to 
assess ATAs before, during, and after the treatment with polatuzumab vedotin.   
Reproductive Toxicity 
Adverse effects on human reproduction and fertility are anticipated with the administration of polatuzumab vedotin giv en the mechanism of action of MMAE.  
Standard exclusion criteria are used to ensure that patients of childbearing potential (male or female) are using adequate contraceptive methods.  
Specific Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
Diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting have been reported frequently as treatment-emergent adverse events in Studies DCS4968g and GO27834 with polatuzumab vedotin.  Diarrhea has been responsible for study drug modification and discontinuations. 
Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin as well as with other ADCs that use the same vc-MMAE platform.  Hyperglycemia has been 
reversible upon holding or discontinuing treatment of the ADCs and/or initiation or adjustment of anti-hyperglycemic medications. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity has been observed in patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin in both the Phase I and II trials.  Although the relationship between hepatotoxicity and polatuzumab vedotin has not been definitively determined, transient, dose-related increases in hepatic enzymes were noted in nonclinical rat studies.  No hepatotoxicity was noted following administration of the surrogate ADC in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Elevations of transaminases have been r eported in patients receiving polatuzumab 
vedotin and have ranged in intensity from Grades 1-3.  These have been reversible with 
and without dose modification.

150/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 5.1.4 Risks Associated with Lenalidomide  
[IP_ADDRESS] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is structurally related to thalidomide, a known 
human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.  In a developmental study in monkeys, lenali domide caused limb abnormalities similar to 
birth defects caused by [CONTACT_311354].  If taken during pregnancy, lenalidomide 
is expected to have a teratogenic effect in humans. 
Lenalidomide must not be taken by [CONTACT_844943].  In every country where 
lenalidomide has been approved, a risk minimization plan, which includes a pregnancy prevention program, is in place.  Investigators must ensure that all specific local requirements that are applicable to the safe and effective use of lenalidomide are fulfilled prior to administration to patients.  The risk minimization plan should be followed by [CONTACT_844944], with one exception:  Because lenalidomide will be administered in combination with polatuzumab vedotin and 
obinutuzumab  or rituximab, patients must comply with contraceptive measures 
designed to ensure safe administration of all four  study treatments, as outlined in 
Section 4.1.1.  Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient 
misses her period or ha
s unusual /irregular  menstrual bleeding.  Treatment with 
lenalidomide must be discontinued until it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Toxicity 
Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Patients should 
have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first [ADDRESS_1174226] monthly thereafter.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Venous and Arte rial Thromboembolism 
Venous thromboembolic events (predominant ly deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism) have occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide.  Prophylactic anti-thrombotic medicines are recommended, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors.  The decision to take prophylactic measures should be made after a careful assessment of a patient’s underlying risk factors.  Thromboprophylaxis is 
presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Patients with known risk factors for thromboemb olism, includ
ing prior thrombosis, should 
be closely monitored.  Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]).  Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients.  Therefore, erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis (such as hormone replacement therapy), should be used with caution.  A hemoglobin concentration of >
 12 g/dL should lead to 
discontinuation of erythropoietic agents.

151/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174227] pain, or arm or leg swelling.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Flare Reaction 
Tumor flare reaction (TFR) has occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for treatment of CLL and lymphoma, and is c haracterized by [CONTACT_844991], 
low grade fever, pain, and rash.  Monitoring and evaluation for TFR are recommended in patients taking lenalidomide.  TFR may mimic disease progression.  Guidelines for the management of TFR are presented in Table 19.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Skin Reactions 
Angioedema and serious dermatologic reactions including SJS and TEN have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide.  These events can be fatal.  Guidelines for the management of severe skin reactions are presented in Table 19.  Patients with a 
history of erythema multiforme, Grade 
 ≥ 3 rash, or blistering following prior treatment 
with immunomodulatory derivatives (such as thalidomide and lenalidomide) will not be enrolled in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Fatal instances of TLS have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide.  Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment.  These patients should be monitored closely, and appropriate precautions should be taken. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone.  The mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown.  Preexisting viral liver diseas e, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and 
concomitant medications may be risk factors.  Liver enzymes are to be monitored periodically.  Guidelines for the management of hepatotoxicity are presented in Table 19.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Impairment 
Lenalidomide is substantially excreted by [CONTACT_10521].  Patients with renal impairment 
(i.e., calculated creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) will not be enrolled in this study.  
Renal function will be monitored during the study, and the lenalidomide dose may be adjusted as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (see Table 19). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thyroid Disorders 
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported during 
treatment with lenalidomide.  Optimal control of co-morbid conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before initiating lenalidomide treatment.  . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral neuropathy.  There was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
152/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 the long-term use of lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Second Primary Malignancies 
Patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide in studies that included melphalan and SCT had a higher incidence of second primary malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Patients are to be monitored for the development of second malignancies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiovascular Reactions 
Cases of serious adverse cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in patients with CLL treated with lenalidomide compared to single agent chlorambucil.  Patients will be monitored 
for the development of cardiac toxicities.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization 
Patients have been reported to show a decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment with lenalidomide.  Early referral to a transplant center is recommended in patients who are autologous SCT candidates.   
5.1.5 Risk of Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844894].  
Rituximab was safely combined with polatuzumab vedotin in patients with R/R FL or 
DLBCL.  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (21%) appeared to be the most important hematologic adverse event associated with this combination.  When given as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma, obinutuzumab was associated with 5% Grade [ADDRESS_1174228] an incidence of neutropenia that is higher that with rituximab monotherapy, there is a risk of increase incidence of neutropenia.  Obinutuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with R/R FL or DLBCL is currently being assessed in Study GO27834.  As these new data emerge, they will be assessed and applied to update this study if required.   
Lenalidomide has also been associated with hematologic adverse events, including 
neutropenia.  When lenalidomide was combined with obinutuzumab, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported to be 33.3% ( Morschhauser et al. 2014b).  
Therefore, the combination of G
 + Pola  + Len is anticipated to result in overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844910], for which patients will be closely monitored.  Guidelines for the management of patients who develop hemat ologic toxicities are provided in 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  In addition to the standard hematologic monitoring, 
patients enrolled in this  
study will be closely monitored for evidence of infections. 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
153/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174229] been associated with a risk 
of peripheral sensory neuropathy, it is unknown whether this risk may be increased when they are combined.  Therefore, peripheral neuropathy will be closely monitored, and guidelines for management for patients who develop neurotoxicity (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, sensory and/or motor) are provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS], and in 
Table 19. 
There is an identified risk of TLS if tr eated with obinutuzumab , rituxi
mab,  or 
lenalidomide and a theoretical risk if treated with polatuzumab vedotin because these 
agents can result in the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells.  Therefore, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_816992].  Guidelines for management of patients who develop TLS are provided in Table 19. 
Both rituximab a 
nd lenalidomide have been asso ciated with dermatologic reactions such 
as SJS and TEN, and the risk of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_844895].  Guidelines 
for management of patients who develop dermatologic toxicities are provided in Table 19.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_1174230] 
directly with CYP isoforms or other drug–metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters.  
Cytokine modulation may be considered as an indirect mechanism through which a monoclonal antibody could alter CYP expression.  However, treatment with obinutuzumab results in only transient increases in cytokine levels after the first infusion, and no increases are observed after subsequent infusions.  In vitro (human PBMCs) and in vivo (cynomolgus monkeys) treatment with anti-CD79 antibodies (i.e., the same antigen target as polatuzumab vedotin) showed a low risk for release of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines.  Taken together, these results suggest that both obinutuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin are unlikely to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_242960] e DDIs via indirect effects on cytokines.   
Second, lenalidomide is primarily excreted in the urine.  Lenalidomide is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the CYP group of enzymes ( Kumar et al. 2009).  In vitro, the 
MMAE component of polatuzumab vedotin is ma inly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and it is 
mainly elimi
nated by [CONTACT_844945].  Both lenalidomide and MMAE are 
substrates but not inhibitors of P-gp.  Owing to the different elimination pathways for lenalidomide and MMAE, the risk of CYP-mediated and transporter-mediated DDI risk is low when polatuzumab vedotin is combined with lenalidomide.   
In addition, simulation results suggest that unconjugated MMAE exposure is likely to be 
altered by 
 < 50% when polatuzumab vedotin is co-administered with strong CYP3A 
inhibitors or inducers.  Therefore, patients who receive concomitant medications that are strong CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product

Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study treatment. 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death) 
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study treatment 
• Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) 
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and
 seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).

law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as defined 
below: 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
 
when a contamination of any of the study treatment components is suspected. 
• TLS of any grade, irrespective of causality 
• Second malignancies 
 
5.2.4 Dose-Limiting Toxicities (I mmediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
During the DLT assessment window, adverse events identified as DLTs, as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1, are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the  event; see Section 5.4.2
 for 
reporting instructions). 
5.2.5 Selected Adverse Events  
Selected adverse events in this study are defined as adverse events for which additional 
data collection or analyses will be performed.  Selected adverse events do not require immediate reporting if they are not serious (except for TLS). 
The following adverse events are considered selected adverse events: 
• Thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia (events occurring during and 
within 24 hours following obinutuzumab infusion) 
• Hepatitis B reactivation 
• Cardiac events 
• TLS 
• IRRs • All infections, including PML

165/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • Neutropenia, including prolonged neutropenia (neutropenia < 1000 cells/ μL that 
does not resolve after 28 days without obinutuzumab treatment) and late-onset 
neutropenia (neutropenia < 1000 cells/ μL occurring  ≥ 28 days after obinutuzumab 
treatment has been completed or stopped)  
• Peripheral neuropathy (motor and/or sensory) 
• Gastrointestinal perforation 
 
Events for which additional data collection will be required are PML and hepatitis B 
reactivation. 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to th
e Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.4−5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will 
make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3), and causality (see Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_1174236].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained  but prior to initiation of study treatment , 
only serious adverse events caused by a pr otocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see 
Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). 
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_1174237]
 dose of study treatment.  After this period, the investigator should report 
any serious adverse events that are belie ved to be related to prior study treatment and 
events of second malignancies for patients who received obinutuzumab (see 
Section 5.6). 
An exception is for the FL pa ti
ents, where Grade 3 and 4 infections (both related and 
unrelated) should be reported until up to [ADDRESS_1174238] dose of obinutuzumab.

166/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?" 
"Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) will be used 
for assessing adverse event severity.  Table 21 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Table 21 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE 
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening;

Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medica tions, as performed by [CONTACT_25744]. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions),  per the definition of seriou s 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
d Grade [ADDRESS_1174239] be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instruction
s), per the definiti on of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
 
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to any of the study treatment 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
167/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 components, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be 
taken into consideration: 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of study treatment 
modifications or discontinuation, or reintr oduction of study treatment (as applicable) 
• Known association of the event with the study treatment or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1174240] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-Related Reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after the end of study treatment infusion and are judged to be related to infusion of any of the study treatment components should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion-related reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion-Related Reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study treatment, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion-Related Reaction eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.

168/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events that Ar e Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A m edically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Details regarding any increase or decrease in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it 
should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  
The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by  [CONTACT_25748] "non-serious" 
to "serious,"
 providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data 
fields related to serious adverse events. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.

169/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events. 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia." 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
170/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (>  2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours aft er learning of 
the event), either as a se rious adverse event  or a non-serious 
adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1) that are attributed 
by [CONTACT_844995]/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All other on-study deaths, regardless of 
relationship to study treatment, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).  An IMC will monitor the 
frequency of deaths from all causes. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
171/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death"  should not 
be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac 
death").   
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "more frequent headaches"). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy or  Worsening of Lymphoma 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not
 be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on the Lugano 2014 criteria (see Appendix 5).  In rare cases, 
the determination of clinic al progression will be b 
ased on symptomatic deterioration.  
However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25675] (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
An event th
at leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678] 
• Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for study treatment 
administration or insertion of access dev ice for study treatment administration)

172/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33403]. 
The patient has not experienced an adverse event. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_844912] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in 
Treatment Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
No experience with overdosage is a v
ailable from human clinical trials.  In clinical trials 
with obinutuzumab, doses ranging from [ADDRESS_1174241] report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_1174242] 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
173/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174243] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to any of the study treatments: 
• Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) 
• Adverse events of special interest (s ee Section 5.4.2
 for further details) 
• Dose-lim i
ting toxici ties (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) 
• Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for f urther details) 
 
The investig
ator must report new significant follo w-up information for the
se events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
• Change in causality based on new information • Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

[IP_ADDRESS] Events that Occur prior to Study Treatment Initiation 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be reported.  The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_25750]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Events that Occur after Study Treatment Initiation 
After initiation of study treatment, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until [ADDRESS_1174247] dose of study treatment.  After this 
period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be 
related to prior study treatment (see Section 5.6).  DLTs will be reported during the DLT 
assessment window.  Investigators should recor
d all case details that can be gathered 
immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A report will be generated and sent to [COMPANY_002] Safety Risk Management by [CONTACT_27950]. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_25750].  Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting events after the  adverse events reporting period  are provided 
in Section 5.6. 
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1174248] 
dose of study treatment.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_123565].  Pregnancy 
should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator 
should discontinue study treatment and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with 
the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during  or after the 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
175/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients 
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
[ADDRESS_1174249] dose of study treatment.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_162492].  Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and 
outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study 
treatment.  The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and 
Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow-up on her 
pregnancy.  After the authorization has been signed, the investigator will submit a 
Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and 
outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_589986], to support an informed decision in 
cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exposure of Pregnant Female  to Lenalidomide  
If a pregnant female not enrolled in the study (e.g., caregiver or pharmacist) is exposed 
to lenalidomide, the Adverse Event Form pr ovided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the exposure), either by [CONTACT_844996].  The woman should be 
referred to an obstetrician or gynecologist, preferably one who is experienced in 
reproductive toxicity, for further evaluation and counseling.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions 
Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital Anom alies/Birth Defects 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).

176/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174250] to follow-up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study treatment or study-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification. 
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.   
5.5.[ADDRESS_1174251], and 
pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERIOD 
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as [ADDRESS_1174252] dose of study treatment), if the event is believed to be related to 
prior study treatment.  The sponsor should also be notified of events of second 
malignancies after the end of the adverse event reporting period for patients who received obinutuzumab.   
An exception is for patients receiving obinutuzumab, where  Grade 3–4 infections (both 
related and unrelated) should be reported until up to [ADDRESS_1174253] dose of study treatment. 
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either 
by [CONTACT_25752]/Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Form  using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.   
During survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of lymphoma should be 
recorded only on the Study Completion/Early Discontinuation eCRF. 
 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
177/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174254] experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document: 
• Obinutuzumab Investigator's Brochure (Oncology) 
• Rituximab Investigator’s Brochure (Oncology) 
• Polatuzumab Vedotin Investigator's Brochure

The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non -randomized study will evaluate the safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of G  + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R FL and 
R + Pola  + Len in patients with R/R  DLBCL . 
The study will include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342].  
The dose-escalation phase in FL patients is designed to determine the RP2Ds for both 
polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomi de when combined with fixed doses  of 
obinutuzumab.  The dose-escalation phase in DLBCL pa tients is designed to determine 
the RP2D of lenalidomide when combined wi th fixed doses of pola tuzumab vedotin (1.8 
mg/kg) and rituximab (375 mg/m2).  During the expansion phase, additional patients 
with R/R FL or DLBCL will undergo treatment with polatuzumab vedotin and lenalidomide at their respective RP2Ds in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab . 
Study data will be summarized separately for each phase.  Data from the 
dose-escalation phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084] (assigned dose level).  Data from the expansion phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719] (i.e., FL or DLBCL).  Data will be summarized as warranted, and listings will be used in place of tables when the sample sizes are small.

 + 3 algorithm, as outlined in Section 3.1.  It is anticipated that enrollment of 5 cohorts of 
3−6 patients each, for a total of 18− 30 patients, w
ill be required to establish the RP2D 
during the dose-escalation phase  for patients with R/R FL.  An additional 3 possible 
cohorts of 3 −6 patients each, for a total of 12 −18 patients will be required to establish 
the RP2D during the dose-escalation phase for patients with R/R DLBCL.  
Approximately 80 patients (40 patients with FL and 40 patients with DLBCL) will be 
enrolled during the expansion phase.  Overall, approximately 110−[ADDRESS_1174256] −defined CR at EOI. 
Data from completed and ongoing studies in similar disease settings will be used as historical controls for comparison.  Currently available data indicate that the historical CR rate based on PET-CT scans is 40% for R/R FL and DLBCL.   
A sample size of 40 patients is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision for the 
point estimate and for the lower bound of the two-sided 90% CI to rule out a clinically uninteresting probability of response of <
 55%, assuming an observed PET-CT −defined 
CR rate of 70%.   
Table 22 lists the two-sided 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CIs for the true probability of achieving a PET-CT −defined CR at EOI for a range of obser ved proportions based o 
n a 
sample of 40 patients.

6.2 DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The following populations are defined: 
• The primary safety and efficacy populations will include patients who received at 
least one dose of any component of the combination.   
• The intent-to-treat population will includ e all patients enrolled in the study. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1174257] OF STUDY 
Enrollment, major protocol violations, and discontinuations from the study will be listed.  
The incidence of treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated.   
Data related to administration of study treatment components will be listed, and any 
dose modifications will be flagged.  The number of doses, treatment cycles, average dose received, and relative dose intensity for each treatment component will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range). 
6.4 SUMMARIES OF DEM OGRAPHIC AND BASELINE 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race, and duration of malignancy, will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.

180/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
The safety analyses will include all treated patients (i.e., patients who received any 
amount of study treatment).  Data for patients in the dose-escalation phase will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_844947] , and data for patients in the expansion phase 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719] (FL or DLBCL).   
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events and changes from 
baseline in laboratory test results, shift-tables of ECGs findings, and vital signs. 
All adverse events occurring on or after fi rst study treatment will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_27940], appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE, Version 4.[ADDRESS_1174258] scans alone, using 
the Lugano 2014 criteria (see Appendix 5). 
6.6.[ADDRESS_1174259] −based Lugano 2014 
criteria.  Point estimates will be presented, along with the corresponding two-sided 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CIs.  Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders. 
6.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy analyses will be estimation of the proportion of patients achieving each of the following endpoints:  
• CR at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_817001]-CT scans 

 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
181/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 • CR at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844949] 
• Objective response (defined as a CR or PR) at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844950]-CT scans 
• Objective response (defined as a CR or PR) at EOI, as determined by [CONTACT_844951] 
• Best response of CR or PR during the study, as determined by [CONTACT_844952], along with the corresponding two-sided 90% 
Clopper-Pearson exact CIs.  Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders. 
6.6.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Exploratory efficacy analyses will include estimation of the proportion of patients achieving each of the following endpoints:  
• For patients who have positive PET scans at EOI:   
– CR at [ADDRESS_1174260] scans , in FL patients 
– CR at EOC, as determined by [CONTACT_844953]-CT scans, in DLBCL patients 
 
Point estimates will be presented, along with the corresponding two-sided 90% 
Clopper-Pearson exact CIs.  Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders. 
Exploratory efficacy analyses will also be performed on the following endpoints:  
• PFS 
• EFS 
• DFS • OS 
 
PFS, EFS, DFS, and OS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier 
method ( Kaplan and Meier 1958 ).  For the PFS, EFS, and DFS analyses, data for 
patients without an event of interest will be censored at the 
date of the last tumor 
assessment.  For patients without post-baseline tumor assessments, data will be censored at the date of initiation of study treatment plus 1.  For the OS analysis, data for patients who have not died will be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive.  Where medians are reached, the corresponding estimated median will be provided, along with the 95% CI estimated using the method of Brookmeyer and 
Crowley (1982).   In addit i
on, landmark estimates of the proportion of patients who are

182/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 event free at 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 2 years will be provided, along with 95% 
asymptotic CIs using Greenwood’s formula for standard errors. 
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES 
Plasma/serum concentrations of obinutuzumab, rituximab,  polatuzumab vedotin, and 
lenalidomide will be tabulated, summarized, and plotted after appropriate groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  As 
appropriate, PK parameters (e.g., area under the curve [AUC], time to maximum concentration [t
max], maximum concentration [C max], half-life [t 1/2]) may also be calculated, 
tabulated, and summarized after appropriate groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Additional PK and PK/PD analyses (e.g., population modelling including pooled analyses across studies) may also be performed as appropriate.  If done, these additional analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  At the discretion of the Sponsor, all analyses may be extended to include relevant biotransformat ion products of polatuzumab vedotin or 
lenalidomide. 
6.[ADDRESS_1174261]-treatment HAHA-  or HACA-, and ATA-positive 
patients and HAHA-  or HACA-, and ATA-negative patients at baseline and during both 
the treatment and follow-up periods will be summarized by [CONTACT_505719].  Patients are considered to be ATA positive if they are ATA negative at baseline but develop an ATA response following study treatment administration (treatment-induced ATA response) or if they are ATA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post-baseline samples is at least 4-fold greater (i.e., 
 ≥ 0.60 titer units) than the titer of the 
baseline sample (treatment-enhanced ATA response).  Patients are considered to be ATA negative if they are ATA negative at baseline and all post-baseline samples are negative or if they are ATA positive at baseline but do not have any post-baseline samples with a titer that is at least 4-fold greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). 
The relationship between HAHA  or HACA,  and ATA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and 
biomarker endpoints will be explored as appropriate. 
6.9 BIOMARKER ANALYSES 
Exploratory analyses of biomarkers related to tumor biology and study treatment MOA 
will be conducted.  Analyses will assess the prognostic and/or predictive value of candidate biomarkers separately for each histologic subtype with respect to both IRC- and investigator-assessed outcomes.  Specifically, the association between candidate biomarkers and PET-CT −defined CR rate and objective response (CR
 + PR) rate, and 
potentially other measures of efficacy and safety, will be explored to assess potential prognostic or predictive value.  These analyses may not be included in the final study report because of their exploratory nature.  In addition to analysis in the context of this study, data will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. 
 
Obinutuzumab , Rituximab,  and Polatuzumab Vedotin—F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd 
183/Protocol GO29834, Version [ADDRESS_1174262] −defined CR at EOI.  Additional analyses may be 
conducted to guide early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_844901]. 
During the expansion phase, a modified version of the predictive probability design 
(Lee and Lui 2008 ) may be used to guide early st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_844913] a PET-CT −defined CR at EOI in each 
indication-specific expansion cohort  with that in historical controls.  Updated estimates 
for the assumed historical control PET-CT −defined CR rate will be available from 
currently ongoing studies by [CONTACT_844954].  The design is based on 
Lee and Lui 2008, with the modification that the uncertainty in th e historical control 
data is fully taken into account by [CONTACT_14662] a beta posterior on the control response rate.  
Interim analysis decision rules will be based on the predicative probability that the trial will have a positive outcome if carried out to completion and will use the historical control data available at the time of analysis.   
If, at any time, an interim analysis suggests that the proportion of patients achieving a 
PET-CT −defined CR for one of the indication-specific expansion cohorts is lower than 
expected, the IMC will review the data and decide whether to recommend an early decision to stop enrollment in that subgroup.   
Additional review of safety and/or effica cy data by [CONTACT_844955].  Further details regarding the rules 
and guidelines of data review will be provided to the IMC in an IMC charter. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.[ADDRESS_1174263] data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specif ication document that describes the 
quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data and any other 
externally-generated electronic study data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.

System backups for data stored by [CONTACT_260506]’s standard procedures. 
7.[ADDRESS_1174264] disc is required. 
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification, 
the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756].

scheduled, but the associated data do not need to be recorded on the eCRF (except in the case of an adverse event).   
a The screening period starts with the signing of the Informed Cons ent Form.  Results of standard-of -care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining 
informed consent and within the defined window may be used as screening and baseline assessments; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening 
purposes. 
b Patients who complete consolidation treatment or discontinue consolidation treatment prematur ely will undergo assessments at E OC. 
c EOI assessments should be performed 6 −[ADDRESS_1174287] induction cycle.  As an exception, patients who discontinue induction treatment 
prematurely because of an adverse event may undergo EOI assessments 4 −[ADDRESS_1174288] n ew or worsened clinically 
significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For rituximab infusions:  Vital signs monitoring during infusion should be determined as per local 
label.   For polatuzumab vedotin infusions :  During the administration of polatuzumab vedotin, vita l signs should be assessed before the start of the infusion, 
every 15 ( ±5) minutes during the infusion, at t he end of the infusion, and every 30 (± 10) minutes for 90 minutes following completion of dosing at Cycle 1 and 30 
(±10) minutes following completion of dosing in subsequent cycles.

(Cheson et al. 2014) 
In this study, the designation of a complete response ( CR) using positron emission to mography and computed tomography 
(PET-CT) −based response, requires normal bone marrow by [CONTACT_845000].  If 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], immunohistochemistry should be negative.  Additionally, designation of PET-CT based PR requires that 
CT-based response criteria for a CR or PR be met in addi tion to the PET-CT based response criteria for a PR.   
Revised Criteria for Response Assessment  
Response and Site PET-CT–Based Response CT-Based Response 
Complete Complete metabolic response Complete radiologic response (all of the following) 
Lymph nodes and 
extralymphatic sites Score 1, 2, or 3 a with or without a residual mass on 5PS b 
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal sites 
with high physiologic uptake or with activation within 
spleen or marrow (e.g., with chemotherapy or myeloid colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver.  In this circumstance, complete metabolic response may be inferred if uptake 
at sites of initial involvement is no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high 
physiologic uptake. Target nodes/nodal masses must regress to 
 ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi 
No extralymphatic sites of disease 
Non-measured lesion Not applicable Absent 
Organ enlargement Not applicable Regress to normal 
New lesions None None 
Bone marrow No evidence of FDG-avid disease in marrow  Normal by [CONTACT_5293]; if indeterminate, IHC negative

New lesions None None 
Bone marrow Residual uptake higher than uptake in normal 
marrow but reduced compared with baseline 
(diffuse uptake compatible  with reactive changes 
from chemotherapy allowed).  If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal response, consideration should be given to further evaluation with MRI or biopsy or

223/Protocol GO29834, Version 2 New lesions New FDG-avid foci co nsistent with lymphoma rather 
than another etiology (e.g., infection, inflammation); if 
uncertain regarding etiology of new lesions, biopsy or 
interval scan may be considered Regrowth of previously resolved lesions 
A new node > 1.5 cm in any axis 
A new extranodal site > 1.0 cm in any axis; if < 1.[ADDRESS_1174310] be 
attributable to lymphoma

to lymphoma 
Bone marrow New or recurrent FDG-avid foci New or recurrent involvement 
5PS =  5-point scale; CT = computed tomography; FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose; GI =  gastrointestinal; IHC = immunohistochemistry; LDi = longest 
transverse diameter of a lesion; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PET =  positron emission tomography; [COMPANY_003] = cross product of the LDi and 
perpendicular diameter; SDi = shortest axis perpendicular to the LDi; SPD = sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters for multiple 
lesions. 
a A score of [ADDRESS_1174311] treatment, especially if at the time of an interim scan.  However, in 
trials involving PET where de-escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to cons ider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid 
undertreatment).  Measured dominant lesions:  Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions sel ected to be 
clearly measurable in two diameters.  Nodes should preferably be fr om disparate regions of the body  and should include, where a pplicable, 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas.   Non-nodal lesions incl ude those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs),  GI involvement, 
cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation.  Non-measured lesi ons:  Any disease not selected as measured; dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not  measured.  These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not se lected as 
dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as tru ly assessable 
disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pl eural effusions, 
ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal mass es, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_92156].  In 
Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (e .g., GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake  may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete 
metabolic response, but should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (e.g., with marrow activation as a resul t of 
chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors). 
b PET 5PS:  1 = no uptake above background; 2 =  uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3 = uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4 =  uptake moderately > liver; 
5 = uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X = new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.

Anaphylaxis Precautions 
EQUIPMENT NEEDED  
• Tourniquet 
• Oxygen 
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33414], intravenous (IV), and/or endotracheal use in 
accordance with standard practice  
• Antihistamines • Corticosteroids 
• IV infusion solutions, tubing, catheters, and tape 
 
PROCEDURES  
In the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction during study treatment infusion, the 
following procedures should be performed: 
• Stop the study treatment infusion. 
• Apply a tourniquet proximal to the injection site to slow systemic absorption of study 
treatment.  Do not obstruct arterial flow in the limb. 
• Maintain an adequate airway. 
• Administer glucocorticoids, antihistamines, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other medications as 
required by [CONTACT_294905]. 
• Continue to observe the patient and document observations.

Ann Arbor Staging 
Grade Description 
Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node region (I) or of a single 
extralymphatic organ or site (IE) a 
Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions or lymphatic 
structures on the same side of the diaphragm alone (II) or with 
involvement of limited, contiguou s extralymphatic organ or tissue 
(IIE) 
Stage III Involvement of lymph node regi ons on both sides of the diaphragm 
(III), which may include the sple en (IIIS) or limited, contiguous 
extralymphatic organ or site  (IIIE), or both (IIIES) 
Stage IV b Diffuse or disseminated foci of involvement of one or more 
extralymphatic organs or tissue s, with or without associated 
lymphatic involvement 
Note:  All cases are subclassified to indicate t he absence (A) or presence (B) of the systemic 
B symptoms of significant unexplained fever ( > 38°C), night sweats, or unexplained weight loss 
exceeding 10% of body weight during the 6 months prior to diagnosis. 
a The designation "E" generally refers to extr anodal contiguous extension (i.e., proximal or 
contiguous extranodal disease) that can be encompassed within an irradiation field 
appropriate for nodal disease of the same anatomic  extent.  A single extralymphatic site as 
the only site of disease should be cla ssified as IE, rather than Stage IV. 
b Involvement of bone marrow at screening will always qualify for Ann Arbor Stage IV and 
should be recorded as extranodal involvement.

Study Protocol (see pub lished results – citation above for further details)  
Between 7/2018 and 7/2019, e ligible participants  were recruited from the community by 
[CONTACT_69417] . Eligibility included being age [ADDRESS_75730] moderate symptom s (Yale -Brown Obsessive -Compulsive Scale  [Y-BOCS]  
score ≥ 18), and having  failed ≥ one prior adequate trial ( using  APA Guidelines ’ dose and duration  
definitions ) of first -line OCD treatment (SRI or CBT ). The Stanford Institutional  Review Board 
approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants  who were 
already  taking an SRI remained on a stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks before  study entry. Exclusion 
criteria were:  severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS -17] > 20) ; age of OCD 
onset > 30 years ; comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions mak ing participation unsafe ; or 
taking  medications that increase cortical excitability, inhibit brain excitability , or create hazard 
with TMS. Subjects planning to commence CBT within 8 weeks before  enrollment  were also 
excluded . Independent raters administered the Y -BOCS (primary outcome measure) week ly for 4 
weeks . Response was defined a priori  as a > 35% reduction in Y -BOCS score . The primary 
outcome was change in Y -BOCS score at Day 14.  
 
Before beginning  the accelerated  cTBSmod  protocol , each participant completed a neuroimaging  
session that included a resting sequence for determining a personalized frontal pole TMS target  
and task-based fMRI  elicited by [CONTACT_69418] /No-Go task  (Supplementary Material) . All scans were 
acquired using a 3 -tesla GE Discovery MR750 scanner with a  NOVA Medical  32-channel head  
coil and a 3x accelerated multi -band  (simultaneous multi -slice) imaging sequence with a repetition 
time of 2 seconds.  
 
The resting state fMRI sequence was acquired to generate each participant’s personalized right 
frontal pole TMS target ( Supplementary Material ). The right frontal pole subunit showing greatest 
connectivity across all the ventral striatum subunits was selected as the stimulation target in each 
participant (target generation methods and commentaries are provided elsewhere ).[5, 10]  
 
Participants received [ADDRESS_75731] contained 3 pulses at 30 Hz, repeated at 6 Hz .[1] Ten sessions were applied per day 
(18,000 pulses/day, hourly) (90,000 total pulses) using a Magventure Magpro X100. Stimulation 
was delivered at 90% resting motor threshold  (depth corrected).  Localite Neuronavigation System 
was used to position the TMS co il over the individualized stimulation target.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Mann -Whitney nonparametric test with Y-BOCS change score as outcome was conducted  to 
determine the group difference (responders vs nonresponders) in magnitude  of change in left and 
right DLPFC activity, elicited during inhibitory control, from before to after treatment  with the 
cTBSmod  protocol . The Wilcoxon signed rank test (i.e., paired test) was used to determine  within 
individual differences between left and ri ght side of the DLPFC in  cognitive control activ ation 
evoked by [CONTACT_69419] -Go condition of the Go/No -Go task.  One participant was removed from the 
neuroimaging analysis due to excess motion.

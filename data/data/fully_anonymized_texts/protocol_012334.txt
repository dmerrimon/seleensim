2. Introduction & Study Rationale  
The human skin aging process is characterized by [CONTACT_123761], atrophy of the extracellular matrix, 
and reduced collagen synthesis.  Overwhelming epi[INVESTIGATOR_123752] n play a major role in causing the undesirable skin 
changes of fine and coarse wrinkles, roughness, laxity, mottled pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], actinic lentigines, actinic 
keratoses, leathery texture/coarseness, scaling/xerosis, shallowness, and telangiectasia1. 
Althoug h facelift  surgical procedure  remain s an extremely effective and popular method to reduce static 
rhytids, there has been a dramatic paradigm shift toward non -surgical skin tightening and rejuvenation 
techniques, as patients seek to achieve skin tightening with no or minimal downtime procedures.  
Non -ablative energy treatments for skin laxity and rhytides have grown rapi[INVESTIGATOR_123753] [ADDRESS_139318] 
and, additionally, the devices could often not be used on darker skin types due to risk of discoloration 
and scarring following absorption of energy by [CONTACT_123762]2. 
Radiofrequency (RF) devices have been reported to achieve modest clinical effic acy in skin tightening 
without many of the limitations of other energy devices, and may therefore represent an ideal 
treatment option for non -invasive skin tightening3-5. 
However, m ost RF treatments  are administrated by [CONTACT_123763] , this treatment is time 
consuming and causes  operator fatigue reducing the most effective outcome of the treatment. Evoke  
device allowing hands free procedure  that eliminates operato r dependency factor.  
The Evoke  devic e is a non -invasive  system based on radiofrequency (RF) energies. The Evoke  provide s a 
non-invasive approach to achieve a desired aesthetic effect ( skin tightening and wrinkle reduction ). The  
system is designed to enable an automatic, hands -free, full facial treatment that is based on a 
predefined user protocol. In addition, the system incorporates a skin -temperature control into the 
protocol, enabling accurate, stable and safer treatment.  
This prospective study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of Evoke  system using  radio 
frequency for wrinkles reduction and skin tightening . Aging is associated  with a decrease in collagen 
turnover due to a decrease in fibroblasts and elastin.  The degradation and disorganization of elastin 
fibers contribute to  skin laxity and wrinkles.  We may be able to see improvement in histology.

4. Device Description  
The Evoke  Platform employs Radio -frequency (RF) technology for various aesthetic applications.  
The Evoke  System with the Cheek and Chin Applicators is a hands -free medical aesthetic device using RF 
energy for the treatment of selected medical conditions such as relief of minor muscle aches and pain, 
relief of muscle spasm, temporary improvement of local blood circulation.  
RF energy does not cause any thermal damage to the treated skin. The System prov ides individual 
adjustment of RF power to achieve maximum efficiency, safety and comfort for each patient. The 
System provides enhanced safety while minimizing possible side effects by [CONTACT_123764].   
The System incorporates the follo wing safety features. All personnel operating the System should be 
familiar with these features.  
• System has unique password to avoid device operation by [CONTACT_105] -authorized personnel.  
• An audible tone indicates energy activation.  
• Special audible tone will be act ivated in case of bad coupling of one of the applicators.  
• During activation, the system performs a self -test of the hardware.  
• Hardware is tested every 1 msec. to ensure proper operation of electrical circuits.  
• Skin surface temperature is monitored during t he treatment. RF energy delivery is 
terminated when skin temperature accidentally reaches the Cut -Off level.  
• System starts at a low setting.

8. Study Procedures  
The Time and Events Schedule is provided in Appendix 1.0.  
8.1 Screening and Base line (Visit 1)   
Screening visit will be performed in order to determine subject eligibility and to collect all required 
demographic and baseline clinical information. Study procedures and available treatment options, 
including the RF technology will be des cribed in detail to the subject. Subject will be assured that the 
decision regarding participation in the study is strictly voluntary and that they are free to change their 
mind at any stage.  
The subject will review the informed consent form and the study  will be explained to the subject 
including all risks, potential benefits, procedures, visit requirements, and other alternative treatment 
options.   If the subject qualifies and wishes to participate,  he/she  will complete the ICF with a signature 
[CONTACT_3670] .  The original will be retained with subject’s records and a copy will be provided to the subject. 
Subjects will then be screened for study eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
The following Demographic and Baseline Measurements will  be performed:  
- Demographic data including gender, age, race, skin type (Fitzpatrick scale).  
- ICF - Prior to any study procedures, informed consent will be obtained.  When the subject fully 
understands the possible benefits and risks of the study, the subjec t will be asked to sign and date 
the informed consent form (ICF).  The subject will be given a copy of the signed ICF.  
- Subject ID - subjects will be assigned a study subject ID number.  
- Medical History - A medical history will be obtained to determine if t he subject meets the study 
criteria, including a list of all prescribed and over the counter medications taken within the 
previous [ADDRESS_139333]. This will be repeated prior to all treatment s, and at the end of the study (last FU 
visit, 6-month  FU).   
- If the Screening and Treatment procedures are not conducted on the same day, the urine 
pregnancy test will be repeated on the first treatment day.  
- Photography – Baseline photographs will be obtained using a consistent camera and subject 
placement settings with a digital imaging system.  
- 3D Photography – Baseline 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_123754]  3D system . PI [INVESTIGATOR_123755] a is used throughout the study.  
- Up to 5 study participants be selected for baseline biopsy  
- Scheduling: Subjects will be scheduled to return for the baseline and first treatments visit within 
3 weeks following the screening visit  
8.2 Treatment (visits 1 -3) 
The Evoke  treatment may occur on the same day of screening and baseline visit (or within 3 weeks 
following screening).  
 Treatment with the Evoke  System for Facial and Submental Laxity  
Protocol No:  DO609886A  
SIRB ID:                     Rev. Date:  [ADDRESS_139334]. 20  
 
Enrolled subjects will undergo up to 3 successive bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) treatments (Tx.1, Tx.2 and 
Tx.3). Additional three  (3) visits in the clinic will occur  to follow -up the skin appearance changes  and 
wrinkles  reduction at visits 4 ,5 and 6  (4 weeks  (except site #3 ) [ADDRESS_139335] 
treatment).  
Treatment area:  Treatment area  will include face  and under chin  
Urine Pregnancy Test will be performed prior to each procedure.  
Treatment procedure:  
• Remove any jewellery in the treatment area  
• Clean the Evoke Applicator with 70% alcohol.  Detach electrodes from the mask frame (Cheek 
Applicator) using ma gnetic connection if needed.  
• Test the Patient Call Button prior to each session.  This will pause the treatment.  
• Long and dense hairs may affect the treatment and should be shaved according to physician’s 
discretion.  
• Clean and dry the skin surface prior t o applying the Applicators. Ensure there are no creams, 
lotions or sweat residue on the area to be treated.  
• Treatment is performed in an upright sitting position. Ensure patient is comfortably seated.  
• Make sure that the Applicator for the treatment corresponds to the device interface.  
• Apply 2 -4mm clear ultrasound gel (not oil) to the treatment area.  
• Apply the Evoke Applicator (Chin or Cheeks) on top of the treatment area and adjust according to 
patient comfort.  
• For Cheek Applicator:  
o Position the applicator -stabilizer (black metal hoop) on the back of the neck. Adjust the 
applicator according to patient anatomy.  For a wider face, pull the stabilizer all the way 
out. For a narrow face, bring the stabilizer all the way in.  Ensure that patient is seated 
upright when positioning the applicator on the head.  Do not allow the patient to lean 
their head backward as the applicator will shift forward out of position. Patient head must 
remain upright throughout the entire treatment.     
o Secure the Applicator with 2 additional adjustable straps. One strap is positioned on the 
back of the head, and one across the top or the head.  
• For Chin Applicator:  
o Place the Applicator on the under -chin area. Ensure that the electrodes are positioned  on 
the soft tissue, not on bony areas. The position of the applicator should not be angled or 
tilted.  
o Secure the Applicator with the adjustable strap on the top of the head. Use additional 
silicone strap to secure the Applicator on the chin to prevent it  from sliding to the neck.  
o There should be a complete coupling between all Applicator electrodes and the skin 
during the treatment session.  
o Adjust or reposition the Applicator if one or more electrodes do not have complete 
contact [CONTACT_8124]. In the e vent that the proper coupling between the electrodes and 
the skin cannot be achieved, due to patient anatomy or surface irregularities (such as 
 Treatment with the Evoke  System for Facial and Submental Laxity

moles, scars, etc.), disable the specific electrode.  Treatments can still be conducted if one 
or more of the el ectrodes are disabled.  
• Provide patient with Patient Call Button and educate on proper use . 
• Start with lower energy levels and gradually increase according to patient’s comfort level. Set 
treatment time to desired treatment duration and press the Start butt on.  
• Treatments can be paused by [CONTACT_123767].  
• In case the Applicator needs to be readjusted or repositioned, pause the treatment, readjust the 
Applicator and restart the treatment. DO NOT readjust the A pplicator when treatment is 
activated.  
• The procedure should NOT feel hot or intolerable to the patient. If the patient complains of 
discomfort, immediately pause the treatment and inspect the area.  Treatment can be continued 
with one or more of units dis abled. Reduce RF power if required.  
• Consequent cyclic electrodes activation during the procedure will be reflected on the screen.  
• The treatment attendant should not leave the room after starting the treatment as it is important 
for the clinician to ensure that all Applicators reach the desired cut -off temperature and that the 
RF energy is maintained at the cut -off level.  This should take approximately 2 -5 minutes.   
• During the procedure check Applicators position occasionally, as they can be shifted from t he

9. Adverse Events Reporting  
9.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event:  
An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study participant 
during their participation in the study.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that:  
• Led to death  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in a life -threatening illness 
or injury  
• Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
• Required in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242]  
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure 
or a body function  
• Led to fatal distress, a congenital abnormality, birth defect or death  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Event:  
An u nanticipated adverse event is any serious, device -related adverse event, if that event was not 
previously identified in the risk analysis and Informed Consent form in nature, severity, or frequency.  
AE Severity:  
Adverse events are graded according to severity as follows  (Table 3) : 
Mild  Sign or symptom, usually transient, requiring no special treatment and 
generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate  Sign or symptom, which may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_39508]; yet, may interfere with usual activity.  
 Treatment with the Evoke  System for Facial and Submental Laxity  
Protocol No:  DO609886A  
SIRB ID:                     Rev. Date:  [ADDRESS_139339]. 20  
 
Severe  Sign or symptom that are intense or debilitating and that interfere with 
usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by [CONTACT_123768].   
Relationship to Device:  
The relationship of the adverse event to the treatments or procedures is defined as fol lows (Table 4):  
Most Probably Related:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device 
delivery/retrieval and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26562]’s clinical data or the surgical 
procedure applied.  
Possibly Related:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device 
delivery/retrieval but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_123769].  
Probably not Related:  Temporal associa tion is such that the study device is not likely to 
have had any reasonable association with the observed event.  
Unrelated  No relationship to study device activation is perceived  
9.2 Anticipated Adverse Events in this Clinical Evaluation  
Possible Evoke  adverse effects include but are not limited by:  
- discomfort or pain,  
- excessive skin redness (erythema)  
- swelling (edema),  
- damage to natural skin texture (crust, blister and burn),  
- change of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (hyper - and hypo -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]),  
- bruising,  
- scarri ng.

12.2 On-Site Visits  
Periodic on -site monitoring visits are intended to assess the Investigator’s adherence to the protocol, 
maintena nce of records and reports, and review of source documents for accuracy, completeness, and 
legibility, and monitoring of Adverse Events.  
During periodic visits the monitor is required  to: 
• Assess the progress of the study towards meeting study objectives.  
• Identify any concerns that stem from observations of device performance and/or review of the 
subject’s CRF, study management documents, and informed Consent documents.  
• Monitor AE reporting and investigations.  
Reports of on -site visits will be submitted by [CONTACT_123775], as applicable, resolution of 
concerns, completion of appropriate follow -up activities, completion of assigned tasks, and corrective 
actions. Some ‘visits’ may be performed using a conference call/ video conference call and will not be actual 
physical visits.

12.5 Site Closure Visit  
A Site Closure Visit will be conducted to ensure that all relevant documentation is filed and archived under 
the Investigator’s responsibility according to regulations.  
13. Risk/Benefit  Analysis  
13.1 Expected Risks:  
As indicated in section 10.2 p ossible Evoke  handpi[INVESTIGATOR_123757]:  
• discomfort or pain,  
• excessive skin redness (erythema)  
• swelling (edema),  
• damage to natural skin texture (crust, blister and burn),  
• change of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  (hyper - and hypo -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]),  
• bruising,  
• scarring.

Protocol No:  DO609886A  
SIRB ID:                     Rev. Date:  [ADDRESS_139350]. 20  
 
These risks are m inimal  when compared to other  methods of skin tightening that are being utilized  (such 
us surgical facelift) .  
13.2 Expected Benefits:  
The expected benefit of using the Evoke  is achieving the desired skin improvement  via non invasive 
technique. It is obvious that the low risk profile of the RF utilizing Evoke  device  greatly benefits the 
individual seeking treatment for skin appearance imp rovement  and wrinkles reduction  as it significantly 
minimizes the risks associated with other techniques such as  surgery .  
13.3 Conclusion:  
It can therefore be claimed that the expected benefits associated with the use of the Evoke  device  
outweigh its risks.  
14. Data analysis  
14.1 Analysis Sets  
• Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects using Embrace  procedures at least a single time.  
• Performance Analysis Set  
Performance analysis set will consist of all subjects providing at least one post treatment performance 
measurement.  
• Treatment of Missing Values  
Only observed data will be used; i.e. missing data will not be imputed.  
14.[ADDRESS_139351] will be 
computed to assess changes in before treatment and follow -up scores. Statistical significance will be 
calculated and two -tail significance level of 0.05 will be used.

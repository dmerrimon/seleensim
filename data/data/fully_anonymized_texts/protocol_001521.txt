  * Study  Name:  
[CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_653978]  
 
 * Brief Description (using layman's terms) - 500 words or  less:  
Frail Veterans are at increased risk for poor surgical outcomes, and as the Veteran population 
grows older and more frail, there is a critical need to identify effective strategies for reducing 
surgical risks for these patients. Prior research shows that i nter-disciplinary rehabilitation 
strategies deployed after surgery enhance recovery and improve outcomes by [CONTACT_654017]. We believe that similar improvements may be obtained by [CONTACT_654018] “pr ehabilitate” patients’ capacity to tolerate the stress of surgery. 
The proposed research will examine the feasibility of a new, prehabilitation intervention aimed at 
improving postoperative surgical outcomes through preoperative exercise training and nutri tional 
supplementation. Findings from the study will inform the design of a larger randomized controlled 
trial of the prehabilitation intervention. If proven effective, prehabilitation could benefit as many 
as 42,000 frail Veterans who are scheduled for ma jor elective surgery each year.  
 
 * Abstract. Please provide a brief description of the  study . 
Background : Frail Veterans are at increased risk for poor surgical outcomes. Although surgeons 
operate safely on even the oldest old, if the elder is also frail,  the stress of surgery can result in 
significant mortality, morbidity, and institutionalization. Frailty is a clinical syndrome marked by 
[CONTACT_307703], diminished strength, decreased physical activity, and exhaustion. It is 
independent of any specific di sease, but it increases with age, and is a more powerful predictor of 
increased perioperative mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and cost than predictions based on 
age or comorbidity alone. As the Veteran and US populations grow older and more frail, it  is 
critically important to identify effective strategies for improving the surgical outcomes of these 
patients.  
“Prehabilitation” has the potential to improve surgical outcomes among the frail. Prior 
research demonstrates that inter -disciplinary rehabilit ation strategies deployed after surgery 
enhance recovery and improve outcomes by [CONTACT_654019], improving nutrition, and optimizing 
home supports. Based on this success, there is growing interest in deploying similar interventions 
before surgery in wha t some call “prehabilitation.” By [CONTACT_654020], prehabilitation aims to augment patients’ capacity to compensate for the stress of both 
surgery and recovery. Frail patients will likely benefit disproportionately from preh abilitation 
because they have the most diminished capacity to adapt to the stress of surgery. However, 
prehabilitation has not yet been studied in either Veteran or specifically frail  populations.  
Objectives : We will examine the feasibility of a novel, mul tifaceted pre -habilitation intervention 
aimed at improving postoperative outcomes for frail Veterans undergoing major abdominal 
surgery. Specific aims are to:  
(1) Estimate rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, and compliance with the 
prehabilitation  intervention;  
(2) Measure (a) physical performance, (b) pulmonary function, and (c) nutrition at baseline and 
2-week intervals to estimate changes over time and explore the optimal duration of 
prehabilitation (2 vs. 4 vs. 6 weeks);  and 
(3) Estimate overall and tre atment -specific summary statistics for postoperative outcomes in 
terms of 30 - and 90 -day (a) mortality, (b) major complications, (c) length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], (d) 
health -related quality of life, (e) quality of surgical care, and (f) change in level of indep endent 
living.  
Methods : This randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_112545] a consecutive cohort of up to 50 Veterans 
identified as frail using a standardized frailty assessment and scheduled for major abdominal 
surgery on the general or urological surgery services at the VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710]. We 
will randomize participants 1:1 to receive either: (1) standard preoperative optimization by [CONTACT_654021] & Treatment Clinic (IMPACT), or  
(2) prehabil itation + standard IMPACT optimization. The 6 -week long prehabilitation intervention 
 
 will include (1) strength and balance training; (2) inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13982]; and (3) nutritional 
coaching and supplementation. Assessments will include standard postop erative outcomes as well 
as the Short Physical Performance Battery to measure physical performance, Maximal Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_653979], and both prealbumin and the 7 -point Subjective Global 
Assessment to measure nutrition. Outcomes will be assessed 30 or 90 days after surgery. 
Compliance with the prehabilitation regimen will be assessed through patient logs and  
pedometers. Analyses will inform the development of a larger randomized controlled trial testing 
the prehabilitation interve ntion. Findings will be relevant for the as many as 42,000 frail Veterans 
scheduled for major elective surgery each year.

any secondary aims and  hypotheses.

 * Provide a summary of the background of the study and  explain how this research  will 
contribute to existing knowledge. Describe previous studies that provides a basis to  
show that the proposed research can be carried out without undue risk to human 
subjects.  
A.1.  What is frailty? Although frailty can be defined in many ways, an international panel of 
experts convened in [ADDRESS_877446] consisting of 6 domains 
(physical  performance,  gait speed,  mobility,  nutritional  status,  mental  health  and cognition)  that 
together indicate increased risk of death, disability and institutionalization.[ADDRESS_877447]. As s uch, frailty can be conceptualized as a 
measure of “physiologic reserve, ” defined as the critical threshold at which external stressors 
overwhelm the human body’s multiple mechanisms for adaptation, resulting in  decompensation  
(i.e., acute illness or injur y).[ADDRESS_877448] 80 year old might survive an operation that a frail 60 year old 
might not.  
A.2.  Frailty will increase as the US and Veteran populations age, constituting a growing 
vulnerable population. By 2040, the population over age 65 is expecte d to double and  continue  
expanding thereafter.35 Many aging Veterans will develop decreased physical and cognitive 
capacities,36-38 making them vulnerable to impaired decision making,39 loss of independence,40 
polypharmacy41 and elder abuse.42 The VA’s Str ategic Plan for 2014 -2020 recognizes that 
“geriatric care will continue to be a significant portion of VA’s health care,”[ADDRESS_877449], our preliminary analysis demonstrates similar patterns across 1,632 
major abdominal operations performed at VAPHS from 2010 to 2014 where 192 (11.8%) Veterans 
with differing degrees of frailty suffered dramatically increased mortality, morbidity a nd length of 
stay. Even in the mildly frail, [ADDRESS_877450] (4% vs. 0.4%, p<.001), and increased dramatically with increasing frailty. However, little 
is known about how to improve the surgical out comes of frail  patients . 
A.4.  A recent expert panel of VA surgeons identified several potential targets  for 
improving surgical care of Veterans before, during, and after surgery .[ADDRESS_877451], our previous work provides preliminary support for this 
hypothesis: In one of the only prospective attempts to improve the surgical care of the frail, we 
demons trated that pre -operative, palliative care consultation ordered by a surgeon to inform and 
clarify surgical decision -making was associated with a markedly reduced odds of dying, even after 
controlling for age, frailty, and whether or not Veterans had surge ry (OR=0.27; 95% CI  
0.11-0.68, p=.006).[ADDRESS_877452] 
mobilize and then advance activity for patients who had survived what was usually a devastating 
myocardial infarction and/or who had undergone what was usually a severely debilitating  coronary  
artery by[CONTACT_14720].[ADDRESS_877453] in deploying similar exercise -educational -behavioral strategies 
before surgery to mitigate perioperative risks by [CONTACT_654022]’ capac ity to respond to  
intraoperative stress and accelerate postoperative recovery.12,19,50 Several cohort and small 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the feasibility and impact of prehabilitation for  
cardiac, orthopedic, and major abdominal ope rations.16-18,20,[ADDRESS_877454] improvements in strength, bal ance, and nutrition  may 
prevent the physiologic decompensation that leads to poor outcomes.51,52 However, it remains 
unclear if frail patients can fully comply with intensive physical therapy (PT), and even if they do, 
it is not clear if they will build st rength, muscle mass, aerobic capacity, and nutrition  
demonstrated in more robust populations.[ADDRESS_877455] 
effective int erventions lasted ≥[ADDRESS_877456] preoperative risk assessment (but not risk mitigation). For those identified as frail, 
we will offer prehabilitation focused on increasing physiological reserve through (a) stren gth and 
balance training to support the improved outcomes associated with early mobilization  after 
abdominal surgery,56 (b) inspi[INVESTIGATOR_653980]57 and (c) nutritional coaching and supplementation to en hance physical  
performance58 and wound healing.[ADDRESS_877457]. 
Hall is a general surgeon and former recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653981]&D Career Development Award focused on 
improving the process of surgical informed consent. In 2014, he began collaborating with [CONTACT_654031] (Co -I) to validate the Risk Analysis Index (RAI) of frail ty used in this study (B.2). He is 
a consultant on several quality improvement (QI) projects related to surgical frailty at the Omaha, 
Atlanta, Nashville and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_653982]. [CONTACT_173505]  is a 
geriatrician and cardiologist w ho directs the VAPHS Cardiac Rehabilitation Center. He has 
extensive experience with exercise physiology trials (B.3), including an ongoing RR&D  I01 
(F0834 -R) aimed at understanding the effects of different types of exercise training on the 
functional capa city of heart failure patients. [CONTACT_654032]  is a vascular surgeon and health system 
administrator with geriatric training who implemented the Frailty Screening Initiative at the 
Omaha VAMC (B.4), collaborated with [CONTACT_38845] to validate the RAI, and serves  as a consultant with 
similar initiatives at several VA and non -VA centers. [CONTACT_9382] , the Chief of Surgery at VAPHS, 
has expertise in surgical QI. With [CONTACT_38845], he implemented procedures at VAPHS to  systematically  
 
 screen all preoperative patients for frailty, and will work closely with the team to implement the 
prehabilitation procedures proposed here. [CONTACT_654033]  brings key expertise as a leader in the field  
of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13982] (IMT),60-[ADDRESS_877458] regimen for 
IMT (B.5). He is collaborating on [CONTACT_173505]’s RR&D I01 (B.3), and he will guide the IMT 
component of the present study.  
B.2.  Development, validation, and implementation of the Risk Analysis Index (RAI) of 
frailty. None of  the existing tools for measuring frailty have proved suitable for widespread, 
prospective clinical screening. To fill this gap, Drs. Hall and Johanning developed, validated and 
refined the RAI that can be calculated retrospectively from VA Surgical Qualit y Improvement 
Program (VASQIP) data or prospectively from a [ADDRESS_877459] (0 -15) to mild (16 -25), 
moderate (26 -35) and severe frailty (≥36). From  July 2011 to September 2015, they used the 14 - 
item survey to assess frailty in a consecutive cohort of 6,905 patients scheduled for surgery at the 
Omaha VAMC. In this cohort, the RAI has strong predictive power for 6 -month  mortality  
(c-statistic=0.772).66 At a cutoff of ≥16, the RAI survey classified 12.5% of the cohort as frail with 
a sensitivity of 0.50 and specificity of 0.90. By [CONTACT_654023], they compared  
the RAI to the previously validated, retrospectively calculated modified Frailty Index (mFI)67 in a 
sub-sample of 1,024 patients where the RAI survey (c=.797) performed on par with the mFI 
(c=.811), thus establishing preliminary convergent validity with the advantage of prospective 
assessment that can inform real -time clinical decisions. Based on these data, the RAI 
questionnaire was implemented as standard of care for pre -surgical risk stratification at the 
Omaha, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], Atlanta, Nashville and Phoenix VAMCs.  
B.3.  Effective implementation of exercise training programs i n frail heart failure patients 
and recruiting subjects into training trials. [CONTACT_173505] was Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_653983] -ACTION68 and the NCCAM Tai Chi Mind -Body Movement Therapy for Patients with  
Chronic Heart Failure.69 He is skil led in the prehabilitation techniques planned for this 
investigation, reliably achieving both training effects and endpoints. For example, in a trial of older 
female patients, those randomized to a strength training program similar to that proposed here 
had significantly increased strength (43.4±8.8% vs. -1.7± 2.8% in controls, p= 0.001)  and 
endurance (299±66% vs. 1±3%, p= 0.001).70 [CONTACT_173505]’s RR&D I01 is currently randomizing 
200 heart failure patients to regimens similar to those proposed here that focus  on strength 
training and IMT.  
B.4.  The Omaha Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) is the first feasible and effective 
facility -level intervention to improve postoperative survival among frail Veterans. While 
Chief of Surgery at the Omaha VA, [CONTACT_654032] began using the RAI to screen pre -surgical 
patients for frailty. Those identified as frail were subjected to an administrative review aimed at 
clarifying  surgical  decision -making  through  informal  discussions  with surgeons,  anesthesiologists  
and palliative care physicians focused on each patient’s frailty and frailty -associated risk.47,71-[ADDRESS_877460]. Hall found that 
180-day survival among frail patients improved 7 -fold after implementing the FSI (OR 7.50, 95%  
CI 4.08 -13.79), reflecting a drop in 180 -day mortality from 23.9% to 4.5% (p<.001).[ADDRESS_877461]. Cahalin’s study of IMT in 
advanced heart failure patients found that dyspn ea symptoms improved when maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_653984] 24% (51±21 to 63±23 cm H 20, p=.0001) only [ADDRESS_877462]. Forman’s RR&D I01.  
 
 * Describe the overall significance of the research in terms of the problem to be  studied 
and potential findings, as well as its relevance to the care of veterans, the VAPHS, and 
the VHA:  
C.1.  The proposed research has potentially high impact  because it addresses the  needs 
of as many  as 42,[ADDRESS_877463] likely to  benefit.  
C.3.  The proposed research is directly aligned  with VA’s operational imperatives.  Our 
study “ advances healthcare innovation ” (Theme 3 of the VA’s Strategic Plan75) by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_653985], preventative healthcare intervention that “anticipates and meets the unique needs of… 
[the] most vulnerable Veterans” (Blueprint Strategy 1). It also aligns with HSR&D Priority Areas A 
(access for vulnerable Veteran populations) and B (health equity) along with the Office of 
Geriatrics and Extended Care Service’s focus on “optimizing the health and well -being of Veterans  
with multiple chronic conditions, life -limiting illness…and frailty.”[ADDRESS_877464] in this study.  
 
 * Research  Procedures/Interventions:  
D.1. Overview. We will conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a prehabilitation intervention in a 
consecutive sample of up to [ADDRESS_877465] clinic where 
all patients are routinely screened for frailty. Frail patients agreeing to participate will be 
randomized 1:1 to (a) standard preoperative  optimization by [CONTACT_654024] (b) 
prehabilitation + standard IMPACT optimization. The prehabilitation intervention will deploy 
existing cardiac rehabilitation resources to provide (a) strength and balance training, (b) 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13982], and (c) nutritional coaching and supplementation. Using physical 
performance tests , biomarkers , chart review , survey instruments , and patient logs , we will 
assess the feasibility of the recruitment, randomization, retention and assessment procedures, 
compe nsating patients for their time.  
D.4.  Eligibility criteria. We will include all patients with RAI>[ADDRESS_877466], 356 intermediate, and 34 complex 
procedures, but excludes 291 low risk, “minor” surgical procedures with limited morbidity (e.g., 
abscess drainage,  lipomas, or hemorrhoids). From these major surgeries, we will include those 
abdominal procedures that deliberately violate the peritoneal or retroperitoneal spaces. For 
example, from the general surgery service we will include all bowel resections, biliar y 
procedures, and abdominal wall reconstructions, but exclude open, anterior inguinal hernia 
repair. The list of included CPT codes (see Appendix) represents 56% and 35% of the general 
and urological surgery volume at VAPHS, respectively (Table 2 below). G iven the burden of 
comorbidity among the frail, we anticipate that many eligible Veterans will have concurrent 
cognitive impairment or dependent living situations. These limitations need not preclude 
inclusion so long as the patient can provide first -perso n informed consent and participate in the 
prehabilitation regimen described below (D.6). No other exclusions are  planned.  
D.5.  Randomization procedures and their rationale. Some patients may be reluctant to 
accept the possibility of randomization to control con ditions, and if so, recruitment rates of a 
randomized trial would be diminished. We will therefore use the randomization feature in 
REDCap to randomize participants in a 1:[ADDRESS_877467], but offer 
the opportunity to participate in the preferred arm (intervention or control). This approach  will 
permit accurate estimates of randomization while accruing the largest possible sample  size. 
D.6.  Prehabilitation  Procedures.  
(a) Overview. Prehabilitation will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - and home -based components within 
an integrated intervention led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Forman. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based component will occur 
at the VAPHS Cardiac Rehabilitation facility and focus on supervised strength and 
balance training . One -hour sessions will be scheduled twice weekly for at least 4, but no 
more than 6 weeks before the operation. The home -based component will entail walking 
or seated pedaling on a home exerciser, as well as Respi[INVESTIGATOR_653986] (RMT), 
both of whi ch are feasible  and safe to do in a non -supervised setting. Nutritional 
supplementation will be linked to the composite training protocol. Compliance will be 
measured with exercise log books (See Appendix) and pedometers given to each 
participant. With the  consent of the surgeon, operative dates will be scheduled to 
accommodate prehabilitation.  
(b) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based Training will be scheduled twice weekly and include strength and 
balance training. All sessions will begin with an assessment of the subject’s vital s igns and a 
review of their progress with home -based training. Based on evaluation of the exercise log 
books and pedometer data, the exercise physiologist will reinforce the goals and techniques of 
the home -based regimen as needed. After the assessment phas e, subjects will complete 5 
minutes of warm -up with low -intensity walking or seated pedaling. Seated pedaling can be 
used to exercise the upper extremities in cases of lower extremity disability. Mode of exercise 
will depend on patient preference and safet y, but the same mode of exercise will be used in 
both the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - and home -based regimens (see below). Subjects will then complete [ADDRESS_877468]’s capacities and progressing as tolerated. 
Regimens will uniformly include elements of static, tandem and one -foot stands, weight shifts, 
side steps, crossovers, grape vines, backward walking, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_653987]. Balance 
training will be coupled with an additional 10 minutes of transitional movement training  to 
enable and strengthen the proper form of movements required after surgery such as lying -to- 
sitting and sitting -to-standing. Next, subjects will complete 25 minutes of strength training  (2 
sets with 8 -12 repetitions) focused on a spectrum of antagonist muscle s for the core abdominal 
muscles impacted by [CONTACT_44850], including hip flexors and extensors, obliques, rhomboids, erectus 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_625319], and latissimus dorsi. In addition, to optimize mobility and daily function, we will target 
other muscle groups in the legs, arm s, and hands (quads, hamstrings, calf, biceps, triceps, and 
hand groups). The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based session will finish with full body stretching and reassessment 
of vital signs. During each session, the exercise physiologist will use a log book (Appendix) to 
 
  
 record completion of each component along with details about the duration and intensity of the 
aerobic training, balance, and weight training. Regimens such as this have been shown to  be 
both safe and effective among the frail elderly,76 and the improvements in strength and 
balance will likely facilitate early mobilization after surgery —an intervention shown to improve  
outcomes after surgery.56 
(c) Home -based Training: Patients will be coached to complete home -based training at least 
2-3 days a week and more as to lerated. Exercise will start with a 5 minute warm -up (i.e., slow 
paced walking or seated pedaling, consistent with the mode of exercise used in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
The same exercise modality will then extend for an additional 30 minute aerobic training 
session . This phase will entail efforts at a comfortable speed with increasing duration. We will 
coach patients to reach 30 minutes of continuous, moderate exertion of 11 -13 on the  Borg 
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale,77 but it is expected that initially many subjects may 
only tolerate shorter intervals. In that case, 5 -10 minute intervals of less intense (slower) 
walking or pedaling may then be combined with periods of rest, with the goal of repeating and 
elongating them as tolerated until 30 continuous m inutes are achieved. If/when 30 minutes of 
continuous exercise is achieved (at RPE 11 -13), the next step will be to progress the intensity 
(speed) with short periods of relatively greater speed (RPE 13 -15) for 1 -2 minutes, and 
alternate with slower intensi ty (speed) at RPE [ADDRESS_877469] the duration and 
exertion of training in their log books along with step counts from their pedometer affixed to 
either the patient’s waist (walking) or wrist/ankle (pedaling). Family members or other 
caregivers  can assist patients in completing the log books if needed . After aerobic activity, 
home -based exercise will continue with 30 minutes of progressive RMT  using a Threshold RMT 
device (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_653988]). Threshold RMT requires that subjects inspi[INVESTIGATOR_653989] a 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_653990] a comfortable rate using diaphragmatic breathing techniques. The Threshold 
IMT device prohibits the subject from inhaling or exhaling until a set negative pressure is 
achieved and overcome. This is accomplished through the us e of weighted plungers or spring -
loaded valves. It is inexpensive, convenient, and easy to administer at home. We will set each 
patient’s threshold to 40% of maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393773] (MIP &  
MEP) as measured by [CONTACT_654025][INVESTIGATOR_653991] (TIRE)60 device, a 
breathing assessment tool that links a pneumotachometer to a computer tablet and can be 
used gauge inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65168]. MIP & MEP are the peak pressures generated by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_653992]. It is analogous to a 
maximum weight lifted in the gym but  measures the strength of the diaphragm and accessory 
breathing muscles. MIP & MEP will be defined as the average of 3 assessment breaths on a 
TIRE device. M IP & MEP will be measured at the first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based session and bi -weekly 
thereafter, adjusting the Threshold RMT device to maintain a workload at 40% of MIP & MEP as 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_653993]. Patients will again record the threshold and number 
of breaths completed in the 30-minute  session in log books. Family members or other 
caregivers can assist patients in completing the log books if needed. Regimens such as this 
have been shown to increase MIP (15 cm H 20, 95% CI 9 -21) and hal ve the risk of  
postoperative pulmonary complications following abdominal surgery (relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 
0.26 to 0.8).78 
(d) Nutritional Counseling. Malnutrition at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653994],[ADDRESS_877470] scheduled visit to the Cardiac Rehabilitation 
facility. Staff nutritionists (see letter) will administer the standardized Subjective Global 
Assessment (SGA) of nutrition (Appendix) to identify nutritional  needs and classify the patient 
as either normal or mildly, moderately or severely malnourished. All patients will receive best 
practice nutritional counseling focused on lean, high protein foods in preparation for surgery. 
 
  
 Cardiac rehabilitation personnel  will be trained to assess and reinforce progress on these 
dietary practices. In addition, standard of care nutritional supplementation will be prescribed to 
malnourished patients, including Impact® Advanced Recovery, an immunomodulating formula  
shown to i mprove outcomes after major surgery.80 Supplements will be delivered to patient’s 
homes. Patients will also record their meals and supplements in log books (Appendix), and 
cardiac rehab personnel will be trained to monitor and encourage consumption of the 
supplements as prescribed during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based coaching sessions. Family members or 
other caregivers can assist patients in completing the log books if needed. Although the 
evidence is somewhat equivocal, approaches such as this have been shown to red uce 
postoperative complications (relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 -0.84).81 
(e) Occupational and Physical Therapy (OT/PT). We will arrange for a standard OT/PT 
consult to coincide with either the initial IMPACT clinic visit or the first scheduled visit to the 
Cardiac Rehabilitation facility. Staff therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (see letter) will perform routine, standardized 
assessments of the patient’s home, environment and mobility, prescribing and supplying 
indicated durable medical equipment to aid mobility, exercise, and safe  transition to 
independent living at home after the proposed surgery. As per their usual protocol, the PT/OT 
consult will consult with the Social Work services to adequately assess the home environment 
and supports in anticipation of postoperative discharg e planning.  
D.7.  Assessment Schedule. As shown in Table 1, research staff will collect baseline data at 
the time of recruitment regarding demographics, physical performance, and nutrition. We will 
monitor physical performance, nutrition and compliance every oth er week during in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653995]. Postoperative outcomes will be assessed [ADDRESS_877471] clinic, and thus convenient for patients to visit 
on both the days of recruitment and surgery. Nutrition  assessments include serum prealbumin 
and Body Mass Index (BMI) collected biwe ekly by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_653996], and the  7-point 
Subjective Global Assessment (SGA -7)[ADDRESS_877472] the surveys over the phone.

Minimizing the Burden of Assessments : Some participants in this study will be concurrently 
enrolled in a related study of frailty and preoperative palliative care consultation 
(Pro1840). Some of the outcome assessments planned for Pro1754 are identical to  those  
planned here. When a participant is enrolled in both studies (Pro1840 and Pro1754) the study 
 
  
 coordinators will work together to ensure that participants do not have to complete identical 
assessments twice. At any given time point when potentially duplicative assessments could 
occur, study staff will record the participant's singular response to a duplicative question 
simultaneously into the case report forms (CRFs) of each separate study. This could be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_7661] a two separate study staff on the phone or in the room as the patient 
is interviewed. It could also be accomplished by [CONTACT_7661] a single cross -listed staff member 
(e.g., listed on the staff form of both studies) administer the assessment and record the 
responses into the separate CRFs of each study at the same sitting. Additionally, some 
participants may be concurrently enrolled in a minimal risk study (PI [INVESTIGATOR_653998]; 
Pro1843) that has similar inclusion criteria. However,  participation in Pro1843 will not impact 
the outcomes of this protocol (1754).  
D.8.  Variables  Assessed.  
 
▪ Age, sex, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status  will be assessed by [CONTACT_654026].  
▪ Procedure -related variables  will include the CPT codes of the initially planned 
operation as well as the operation actually performed. We will also abstract from the 
chart the type of anesthesia, the duration of the procedure, and the disposition of the 
patient at the end of surgery (e.g., discharge v. admission)  
▪ Living Location  is the environment where patients are living before and after the index 
operation (i.e., home, nursing home, etc). It wil l be assessed by [CONTACT_654027].  
▪ Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  is a test of balance, gait, strength, and 
endurance that combines gait speed, repeated chair stands and balance tests that 
together  take less than [ADDRESS_877475] in rehabilitation  
literature.82-86 
▪ [ADDRESS_877476] measure of physical performance tha t measures the 
total distance traversed in 6 minutes, measured in meters. Clinically significant 
differences can be quantified in as little as 30 meters. This is an exploratory measure 
that will only be administered if time allows. As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim  to determine what 
kinds of assessments are feasible in this  group.  
▪ Maximal Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_696] & Expi[INVESTIGATOR_653999] (MIP & MEP)  are the standard metrics of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_65172]27 and will be measured using the TIRE device described  
above (D.6c). It has been shown that changes as small as 15 cm H 20 can significantly  
reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and length of  stay.78 
▪ Frailty  will be assessed through several measures because no single measure of  frailty  
captures the breadth of the syndrome. In addition to the RAI described above, we will 
quantify the Hopkins & Edmonton Frail Scales and independently analyze the gait speed 
and handgrip strength that is part of the Hopkins Frail Scale. We recently developed a 
streamlined approach to measuring all of these metrics simultaneously in a parsimonious  
exercise that takes <5 minutes to administer.87 
▪ Hopkins Frail Scale  encompasses slown ess, weakness, weight loss, low physical 
activity, and exhaustion with ≥3/[ADDRESS_877477] mortality and disability in large 
cohorts of community -dwelling elders and surg ical patients.  
▪ Edmonton Frail Scale  is an 11 -item survey that assesses 8 dimensions of frailty. 
Each item is scored 0, 1, or 2 with higher scores indicating greater frailty. The 
total score ranges from 0 -17 with good inter -rater reliability (k = 0.77),  moderate 
internal consistency (alpha=0.62), and strong correlation with a geriatrician’s 
assessment of frailty (r=.64, p<.001).88 
▪ Gait speed  is one key measure of frailty76,97,98 that has excellent inter -rater 
reliability (intraclass coefficient 0.88 -0.96) an d test -retest reliability (intraclass 
coefficient  0.86-0.91).  
▪ Handgrip Strength  has also been demonstrated to have key utility as an index of 
frailty.32,89 A grip dynamometer will be used, averaging 2 serial assessments from 
the dominant  hand.  
▪ Prealbumin  will be measured with standard serological testing. Changes can be  detected  
in days, and it is the best available biomarker of nutrition.90,91 However, because 
 
  
 prealbumin can function as an acute phase reactant, we will also concurrently measure  
c-reactive protein as a measure of inflammation and interpret prealbumin as proposed  
by [CONTACT_337221], et al.92,93 
▪ Body Mass Index (BMI)  will be calculated from height and weight assessed each week at 
the Cardiac Rehab facility, and is considered the most suitable, objective anthropometric 
indicator  of nutritional  status,[ADDRESS_877478]  survival  
in the elderly.95 
▪ Subjective Global Assessment of Nutrition (SGA)  is the standard approach to nutritional 
assessment.96 It evaluates multiple domains of nutrition and reliably categorizes patients 
into 1 of 4 categories: normal, mild -, moderate - and severely maln ourished. We will use 
the 7-point SGA (See Appendix) because it is sensitive to 1 -point changes in as little as 
1 month and has excellent inter -rater reliability  (k=.726).28 
▪ Compliance  with Prehabilitation . Each patient  will receive  a prehabilitation  log book in 
which they will record details about their home -based regimen, including the date of  
training, duration and intensity of exercise, IMT repetitions and threshold pressures, 
nutritional supplements consumed, dietary intake, and pedometer data (e.g., s tep 
counts at the beginning and end of each training session). They will be coached in the 
use of this log at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654000]. Data from the logbook will be collected from 
patients weekly and entered into the database for analysis. In addition, becau se the 
pedometer stores [ADDRESS_877479] daily step 
counts as a measure of overall activity at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654000].  
▪ Health -Related Quality of Life  will be measured with the Assessment of Quality of Life 
(AQoL -6D) that includes 20 items on a Guttman scale assessing 6 domains:  independent  
living, mental health, relationships, senses, pain and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].97 The utility score ranges 
from -.04 (state worse than death) to 1.0 (full health). It is sensitive to change with a 
minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.06.98 
▪ Quality of Surgical Care  will be measured with the Surgical Care Survey (SCS)  that 
includes subscales for quality of pre -surgical care (11 items), day of surgery (6 items), 
and postoperative care (12 items).99 
▪ Measures of Decision Quality  include Decision Regret (5 items), Patient Centeredness  of 
Care (12 items), Satisfaction with the Process of Decision Making (14 items), 
Satisfaction with the IMPACT clinic (8 items), Satisfacti on with the frailty diagnosis (8 
items), satisfaction with the palliative care consult (8 items), and Satisfaction with the 
surgeon (8 items).  
▪ Mortality . Patients completing the [ADDRESS_877480] with identified surrogates will confirm 
vital status and date of death (if  deceased).  
▪ Length of Stay  will be calculated from the date of surgery to the date of discharge or 
transfer from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will also record the time  spent in the intensive care unit. 
Intervals will be calculated in  days.  
▪ Major Complications  will be abstracted from the chart according to VASQIP coding rules 
(Appendix). The presence or absence of each complication will be recorded separately, 
but analys is will focus on a dichotomous outcome indicating the occurrence of  serious,  
Clavien -Dindo level IV complications.100 These include deep wound infections, organ 
space infections, wound disruption, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, pulmonary 
embolism, mechan ical ventilation for >[ADDRESS_877481], myocardial infarction, bleeding in excess of 4 
units, deep vein thrombosis, sepsis and C. difficile colitis. This approach to analyzing  
comp lications has been shown to correlate with frailty.6 Co-I and Chief of Surgery Mark 
Wilson (see letter) has authorized the VASQIP nurse abstractor to use standard VASQIP 
procedures to code the charts of participating patients.  
 
Incidental Findings:  If any of these tests generate an incidental finding of sufficient clinical 
significance to warrant review by [CONTACT_102]'s primary care physician (PCP), we send the test 
results to the PCP and follow up with an encrypted email. We will also telephone the patient  
within a week to inform the patient of the finding and the planned PCP follow -up. 
 
 
 
 Research study methods: analysis  Plan 
 * Please describe the analysis plan for the study (it is acceptable to refer to the 
 
  
 sponsor/multi -site protocol for section if  applicable):  
D.10.  Data  Analysis.  
(a) General approach for quantitative data. We will first explore the data using descriptive 
statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations, percentiles, ranges) and graphical techniques 
(e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to examine key variables to assess distri butional assumptions, 
the existence of outliers and data sparseness. For categorical variables, we will generate 
frequency and percentage distributions to identify data sparseness. In the event of data 
sparseness, categories with small frequencies will be merged when meaningful and 
appropriate. Continuous variables will be categorized into meaningful groups if the distributions 
are skewed. All analyses will be performed using Stata statistical software (StataCorp,  2013).  
(b) Missing Data Strategies . We will att empt to minimize the amount of missing due to 
dropouts (withdrawals, lost to follow -up, or deaths) or individuals who missed at least one of 
the follow -up assessments (intermittent missing). In the event of missing data, we will use 
multiple imputation to impute the missing  values.  
(c) Estimate rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, and compliance with the 
prehabilitation intervention [Aim 1]. To assess the feasibility of recruitment, 
randomization, and retention, we will summarize the total number of eligible patients 
approached,  recruited,  randomized  to intervention  and control  conditions,  and retained  through 
the completion of study procedures [ADDRESS_877482] to fo llow up, we will estimate the proportion of 
planned in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654001] 
30-day outcome assessment (if available). For those randomized to the intervention condition, 
compliance with the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based regimen will be measured as the number of scheduled 
sessions completed. If patients are able to comply with only a portion of the training regimen, 
this will be noted and the patient will be categorized as partially compliant. Compliance with 
the home -based regimen will be measured as the number of assigned activities documented in 
the patient logs. Overall compliance rates with confidence intervals (CIs) will be estimated for 
the home, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and combined intervention. We will also compute r ates (and CIs) of partial 
compliance as well as rates (and CIs) of intervention -specific task compliance.  
(d) Measure (a) physical performance with the SPPB, (b) pulmonary function with 
MIP, and (c) nutrition with the SGA -7 and prealbumin at baseline and 2 -week 
intervals to estimate changes over time and explore the optimal duration of 
prehabilitation (2 vs. 4 vs. 6 weeks) [Aim 2]. We will use graphical analyses to assess 
simple change in physical performance, pulmonary function and nutrition over the 
prehabili tation period. We will also use simple mixed models to explore changes over the 
multiple time points (baseline and 2, 4, and 6 weeks). Separate models for each outcome will 
assess the rate of change, including a fixed effect for time and a random effect fo r subject. The 
type of mixed model used will be dependent on the data type of the outcome with linear mixed 
model for continuous variables (SPPB, MIP, prealbumin, BMI and RAI) and generalized mixed 
models for categorical/ dichotomous (SGA). To the extent p ossible, the modelling of the rate of 
change in the outcomes over time will include an assessment of the shape of this relationship 
utilizing simple pi[INVESTIGATOR_654002]. We anticipate that  improvements in the outcome will grow logarithmically over time, 
and that the majority of the growth will be achieved between 3 -6 weeks.  
(e) Estimate overall and treatment -specific summary statistics for postoperative 
outcomes in terms of 30 - and 90 -day (a) m ortality, (b) major complications,  (c) 
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], (d) health -related quality of life, (e) quality of surgical care, 
and (f) change in level of independent living [Aim 3]. We will summarize separately the 
total number of deaths and major compl ications at 30 and 90 days for all patients, estimating 
rates (overall and by [CONTACT_3148] -group) as well as associated CIs. Rates will be computed as 
the number of specific events (deaths or major complication), divided by [CONTACT_654028] -time where  person -time is defined as the amount of time a patient is followed from 
study start to either the end of study, death or loss to follow -up (whichever occurs first). We 
will also compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, range) for leng th of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], health -related quality of life, quality of surgical care and recovery to independent 
living. We will make assessments overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. While our emphasis is to 
assess feasibility, we will also attempt to assess if differ ences exist between the intervention 
and control conditions with regards to these post -operative  measures.  
D.11.  Justification of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_654003] . Based on the historical surgical volume at VAPHS, 
the participating surgical services will treat 54 eligible patients who meet our inclusion criteria 
during a 7 month recruitment window (Table 3). We are not estimating the effect size between 
interventio n and control conditions. Although there is a tradition of using pi[INVESTIGATOR_654004], 
there is growing consensus that this approach is ill -founded because the small samples  result  
in imprecision that makes power estimates unreliable.23 Therefore, based on recruitment and 
retention rates estimated here (Aim 1), we will power our subsequent study based on  
“minimum clinically meaningful differences” defined for each outcome a priori .24

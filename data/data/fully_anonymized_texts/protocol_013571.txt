*************************************************************************************************** 
 
1. Abstract  
 
Baltimore’s HIV prevalence rate (586/100,000) is among the top [ADDRESS_50717] an HIV prevalence that is 5 times higher than among 
whites, and they account for 78% of all HIV cases. Latinxs also have a higher prevalence of HIV than whites and are at the highest risk for late HIV diagnosis among all racial/ethn ic groups.
ii  In addition, HIV 
viral load suppression, which is the best predictor of long- term survival among HIV -infected patients, is 
substantially lower among minority populations in Baltimore.  
 
The hypothesis of this study is that a n mHealth -enhanced Linkage to Care and Retention (mLTCR) 
intervention can improve HIV outcomes among HIV -infected African Americans and Latin xs compared to 
standard linkage and care support  protocols. The mLTCR intervention consists of two smartphone 
applications (app), one for patients and one for support staff such as linkage officers or patient navigators , 
to help facilitate communication. Communication will focus on issues related to HIV care (e.g. appointment scheduling, need for laboratory tests ), as well as patient -directed requests. Using HIV 
surveillance data (e.g. dated HIV viral load), support staff will be automatically alerted if a patient has a 
high viral load or has not had labs done in > [ADDRESS_50718] the patient. In addition to 
appointment and laboratory reminders, patients will receive positive reinforcement behavioral text 
messages.  
 This is  a pragmatic randomized controlled study comparing existing linkage  and care support (LTC) 
services to an mHealth -enhanced linkage to care a nd retention (mLTCR) protocol.   
 According to modelling studies, improvement in linkage and retention in care indicators is the single most important component to achieve the 2020 National HIV/AIDS Strategy targets and substantially reduce the 
burden of H IV in the [LOCATION_002].
iii The results of this randomized study will contribute to the evidence 
on the effectiveness of mHealth -enhanced LTCR initiatives implemented by [CONTACT_48035]. Evidence supporting the feasibility and effect iveness of this intervention will be important for 
HIV clinics,  the BCHD and other health departments as they allocate limited resources to address the HIV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_48029]. The information will also be relevant to Ryan White officials respo nsible for 
allocating federal dollars to support clinical and ancillary services to improve HIV outcomes, particularly among patients who are uninsured or underinsured. 
 
 
2. Objectives  
 
Aim 1: To compare virologic suppression and retention in care between HI V-infected individuals 
who are randomized to receive standard of care linkage and care support service s versus mHealth -
enhanced LTCR (mLTCR) services. The primary outcome measure will be virologic suppression

 at 12 months of study enrollment, and secondary outcomes will include retention in care at 12 
months.  
 
Aim 2: To examine the implementation of mLTCR services using a mixed -methods approach to 
determine the intervention’s feasibility, acceptability, coverage, fidelity, sustainability, and patient satisfaction.  
 3. Background   
 HIV Disparities among African Americans and Latinos.   African Americans represent 12% of the 
population but account for 43% of people living with HIV in the US and are less likely to receive ART or achieve virologic suppression compared to whites.
iv HIV rates among Latinos are [ADDRESS_50719]. In 2016, 78% of new HIV diagnoses were among African Americans, 
whose ra te of HIV infection is [ADDRESS_50720] suppressed 
HIV viral loads (VL), dramatically short of the 80% goal outlined by [CONTACT_48036]/AIDS Strategy 
(NHAS).i, xi  
 
Health Department Response and Linkage to Care Initiatives.  To address the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], health 
departments across the US have operationalized the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Data–to -Care initiative to optimize the HIV care cascade.
xiiUsing routine HIV surveillance data, health 
departments, including the BCHD, systematically identify HIV -infected people who are newly diagnosed 
or out of care, and reach out to them to facilitate l inkage to care.xiii In 2017, BCHD linkage officers 
engaged [ADDRESS_50721] throughout the year by [CONTACT_648] (personalized reminder calls and follow up for missed 
appointments) were more likely to keep appointments than those receiving automated appointment reminder calls (56% vs. 46%).
xiv The intervention, however, was less e ffective among patients with at least 
one unmet need or active substance use disorder.   
 
Unmet Needs and Linkage and Retention in Care.   The Data- to-Care experience has shown that a 
significant proportion of individuals out of care are homeless, transitio nally housed, transient, and without 
working phone numbers.xv Interviews with patients out of care contact[CONTACT_48037]   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 4 of 15 
 Department identified several personal and structural barriers to care. The top unmet needs included 
difficulty with tr ansportation to the clinic and lack of practical support in navigating the system.xvi 
Participants expressed willingness in engaging with health department staff to receive assistance with 
ancillary services and HIV engagement in care. In Los Angeles, HIV -infected patients reported that the 
main reasons for not accessing HIV services were lack of information (do not know where to go or who to 
call), agency barrier (system too confusing, wait list too long), or financial/practical barriers (too expensive, 
transportation problem).  In this study, African American were 3 times more likely to report unmet needs 
compared to whites.xvii 
 
Integrating Retention Services into Health Department Linkage Protocols.  Implementing homogenous 
retention to care services in all HIV clinics is neither feasible nor advisable, as clinics should be able to 
tailor their approach based on their resources and their clients’ needs.   This is where health departments can 
leverage r outine HIV surveillance data and provide an additional layer of support to patients and clinics 
independent of clinic -based services. In most linkage protocols, contact [CONTACT_48038], as linkage officers primarily assist with facilitating the initial appointment for engagement or reengagement in care. This model may be efficient for patients who are linked to care without additional support. However, for many patients, engagement in care occurs within a spectrum  of 
frequent engagement and disengagement cycles due to complex personal and structural barriers.  An 
evaluation of the San Francisco Health Department LTC model found that rather than being truly out of care or never in care, many patients were in intermit tent HIV care, and were willing to accept health 
department assistance to help them stay in care.
 xvi 
 
An alternative to one -time linkage services is to provide ongoing support to maintain continuity of care, 
particularly among minority populations that fa ce multiple contextual challenges, such as poverty, 
substance use disorder, or housing instability. Providing linkage and longitudinal retention (LTCR) services 
from the health department that complements existing clinic -based retention efforts has not bee n 
systematically evaluated. This model  assumes that a significant proportion of individuals will require not 
only linkage services but also retention support during their HIV care trajectory, and that providing 
longitudinal support may enhance timely linka ge to care and facilitate future re -engagement attempts, if 
needed.  
 
Enhancing Efficiency through Tailored mHealth Interventions.  A health department  or clinic -based  
LTCR approach could be enhanced with the use of evidence -based mobile health (mHealth) strategies that 
leverage mobile phones to improve health outcomes. Systematic reviews have found that mHealth interventions can promote engagement in care, adherence to ART, and virologic suppression.
xviii, xix, xx 
These platforms can be programmed to send tailored messages, reminders, and alerts to patients and providers (such as linkage officers) using algorithms that leverage existing data (e.g. surveillance data) and patient input (e.g. response to prompts). A distinct advantage of mHealth platforms is the ability to 
facilitate patient -centered approaches to LTCR efficiently and without overburdening providers (alert for 
action to providers can be designed to focus on are as that truly require provider input).    
 
Our team has previously partnered with emocha Mobile Health (https://www.emocha.com) to develop evidence -based HIPAA compliant mHealth applications to facilitate engagement in care.
xxiii xxi,xxii,   The 
miLINC platform, for example, facilitates direct communication and linkage between outreach workers, 
patients, and providers and has been used to link patients to tuberculosis services and improve coordination 
of care and timely treatment for patients with multi- drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa. A video 
directly observed therapy application (miDOT) has been evaluated and adopted by [CONTACT_48039], hepatitis C, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2571].   These emocha 
platforms have shown acceptability and feasibility of implementation in Baltimore City, including African 
American men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and foreign- born Latinos, and in diverse 
settings.xxiv, xxv

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_50722] BCHD  and HIV clinic -based  linkage  
and care support  services to mHealth -enhanced LTCR services described below.  
 
Description of usual care and comparator arm:  
 Standard BCHD Linkage Services. The 2007 Maryland HIV/AIDS Reporting Act requires that HIV cases 
be reported by [CONTACT_2300].  Laboratories are required to report HIV positive tests within [ADDRESS_50723] investigations and referral to linkage services. In addition, the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) HIV Surveillance Branch receives laboratory -based reports with results indicating HIV infection (including HIV diagnostic 
tests, CD4, HIV viral loads, and HIV genotype and phenotype tests) through the enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS). Using this data, MDH generates weekly “Never in Care” and “Out of Car e” 
lists for BCHD. Guided by [CONTACT_48040], the BCDH linkage team contacts patients by [CONTACT_48041]. Providers can also request assistance from the BCHD LTC program to link patients newly diagnosed or re -engage those lost to HIV care by [CONTACT_48042]. Therefore, the BCHD 
linkage officers attempt to contact [CONTACT_48043] , as identified through surveill ance data 
or by [CONTACT_48044].  Patients who agree to be linked to care by [CONTACT_48045] a 
same- day appointment and warm handoff to clinical care (the outreach worker drives the patient to the 
clinic of his or her choice). After th e patient is seen by a provider, the linkage officer  can assist with 
retention to the second appointment, but after the two initial appointments , the LTC officer is no longer 
involved in the case unless the patients appears again in the MDH Out of Care rep ort at a later time  or is 
referred by a provider .   Linkage officers record patient encounters, and linkage attempts and outcomes in 
PRISM.  
 Clinic -based Linkage and Retention Services.  In response to the “End the HIV Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]” strategy, many 
HIV clinics have strengthened their HIV Linkage and Retention Services.  The Johns Hopkins Bartlett 
Clinic, for example, has implemented a Rapid ART initiation (RART) protocol where patients who are newly diagnosed with HIV in the Emergency Department and linked to the clinic within 1 business day with same- day ART initiation at the time of visit.  In addition, the clinic uses “Data -to-Care” to identify 
patients who are out of care (no visits for > 8 months) or whose viral load is not suppressed, and provides 
them patient navigation services, appointment reminders, and pharmacy/adherence support.  
 mHealth -enhanced LTCR (mLTCR).  This approach leverages the existing BCHD and clinic -based  LTC 
and support protocols to identify newly diagnosed patients , those out of care , and those in need of retention 
services to provide ongoing linkage and retention to care services for [ADDRESS_50724] 
BCHD Linkage services, where linkage officers provide two-time support to link patients to care, the 
mLTCR approach will promote ongoing engagement between support staff  and a patient over a period of 
12 months. This allow s for repeated doses of support (patient and algorithm -driven) and provides more 
opportunities for patients to develop a trusting relationship with support staff . The communication between 
patients and support staff  will be driven by [CONTACT_102]’s needs. P atients will be assigned a specific support 
staff member to allow for relationship -building, with backup as needed for support staff  absences,

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_50725]. The BCHD linkage officers  and clinic -based patient navigators are representative 
of the community served (primarily African American or bilingual Latino) and have long- standing 
experience working with the community.  
 
mHealth Application for mLTCR arm. The mHealth application is designed to facilitate communication 
between the patient and su pport staff , and to automate certain tasks/alerts/reminders, so that support staff  
can focus their efforts on patients at high risk of falling out of care (such as calling a patient with a high 
viral load), rather than on time -consuming tasks not specifica lly targeted to high risk patients (like general 
appointment reminders). The patient application will be available in English and Spanish. Spanish- speaking 
limited English proficiency patients will be assigned a bilingual support staff person who will communicate 
with them in their preferred language. The study team has experience with cultural and linguistic adaptation of interventions and will elicit feedback from the Steering Committee (see below) to ensure messages are tailored to the health literacy an d language proficiency of the target population. Tasks, alerts, and action 
prompts are outlined in Table 1 for the patient application and in Table 2 for the mHealth  application.

   Study Design.  
This study is a pragmatic individual randomized trial comparing standard BCHD linkage services or clinic -
based linkage and retention and care support services to mLTCR services. The study will not be masked to 
participants or support staff due to practical  considerations, but all data analysis related to Aim 1 will be 
conducted in a blinded fashion.  Figure 2 describes the study design.

                 The BCHD identifies newly diagnosed patients with HIV or those who are out of care  based on laboratory -
based HIV surveillance report . In addition, clinics and providers can identify patients in need of retention 
services and refer patients to their clinic’s patient navigators or the BCHD linkage to care program.  HIV 
Clinics can also get assistance from study team members in identifying patients by [CONTACT_48048] “Data -to-
Care” report.  Using the report, study team members will identify patients in need of retention services and alert their providers.  Providers can then refer the patients to their su pport staff, clinic’s patient navigators 
or the BCHD linkage to care program. Support staff  reach out to the patient identified through surveillance 
or referred by [CONTACT_48049].  When support staff  meet  
or talk with the patient, he/she will  tell them that they may be eligible for a study and ask them for 
permission to be contact[CONTACT_426] a study research assistant (RA) . All patients, regardless of their interest in the 
study, will be linked to care by [CONTACT_48050] .  Support staff  will call the study RA to let him or her know 
that there is a potential participant. The RA will meet or call the  potential participant to go over the study. 
After obtaining and documenting written  informed consent  (for in person enrollment) or oral consent (for 
over-the-phone enrollment)  of participants who wish to enroll in the study, the participant will complete a 
baseline questionnaire and the RA will use  a randomization program that will electronically assign the 
patient to the control or intervention arm. Patients randomized to the control arm will have no further 
interaction with the study team other than rece iving a satisfaction survey and potentially being invited to an 
in-depth interview (which they can decline).  Participants randomized to the intervention arm will be 
instructed to  download the  app to their personal phones (or study phone if participant doe s not own a 
compatible phone) and practice using the app by [CONTACT_48051], ideally  in the presence of the 
RA (this can be done by [CONTACT_45933]) , who can trouble shoot any issues and show the patient 
how to use the various features  of the app. Participants  in the intervention arm will continue to be in touch 
with support staff  for 12 months using the app, and by [CONTACT_48052], depending on the participants 
needs  and Covid- 19 situation (as identified through the app algorithms a nd patient -generated messages).  
 HIV Surveillance Data Flow.   HIV laboratory data (dated viral load) will be used to drive emocha app alerts and for evaluation of primary outcomes.  A list of the individuals who have consented to the study (including those recruited in the clinics) will be provided to the BCDH on a weekly basis.  The BCHD will send this information to the Maryland Department of Health HIV Surveillance Branch. MDH  will generate 
a weekly report of HIV viral load test results  and date s and send this information to the BCHD. The BCHD 
will share this information with emocha  so that it can be uploaded to the emocha platform. Alerts to 
participants will not include HIV -specif ic information .  HIV surveillance data will be uploaded to the

 emocha platform for all participants (intervention and control) and used for data analysis. However, this 
data will be integrated into the emocha algorithms and alerts only for participants in the intervention arm.   
Data on all participants will be exported from emocha to JHU secure servers for data analysis.  
 A backup system will be implemented in the event the MDH or BCHD is unable to generate and/or share the weekly HIV viral load test results. Study team members will access viral load data through health provider records and upload data directly from JHU secure servers to the emocha platform.   
 Laboratory Assessments.  There will be no study- associated laboratory assessments.  All laboratory 
assessments will be conducted as part of clinical care and reported to BCHD HIV surveillance databases (eHARS and PRISM).  We will consider those with a suppressed viral load (HIV R NA <200 c/mL) to be 
fully engaged in HIV care. While some individuals are able to maintain immune control of HIV in the absence of ART, this occurs in <1% of infected persons.  
 Randomization plan.  The study Statistician will generate a randomization schedule to assign [ADDRESS_50726] with an elig ible participant /patient, they will introduce the study and if consent to participate is 
obtained, the officer will telephone the data center to obtain an arm assignment and proceed to enroll the participant. All data analysis will be conducted in a blinded fashion, but the linkage officers and participants cannot be masked from the intervention.  Mortality Assessment. Participant s will be cross referenced with the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s National Death Index, a database for all deaths in the [LOCATION_002], to determine if there is a 
known date of death and cause of death.  
 Implementation Assessment  
RE-AIM Framework.  Using a hybrid study design, we will also incorporate implementation science 
evaluations to assess important implementatio n questions while also assessing effectiveness.  Hybrid 
designs are efficient approaches to obtaining information that can help understand research findings in terms of internal validity and external generalizability, and provide data to facilitate translating research into real world policy and programs. We propose using the well -established RE -AIM Framework for 
implementation science research to provide methodological specificity for Aim 2. This framework was created to encourage consideration of program e lements that can improve the sustainable adoption and 
implementation of effective, generalizable, and evidence -based interventions.  
 A summary of how the 5 components will be assessed in this proposal is shown below.

 Support staff  and patient navigators  in-depth interviews.  In an effort to measure the intervention’s 
feasibility and degree of fidelity, we will conduct in -depth interviews (IDIs) with support staff  (N=5) 
before and 12 months after the implementation of the mLTCR intervention to allow for sufficient time for 
staff to acclimatize to service delivery and to give ample time to adapt services based on feedback. Interviews with support staff  will examine: the nature of service delivery; client interactions and how this 
differs from standard linkage  and retention activ ities; barriers and facilitators of engaging out- of-care 
patients; challenges and solutions to the mLTCR service delivery; and recommendations for service delivery improvements and expansion of reach.  Additional interviews with patient support staff may b e 
requested beyond 12 months if and when additional feedback would be useful to further adapt services.  
 In-depth interviews with participants randomized to the intervention arm and the control arm.  In 
order to examine feasibility and acceptability, IDIs will be conducted  (in person or by [CONTACT_48056]-
19) with study participants randomized to standard linkage  and retention and care support  services (n=20) 
and to mLTCR services (n=20) to assess program fit and appropriateness of mLTCR services. Participants will be asked what they liked/disliked about the linkage /retention /care and mLTCR services they received 
as well as recommendations for additional services. Participants randomized to the inte rvention arm will be 
asked if the text message topi[INVESTIGATOR_48031], their motivation for engaging the support staff -delivered text messages, and their suggestions for other ways the mobile 
phone may facilitate HIV retention in care and adherence to medications. We will also assess facilitators and barriers to program participation. IDIs will take place in a private location and will last 45 -60 minutes 
and participants will be paid $50 for their time (remuneratio n may be revised by [CONTACT_48057]).  
 Client satisfaction survey.  All participants (control and intervention, n= 500) will be asked to complete a 
brief client satisfaction survey using a validated Client Satisfaction Questionn aire (CSQ -8). Participants in 
the intervention arm will be asked to complete the validated System Usability Scale (SUS) to assess acceptability and ease of use of the mHealth application.  
 Intervention fidelity  We will monitor support staff -participant con tacts weekly using phone records. This 
will allow an assessment of the level of intensity of support staff -participant contact [CONTACT_48058] (retention in care, virologic suppression), as well as inform the appropriate caseload for support staff . Fidelity and quality assurance feedback will be provided during monthly meetings or 
more frequently if necessary.   
 Key-informant interviews with BCHD and clinic officials.  In order to examine the mLTCR acceptability 
and sustainabil ity, study investigators will conduct key- informant interviews with program managers and 
executives at the city health department  and Bartlett Clinic . Interviews with BCHD and clinical staff will 
explore how the mLTCR intervention has affected the flow and efficiency of surveillance work at the BCHD and Bartlett clinic , any observed changes in the number of patients linked to care and time to 
engagement in care, and recommendations for service delivery improvements. These interviews will provide insights about policy, acceptability, political buy -in for the intervention, and potential for adoption 
in other settings going forward.

Not applicable  
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  Not applicable  
 
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  Virologic suppression: Viral load < 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/cc within a 6- month 
window of 12 m onth follow up period (i.e. 3 months before or after 12 month follow -up).  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables.   
1. Retention in care: Viral load or CD4 count reported in eHARS within a 6 month window 
of 12 month follow up period (i.e. 3 months before or after 12 month follow up)  
2. Mortality: Death occurring within a 6 month window of 12 month follow up period (i.e. 3 months before or after 12 month follow up)  
3. Implementation outcomes will include:  
a. Proportion of out of care or newly diagnosed HIV -infected patients contact[CONTACT_48064] . 
b. Frequency of contacts between support staff  and patients.  
c. Qualitative assessments from in -depth interviews with support staff , 
BCHD/clinic  officials, and study participants  
d. Client satisfaction surveys    
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.  
 
Statistical Analysis.  For the study’s main outcome, we will conduct a test for the equality of 
proportions of virologically suppressed/not suppressed or missing VL individuals at [ADDRESS_50728] a logistic regression using individual outcomes (yes/no suppressed) with study arm as a main predictor and adjusting for patient demographic characteristics, socio -economic status at basel ine, and other factors. A 
subgroup analysis will be conducted to assess the effects of the intervention among African -
Americana and people of Hispanic/Latino descent.    Secondary outcomes analysis.  An evaluation of the differences in retention in care and  
participant mortality will follow the same analytical approach as for the main outcome. That is, 
we will test for the difference in proportions between the [ADDRESS_50729] ics.   
 Qualitative data analysis . Qualitative data analysis involves the search for patterns in data and 
for ideas that help to explain the presence of those patterns. Transcripts from in -depth interviews 
and key informant interviews will be entered and managed in Atlas.ti . Separate coding schemes 
will be developed for HIV -infected patients (control and intervention arm) and the other groups 
of BCHD staff (Linkage officers and BCHD officials). An iterative coding process in Atlas.ti  
will be used to concept ually name [CONTACT_48072]. Codes will be informed by [CONTACT_48065]   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_50730], an “audit trail” will be used to help ensure trustworthiness of finding s, gather input from multiple perspectives, and enhance reliability.  
 Power Calculations. The reported virologic suppression or lack of a VL measurement rate under standard of care among HIV -infected African Americans and Latinos in Baltimore City is 
33%.
xxvi In order to detect an improvement of 13%, such that 46% of the mHealth enhanced 
LTCR group have a VL and achieve virologic suppression, with 80% power at an alpha=5% level of significance, we require a total sample size of 442 (221 per arm).  We plan to enroll 500 participants to the study to account for withdrawals.

4. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency. 
There are no direct medical risks associated with the intervention arm. There is a risk to 
confidentiality in the use of the mHealth application.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
After obta ining consent, all participant data (such as basic demographics and contact 
[CONTACT_3031]) is entered into the emocha platform.  In addition, HIV surveillance data is imported into the emocha platform from the BCDH (see above). Risks to confidentiality will be minimized  by [CONTACT_48066] a n emocha  web -server that is password 
protected. Data collected by [CONTACT_48067] -time to a secure server, 
where LTCR activities and data can be accessed through a simple web interface. Only authorized study personnel will have access to this data. A triple level of data encryption will be used to ensure confidentiality of data and HIPAA -compliance. LTCR phones , and access to the 
LTCR and pa rticipant emocha  apps will be password protected. To further protect p articipants’ 
confidentiality, messages to the participant will include non- specific terms without mentio n of 
HIV or other personal health information. Electronic research data will be exported from emocha to central storage (JHU) via secure, encrypted transmission . The National Center for 
Health Statistics is required by [CONTACT_48068] o f identifying information it 
collects including information on individuals supplied by [CONTACT_48069].  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviatio ns. 
The research staff and support staff  will report problems or study deviations to the study 
supervisor ( Jane McKenzie- White).  Ms. McKenzie- White  with discuss problems and event with 
the study PIs (Drs. Page  and Chang) at weekly study meetings (or sooner ) depending on the 
severity of the event. The PIs will report unanticipated problems or study deviations that involve risks to participants or others promptly to the JHM IRB in accordance with Organization Policy. Minor problems and protocol deviations (which pose no risk to subjects or others) will be reported in annual protocol continuing review.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
There are risks that confidential information could be revealed to peopl e not involved in the 
research such as a friend, relative, or an outside organization. This could be embarrassing to the participant if the participant wanted to keep participation in the study secret. The legal risks are limited because we are not collect ing any additional data than is collected during routine BCHD 
activities . Thus, the risks associated with participating in this study  are no  greater than the risks 
associated with routine psychological examinations or tests.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
This study entails no financial risks to participants.   
 
 
5. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
The study has the potential to benefit society if the tested intervention (nHealth LTCR) is found be effective in improving virologic suppression by [CONTACT_48070].

6. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
Participants will receive $ 50 for completing the baseline enrollment and $ 20 for completing  client 
satisfaction surveys .  Participants randomized to the intervention arm who do not own a phone will 
be provided a study phone with a pre -paid data plan.  
 
Participants in the in depth interviews will be compensated $ 50 for their time.  
 
7. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participant s and identify 
who will pay for them.  
There will be no costs to participants for any services or treatment provided in this study.  
The study procedures will be financed by a PCORI grant.

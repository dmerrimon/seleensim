analysis will be performed after the last patient c ompletes the 6-month visit. Patients will 
have the option to continue dosing in an extension period for up to an additional 6 months.   
All patients will take PCS499 300 mg BID with food for 1 week.  Beginning at Week 2, 
patients will commence administration of twice daily dosing of three PCS499 300 mg tablets 
(900 mg BID) with food.  Patients will continue at their assigned dose for the remainder of 
the study.   
During the dosing period, if a patient receiving PCS499 900 mg BID experiences unacceptable toxicity (i.e., non- transient, moderate to severe limitation in activity) that is 
deemed by [CONTACT_66325], his/her dose will be changed to

STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Analysis Populations: 
Patients will be analyzed by [CONTACT_16783].  Analyses w ill be performed based on 
observed data, and missing values will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. 
• Safety Population:  Defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at 
least 1 dose of treatment.  
• Efficacy Population (Modified Intent to T reat (mITT)):  Defined as all patients 
enrolled in the study who received at least [ADDRESS_1212919]-baseline efficacy assessment.    
• Per-Protocol Population:  Defined as a subset of the Efficacy Population who did 
not have a majo r protocol violation as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
• Biomarker Population:  Defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least [ADDRESS_1212920] appropriate samples available for analysis.    
Timing of Analyses: 
All endpoints will be analyzed after the last patient completes the 3 -month visit and the 6- 
month visit (primary) .  A final lock of the database and the final analyses will occur after the 
last patient completes the 12 -month visit.  
Patient Characteristics:  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics will be presented for each treatment group by [CONTACT_869174]. All descriptive summary 
statistics of continuous variables will include: n, me an, median, standard deviation, minimum 
and maximum. All descriptive summaries presenting frequencies and incidences will include 
n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients with recorded values in the 
corresponding group.  Patient completion status and exposure outcomes will be similarly

Safety Analyses:  
The safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population and include adverse 
events, changes in physical exam findings, vital signs, and clinical laboratory values.   
Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 21.0 or higher).  The number and percent of patients 
reporting at least one adverse event will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and 
Preferred Term (PT) and presented by [CONTACT_15994], severity, relationship to study drug, amount 
of drug exposure, and time. Each patient will contribute only once (i.e., first occurrence) to 
each of the incidence rates, regardless of the number of occurrences. For reporting of adverse 
event severity in patient s with more than one occurrence of the same adverse event, the 
patient will only be reported once based on the highest severity of the adverse event 
observed. Patients who have a serious adverse event (SAE) or who discontinue the study due to an adverse event deemed to be related to study drug will be described in patient narratives.  
 
Vital signs, clinical laboratory, and ECG results will also be presented and summarized by [CONTACT_869175].  All safety data collected in the clinical database, including physical exam findings and abnormal ECG results, will be presented in data listings.   
Efficacy Ana lyses: 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the Efficacy (mITT) Population.  Efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_869176]. All descriptive summary statistics of continuous variables will include: n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. All descriptive summaries 
presenting frequencies and i ncidences will include n, % and N, where N is the total number 
of patients with recorded values in the corresponding group.  Graphical representations will 
be presented, if appropriate.  Efficacy data will also be presented in listings to assess changes within patients over time.    
Exploratory Analyses: 
Depending on the extent of the data, additional exploratory analyses may be performed to 
characterize relationships among variables, such as correlations among variables and 
trending, as well as further sub-group analyses, such as based on diabetic status and study completion status.  Additional sensitivity analyses may include comparisons between 
observed values and imputed values for missing data using different methods (e.g., multiple 
imputation, last observation carried forward ( LOCF).

CONFIDENTIAL   23 7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Background Information  
Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare, idiopathic granulomatous disease involving collagen 
degradation.  It is a chronic, disfiguring skin condition that often develops on the pretibial region 
of the lower extremities but can also occur on other areas including the face, scalp,  forearm, and 
trunk.  NL usually presents initially as red papules that enlarge to form patches or plaques with 
an atrophic yellow center.  Although more commonly found in diabetic patients, non- diabetic 
patients can also develop NL and the progression of the disease is not correlated with glycemic control.  It is estimated that approximately 0.3% of the diabetic population has NL and that between 11 -65% of the NL patients are diabetic ( Muller, 1966; O'Toole, 1999).  NL also occurs 
predominantly in women (3:1 female- to-male ratio).  Ulceration occurs in approximately 30% of 
patients, which can lead to more severe complications, such as deep tiss ue infections that can 
threaten life of the limb  (Muller, 1966; Erfurt-Berge, 2015 ). Rare cases of squamous cell 
carcinoma in the NL region have also been reported.  
The earliest observed changes in NL involve small vessel vascular inflammation, progressing to 
larger vessel vasculitis, and collagen degeneration with septal fibrosis and fibrotic replacement 
of fat lobules ( Muller, 1966). Interstitial and palisaded granulomas involving the dermis and 
subcutaneous tissues are usually present. Granulomas are composed primarily of histiocytes 
(macrophages) with lymphocytes and plasma cells.  Palisaded histiocytes can be found near 
necrobiotic areas (especially in diabetics) with deposition of extracellular fat.  Although the 
pathophysiology of NL is still unclear, various potential mechanisms for development and progression of NL have been proposed.  Immune-complex deposition in blood vessels, abnormal 
collagen deposition/degradation and impaired neutrophil migration have all been suggested as 
possible causes of granuloma and necrobiotic collagen seen in the disease ( Ullman, 1977; 
Oikarinen, 1987; Markey, 1988; Gange, 1979).  Considering the strong association between NL 
and diabetics, diabetic microangiopathy (deposition of glycoprotein in blood vessels) has also been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis ( Reid, 2013) .   
7.2. Preclinical Data 
PCS499 is a methylxanthine derivative that is structurally identical to the pentoxifylline M1 
metabolite (PTX -M1), except that several key hydrogen atoms have been replaced with 
deuterium.  Pentoxifylline is th e active ingredient in Trental® which is approved in the US for 
the treatment of intermittent claudication on the basis of occlusive arterial disease of the limbs.  The extended release (ER) formulation of Trental was originally approved for use in Europe in 
1972 and US FDA approval for the treatment of intermittent claudication due to chronic occlusive arterial disease of the limbs was granted in 1984.  Metabolically, PTX and PTX -M1 
are known to interconvert in erythrocytes and liver by [CONTACT_869177], carboxy and demethylated metabolites (PTX-M2, 
PTX-M3, PTX-M4, PTX-M6 and PTX M7) as well as the terminal metabolite, M5 by [CONTACT_869178] ( Hinze, 1972; Lillibridge, 1996; Lee, 1997; Shin, 1998; 
Nicklasson, 2002; Peterson, 2004; Wyska, 2007).   
PCS499 has a complex mechanism of action including anti- inflammatory, immunomodulatory, 
hemorheological and antifibrotic effects that potentially could benefit NL patients.  PCS499 has 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   24 slightly more potent anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive  activities than PTX in inhibiting 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF -α and IFN-γ) and neutrophil activation that drive granuloma 
formation  and other inflammatory/autoimmune mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NL.    
In addition, P TX and PTX-M1 have in vitro  hemorheological properties that increase red blood 
cell deformability and decrease platelet aggregation.  These data suggested that PCS499 
potentially could moderate hypoxia and platelet aggregation/coagulation associated with 
microangiopathy and antibody- mediated vasculitis in NL.  F urthermore, PCS499 and PTX have 
similar activities in inhibiting in vitro the secretion of TGF -β, the master regulator of fibrosis, 
which could potentially modulate the fibrosis and increased collagen crossing linking in basement membranes in NL lesions.  
Thus, PCS499 may benefit NL patients based on its slightly more potent inhibition of pro-inflammatory  cytokines/chemoattractants and neutrophil activation that induce inflammation and 
granuloma formation, as well as its promoting effect on red blood cell de formability and platelet 
deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory flow and hypoxia in NL lesions, plus its inhibitory effect on TGF-β which reduce fibrosis and other collagen abnormalities.  
In terms of toxicology findings, there was no evidence of genetic toxicity in vitro or in vivo. 
PCS499 did not inhibit any of the major CYP450 isotypes in human liver microsomes; it 
exhibited low plasma protein binding and was permeable in CaCO-2 cells. The oral bioavailability of PCS499 was 37% in rats, and 62% and 25% in male and female dogs, 
respectively.   
PCS499 was well- tolerated in single - and repeat -dose toxicity studies at dose levels that are 
above the anticipated human dose levels. Overall, none of preclinical results preclude the administration of PCS 499 to humans and its development for the treatment of NL.   
Full details regarding the preclinical program for PCS499 are provided in the Investigational 
Brochure (IB ). 
7.3. Clinical Data Summary  
7.3.1. Previous P hase [ADDRESS_1212930] been completed including 4 studies in healthy volunteers and 2 studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Four Phase [ADDRESS_1212931] been completed evaluating tablet 
formulations, different dose regimens and administration of PCS499 with and without food. PCS499 tablets provide for a controlled release of the drug over an extended period of time after 
dosing. The maximum concentration (Cmax) 
 and area under the concentration vs time curve 
(AUC) of PCS499 increased approximately in proportion to dose across the range of tolerated 
doses.  Single daily doses up to [ADDRESS_1212932] common adverse events were nausea and headache.      
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   25 Trials in patients with CKD include a single Phase 1 study and a Phase 2, 48-week double-blind 
into 48-week open -label clinical trial in CKD patients with Type 2 diabetes.   During the Phase 2 
double-blind study, treatment with PCS499 was generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal (GI) 
events were reported more frequently in the PCS499 arm. Nausea was the most commonly 
reported event in the PCS499 arm, with 12 (13.5%) PCS499 vs 5 (5.7%) placebo patients 
reporting the event. Influenza was reported in 9 (10.1%) PCS499 and 1 (1.1%) placebo patients, and peripheral oedema reported in 9 (10.1%) PCS499 and 4 (4.5%) placebo patients. 
Hypertension was reported in a greater proportion of placebo patients, with 6 (6.7%) PCS499 
and 12 (13.6%) placebo patients experiencing the event. However, as only 6 patients required dose reduction, and only 4 patients were unable to tolerate PCS499 due to a GI event (and were 
forced to discontinue treatment), the 600 mg BID dosing regimen, following an initial 2  weeks of 
once daily  (QD) dosing, appeared to be satisfactorily tolerated in this patient population.  
Clinical safety data obtained to date in the [ADDRESS_1212933] been no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
that were considered by [CONTACT_869179]. Further information 
regarding previous clinical studies can be found in the Investigator Brochure.    
7.4. Dose  Rationale  
Previously, single oral doses of up to [ADDRESS_1212934] been shown to be safe and well tolerated in a 
Phase 1 study with healthy volunteers.   
PCS499 has been previously administered to CKD patients.  Multiple doses of 600 mg QD for 2 
weeks followed  by 600 mg BID for an additional 2 weeks were administered to Stage 3 CKD 
patients. No significant AEs were observed in this  study. Also, in a Phase 2 study (CP.505.2001), 
PCS499 was administered at a dose of 600 mg BID for up to 2 years in diabetic nephropathy patients. From the studies conducted to date, although tolerable, higher daily doses may be 
needed to further maximize  the effects from PCS499.   
A recent study (PCS499.1005) was performed to identify a formulation with target product 
profile characteristics of a delayed time to maximum concentration ( Tmax), lower Cmax, and 
increased AUC.  The PK and safety profile of the selected form ulation was then assessed in a 
multiple dose study with a maximum daily dose of [ADDRESS_1212935] for NL.  Current treatment approaches are based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_77478], but generally produce unsatisfactory results.  These include corticosteroids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   26 intralesional, and systemic), topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726], anti-pla telet agents, various 
immunosuppressants (chloroquine, thalidomide, TNF-α blockers, etc.), UV phototherapy, and 
skin grafting. For ulcerated lesions, wound care involving moisture control, infection control, conservative debridement, and compression therapy is employed. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in 13-19% of patients after 6- 12 years (Muller, 1966).  
Clinically, multiple case reports have been published suggesting benefit from the use of pentoxifylline (PTX) in NL patients, possibly related to its vascular and anti- inflammatory 
effects (Littler, 1987; Noz, 1993; Basaria, 2003; Wee, 2017). PCS499 is an analog of 
pentoxifylline that provides an exposure profile of active molecules more favorable to inhibiting 
the secretion of TNF -α, IFN-γ, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, PCS499 has 
been well tolerated in Phase 1 studies  at higher doses , which may be due to the flatter slope in 
achieving maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of active metabolites , which would be 
consistent with published reports that equate a higher rate of adverse events with a rapid drug 
absorption rate and higher maximum plasma concentrations for PTX ( Cleary, 1999 ).  Thus, 
PCS499 may benefit NL patients based on its enhanced inhibition of cytokines (TNF- α, IFN-γ) 
that induce inflammation and granuloma formation as well as its effect on red blood cell deformability and promotion of platelet deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory 
flow.  Furthermore, higher doses of PCS499 can be administered with resulting higher exposures 
of active molecules with no observed increase in adverse effects.

 14. ASSESSMENT OF EXPLORATORY E FFICACY  
14.1. Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
14.1.1. Investigator Global Assessment: Necrobiosis Lipoidica ( IGA :NL)  
The Investigator Global Assessment : Necrobiosis Lipoidica ( IGA:NL) is a tool that has been 
adapted to assess the presence and severity of necrobiosis lesions.  Adap tation of the scale was 
based on input from 4 dermatologists with expertise  in granulomatous disorders, NL, and ulcers.  
The scale has face validity and has performed well in limited testing .  The scale scores activity 
based on features of inflammation/erythema , induration, and ulceration ( Table 3) and damage 
based on features of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring, and atrophy ( Table 4).  Further validation of the 
scale is ongoing.  
Instructions:  Select (1) a numeric score that describes the activity and (2) a numeric score that 
describes the damage of the reference lesion*.  (*Reference lesion is the most severely affected 
lesion.) 
Table 3: IGA :NL Activity  
 
Score  Definition  Description  
[ADDRESS_1212951] Clear  Minimal inflammation (faint erythema); essentially flat with possible 
trace induration; no ulceration present. 
2 Mild Mild inflammation (pi[INVESTIGATOR_100209])  and/or slight induration; no ulceration 
present. 
3 Moderate  Marked inflammation (dark pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], yellow- orange color)  and/or 
moderate induration; no ulceration present. 
4 Severe Intense inflammation (red or orange color) and/or severe induration and/or 1-2 shallow ulcerations present, but underlying structures (muscle, bone) NOT visible. 
5 Very Severe  Very intense inflammation (bright red/purple or deep orange color) and/or very severe induration and/or any deep ulceration present with underlying structures (muscle, bone) visible and/or more than 2 ulcerations.

14.1.2. Necrobiosis Lipoidica Color and Ulcer Scale (NLCUS)  
A tool called the Necrobiosis Lipoidica Color and Ulcer Scale (NLCUS) is also under 
development that separately assess es the color and ulcer of NL lesions.  This tool includes 
domains to separately assess the color/inflammation (Table 5) and induration ( Table 6) of NL 
lesions and the extent of ulceration , if present  (Table 7).  The  scale was  developed among 4 
dermatologists with expertise  in granulomatous disorders, NL, and ulcers, and has face validity 
and has performed well in limited pre- clinical testing .  Further validation of the scale is ongoing. 
Instructions:  Select (1) a numeric score that describes the color and (2) a numeric score that 
describes the ulceration status of the reference lesion*.  (*Reference lesion is the most severely 
affected lesion.)

2 Any deep ulceration with underlying structures (muscle, bone) visible and/or 
more than 2 ulcerations 
14.1.3. Physician Global Assessment (PGA)  
The physician’s global assessment will be performed using a 10 c m VAS ranging from “ none” to 
“extreme activity ”, after the question “ Based on your assessment of the disease activity , draw a 
vertical mark (|) through the horizontal line for the level of disease activity  that is present today.”  
14.1.4. Lesion /ulcer surface area  
Surface area of the lesions(s)/ulcer  will be measured by [CONTACT_869184].  
Lesion surface area is defined as the surface area of the lesion with active 
inflammation/erythema.  The total lesion surface area (if more than one lesion is present), the 
reference lesion (defined as the lesion with the highest disease severity) surface area, reference ulcer surface area (defined as the ulcer with the highest disease severity  within the  reference 
lesion), and total ulcer surface area will be calculated .  The longest length and width (measured 
perpendicular to the longest length) measurements taken by [CONTACT_129960] a ruler will be entered into the eCRF  along with an assessment of the shape of the lesion (rectangular, circular, 
triangular, or elliptical) .   
Using the digital photograph/3D scan of the lesion, the Investigator will also electronically trace 
the perimeter of the reference lesion  and reference ulcer (if present).  Based on the tracing, t he 
surface area of the reference lesion and the surface area and volume of the reference ulcer  (if 
present) will be calculated.    
14.1.5. Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) 
The Dermatology Quality of Life  Index (DLQI) is a self -administered , standard health- related 
quality of life (HRQL) instrument used in clinical trials related to skin diseases  (Both, 2007).  
The DLQI consists of 10 items and covers six domains including: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Scores range from [ADDRESS_1212953] HRQL instrument that has been proposed to be 
comprehensive, but less used in clinical trials ( Chren, 2012).  It includes 29- items with 3 
domains, symp toms, emotions and functioning.  Each domain is scored from 0 to 100 with 
higher scores indicating lower quality of life.  The domains can be combined and scored separately .

 14.1.7. Patient Global Assessment (PtGA)  
The patient’s global assessment will be performe d using a 10 cm VAS ranging from “very 
severe” to “not at all”, after the question “Please indicate with a vertical mark (|) on the 
horizontal line, how does your skin condition affect you today?” 
14.1.8. Exploratory Efficacy Variables in Ulcerated Patients  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Closur e of reference ulcer  
Closure of reference ulcer is defined as skin re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_869165] 2 weeks apart. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ulcer volume  
Ulcer volume will be assessed using via the use of a 3D- imaging system.   
14.2. Biomarkers  
Selected serum biomarkers related to the potential anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive 
effects of PCS499 on NL will be measured.  These include TNF -α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, 
IL-17 and MCP-1.   
Additionally, an association between underlying autoimmunity and the development of NL has been suggested based on the higher than expected prevalence of the disease in patients with Type 
1 diabetes (as compared to Type 2 diabetes)  (Erfurt-Berge, 2015).  C- peptide levels will be 
measured to assess whether there is any benefit of PCS499 in maintaining natural insulin production. 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: [ADDRESS_1212954] resting 12- lead ECGs will be performed ; ECGs will be performed after the patient has 
rested for at least 5 minutes.  
15.1.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical Safety Laboratory assessments will include hematology, chemistry and urin alysis, 
coagulation, and HgbA1c.  
Screening panels will include v irus serology (HIV, and hepatitis B and C).  Results must be 
available prior to dosing. 
The list of clinical laborator y assessments is included i n Appendix A. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
PCS499 should not be administered to pregnant women.  Effective methods of birth control must 
be used by [CONTACT_869185]. 
A serum β- HCG will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening).  All WOCBP will have local urine 
pregnancy tests as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
requires immediate interruption of study treatment until a serum β-HCG is performed and found 
to be negative.  If positive, the subject must be discontinued from the study. 
15.1.5. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications are defined as any medication taken by [CONTACT_869186].  Prior medications are defined as any medication taken by [CONTACT_178825] [ADDRESS_1212955] dose of study medication .  Prior and concomitant medications 
will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary.   
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: [ADDRESS_1212956] whether or not considered drug- related.  Adverse events may include safety findings 
considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], Sponsor, or Medical Monitor.  An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  Reporting an adverse event does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by [CONTACT_737], Sponsor or Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) that the event is causally related to the  drug. 
All adverse events should be captured and must be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Adverse events should be spontaneously reported or elicited by [CONTACT_105]-suggestive probing.  All 
adverse event reports should contain the date the adverse event occurred, a brief description of 
the event (if the event consists of a cluster of signs and symptoms, record a diagnosis rather than each sign and symptom), onset date, the severity, the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship to study drug, the study drug action taken, the outcome, date resolved, and whether 
or not the event was serious (and if so, why). 
New information regarding signs and symptoms that occurred during the Screening phase and 
prior to the day of the first study medication dose on Day 1 of study that are related to screening 
procedures should be recorded on the Adverse Event log.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnorm ality: 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_125943]  
• Results in study withdrawal 
• Fulfills any of the criteria for an SAE, as described in this section  
• Requires intervention or further evaluat ion to determine the etiology of the 
abnormality and/or assess the risk to the patient 
• Requires treatment  
15.2.2. Categorizing Adverse Events in Relation to Study Phase 
The relationship of each adverse event must be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF as one of 
the choices provided on the scale that follows, where the temporal sequence is defined as an association between administration of a drug and the observed reaction or event such that the drug was present prior to the reaction or event: 
The Investigator assess es the relationship between the AE and the study drug by [CONTACT_869187]: 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   56 
 
 • DEFINITELY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable and there is no other cause to explain the event; or a re-
challenge (if feasible) is positive.  
• PROBABLY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable and is more likely explained by [CONTACT_646075].    
• POSSIBLY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to adm inistration of the study 
drug is reasonable; however, the event could have been due to another, equally likely, cause. 
• UNLIKELY TO BE RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of 
the study drug, is possible but another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the event or there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the product could have caused the event. 
• NOT RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the study drug, 
is not reasonable; or, another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the event.  
All AEs (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) through to the follow- up/early withdrawal visit are 
to be recorded in the patient’s source documents and on the corresponding page(s) in the e CRF.  
Whenever possible, symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis.  The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to study drug, corrective treatment/therapy given, outcome and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_869166] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_5257] .  All 
medications administered to treat an AE must be recorded in the patient’s source documentation 
and documented in the e CRF. 
15.2.3. Assigning Severity to Adverse Events  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as one of the choices provided on the scale below: 
• MILD: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. 
• MODERATE: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
• SEVERE: Incapa citating with inability to work or do usual activity.  
15.2.4. Serious Adverse Event  Definition and Collection  
An adverse event is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it includes any untoward medical occur rence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869167]499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   57 
 
 • Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the patient's body fun ction/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life. 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
The term “life threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient in the view of either the I nvestigator or Sponsor, was at risk of immediate death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
and reported on the SAE form and documented in the e CRF. 
Reporting serious adverse events to the Medical Monitor requires additional detailed reports and 
follow-up, depending upon the Investigator's (or in some cases the Sponsor's) estimate of a 
causal relationship between the test agent and the adverse event(s), and whether the adverse event(s) is identified in  nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator's Brochure or other 
risk information supplied to the Investigator. 
In the event of a serious adverse event, the Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor 
immediately (within 24 hours).  The SAE hotline telephone and SAE fax line numbers will be 
provided to each site and will be present also on the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet.  Details 
of the serious adverse event must be documented on the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet by [CONTACT_869188].  The initial report should be as complete as possible. 
Information not available at the time of the initial report ( e.g., an end date for the adverse event 
or discharge summary/testing/laboratory values received after the first report), must be 
documented on a follow-up Serious Adverse Event Worksheet.  Sites must make an effort to obtain all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806682].  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be submitted to the Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) 
as per the requirements of the IRB.  The death of a patient must be immediately (within 24 hours 
of site awareness) reported to the IRB.  All serious and non-serious adverse events should be 
thoroughly documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and followed out by [CONTACT_869189].  The event may be followed longer, if deemed 
necessary.  Sites must ensure that the final SAE Worksheet captures the same information as the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  For any death occurring during the trial, the medical condition that led to 
the death on the Adverse Event eCRF and also reported on the SAE Worksheet.  The “outcome” 
status should be noted as “death” in these cases of SAEs that resulted in death.  In addition, all 
SAEs that occur within [ADDRESS_1212957] dose of study drug should be recorded and reported as noted previously.

 22. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
22.1. Data Collection  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be provided to the study site by [CONTACT_869193].  All protocol-required information collected during the study must be recorded by [CONTACT_869194].  The source 
documentation will then be used to enter the protocol required information onto the eCRF.  The Investigator may authorize other persons to make entries in the eCRF, provided that the names, 
positions, signatures and initials of these persons are supplied in a delegation of authority log 
actively maintained at the site and reviewed by [CONTACT_39613].  The Investigator or 
designated representative should enter source document data for enrolled patients into the eCRF 
as soon as possible once the information has been collected.  All changes to data will be 
collected electronically through a computerized system for electronic data capture.  Changes or 
corrections to electronic case report forms will be documented by [CONTACT_869195] a change or correction, and wil l be time/date stamped.  The 
eCRF for each patient will be checked against source documents by [CONTACT_39613].  eCRFs 
will be stored on an appropriate storage media at the Investigator's site and the data management 
center. 
Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a Delegation of Authority form (Site Signature [CONTACT_53633]), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individual s who are 
authorized to make or change entries on e CRFs. 
22.2. Case Report Form Completion  
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by [CONTACT_869196] a 
Clinical Monitoring Plan.  Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while 
monitoring.  Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately.  Additionally, CRO and Processa Pharmaceuticals may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which 
could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution.  The final, completed e CRF 
for each subject must be electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_869172]. 
22.3. Database Management, Da ta Clarification, and Quality Assurance  
A designated CRO will be responsible for data management.  Data Management will develop a 
Data Management Plan document and provide it to Processa Pharmaceuticals for approval.  The DMP document will define all activ ities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed 
DMP will be based on the protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data-flows, e CRFs, data 
cleaning procedures, other supporting documents, and data management standards and practices. 
Programmed data validation edit checks will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data 
Manager after entry.  The sites will respond to the data queries in a time ly manner.  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   70 
 
 Concurrent medications entered into the database will be coded using a WHO Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical dictionary.  Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated CRO SOPs.  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.  Any changes to the database after that time will only be made by [CONTACT_869197], the Trial S tatistician, the Data Manager, and the Quality Assurance 
Auditor according to designated CRO SOPs. 
22.4. Inspection of Records/Source Documents  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the sponsor or designee must verify data entered in the eCRF entries against the source documents, except for the pre- identified source data directly 
documented in the e CRF (if applicable).  The ICF will include a statement by [CONTACT_53620]’s duly authorized personnel, the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authorit ies to 
have direct access to source data that supports the data in the eCRF (e.g., subject’s medical file, 
appointment books, and original laboratory records).  These personnel, bound by [CONTACT_56520], must keep confidential all personal medical inf ormation. 
The objective of source document verification (SDV) is to comply with GCP and international 
regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud.  Source document verification means 
ensuring that the source documents are an accurate and verifiable reflection of the subject’s participation in the study and that all relevant information that is recorded in the source document is accurately entered into the eCRF. 
Where source documents serve as the basis for deriving data for the trial, SDV should ensure that these documents are correctly labeled and filed and that the data derived from them are correct.  
All source documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_30377].  If electronic progress notes and other electronic 
source documents are not Title [ADDRESS_1212969] be dated and signed by [CONTACT_869198]-Investigator at the time  of the visit.  Processa  Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to terminate 
the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply original source documentation for this clinical study. 
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the e CRF the following information: 
1. Information to confirm that the subject exists ( e.g., initials, date of birth, sex) 
2. Confirmation that the subject satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
3. Confirmation that the subject is taking part in the clinical trial 
4. Confirmation of the informed consent process 
5. Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures 
6. Information concerning all AEs 
7. Details of concomitant and investigational medications  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: [ADDRESS_1212970] 2 years after the approval of a 
marketing application/new drug application for the indication investigated or at least [ADDRESS_1212971] (e.g., the Investigational New Drug application is withdrawn).  These documents should 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_869199].  
The Investigator must notify Processa  Pharmaceuticals prior to destroying any study essential 
documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform Processa  Pharmaceuticals.  
The relevant records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.

 23. CONFIDENTIALITY, AMENDMENTS, AND PUBLICATIONS 
All informa tion disclosed or provided by [CONTACT_869200] (or designee) or produced 
during the trial including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the IB, and the results 
obtained during the course of the trial (if applicable), are confidential.  The Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to undertake to keep confidential and not to disclose the information to any third party without the prior written approval of Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
However, submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB/IEC is expressly permitted, the IRB/IEC members having the same obligation of confidentiality. 
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission from Processa Pharmaceuticals.  However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel 
(or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records.  The copi[INVESTIGATOR_860613].  All study drug, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_869201](s) or regulatory authorities.  
Photographs from this study may be used for the further development of clinical tools to evaluate the disease activity in patients with Necrobiosis Lipoidica (e.g. the IGA:NL scale and the 
NLCUS).  If photographs are used, they will only include unidentifiable images, meaning that 
the patient will not be able to be identified from these photographs. 
Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_869202].  Their full names may, 
however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized officials in the event of inspections.  Documents containing the full name [CONTACT_869209].  This information will not be transferred to Processa 
Pharmaceuticals nor be contained in regulatory filings.  In the event of inspections by [CONTACT_869203], this subject identification may be disclosed.  
23.1. Subject Data Protection  
Prior to an y testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates 
must also provide all authorizations required by [CONTACT_1769] ( e.g., PHI authorization in North 
America).  
The subject will not be identified by [CONTACT_869204].  Processa Pharmaceuticals, its partner(s) and 
designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of this study.  Every effort will be made to keep the subject’s  personal medical data confidential.  
Processa Pharmaceuticals will protect individual subject information to the fullest extent possible during this trial.  At no time will a subject become identified in any publication or presentation.  However, the subject may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit 
or inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to subject information is at the 
discretion of Processa Pharmaceuticals and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as determined solely by [CONTACT_869205].  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   73 
 
 23.2. Study Protocol Amendments  
The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from 
Processa Pharmaceuticals and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  Any permanent change to 
the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any amendment to the protocol that appears necessary as the 
study progresse s will be fully discussed by [CONTACT_737](s) and Processa Pharmaceuticals.  If 
agreement is reached regarding the need for an amendment, it will be written by [CONTACT_869206].  The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB /IEC 
identified with this responsibility.  Except for administrative amendments, Investigators must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the change(s).  Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research 
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately, and the IRB/IEC notified within 5 days.  Processa  Pharmaceuticals will ensure submission of any 
protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/IEC, the Investigators, and/or Processa 
Pharmaceuticals, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or 
increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar 
modification.  In such cases, the Investigator will obtain repeat informed consent from subjects enrolled in the study before expecting continued participation. 
23.3. Publication  
All information concerning the product as well as any information such as clinical indications for 
the study drugs, their formula, their formulation, methods of manufacture and other scientific 
data relating to it, that have been provided by [CONTACT_869207], and are 
unpublished, are confidential and must remain the sole property of Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
The Investigator will agree to use the information only for the purposes of carrying out this study 
and for no other purpose unless prior written permission from Processa Pharmaceuticals is obtained.  Processa Pharmaceuticals has full ownership of the e CRFs completed as part  of the 
study. 
By [CONTACT_33351], the Investigator agrees that the results of the study may be used for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for 
medical and pharmaceutical professionals by [CONTACT_869208].  If necessary, the 
authorities will be notified of the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of 
involvement. 
Processa Pharmaceuticals or designee will prepare a final report on the study.  The Investigator 
may not publish or present any information on this study without first presenting the information to Processa Pharmaceuticals for review.

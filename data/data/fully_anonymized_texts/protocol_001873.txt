[ADDRESS_947396] goal(s): We will study 3 groups of 10 older subjects during daily protein intakes of 0.8 (recommended dietary allowance [RDA]), 1.1 (National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]), and 1.5 (optimal [OPI]) g/kg/d. 
Due to common eating patterns in older adults (1), these protein intakes will be 
structured within 2 meals per day. A 2- day dietary lead- in (matching the subject’s 
intervention paradigm ) will proceed each dietary intervention. Whole- body protein 
balance will be determined during metabolic study days by [CONTACT_697954] [ADDRESS_947397] will be about 2 weeks.

[ADDRESS_947398] and fourth decades of life, 
respectively (2). Thus, treatments that prevent age- related losses of skeletal muscle 
mass and function are essential for all aging populations.  
Protein turnover is an important regulatory process of muscle growth and function and is 
influenced by [CONTACT_697955]. The current RDA for protein for 
adults is 0.8 g/kg/d, which is the minimum protein intake necessary to avoid malnutrition 
(3). However, the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) was developed 
to express dietary recommendation in the context of a complete diet. For protein the AMDR is 10 –  35% of total calories. Assuming a [ADDRESS_947399] provides 1.05 – 3.67 g/kg/d when reference body weights of 57 and 
70 kg are assumed for women and men, respectively (4). In this regard, even the lower 
end of the AMDR intake is higher than the RDA. Moreover, many nutritional organizations (3,5) hav e recommended intakes above the RDA (1.2 -  2 g/kg/d) for older 
adults. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_697948], an increase in the RDA for the general population, or for older adults, has not materialized.  
Increasing the RDA would represent a physiologically accurate acknowledgment of an 
increased protein requirement with aging. The adequacy of protein intake is made 
further difficult as older adults tend to consume lower food/caloric intakes as they age. 
This age associated decrease in food/caloric intake has been attributed to reduced 
appetites, changes in chemo- sensory abilities, and deteriorations in dentition, manual 
dexterity, and gastro- intestinal function (6). Unfortunately, studies suggest that the 
consumption of animal -based protein- rich foods is impacted to a greater degree (6). 
This is of concern as animal -based protein- rich foods not only provide a better protein to

262424 protocol v. 9 07Dec 21 Page 7 of 23  calorie ratio, requiring less total food intake to meet protein requirements, but also 
provide unique nutritional profiles that cannot be obtained through supplementation or 
substitution (7). Furthermore, we have demonstrated (Figure 1) that complete protein 
ingestion leads to a greater increase in peripheral EAA, and further, that this  increase is 
directly related to the increase in muscle protein synthesis and whole- body net protein 
balance. It is apparent that the use of animal -based protein- rich food sources are 
imperative for older adults to meet their elevated protein requirements.  Thus, it is crucial 
to identify nutritional strategies that require minimal changes in eating behaviors of older 
adults yet improve the potential for protein homeostasis.  
Older adults have decreased motor abilities, which impacts their ability to cook and prepare their own food. Animal -based protein -rich food sources often require more time 
and effort to prepare than plant sources. This aspect contributes to inadequate protein intakes as plant sources have a lower protein to calorie ratio. Thus, an importa nt 
strategy to increase daily protein intake is to improve the convenience and minimize the effort required to prepare animal -based protein- rich food sources. This can be readily 
accomplished by [CONTACT_697956]’ diet. The reduced effort and time required to incorporate these 
products into a pre- existing dietary plan would improve the potential of successful 
implementation.  
One common approach to increase dietary protein in older adults has been to define an “optimal” within -day protein intake distribution. Based upon skeletal muscle responses 
to various doses of protein intake, it was concluded that an even distribution of protein intake, as opposed to an uneven distribution, was preferable (8). The primary issue here 
is that saturable protein dose limits are not well -defined, and arguably non- existent. 
Research consistently supports the concept that muscle protein synthesis is maxed out with around 10- 15 grams of EAA when supplied in liquid format following resistance 
exercise (9– 13). However, we have observed (Figure 1 ) that greater protein intake is 
required when provided in whole- food format as opposed to liquid drinks.

Figure 1: A greater digestibility requirement (whole- food protein s ources) results in a 
lower stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. These data also demonstrate that greater 
peripheral EAA are required to increase muscle protein synthesis.  
 
Basing protein distribution optimization upon saturable protein dose studies ref lects the 
“muscle -full” effect theory, which recently was shown to be an artifact of the rapid and 
transient rise in circulating amino acids rather than a true physiological effect (14). 
Furthermore, protein recommendations are based upon whole- body protei n 
requirements, not muscle requirements. This is an important consideration as we (15) 
and others (16) have demonstrated that whole- body protein balance does not plateau 
with protein intake; i.e., greater improvements in whole- body net protein balance are 
observed with increasing doses of protein.  
The above highlight an incorrect underlying assumption of evenly distributing protein intake throughout the day. More pertinent to the issue is that studies directly testing 
protein distribution do not provide strong evidence for an even protein distribution being 
superior to an uneven protein distribution. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_697949] (17) in younger adults (36.9 ± 3.1 years of age), our recent studies (18,19) in older adults (50 –  75 years 
of age) demonstrated no superior effect of an even protein distribution on whole- body 
protein balance or muscle protein synthesis over a 24- hour period. More importantly,

[ADDRESS_947400] influence on 
anabolism (18– 21). The take home message from these studies is that total protein 
intake, not intake patterns, dictates protein homeostasis. This is an important message, as NHANES data indicates that only 17.3% of adults eat more than two meals a day 
containing ≥30 grams  of protein per meal (1).  Thus, the issue becomes one of 
increasing protein intake in older adults within their pre- existing dietary patterns. 
Incorporating minimally and further processed meat and poultry products into current 
dietary patterns provides an easily accessible strategy for older adults to meet higher 
protein requirements required to maintain protein mass. Therefore, demonstrating the 
efficacy of these products to meet body protein demands within a preexisting dietary 
pattern of two meals a day is the focus of this project.

and whole- body protein balance with increasing doses of daily protein intake.

prepared by [CONTACT_697957]. Subjects  will be instructed to eat only the food that is 
labelled for each particular meal over the run- in days. They may add non- caloric 
condiments and seasonings and have their usual beverages. Caloric  requirements are 
determined by [CONTACT_697958] -Benedict formula based on subject’s weight and sex  and are 
matched to the subject’s intervention group (e.g. 0.8 or 1 or 1.5g protein/kg per day ). 
Each meal’s containers  are placed into a labelled plastic zippered storage bag, with the 
meals for one day placed into a larger  labelled bag. Subjects are asked to store them in

consents, their height and weight will be measured to determine their BMI . Questions 
will be asked about their medical history and medication use.  Eligible, enrolled subjects 
will be shown a menu of the foods they will be asked to eat to elicit any food allergies or 
intolerances . If the subject is fasted  for 8 hours , has not had caffeine in 12 hours, and 
has not strenuously exercised in 24 hours, they  will undergo body composition testing 
and DXA scan . If these criteria cannot be met during this visit, subjects will perform 
these two tests at Visit 2 . A blood sample will be drawn for Complete Blood Count 
(Labcorp). Randomization will occur. Future study visits are scheduled.

completes the 2- day run- in meals . At this visit , subjects will report having fasted for 10 
or more hours . This visit is expected to take about 1 3 hours.  During this visit, subjects 
will be asked to provide blood/urine/saliva samples. They will ingest deuterated water 
(~3mL per kg body weight) at specific times  (total dose divided into 10 aliquots and 
ingested every hour up to study hour 9:00)  and 2g of a stable isotope of alanine (15N -
alanine) dissolved in water. Two (group- specific) study  meals  will be served, one in the 
morning and one in the afternoon/evening. See Figure 2  for a timeline.  After the second 
saliva sample has been collected, subjects wil l go home and return to the study site the 
following morning having fasted overnight.

10.5 Power Calculations 
We propose a group size of 10 per group, based upon an ANOVA model to compare 
the nutrition interventions. With this sample size, the ANOVA model has 80% power to 
detect effect sizes of f = 0.484 or larger. This estimate assumes that the basal covariate explains 50% of the variation in the response and a 5% α -level is used to determine 
statistica l significance.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_947417] benefits to the study participants; however, knowledge gained 
from the study could potentially benefit patients in the future.   Anticipated risks 
associated with this protocol are described in detail below. All experimental procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_251233].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_697952].  There are no known risks of body composition testing ( InBody770, 
BioSpace, Seoul, South Korea) , urine or saliva collection.

The risk s of drinking 70% deuterated water are  temporary dizziness , nausea and 
possibly vomiting . Each dose is approximately 20- 40 mL (1 ½ -  2 tablespoons).  There 
are no known risk s of ingestion of the stable isotopes of alanine or methyl hist idine.  
 
11.2 Blood Sampling 
Up to 10 mL of venous blood will be drawn during visit s 3 and 4 in total . This is less than 
a tablespoon. The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, bleeding, and small 
chance of infection from the needle sticks.  One ~5mL sample will be drawn during visit 1 
to determine eligi bility.  
 
11.3 Percutaneous Vastus Lateralis Muscle Biopsy  
The risks of this procedure include pain, bruising, bleeding, scar formation, and infection. 
This procedure will be done using aseptic technique by [CONTACT_25245] (MD or PA) 
after injection of  local anesthesia (1% plain lidocaine). Approximately 100mg of tissue will 
be removed from the vastus lateralis muscle (subject’s choice of left or right leg).

11.6 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
• Study staff will ask subjects about the occurrence o f adverse events during  visits.  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_697953].  
• Adverse events will be recorded in the CRF and on an excel spreadsheet that is 
submitted to the IRB at required intervals.  
• Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of their 
discovery.  
 
 
12.0 Ethical Considerations  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) research policies and 
procedures.   This protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_348216] (IRB) to conduct the study.  
The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.   All subjects for this 
study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information in language suitable for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.   The person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each 
element of the document and out line the risks and benefits, alternate treatment(s), and 
requirements of the study.   The consent process will take place in a quiet and private 
room, and subjects may take as much time as needed to make a decision about their participation.   Participation privacy will be maintained and questions regarding 
participation will be answered.   No coercion or undue influence will be used in the 
consent process.   This consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_348217].   A copy of th e signed consent will be given to the participant, and

Statistical Methodology This is a proof of concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_855128]-emptive 
treatment with AAT. The expected inci dence of steroid refractory (SR) 
GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100  in patients who are high risk at either day 7 or 14 is 
28%. We assume that the incidence of steroid refractory GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 
100 among high risk patients treated pre-emptively will be 15% as a 
clinically meaningful incidence. Based on this assumption, a sample size 
of 30 achieves 85% power to detec t a 13% improvement (28%-15%) in 
steroid refractory incidence rate using a one-sided exact test with a target significance level of 0.23. If we obser ve 6 or fewer cases of SR GVHD, we 
will consider this approa ch sufficiently promising to warrant further study. 
5 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Acute GVHD 
Hematopoietic cellular transplantation (HCT or  BMT) is an important treatment for high-risk 
hematologic malignancies whose curative potentia l depends on the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) 
effect. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the major cause of non-relapse mortality (NRM) after 
HCT, is closely associated with GVL 1-3. Pre-transplant clinical risk factors for GVHD include the 
degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], donor type, and conditioning regimen intensity 
4,5. Some centers use one or more of these risk factors to 
guide GVHD prophylaxis, such as the use of anti- thymocyte globulin when the donor is not an HLA-
identical sibling 6, but such approaches are globally immunosuppressive and carry their own risks, 
in particular of opportunistic infections 7,8. 
Acute GVHD affects 40% to 60% of  patients and targets the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract 5,9. The median onset of acute GVHD is approximately 1 month after transplant 10,11. The initial 
treatment for GVHD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_855129], but up to 50% of patients 
do not respond to this approach. Steroid refractory  (SR) GVHD, which most often involves the GI 
tract, is the primary driver of lethal GVHD, and by [CONTACT_66250], non-relapse mortality after HCT 10. 
However, until now there has been no reliable method to identify the patient s at high risk for SR 
GVHD before GVHD develops.  
1.[ADDRESS_1190837] Outcomes 
The concentrations of several protein biomarkers (e.g., ST2, REG3α , IL2Rα, TNFR1, hepatocyte 
growth factor, and elafin) in the serum are increased in patients with  GVHD 12-15. Combinations of 
ST2 and REG3 α, with or without TNFR1, have been prov en to be prognostic for GVHD outcomes 
when measured at the time GVHD is diagnosed 10,16. Recently, we used serum samples obtained 
from patients participating in the Mount Sinai Ac ute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) to 
develop and validate an algorithm that uses the combination of ST2 and REG3α  concentrations, 
measured on Day [ADDRESS_1190838] the development of non-relapse mortality (NRM) 16. We 
used samples from Day [ADDRESS_1190839] pre-emptive treatment strategies. The 
MAGIC algorithm identified a high risk (HR) gr oup in the training set whose NRM (28%) was 
significantly greater (p<0.001) than that of the low risk (LR) group (7%) (Fig ure 1A). Application of 
this algorithm to the test set produced similar, highly statistically significant differences between HR 
and LR groups (Figure 1B). We performed a seco nd validation in the multicenter set and again 
observed large differences between groups, with an HR 6-month NRM of 26% versus 10% in the 
LR group (p<0.001) (Figure 1C). The proportion of  patients in the HR group was similar in all 3 
patient sets (16% to 20%). Relapse rates were equivalent in both risk groups in all 3 sets (Figure 1, D–F), with the result that HR patients experienced signi ficantly worse overal l survival (p<0.001) 
(Figure 1, G–I). Importantly, GVHD was the driver of  NRM. HR patients were 3 times more likely to 
die from GVHD than LR patients (HR 19% vs. LR  6%, p<0.001), a finding explained by [CONTACT_855154] 6-month incidence of SR GVHD in high risk patients compared to LR patients (35% vs 15%, 
p<0.001).
 It is likely that the blood biomarker concent rations on Day [ADDRESS_1190840] risk groups independently of 
patient age [ ≤21y: HR 27% vs LR 6%, p<0.001; >21y: HR 29% vs LR 8%, p<0.001], conditioning 
regimen [reduced intensity: HR 37% vs LR 8%, p<0.001; full intensity: HR 25% vs LR 8%, p<0.001] 
or the use of thymoglobulin in the conditioning r egimen [ATG given: HR 31% vs LR 8%, p<0.001; 
6 no ATG: HR 28% vs LR 8%, p<0.001]. Relapse rates we re equivalent within all subgroups of clinical 
risk factors, resulting in a decrease of at least 20% in overall survival for HR patients  
We recently tested whether we could improve the sensitivity of the MAGIC algorithm by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-testing 
low risk patients one week later (Day 14), reas oning that the concentra tion of GVHD biomarkers 
would be higher one week closer to the onset of GVHD. Serum samples from both Day 7 and Day 14 were available for 768 MAGIC patient s (Figure 2) We measured ST2 and REG3 α on Day 7 in 
all patients and identified 145 (19%) as high risk and 623 (81%) as low risk with distinctly different 
NRM (26% vs 8%, p<0.001). Twenty low ri sk patients (3%) developed GVHD between Day [ADDRESS_1190841] on Day 14 in the 
remaining 603 LR patients, we identified 60 additi onal HR patients whose NRM risk was similar to 
the day 7 HR patients and signific antly higher than the 543 patients who remained LR (24% vs 6%, 
p<0.001). Compared to the Day [ADDRESS_1190842] alone, repeat testing on Day 14 resulted in a large 
improvement in sensitivity for NRM (46% to 61%) with only a modest loss of specificity (80% to 
1 
7 75%). Serial testing at both Days 7 and 14 significantly increases the proportion of patients 
potentially eligible to participat e in a GVHD pre-emptive treatment trial from 19% (145/768) of the 
total population to 27% (205/768). 
For this proof of concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_855130] 100 as the primary 
endpoint to determine whether pre-emption therapy with AAT warrants further study. The 
cumulative incidence of SR GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 in patients who are HR at either Day 7 or 14 is 
28%. 
1.3 Alpha-1-Antitrypsin 
Few side effects and promising efficacy are desir able properties in an agent to be tested for GVHD 
preemption. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT, A1PI, Glassia®) possesses these properties. Glassia is a 
stable, liquid, ready to use preparation of 2% human AAT that belongs to the family of serine 
protease inhibitors and is primarily produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. In addition 
to its anti-protease activity, A1PI [INVESTIGATOR_855131]- inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory 
properties19-22. 
Glassia is an injection solution prepared from pooled human plasma collected from healthy 
volunteers in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) regulations. It was approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in July 2010 for chronic 
augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with  clinically evident emphysema due to severe 
hereditary deficiency of AAT. 
The mechanism of action of AAT for GVHD is not fully understood. However, animal studies provide 
strong evidence to support AAT’s use in this se tting. GVHD results when donor T cells are primed 
against host antigens in the context of a pro-inflam matory environment (e.g., high pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and IL-6, low anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, and decreased regulatory T cell numbers). First, the administration of exogenous AAT significantly 
reduced the incidence and severity of GvHD in murine bone marrow transplant models
23,24. In one 
of these mouse GVHD models, Tawara et al showed that AAT administration before GVHD 
developed inhibited pro-inflammatory cytoki ne production, enhanced IL-10 production, and 
favorably altered regulatory T cell numbers23. These findings were confirmed in a separate murine 
study by [CONTACT_855155] a 
cell-specific manner. Specifically, AAT exposed effector T cells (which cause GVHD related tissue damage) have significantly less respi[INVESTIGATOR_855132] T-regs and DCs. These cell specific differences favor survival of i mmune cells that promote tolerance
25. Taken together, these data Figure 2: Serial monitoring  of MAGIC biomarkers  at Days [ADDRESS_1190843]‐BMT. Patients who  are low 
risk at Day 7 but high risk at Day 14 are significantly  more likely to die from non‐relapse  causes 
than patients who  are low risk at both Day [ADDRESS_1190844] em cells in an pro-tolerance, anti-inflammatory 
direction which supports its use in this trial of GVHD prevention. 
Nonclinical PK studies in rabbits treated with a si ngle bolus IV administration of AAT showed that 
the half-life of A1AT during the Phase 1 elimination was 16.3 hours; the maximum concentration, 
terminal half-life (Phase 2 half-life) and Phase 2 elimination rate constants were 42 264 ± 3443 
ng/mL, 68.13 ± 13.53 hours and 0.0046 ± 0.[ADDRESS_1190845] evaluated acute and r epeated dosing with AAT in rats and rabbits; AAT was well 
tolerated with no overt toxicities reported.  
Glassia has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adult subjects with AAT deficiency, one clinical 
study in subjects aged 9 to 18 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus and one Phase 4 clinical study 
in adult healthy volunteers. Glassia was generally safe and well tolerated in all 4 studies; the majority of adverse events (AEs) reported were of  mild or moderate severity. All serious adverse 
events (SAEs) reported in the clinical studies were assessed by [CONTACT_855156].  
The relationship between alpha-1-antitrypsin and GVHD has been examined in human studies. A 
study of 12 children with GI GVHD found a signifi cant positive correlation between more rapid GI 
clearance of AAT and severe symptoms
26. Higher donor AAT levels correlated with significantly 
less GVHD in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]25. 
One recent clinical trial tested the safety and efficacy of Glassia in 12 patients with SR- GVHD 27. 
Subjects received a loading dose of AAT of 90 mg/kg IV on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_5640] 30 or 60 
mg/kg every other day through Day 15. In the analysis, most AEs were of mild or moderate severity. 
Two subjects experienced bowel perforation [ADDRESS_1190846] concluded 
that the 2 bowel perforation events were not related to AAT, but instead were related to viral infections. One fatal case of liver failure oc curred <[ADDRESS_1190847] or ex periencing GvHD. The efficacy data from this 
study showed that 8 of the 12 subj ects had overall responses, 4 of which were CRs, and 4 of which 
were PRs. Six of the 12 subjects (50%) were alive at follow-up of up to 820 days at the time of the 
interim analysis.  
A second clinical trial tested the efficacy AAT in 26 patients with SR GVHD. Subjects received 
60mg/kg of AAT twice weekly for four weeks. A hi gh overall response rate (CR+PR) of 62% at four 
weeks was reported
28. Taken together, the preclinical and clin ical data demonstrate that AAT has 
a favorable safety profile and is potenti ally beneficial as a treatment for GVHD. 
The AAT dosing for this study (90 mg/kg loading dose followed by 45 mg/kg twice weekly) is similar to the two dosing regimens used for SR-GVHD. No rmal AAT levels in adults are 150-200 mg/dL, 
which is the equivalent of a total circulating amou nt of AAT of 7.5-10 gr based on typi[INVESTIGATOR_855133]. Given the half-life of AAT (approximate ly five days) the dosing regimen in this study 
should increase plasma levels  of AAT to 1.[ADDRESS_1190848]. This proof of co ncept pi[INVESTIGATOR_855134].

Study Schema 
Figure 3: Study Schema 

[ADDRESS_1190858] (see Appendix). Patients will be recruited from centers participati ng in the Mount Sinai 
Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) where the procedures for obtaining screening 
samples for biomarker scoring are already established.  
The pre-screening process is outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_1190859] (+/- 1 day) and shipped priority overnight 
to the Mount Sinai GVHD laboratory for early AM arrival ( see MAGIC Sample Collection and 
Storage manual for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585] ). Samples can be received Tuesday through Saturday. 
Once received in the laboratory,  the GVHD biomarkers used to as sign the MAGIC GVHD risk score 
will be measured by [CONTACT_855160]. Processing, measuring, and confirming the ELISA assay results take 4.5 hours (range 4-6 hours). Once the MAGIC GVHD risk 
score is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ferrara (or [CONTACT_16551] in  [CONTACT_16552]’s absence), the investigator at the 
participating center will be notified of the MAGIC score by [CONTACT_855161]. 
Patients who are low risk on day 7, who have not already developed GVHD requiring systemic 
treatment, and who meet the other eligibility criteria will be re-screened on day 14 (+/- 1 day). 
Patients who were low risk on day [ADDRESS_1190860] emic treatment. Only patients with confirmed 
high MAGIC GVHD risk scores will be eligible  to enroll on the clinical trial.  
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally  managed by [CONTACT_855162]: 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by [CONTACT_855163] (DCC).  
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to confirm patient eligibility for the clinical trial. 
Confirmation of a high MAGIC GVHD risk score will be provided directly to the identified Primary 
Site contact [CONTACT_468676]. Fe rrara, [CONTACT_16551] or desi gnee. All other eligibility 
criteria will be provided by [CONTACT_16529]. After patient elig ibility has been determined, a copy 
of the completed Eligibility form will be submitted by t he requesting site to the MAGIC Data 
Coordinating Center by [CONTACT_20143] [EMAIL_281]  with local site investigator signature [CONTACT_468686].  
The MAGIC Coordinator, who acts as the regist rar, will review the submitted documents and 
process the registration.  
An email will be sent by [CONTACT_855164] r to confirm patient registration. 
Patients found to be ineligible for participat ion after being consented w ill be considered screen 
failures, and documented as such in the Screeni ng and Enrollment Log. These patients will not 
receive study treatment. 
5.[ADDRESS_1190861] falls on a Friday (day 7), who has a 
research sample shipped to the Ferrara Lab that day, will have their MAGIC GVHD risk 
13 score assigned on Saturday (day 8). Such a patient must  begin study treatment no later 
than Monday (day 10). There are no exceptions to this requirement . 
5.1.1 Alpha-1-antitrypsin (Glassia) will be supplied by [CONTACT_855165]. Each participating site 
will have a sufficient supply of alpha-1- antitrypsin on hand to begin treatment, 
additional doses will be shipped to the participating site to complete treatment. 
See section 9.[ADDRESS_1190862] of alpha-1-a nti-trypsin administer ed intravenously at a 
loading dose of 90 mg/kg (study day 0) followed by [CONTACT_855166] 45 mg/kg for 15 more doses (total of 16 doses over 8 weeks). 
5.1.3 The planned schedule of subsequent doses (M ondays and Thursdays, Tuesdays 
and Fridays, Wednesdays and Saturdays) can be adjusted as necessary so long as the time between doses is not shorter than two days or longer than four days. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1190863]. 
5.1.5 Subjects who miss more than two doses due to non-compliance will be analyzed 
for safety but considered inevaluable for efficacy assessment and replaced. 
5.1.6 GVHD Prophylaxis Medications 
Medications given for GVHD prophylaxis such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate should be continued at therapeutic doses 
(according to institutional standards) and adjusted as necessary for renal, central 
nervous system (CNS) or other toxicity us ing institutional guidelines.  This study 
allows for changes in GVHD prophylaxis medication (e.g., replacement of cyclosporine with sirolimus for management of posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome [PRES] ) as per institutional standards. The initiation of 
medications  other than AAT for the purpose of intensifying GVHD prophylaxis in 
high risk patients is prohibited. GVHD  prophylaxis medications will be tapered 
according to local institutional tapering practices. 
5.1.7 GVHD treatment 
The preliminary data for this study was generated from patients transplanted at 
multiple centers with heterogeneous GVHD treatment practices. In order to develop “real world” experience in th is study, institutional GVHD treatment 
practices are permitted unless their use is explicitly prohibited.  
Patients who develop GVHD will be treated as per institutional standards with 
systemic and non-systemic tr eatments such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_855138]-absorbable 
steroids for GI GVHD. If systemic steroi d treatment is initiated the recommended 
starting dose is prednisone 2 mg/kg/day . Centers may use a starting dose of 2 
mg/kg of methylprednisolone if that is their institutional practice.  Additional agents 
for the purpose of treating GVHD (e.g., etanercept, extracorporeal photopheresis, 
ATG) are not allowed. The initiation of systemic GVHD treatment beyond 
continuation or adjustment of GVHD prophyla xis medications (see section 5.1.6) 
and corticosteroids will be considered the initiation of second line GVHD treatment 
and considered a treatment failure. Study treatment with alpha-1-antitrypsin 
continues during GVHD treatment until all [ADDRESS_1190864].  
14 GVHD treatment will be tapered according to  local institutional tapering practices. 
A recommended taper is provided in the appendices.  
5.1.8 Ancillary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_855139]/supportive care measures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti-motility 
agents for diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging, or prevent 
hepatic transplant complications is allowed according to institutional guidelines  
5.1.9 Supportive Care Guidelines 
All patients should receive the following: 
Transfusion support per institutional practice
Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes virus is required but otherwiseinstitutional practice can be followed.
Anti-infective prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci , bacterial and
fungal infections according to standard institutional guidelines.
Pre-emptive monitoring and treatment for CMV infections is required but
otherwise institutional practice can be followed .
5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each 
patient will be assessed for t he development of toxicity acco rding to the Time and Events 
Table (Section 6.4). Toxicity will be assess ed according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  
The dose of Glassia will not be modified. In the event of a SAE causally related to study 
drug, Glassia should be discontinued and the patient will be included in all analyses of 
safety and efficacy. 
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
Concomitant use of other investigational agent s is not permitted during the treatment phase 
of the study without PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473].

5.5 Duration of Therapy 
The duration of protocol therapy on this study is eight weeks (16 doses). Protocol therapy will end after the 16
th dose of alpha-1-antitrypsin has been administered or if any of the 
following criteria apply: 
Patient voluntarily withdraws from  treatment OR
General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator OR
Ten weeks has elapsed since the first dose of AAT
5.[ADDRESS_1190866] 8 weeks of participation (i.e., th rough the last dose of alpha-1-antitrypsin), 
patients will be seen twice weekly for study drug administration. GVHD staging should be 
performed approximately weekly through day [ADDRESS_1190867], or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study will be documented and may include:  
5.8.1 Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow-up); 
5.8.2 Loss of ability to freely provide co nsent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment;  
5.8.3 Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements; 
5.8.[ADDRESS_1190868] has any disorder or condition that in the investigator's judgment may 
impede the participant's participation in t he study, pose increased risk to the 
participant, or confound the results of the study 
5.8.5 Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a 
serious adverse event); 
5.8.6 Termination of the study;  
5.8.7 Patient completes protocol treatment and follow-up criteria. 
The informed consent documents will emphasi ze the importance of collecting outcome 
data from individuals who choose to di scontinue treatment during the study, and 
participants will be encouraged to provide this in formation whether or not they complete 
the anticipated course of study treatment. 
5.9 Patient Replacement 
Patients who enroll in the study but do not re ceive any study treatment will be replaced. 
Patients who initiate study treatment but mi ss more than two doses due to non-compliance 
will also be replaced. The number of patients and reason(s) for replacement will be 
recorded and will be used to assess the feasibility of the study design. 
16 6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1 Screening/Baseline Procedures 
Assessments performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this study will be done only after 
obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to 
determine study eligibility) may be used for baseli ne values even if the studies were done before 
informed consent was obtained. Frequent monitoring of  clinical chemistry and hematology is routine 
in HCT patients. This study does not require spec ific laboratory monitoring other than specified 
below. 
The screening procedures include:  
6.1.1 Informed Consent (informed consent can be obtained any time up to Day [ADDRESS_1190869]). 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1190870] eligibility criteria (Eligibility criteria mu st be assess ed between 
days 4-[ADDRESS_1190871]).  
6.1.4 Review concomitant medications (immunosuppressants and GVHD prophylaxis 
medications only) 
6.1.5 Adverse event assessment Baseline adverse events will be assess ed and preexisting co nditions will be 
recorded. See Section 8.0 for Adverse Event monitoring and reporting. 
6.1.6 Serum chemistries (within 3 days prior to enrollment) ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, and total bilirubin are required for assessment of exclusion 
criteria within [ADDRESS_1190872] 8 weeks of participation (i.e., th rough the last dose of alpha-1-antitrypsin), 
patients will be seen twice weekly for study drug administration. GVHD staging should be

significantly impacts on performance status  as determined by [CONTACT_1963]
Comprehensive GVHD staging guidance is provided in the MAGIC GVHD Staging Guidance.
Overall Clinical Grade: 
Grade 0 No stage 1-4 of any organ 
Grade I  Stage 1-2 skin and no liver or GI involvement Grade II Stage 3 skin and/or Stage 1 liver and/or Stage 1 GI 
Grade III Stage 0-3 skin with Stage 2-3 liver and/or Stage 2-3 GI 
Grade IV Stage 4 in any target organ (skin, liver, GI) 
7.1 ENDPOINT AND RESPONSE CRITERIA 
7.1.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for response: Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AAT will be assessed 
from the initiation of the first AAT treatment 
Complete Response (CR): All evaluable organs (skin, liver, GI tract) stage 0. For 
a response to be scored as CR on day 28, the patient must be in CR on that day 
and have had no intervening additional GVHD therapy. Partial Response (PR): An improvement in one or more organ involved with GVHD 
symptoms without worsening in others. For a response to be scored as PR on day 
28, the patient must be in PR on that day and have had no intervening additional 
GVHD therapy. 
No response (NR): All responses that ar e not CR or PR. Patients who receive any 
systemic GVHD therapy other than the continuation or modification of GVHD 
prophylaxis, systemic steroids, and topi [INVESTIGATOR_2855]/non-absorbable oral steroid therapy, 
will be scored as NR on day 28 regardless of organ staging.  
7.1.2 Proportion of CR and CR+PR 
CR and PR on day 28 are scored in comp arison to the patient’s acute GVHD 
staging on the day systemic steroid treatment began. 
19 7.1.3 Steroid refractory GVHD 
Patients who are scored as no response on day 28 of systemic steroid treatment 
for GVHD or who receive additional systemic immunosuppression prior to day 28 
(i.e., no response) will be considered steroid refractory. Escalati on of steroid doses 
during treatment for GVHD are not considered in the definition of steroid refractory 
GVHD. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1190877] line of  GVHD treatment. Any additional systemic 
immunosuppression treatm ent to steroid therapy for acute GVHD will be 
considered 2nd line therapy and considered a failure to respond to steroid 
treatment. Resumption or changes in GVHD prophylaxis (e.g., substitution of 
mycophenolate for tacrolimus due to PRES) are not considered new lines of therapy. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_468645]-absorbable oral steroids are not considered new 
lines of therapy. 
7.1.6 Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM) 
Any death that occurs after HCT not attributable to relapse of the underlying 
disease will be considered a non-relapse death. 
7.1.7 Chronic GVHD  
The occurrence of chronic GVHD as defi ned by [CONTACT_468680], including date of diagnosis, will be recorded.  
7.1.8 Relapse  
Relapse, including date of relapse, of the underlying malignancy will be recorded.

Jakob disease (vCJD) and theoretically, t he Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.  
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll 
in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected from the 
time of the initial study treatment (day 0) through  [ADDRESS_1190882] also be reported.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed  until:
Resolution or the symptoms or signs t hat constitute the serious adverse even t
return to baseline;
There is satisfactory explanation othe r than the study treatment for the changes
observed; o r
Death.
The investigator is responsible for the dete ction, documentation, grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_855141]. 
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study treatment administration is considered to be pre-existing in nature. Any known pre-existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study  entry should be considered medical history. 
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE (CTCAE grade 3 or higher) or SAE, 
as defined in Section 8.3, occurring from the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_1190883] be 
recorded as an adverse event in the pat ient’s source documents and on the CRF.  
8.3 Definitions 
8.3.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether  or not related to the intervention.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive (i.e., surgic al)
procedures will not be reported as ad verse events. However, the medical
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets
22 the definition of an adverse event unless it  is a pre-existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition. 
Event reporting for GVHD treatme nt protocols can be complicated and
confusing for investigators, data managers, and regulatory oversight bodies
because patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_855142]. Furthermore, transplant-
related complications often occur both simultaneously and in series, as on e
complication leads to a series of downstream events. Therefore, a well-conceived event reporting plan separa tes background transplant and GVHD
noise as might be seen with any transplant where GVHD develops from studyrelated event s that are relevant to pati ent safety. On this study, we will not
report CTCAE grade 1 and 2 adverse events (which make up the majority of
events) unless the investi gator determines the event should be reported to
protect subject safety.
It is common for HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_855143].
Symptoms of the original or targeted disease are not to be considered adverse
events for this study exc ept that all BMT CTN grade 3 infections will be
reported (see Appendix B). Symptoms rela ted to the conditioning regimen or
GVHD will not be reported unless the event is serious (see section 8.3.2) and
considered by [CONTACT_855168], probably, or definitely related to
AAT. Events that are unlikely or unrelated to AAT are not required to be
reported. Reporting of such events should include the investigator ’s
assessment as to whether the event s hould be attributed to any of the HCT
procedure itself, GVHD, exposure to immunosuppressive agents other than
AAT, and AAT. An event may be attributable to all, some, or one of thesecategories .
Abnormal laboratory values or test re sults constitute adverse events only if
they induce clinical signs or symptoms  or require therapy and otherwise meet
the criteria for a reportable adverse ev ent as defined above. They are to be
captured under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.
8.3.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
oDeath
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be
reported as event (SAE) itself.
oA life-threatening adverse eventAn adverse event is considered ‘life-thr eatening’ if, in the view of either the
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of
death. It does not include an adverse event  that, had it occurred in a more
severe form, might have caused death.
oInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834897] ≥[ADDRESS_1190884] normal life functions
23 oA congenital anomaly/birth defect
oImportant medical event
Any event that may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medicalor surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed in this definition
of “Serious Adverse Event”. Examples of such medical events incl ude allergic
bronchospasm requiring intensive trea tment in an emergen cy room or at
home; convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855144].
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855145]’s medical history at 
the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a prec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for 
the administration of study therapy or other protocol-required procedure) should not be considered SAEs. However, if t he preexisting condition worsened during 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE. 
8.3.3 Expected Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events are
described in the approved Package Insert (Lab el).
For investigational new drugs or  devices, those ad verse events are
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.
In clinical research studies, info rmation on expected adverse events is
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See
section 9.[ADDRESS_1190885] of expected adv erse events related to the drug unde r
study.
8.3.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unex pected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the 
protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event Characteristics 
8.4.1 CTCAE Term 
(AE description) and grade: The descripti ons and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1190886] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy  of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web si te. (http://ctep.cancer.gov)
 
8.4.2 Attribution of the AE 
The investigator or co-investigator is re sponsible for assignment of attribution. 
Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment. 
24 Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.

8.5.4 All Serious Adverse Ev ents whether expected or une xpected and possibly related 
(definite, probable or possible) to study  treatment administration will be reported 
using the Serious Adverse Event form with in [ADDRESS_1190891] awareness of the event 
to the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center. A copy of the form should be sent to the 
MAGIC Coordinator via email to [EMAIL_281] . 
The MAGIC Data Coordi nating Center 
will disseminate information regarding 
serious adverse events to the participati ng sites within [ADDRESS_1190892]. Levine only in the case t hat the event(s) is believed to be related 
(i.e. probably or definitely) to the study  medication. All other Serious Adverse 
Events will be discussed on monthly webina rs held with all pa rticipating centers 
(see section 12). 
25 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_855146], as appropriate and defined in the regulations under 21 CFR 
312.32.  
8.6 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems 
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experienc e, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an una nticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others, 
the investigator should assess whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem. The incident, experience or outcomes are considered unanticipated 
if it meets all of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (not previously  documented in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);
2. Causally related or possibly related to participation in the study; and
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at  a greater risk of harm than
was previously known or recognized.
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must r eport it to the MAGIC Data Coordinating 
Center within [ADDRESS_1190893] awareness of t he events, and to the local IRB as per local IRB 
policy. 
8.7 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_855147]-1-antitrypsin is generally safe, its use as a pre-emptive therapy for acute 
GVHD has not been previously studied. We will continuously monitor the incidence of BMT

are based on methods described in Chapter 12 of Jennison and Turnbull (2000)30 and in 
the illustrative paper by [CONTACT_429802], Qaquish and Schell31. 
26 An enrollment rule to prevent an excessive num ber of toxicities as described in Song and 
Ivanova32 will be used to inform us of the number of additional patients we can recruit when 
the current patient has not yet completed cycle 1. Formally, the trial can enroll m new 
patients such that r + x + m ≤bn+m, r + x + m– 1 < b n+m−1, and n + m ≤ K where r is defined 
as the number of patients that have not completed follow-up and are still being followed for 
toxicity; x  is the number of patients that  have experienced toxicity and n is the total number 
of patients enrolled to date. This enrollment rule is conservative in that it assumes the worst 
case scenario, that every patient in the fo llow-up will experience a dose-limiting toxicity. 
The study may also be stopped based on the re commendation of the investigators, the TCI 
DSMC, or at Kamada’s discretion for any reason.   
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN (AAT, AAT, A1PI) 
Commercial names for the drug: GLASSIA®
Classifi cation
 - type of agent: Human Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor
Description:  AAT (Glassia) is supplied as contains a single use vial containing
approximately
1 gram of functional Alpha1-PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] 50 mL of solution and a sterile filter needle
Mode of action: The mode of action of AAT in graft-versus-host disease is not wellunderstood, but appears to be related to it s anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and
immunomodulatory properties
19-22.
Pharmacokinetics: A prospective, open-label, uncontrolled multicenter
pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 7 females and 11 males with congenital Alpha-
1 antitrypsin deficiency, ranging in age from 40 to 69 years. Subjects received a singl e
dose of GLASSIA either 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg. Blood samples for
pharmacokinetic study were taken prior to and within 5 minutes of completion of the
infusion, and then at 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 day s  and 7 days. The
mean results for  pharmacokinetic paramet ers in the 60 mg/kg dosage group are
shown in the Table. The  pharmacokinetics of  GLASSIA were linear over the dose
range of 30-120 mg/kg.
Pharmacokinetic Parameter  60 mg/kg Dose Group
Terminal Half-Life (h) * 111 ± 33 
Area under the curve 0-168 hrs (mg·hmL) 89 ± 10 
Clearance (mL/h/kg)  0.68 ± 0.1 
Volume of Distribution (L) 3.2 ± 0.3 
Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reac tions (>0.5% of infusions) in clinical
trials were headache and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].
GLASSIA may contain trace amounts of IgA. Patients with known antibodies to IgA,
which can be present in patients with selectiv e or severe IgA deficiency, have a greater
risk of develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_855149] s.
Because this product is made from human pl asma, it may carry a risk of transmitting
27 infectious agents, such as viruses, the va riant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and 
theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This also applies to unknown 
or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been minimized by [CONTACT_285053], 
by [CONTACT_855169]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], 
such products may still potentially transmit human pathogenic agents. 
Drug Interactions: Alpha-1-antitrypsin ma y interact with immunosuppressant agents
and increase the risk of infection.
Storage and stability: GLASSIA must be refr igerated between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to
46°F). Do not freeze. Product may be stored at room temperatures not exceeding 25°C
(77°F) for up to one month. Once removed from refrigeration use within one month.
Preparation:1. Use aseptic technique.
2. Allow the product to reach room temperature prior to infusing and administer
within thre e hours of entering the vials.
3. Inspect the vial of GLASSIA. The solu tion should be clear and colorless to
yellow-green and may contain a few protein par ticles. Do not use if the product is
cloudy.
4. The product is suitable for infusion directly from the vial or pooled into a sterile
container for intravenous infusion.
5. For pooling the product, use a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (not supplied) to withdraw the
solution from the vial and then use the supplied 5 micron filter needle to transfer
the solution into the intravenous infusion container. NOTE: Do not use the 5micron filter needle to withdraw GLASSIA from the vial.
Administration:
For intravenous infusion only.
GLASSIA should be administered by a healthcare  professional or self-administered
by [CONTACT_102]/caregiver after appropriate training. For self-adminis tration, provide the
patient/ca regiver with detailed instructions and adequate training for infusion  in the
home or other appropriate setting.
1. Use aseptic technique.
2. Inspect parenteral products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior
to administration whenever solution and container permit.
3. Administer GLASSIA alone. Do not mix wi th other agents or diluting solutions.
4. When infusing directly from the vial s, use a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (not supplied). If the
contents of vials have been pooled to a sterile intravenous container, use an
appropriate intravenous administration set.
5. Always use a 5 micron in-line filter (not supplied) during infusion.6. Administer GLASSIA within three hour s of entering the vials to avoid the
potential ill effect of any inadve rtent microbial contamination.
7. Administer GLASSIA at room temper ature through an appr opriate intravenous
administration set at a rate not to exceed 0.2 mL/kg body weight per minute,
and as determined by [CONTACT_855170].
8. The recommended dosage of 90 mg/kg at a rate of 0.2 mL/kg/min will take
approximately 22 minutes to infuse and dosage of 45 mg/kg will take [ADDRESS_1190895] all open vials, unused solution and
administration equipment.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints 
This is a proof of concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_855150], open label multicenter clinical trial. The primary 
study measure of effica cy is the incidence of steroid- refractory GVHD by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_1190897]. GVHD is defined as steroid refractory if CR or PR is not achieved by [CONTACT_4475] 28 of 
systemic steroid treatment OR if additional immunosuppres sion beyond steroids was given 
for treatment of GVHD prior to 28 days of ster oid treatment.  Subjects  who start treatment 
for GVHD within 28 days of Day 100 (i.e., on or after Day [ADDRESS_1190898]) must be followed for a full [ADDRESS_1190899] improvements in the incidenc e of steroid refractory GVHD to translate 
into better long-term outcomes, secondary endpoints include 6 month NRM and 6 months 
overall survival.  Additional secondary endpoints re lated to efficacy will include, in subjects 
who develop GVHD, time to discontinuation of steroid therapy, number of lines of GVHD 
therapy, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Secondary endpoints related to safety 
include 6 month and 1 year relapse rates and incidence of serious (BMT CTN grade 3) 
infections by [CONTACT_4475] 100.  
The historical control population for this study consists of patients who met the criteria for 
a high MAGIC GVHD risk score at either day 7 and 14 (see Background). 
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
This is a proof of concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_855151]- emptive treatment with AAT. The expected 
incidence of steroid refractory GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 in patients who are high risk at either day 
7 or 14 is 28%. We assume that the incidence of steroid refr actory GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 
among high risk patients treated pre-emptiv ely will be 15% as a clinically meaningful 
incidence. Based on this assumption, a sample size of 30 achieves 85% power to detect a 13% improvement (28%-15%) in steroid refractory incidence rate using a one-sided exact 
test with a target significance level of 0.23. It is suggested in the literature that in pi[INVESTIGATOR_30274], false positive rates up to 0.25 could be used as those studies are not designed to 
provide definite evidence but are designed to provide guidance to whether a larger study 
should be conducted
33. If we observe 6 or fe wer cases of SR GVHD, we will consider this 
approach sufficiently promising to warrant further study. 
Sample size calculations were computed using the binomial enumeration of all possible 
outcomes method in PASS 14 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2015) NCSS, 
LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003],  ncss.com/software/pass. 
The five centers participating in this clinical  trial collectively perform >[ADDRESS_1190900] 
per year, of whom >90% should meet the eligibility criteria for this trial. We will need to screen approximately [ADDRESS_1190901] eroids by [CONTACT_4475] 28 of treatment, or initiation of additional 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD will be considered failures for this 
30 endpoint. The incidence of steroid-refractory GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 in the study patients will 
be compared to the historical control rate of 28%. 
Secondary outcomes such as the overall response rate (CR+PR), the incidence of severe 
GI GVHD (stage 3 or 4), non-relapse mortality,  relapse rates, overall survival, will be 
estimated and compared to historical controls.  
Continuous variables will be summarized usin g standard summary statistics such as 
number of observations (n), mean, stand ard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum 
values, median, and 1st and 3rd quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency tables as counts and percentages. 
Cumulative incidence of non-relapse morta lity will be estimated by [INVESTIGATOR_217153]’s method and 
relapse will be consider ed as a competing risk
34. Disease free and overall survival, 
defined as the time from the transplantation to  death or to last follow-up if alive, will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_455355]-Meier and the probability curves and 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided based on the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley35. 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
The safety of subjects is paramount and supersedes  all other concerns. This study employs several 
layers of oversight to ensure that  patient safety is protected.  
1. The local Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at each site which will be responsible
for monthly reviews of patient data at each site
2. The Protocol Data and Safety Monitoring Co mmittee (DSMC), composed of the individual site
PI’s which will review all facets of study conduct at all sites on monthly webinars
3. The Tisch Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (TCI DSMC) of the Mount
Sinai Health System is the DSMB of record fo r this study. The DSMB will be compliant with the
NIH approved DSMP Charte r. This committee will be responsi ble for monitoring the safety and
data integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely composed of members with no connection to this
clinical trial.
4. Annual reviews and safety reporting will be provided to the IRBs at each participating site,  the
Mount Sinai Health System, and the FDA as r equired by [CONTACT_16539] (21 CFR 312.3).
Protocol DSMC: The centers participating in this study are collaborating centers in MAGIC (Mount 
Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium). The local site principal investigator, data manager, 
and study coordinator participates in monthly w ebinars where all facets of study conduct are 
discussed, thereby [CONTACT_16542]. 
The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center is responsi ble for collating all data and safety reports from 
all the participating sites, and providing the in formation to the TCI Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee. 
TCI DSMC: The TCI DSMC serves as the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) for investigator 
initiated studies conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_16513] (TCI) at the Mount 
Sinai Health System. It is compliant with the Nati onal Institutes of Heal th and National Cancer 
Institute charter for DSMBs. This board will be responsible for monitoring the safety and data 
integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely compos ed of members with no connection to this clinical 
trial. 
31 12.1 Multisite Clinical Monitoring Procedures 
This clinical study will be coordinated by t he MAGIC Data Coordina ting Center (DCC) of 
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. As  such it will be conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles that are consist ent with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in 
compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements. 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site  will undergo a site initiation meeting to be 
conducted by [CONTACT_15791]. This will be done as an actual site visit, teleconference, 
videoconference, or web-based meeting after the site has been given access to the study database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53465]/her study staff should make every effort in attending the site initiation meeting. Study-
related questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed-up by [CONTACT_16544]. 
This study will be monitored by a representative of the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center. Monitoring visits, whether remote or in pers on, will be made during the conduct of the study 
and at study close-out. The following issues will be monitored. 
 Signed and dated ICF
 Adherence to the protocol
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and laboratory samples collection
 Proper storage, dispensing and invent ory control of investigational drug
 Compliance with state and local regulat ions
Any issues identified during these visits w ill be communicated to the site and are expected 
to be corrected by [CONTACT_16547] a timely manner.  For review of study-related documents at 
the DCC, the site will be require d to ship, fax, or email documents to be reviewed, ensuring 
compliance with HIPAA and ot her privacy regulations.  
Participating sites will also undergo a site  close-out upon completion, termination or 
cancellation of a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during  the conduct of the 
study, and that the site Investigator is aware of  his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, 
a site close-out is conducted during a site visit; however, site close-out can occur without a site visit if all of the following apply: 
 No patient has signed the Informed Consent  Form and has enrolled into the stud y
 Investigational agent has not been dispensed
 All investigational agent and materials have been returned as defined for the study
or destroyed and accounted for properly .
13.[ADDRESS_1190902] a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies 
a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study-r elated issues. A “for cause” audit would be 
conducted by [CONTACT_468683]. 
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an in spection has been requested by a regulatory 
authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center that 
such a request has been made.

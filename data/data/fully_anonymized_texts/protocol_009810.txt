2. Device Information  
2.1. Principle of Operation  
The emPOWER  Ankle , a Class II exempt  device (in accordance with 21 CFR 890.3500, which 
does not require pre -market notification per section 510(k) ), represents the first significant 
redesign of the BiOM Ankle. The Ankle is a commercially -available prosthetic  device that 
restores ankle po wer across  all walking speeds [1 -3].  This emulation is achieved through three 
technologically -novel functionalities. First, the ankle  provides late -stance  powered assist  [2-4].  
Second, the device  provides stiffness  modulation  after heel strike, which decelerates the body 
and thereby [CONTACT_563402].  Finally, the device  is adjusted with personal bionic tuning , in 
which  ankle stiffness and power levels are personalized for each user, enabling the user to walk 
within normal biologic ranges  [2, 3]. 
 
The ankle  optimizes ankle stiffness a nd power through user-specific settings using a quantitative 
treatment paradigm in which  its dynamic response is adjusted to provide biologically -normal 
ankle behaviors [ 2, 3], removing the subjective and qualitative nature of current prosthetic user 
evalu ations and fittings.  As shown in Section  2.2, the emPOWER  Ankle  was designed with both 
passive and actively powered components in order to emulate biological function throughout the 
gait cycle.  The device continuously modulates ankle stiffness, spring equilibrium and propulsive 
torque throughout a walking gait cycle [ 2, 5-11].  Computers and sensors that operate biomimetic 
control firmware guide the device ’s performance.   The processors are able to adjust the ankle’s 
stiffness, spring equilibria,  and propulsive torque [ADDRESS_740202] 
with changes in both walking velocity and ground inclination [7,8].  During personal bionic 
tuning, ankle stiffness and the magnitude and timing of power as sist are measured directly from 
sensors within the prosthesis and then adjusted to match the performance of a biological ankle.  
Thus, with appropriate tuning of the prosthesis, the walking gait of the user dynamically 
emulates the walking gait of a non -amputee user across the full range of walking velocities [ 1-3].

Sites will keep a log that notes the subject’s name [CONTACT_563421].  All case report forms ( CRFs ) will be tracked, evaluated, and stored using only the 
subject ID number  and initials .  No personal other identifying information will be included on 
the CRFs . 
 
The ICF will notify subjects that study monitors, auditors, and representatives of government 
agencies will have access to personal identifying information to ensure that data reported on the 
CRFs corresponds to the person who signed the ICF and the information contained in the source 
documentation.  
9.4. Phase I : 1st Visit - Baseline   
For each of the enrolled  subjects, characteristics at the time of the procedure  including : age, sex, 
weight, amputation side(s) and amputation type(s) , medical history  will be recorded.  At day of

size and category carbon fiber foot, alignment, and tuning in accordance with the emPOWER  
Instructions For Use (IFU) .  The prosthetist will make a determination that the tuning was 
successful (within th e bounds specified by [CONTACT_563404]) and the Investigator will maintain a copy of 
the Tuning Record.  This initial Tuning Record may also be used to verify that the subject has the 
ability to walk at a self-selected walking speed (SSWS)  > 0.75 meters per second  with the 
current prosthesis  and can walk with variable cadence , where vari able cadence is defined as three 
distinguishable walking speeds with a minimum SSWS of 0.75 m/s (one below SSWS, and one 
above SSWS) on the Tuning record.  Distinguishable will be def ined as no overlap between the 
three (3) primary step groupi[INVESTIGATOR_563393].  
 
At fitting of the emPOWER  Ankle, the Investigator will instruct the subject to utilize the device 
for a 16-day period of time, within the intended and foreseeable  range of use (e.g. – ramps, stairs, 
limited running or jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], steppi[INVESTIGATOR_563394], etc .).  In addition, the investigator will take the 
subject though a series of default operating conditions of the emPOWE R Ankle in the clinic 
setting such as with the power turned off. 
  
Each subject will take  the emPOWER  Ankle  (including batteries and charger) home for 16 days 
(to ensure 14 full days of step counts) of use in everyday life situations.  The subject will not be 
under the observation of the Investigator during this take home period.  During the at home 
portion of the study, subjects will continue to monitor daily steps with use of a Fitbit® One™  
during the  time that they  are wearing the emPOWER  Ankle . Subjects will also maintain an 
Activities of Daily Living Diary during the take home evaluation portion of the study. This Diary 
will allow subjects to note specific activity changes due to the emPOWER  Ankle and serve as a 
log for recording any falls.  
 
As a quality check, the  steps on the emPOWER  Ankle , as recorded in the emPOWER  Tuning 
Records, will also be recorded at baseline and at follow -up.

10.  Study Assessments  
10.1. Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP)  
The AMP is an instrument designed to measure ambulatory potential of lower -limb amputees 
[13]. Subjects begin the test seated in a hard chair with ar ms and are tested for a total of 21 items 
assessing abilities of increasing level of difficulty. Abilities assessed include sitting balance, 
transfer from chair to chair, standing balance, gait quality, negotiating obstacles, and the use of 
assistive devic es. The total score range for the AMP is 0 to 47 points. A minimal detectable 
change of 3.4 points has been reported [14].  
10.2. 12-Minute  Walk Test  (and [ADDRESS_740223])  (12MWT & 6 MWT) 
The walking test is a validated performance test used to measure gait sp eed and aerobic 
capacity/endurance. The distance that the patient is able to walk in [ADDRESS_740224], to determine the pain -free walking distance. Assistive devise may be used, but 
should be recorded and consistent between tests. Minimally clinically important differences 
(MCID) have not yet been reported for amputees, but for patients with inco mplete spi[INVESTIGATOR_105538] (36 m ) [15] and stroke (34.4 m ) [16]. Generally in rehabilitation, increases in walking 
speed of 0.1 m/s or more, which would equal an increase in walking distance of 36 m or more in 
the 6 MWT, are co nsidered clinically meaningful [17-19].  The distance a subject ca n walk after  
[ADDRESS_740225]’s passive 
prosthesis .  
 
The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) score will also be recorded  at 6 and 12 minutes 
and assessment of pain -free walking distance for sound and residual knee and hip, low back pain 
for subjects that report such pain during the 12 minWT . The RPE measures the perceived 
intensity of physical activities on a visual analogue scale and provides a good estimate of the 
actual heart rate during ph ysical activity and is correlated with lactate levels , %VO 2max, and 
breathing rate s in athletes [20]. 
 
10.3. 10-Meter Walk Test  (10MWT) 
The walking test is a validated test used to measure gait speed. When available, data will be 
collected for the walking tests. Subjects are often allowed the use of walking aids (such as a 
cane, crutches or hemi -walker) th at they normally use in home or community ambulation. In 
addition to the time to complete the test, the use of walking aids, the distance of the walk test and 
the use of footwear (e.g. barefoot or with shoes) will be recorded.  
10.4. L-Test 
The L -Test is a timed 20-meter test of basic mobility skills that includes [ADDRESS_740226]’s usual walking speed . This test is a modified version of the Timed Up and Go Test 
designed for people with lower limb amputations. The test i s measured by [CONTACT_563407] a 
subject to stand from an armless chair, walk 10  meters  (in the shape of an L) at the subject’s 
usual walking speed, turn 180 degrees, and return 10  meters  (in the shape of an L) back to a 
seated position in the same c hair [21]. The L -test was selected, since it measures overall 
functional mobility risk and fall and is validated for the amputee population.   The t ime to

prosthesis . 
 
10.5. Ramp  Tests (Ascent and Descent)  
The ramp ascent test is a t imed performance test of walking up a 25 -foot ramp with 5 degree incline 
and an outdoor hill (length and inclination/grade to be determined) .   The ramp ascent time with the 
emPOWER Ankle will b e compared to  the time on the subject’s passive prosthesis followed by [CONTACT_563408].   The Hill Assessment Index is a n instrument to measure the quality  of the 
subject’s gait during ramp ambulation.  
 
The ramp decent test is a t imed performance test of walking down a 25 -foot ramp with 5 degree 
incline and an outdoor hill (length and inclination/grade to be determined) .  The ramp decent time  
with the emPOWER Ankle will be compared to the time on the subject’s passive prosthesis 
followed by [CONTACT_563409] -perceived control of 
walking speed.  
 
10.6. Activities -Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale  
The ABC Scale [22] is a self -administered questionnaire that asks the patient to rate his or her 
confidence in performing various  ambulatory activities on a scale from 0% (no confidence) to 
100% (complete confidence) without losing balance or becoming unsteady. Scores for ea ch of 
the 16 items will be collected and an average percentage calculated, with scores <67 indicating 
an increased risk of falling [23]. The scores  on the ABC with the emPOWER Ankle will be 
compared to the subject’s passive prosthesis.  
 
10.7. Falls Efficacy Scal e 
The Falls Efficacy Scale is a validated 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess 
confidence in the ability to perform 10 activities of daily living  without falling as an indicator of 
how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance. Eac h item is rated from 1 ("very 
confident") to 10 ("not confident at all"), and the per item ratings are added to generate a 
summary total score (10 to 100). Lower scores indicate more confidence and higher scores 
indicate lack of confidence and greater fear  of falling .  It has been validated for use in the elderly 
[24] and persons with amputations [2 5]. Scores  ≥70 indicate an increased fear of falling.  [24, 25]  
 
10.8. Prosthetic Limb Users Survey -M (PLUS -M) 
The PLUS -M is a valid and reliable self -reported measure for the mobility of adults with lower 
limb amputations. PLUS -M asks about the patient’s ability to perform simple and complex tasks. 
This questionnaire is asking about the current timeframe for the p atient. High PLUS -M scores 
correspond with greater mobility [26]. The scores  on the PLUS -M with the emPOWER Ankle 
will be compared to the scores on the subject’s passive prosthesis.  
 
10.9. PROMIS Instruments  
PROMIS item banks and their short forms are a reliable and precise measurements of patient 
reported outcome measures [27]. For this study, the following instruments will be used: the 
PROMIS Physical Function (Custom), the PROMIS Global Health Short Form, the PROMIS 
Fatigue Short Form (7a), and The PRO MIS Pain Intensity Short Form (3a).   The scores  on the 
 
Otto Bock HealthCare LP                                                  Confidential                                                                                     Page [ADDRESS_740228]’s 
passive prosthesis.  
 
10.10.  Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)  
The PSFS [28] is a self -report measure aimed at identifying functional status limitations that are 
most relevant to individual patients. The PSFS is a reliable, valid, and efficient measure for 
detecting clinical change in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction [29]. Patients will 
be asked to i dentify three to five activities that they are having difficulty or are unable to perform 
because of their injury/condition. For the specified activities, patients will then be asked to rate 
their ability to perform each activity at that time (0 -10 numeric al scale) with ‘0’ being unable to 
perform the activity, and ‘10’ being able to perform the activity at the same level as they could 
prior to the injury/condition. The scores  on the PSFS instruments with the emPOWER Ankle 
will be compared to the scores on the subject’s passive prosthesis.  
  
10.11.  Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)  
The NPRS is a valid and reliable measure of pain that may be used across all musculoskeletal 
injuries/conditions and complements the PSFS [29]. The patient will be asked to rate the pain of 
their joints, foot, lower back, and if they are using an assistive device any additional affected 
limbs on average over the last 24 hours on a scale 1 -10, with ‘1’ being ‘very mild’ and ‘10’ being 
the ‘unimaginable unspeakable’.  The scores  on the NPRS i nstruments with the emPOWER 
Ankle will be compared to the scores on the subject’s passive prosthesis.  
 
10.12.  Activity Monitoring  
An activity monitor will be worn to record the number of steps the patient takes with the 
prosthesis. The patient will return to the site with the activity monitor so that the steps counted 
can be downloaded from the device.  In addition, t he patient will be sent home with a prepaid 
envel ope and be instructed to mail back the activity monitor if the next visit will be more than [ADDRESS_740229] Diary  (Activity Monitoring ) 
Subjects will be provided with a ‘diar y’ to record a daily step -count (using the Fitbit provided), 
falls and daily activity.  Subjects will record p ositive and negative observations about the 
prosthesis performance while wearing the study devices. These observations will be reviewed 
together w ith the Investigator during the study  visits. In addition, subjects will also record in the 
diary any falls and resulting injuries.  If any of the diary entries reveal complaints or adverse 
events, these will be reported on the Adverse Event form.  
 
11. Statist ical Methods  
The study objective is to characterize the  improvement in the 6MWT with the emPOWER  Ankle 
versus the subject’s passive lower -limb prosthesis . This is  calculated as:

13.  Risk B enefit Analysis  
The emPOWER  Ankle prosthesis is designed to provide bionic propulsion, emulating the 
biological functi on of an ankle, and attaches to the wearer by a previously fit socket.  The 
benefits of bionic propulsion for the amputee (as compared to conventional prostheses) have 
been studied and published in peer -reviewed scientific journals, summarized as follows:  
a) walk with a more natural gait;

b) reduce musculoskeletal stress believed to be causal of osteoarthritis;  
c) use less energy to walk;  
d) walk at a normal preferred speed;  
e) navigate uneven terrain with less effort and greater speed.  
The device’s safety and performanc e profile has been assessed and has been found to add no 
additional risk to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_563397] -limb prosthetic ankle device.  
 
13.1.  Known and Anticipated Risks  
The emPOWER  Ankle is not expected to produce any additional or unique risks as compared to 
those already associated with existing lower -limb prostheses. The anticipated risks are 
summarized as:  
 
1. Trip / Fall Hazard : The risk of trips/falls is inherent to the lower -extremity amputee 
population based on the nature of the condition.  The emPOWER  Ankle device, by 
[CONTACT_563412], is anticipated to exhibit a lower 
incidence of trips/falls than conventional (non -microprocessor) ankle prosthe ses. 
2. Fire Hazard :  The risk of fire from the Li -ion battery which powers the emPOWER Ankle 
is minimized through design, control circuitry and compliance/testing to international 
standards.  
3. Electrocution Hazard :  The battery -powered ankle prosthetic itself does not present a risk 
of electrocution, however the AC -powered battery charger presents the same risk of 
electrocution as other 120V AC powered devices.  
 
13.2.  Risk Minimization  
The Sponsor will employ measures throughout the course of this study to minimize  risks to 
subjects choosing to participate.  All efforts will be made to minimize potential risks by:  
 
1. Selecting Principal Investigators who are experienced and skilled in fitting and aligning 
lower limb prostheses.  
2. Providing training on the equipment prio r to use  
3. Defining inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly to ensure only appropriate subjects are 
enrolled.  
4. Ensuring that the treatment of the subject is consistent with current medical practices.  
 
14.  Subject Benefit  
Subjects who demonstrate improvements using the emPOWER  Ankle compared to their passive 
prosthetic device will be offered the opportunity to continue using the emPOWER  Ankle at the 
end of the study until there is Medicare payment available for the subject to purchase a 
emPOWER  Ankle. The subject will not be to ld of this prior to study completion to avoid bias.  
All subjects will receive fair compensation  for completion of the study to cover costs of travel to 
and from the study center and for any potential lost wages due to the study visits.

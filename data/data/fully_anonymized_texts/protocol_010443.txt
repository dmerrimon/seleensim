 Study Chairpersons:  Ryotaro Nakamura, M.D. and Corey Cutler, M.D., M.P.H., F.R.C.P.(C)  
 Study Design:  This study is designed as a multicenter trial, with biological assignment  
to one of two study arms;  Arm 1 : Reduced intensity conditioning 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (RI C-alloHCT),  Arm 2: 
Non-Transplant  Therapy /Best Supportive Care . 
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective is to c ompare the three -year overall  survival ( OS) 
probabilities between two treatment  arms . 
 Secondary Objectives:  Patients will also be assessed for the following:  
1. Compare leukemia -free survival ( LFS) at 3 years from patient 
consent.  
2. Compare Quality of Life ( QOL ) measures between treatment arms  
3. Compare Cost -Effectiveness measures between treatment arms (see 
Appendix F for ancillary cost -effectiveness protocol)  
 Accrual Objective:  The trial will accrue a total  of [ADDRESS_146989] is 6:[ADDRESS_146990] is 7:3. 
 Accrual Period:   The estimated accrual period is 2.5- 3.5 years . 
 Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for three years after biological assignment;  total 
time from start of accrual will be approximately 5.5- 6.5 years.  
 Eligibility Criteria:  Patients 50-75 years of age with a history of  de novo intermediate -2 or 
high-risk myelod ysplastic syndrome (MDS) by [CONTACT_130038]  (IPSS)  with < 20% marrow blasts .  MDS 
must be of an acceptable subtype.  Patients must be considered to be 
suitable RIC alloHCT candidates at the time of initial evaluation based 
on medical history , physical examination , and available laboratory tests.   
Specific testing for organ function is not required for eligibility but, if available, these tests should be used to judge eligibility.  
 Patients and physicians must be willing to comply with treatment 
assignment :

  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_146997] of clinical urgency for researchers, clinicians , patients, and health care underwriters  such 
as Medicare,  is the  role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in the treatment 
of older patients with higher  risk myelodysplas tic syndromes  (MDS).  The use of reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC) regimens has extend ed HCT to the care of older patients with acute 
myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) and lymphoma  and a number of retrospective and phase II trials 
for patients with MDS now show the curative  potential of RI C alloHCT in selected patients .

related and unrelated donors in patients aged 50.0 to 75.0 years with high er-risk MDS.  
 1.2. Myelodysplas tic Syndrome  
 MDS is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic precursors and stem cells , which may evo lve to a 
terminal phase resembling acute leukemia.  Alternatively, patients may suffer progressive 
peripheral blood cytopenias and hematopoietic failure, eventually succumbing to complications of bleeding and infection.  The international prognostic scorin g system (IPSS) for MDS assesses  
patients’ risk for transformation and survival at the time of diagnosis and is based on analysis of bone marrow blasts, karyotype , and cytopenias .
9  Median survival for patients with low -risk 
disease is approximately 5.7 years ; it is 11.8 years for low -risk patients younger than 60.  Among 
patients with intermediate -2 disease (composite score 1.5 -2), median survival is 1.[ADDRESS_146999] where non -relapse 
mortality (NRM) rates are in the range of 20 -35%, rela ted to organ toxicity, graft -versus -host

1-2 disease ( GVHD) , and infectio ns.  Recent ly, an HCT -specific co -morbidity index has provided a 
useful guide for HCT risk assessment of HCT and can be applied to transplant ation candidates 
with a variety of disorders, including MDS .[ADDRESS_147000] is delayed until there is evidence of disease 
progression.  Optimal timing for p atients in the intermediate -1 risk category is less clear .14  A 
recent study extended a Markov decision model to elderly MDS patients and showed for de  novo 
MDS patients aged 60 –70 years with low/intermediate -1 disease, early transplantation was not the 
preferred strategy unless MDS -associated Q OL impairment was substanti al.  For i ntermediate-
2/high IPSS risk, early RIC allo HCT offered a life expectancy benefit, with quality adjusted 
survival benefit det ectable earlier .[ADDRESS_147001] compared with azacytidine  therapy in medically fit patients with 
high-risk MDS age 60- 70 years .17 
 
Conventional high dose conditioning regimens include myeloablative doses of chemotherap y 
and/or radiation.  These regimens are often poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_130040] [ADDRESS_147002] to treat MDS with two  to 
three- year overall survival  rates  ranging from 27% to 70% depending on cohort and regimen 
characteristics .1

Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), ages 50 to 74 (median 62) ; 62% received

  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147005] and 19% had therapy -related MD S.  Seventy -seven percent 
received peripheral blood stem cells, and 40% received RIC regimens.  The 100- day cumulative  
incidence of grades B -D acute GVHD was significantly lower in MRD HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_130001] 8/8 
MUD and 7/[ADDRESS_147006] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( 42%, 54%, and 57%, respectively ; p=.009).  The 
corresponding adjusted three -year disease free survival (DFS)/survival estimates were 40%/47% 
for MRD, 35%/38% for 8/8 MUD, and 29%/31% for 7/[ADDRESS_147007] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  In multivariate 
analysis, adjusting for patient -related (age, gender, KPS), disease- related (IPSS stage at diagnosis, 
WBC count at diagnosis, therapy -related MDS, and disease status at HCT), and HCT -related 
variables (time between diagnosis and HCT, donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_130002] m atch, graft type, 
conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens), 8/[ADDRESS_147008] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (relative risk [ RR] 1.11 (95% confidence 
intervals [CI] 0.89- 1.39) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.98 -1.56), respecti vely).  7/[ADDRESS_147009] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.08 -1.91)

1.65) and 1.30 (95% CI 1.01- 1.68), respe ctively).  Differences in outcome were largely related to 
excess TRM (RR 1.37 and 1.71 for 8/8 MUD and 7/8 MUD respectively, p < 0.05 for both 
comparisons).  Unrelated donor status or mismatch was not associated with less relapse (overall p 
value=0.33).  I n patients with MDS, transplantation from 8/[ADDRESS_147011] donors produce 
simila r survival;  however, 7/[ADDRESS_147012] is associated with inferior outcomes .21 
 
1.4. Hypomethylating Therapy for Treatment of MDS  
 
Azacytidine (5-azacytidine) and decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxy cytidine) are two hypomethylating 
agents approved by [CONTACT_130041].  The rationale for 
hypomethylation therapy is the observation that aberrant DNA methylation is frequently seen in 
patients with MDS.  These drugs indirectly deplete methylcytosine and cause hypomethylation of 
target gene promoters involved in disease initiation or progression, making them appropriate targets for pharmacologic therapy.  
 
Azacytidine was first synthesized in 1963 and demonstrated activit y in four AML trials in the 
1970s, resulting in complete remission in 17% to 36% of patients .
22  The registration study leading 
to FDA approval for azacytidine for all MDS subt ypes was a phase III trial in which transfusion-
dependent MDS patients were randomized to receive azacytidine or supportive care .  Patients in 
the supportive care arm were allowed to cross over to the treatment arm at time of disease 
progression.8  Ninety -nine patients were randomized to the treatment arm, in which azacytidine 
was administered at 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days of a 28 -day cycle,  and 92 to the supportive care 
arm, of whom 49 crossed over to receive active therapy.  When these and other CALGB data were 
analyzed using international working group (IWG) criteria, Silverman et al  reported response rates 
of 14% complete response ( CR) + partial response ( PR) and 30% hematologic improvement .8  
There was a significant delay in transformation to AML or death, but not a significant prolongation of survival in the treatment arm.  Major toxicities included cytopenias.  Patients also reported nausea and injection site -related complications.  
 Azacytidine was next explored in a Phase III trial in which higher -risk patients with MDS were 
randomized to receive azacytidine, at the dose used in the registration study, versus  conventional 
care including : best supportive care, low -dose cytarabine, or intensive AML -type induction 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, 2018  
 
 
1-4 chemotherapy, as selected by [CONTACT_130042].23  Of 358 patients, 179 were 
randomized to azacytidine and 179 to conventional care, with the majority (n=105) receiving best 
supportive care.  Overall response rates (ORR) with azacytidine were significantly greater than 
with conventional care, 29% versus 21% .  With a median follow -up of 21.1 months, median 
survival  was 24.5 months for the azacytidine arm and 15 months for the conventional care arm 
(hazard ratio .58, P  = .0001).  The superior activity of azacytidine  in this study , compared with 
both conventional care and previous azacytidine studies, is credited to an appropriately selected 
population of higher -risk patients with MDS and to a median duration of therapy of more than [ADDRESS_147013] explored in AML populations .  The Phase III 
registration trial for MDS randomized 89 patients to receive the drug , 81 to receive supportive 
care.
24  Patients received decitabine at a dose of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours over 3 days, with a cycle 
repeated every 6 weeks.  Using IWG criteria, CRs  occurred in 9%, PRs  in 8%, and hematologic 
improvement in 13% of patients, for an ORR of 30%.  As with 5- azacytidine, the major toxicities 
were hematologic.  Unlike with azacytidine, there was not a significant delay  in transformation to 
AML or death in this study.  Since the two drugs are biologically similar, this difference is often  
attributed to variation in the patient population enrolled to each study (more early MDS patients in the decitabine study) and to an i nadequate number of cycles of decitabine given (median of 2).  
Alternate dosing schedules, including once -daily dosing of decitabine over 5 days every 28- day 
cycle, were  explored in higher -risk patients given a median of >  [ADDRESS_147014] supportive 
care.  While the CR+PR rate was 23% (similar to azacytidine), the study was unable to demonstrate 
a survival advantage, with patients randomized to drug living a median of 10.[ADDRESS_147015] supportive care living a median of 5.8 months (hazard ratio 0.88, P  = .38).  
Progression- free survival (PFS), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - free survival (AMLFS), 
was significantly prolonged with decitabine versus BSC (median PFS, 6.6 v 3.0 months, respecti vely; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88; P = .004; median AMLFS, 8.8 v 6.1 months, 
respectively; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.12; P = .24).  AML transformation was significantly (P = .036) reduced at 1 year (from 33% with BSC to 22% with decitabine).  
 
Combination therapy has also been explored.  A phase II trial of azac ytidine (75 mg/m
2/d x 5 days) 
in combination with lenalidomide  (10 mg/d x 21 days (28-day cycle )) was conducted in patients 
with higher -risk MDS.27  This study demonstrated the overall response rate (per modified MDS 
IWG criteria) of 72% (CR: 44%), median CR duration of 17+ months (range, 3- 39+) and median 
overall survival of 37+ months (range, 7- 55+) for CR patients, 13.6 months for the entire cohort  
(range, 3 -55).  Another phase I study evaluated the combination of azac ytidine and vorinostat in 
MDS and AML patients.  There were no serious non- hematologic toxicities, and responses were 
seen in up to 86% of patients .[ADDRESS_147016] Oncology Group (SWO G) has recently begun 
accrual  to a 3-arm randomized phase II study of a) azacytidine + lenalidomide versus b) 
azacytidine + vorinostat versus c) azacytidine alone for higher  risk myelodysplastic syndromes .29  
 Althoug h these results from hypomethylating therapy represent an important advance for patients 
with MDS, 40% to 50% of patients did not respond to therapy , and most responders experienced

1-5 disease progres sion within 2 years of response.23  In a recent study,30 435 patients with high- risk 
MDS and former refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB -T) were evaluated 
for outcome after azacytidine  failure.  The cohort of patients included four data sets ( i.e., AZA001, 
J9950, and J0443 trials and the French compassionate use program) .  With the median follow -up 
after azac ytidine  failure of 15 months, t he median overall survival was 5.6 months, and the 2- year 
survi val probability was 15%.  Data on treatment administered after azac ytidine  failure w ere 
available for [ADDRESS_147017] and hypomethylating agents/non- HCT 
therapy may be confounded by [CONTACT_130043]-alloHCT therapy.  In a literature review ,

-DRB1 at high resolution DNA -based typi[INVESTIGATOR_130004] (NMDP) .  Donors must meet institutional selection criteria , and 
there is no age restriction for sibling donors .  Allogeneic transplantation using umbilical cord blood 
unit(s), mismatch ed adult donor s (< 6/6 HLA alleles for related and <  8/8 HLA alleles  for 
unrelated ) or haploidentical donor s is not allowed . 
 2.5. Study Treatments  
 Patients must receive either RIC alloHCT  (bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells)  or non-
transplant therapy according to their treatment assignment .  The specific transplant or non-
transplant treatment regimen will be at the discretion  of the treating physician.  The follow ing are 
examples of acceptable  regimens for non-transplant therapy, conditioning regimens , and GVHD 
prophylaxis regimens.  Hypomethylating therapy is the accepted standard therapy of treatment-
naïve patients with Int- 2/High Risk MDS not undergoing transplantation.  Participat ion in Phase 
II clinical trials of HCT or non- transplant therapy  is allowed with the except ion of  exper imental 
graft manipulation studies.

Hypomethylating -based therapy on an I ntergroup clinical  trial (e.g. , SWOG S1117)  
 2.5.2. Reduced Intensity Conditioning Regimens  
 Institutional standard regimens will be used.  All regimens must be declared by  [CONTACT_130045] a 
preferred regimen  in order to assure that alloHCT is performed according to the institutional 
standard .  Deviations from the preferred regimen must be cleared with the study team.  Institutional 
guidelines for dose modifications for renal impairment, obesity , or other factors are allowed.   As 
a general consideration, the following limits on conditioning dose intensity delineate 
myeloablative regimens:  
1. TBI doses of  ≥ 500 (unfractionated) cGy and ≥  800 cGy (fractionated)  
2. Busulfan dose ≥  9.5 mg/kg 
3. Melphalan ≥  150 mg/m

AlloHCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_130007] -HCT complications , which must be 
weighed against the risk of complications in the absence of transplantation  during hypomethylating 
therapy /non- HCT therapy .  Major risks common to both transplantation and non- transplantation 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]:  1) Infection, which can be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal , occurs commonly 
after transplantation due to impaired immunologic reconstitution  (in MDS, infection occurs due to 
neutropenia and granulocyte dysfunction);  2) Bleeding  occurs after transplantation and with non-
transplantation therapy due  to thrombocytopenia ; 3) Damage  of all or any of the major organs may 
occur as a result of reactions to drugs (e.g., chemotherapy, antibiotics, anti -fungal medications), 
and as a result of destructive processes (e.g., infection) ; and 4) Relapse or progression may occur, 
especially in patients with advanced disease status at time of treatment.  Major risks associated 
with alloHCT can be 1 ) Acute and chronic GVHD  and 2) Graft failure , and both can result in 
significant organ dysfunctions and subsequent mortality.  While expected treatment -related 
mortality (TRM) varies widely in non -HCT therapy depending on its intensity (negligible in 
transfusion support only but up to 5- 10% in high- intensity induction therapy), the TRM is expected 
range about 20- 30% with RI C alloHCT.  Patients’ QOL can be affected by [CONTACT_130046]/non -HCT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   QOL of MDS patients are also known to be reduced 
due to symptoms associated with pancytopenia (infections/bleeding/fatigues) as well as frequent need for transfusions.

 3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 3.1. Primary Objective and Endpoint  
 The primary objective for this study is  to compare three- year overall  survival  probabilities between 
two treatment  arms  (Arm 1 : RIC alloHCT  and Arm 2: Hypomethylating  therapy /best supportive 
care).  Overall survival  is calculated for all patients from date of patient consent until death from 
any cause.  Observation is censored at the date of last follow -up for patients last known to be alive.  
 3.2. Secondary  Objectives and Endpoints  
 3.2.1. Three- year Leukemia -free S urvival (LFS)  
 LFS is defined as the time from the date of patient consent  to the date of progression to AML or 
death from any cause, whichever come s first.  Observation is censored at the date of last follow -
up for patients known to be alive  without leukemia .  Progression  to AML is defined as > 20% 
leukemic blasts in  bone marrow or in the peripheral blood.  
 3.2.2. Relapse for HCT A rm  
 Patients assigned to the HCT arm will be followed for relapse of their MDS.  
 Disease r elapse for patients with MDS:  
• Satisfying criteria for evolution into acute leukemia; or,  
• Reappearance of pre -transplant morphologic abnormalities, detected in bone 
marrow specimens; or , 
• Reappearance of pre- transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase 
on each of two separate consecutive examinations at least one month apart, regardless of the number of metaphases analyzed .  
• Institution of any th erapy to treat relapsed disease (institution of any therapy not 
meant fo r maintenance or prevention), including withdrawal of immunosuppressive 
therapy or DLI, will be considered evidence of relapse regardless of whether the criteria described above are met . 
 3.2.3. QOL Comparison Between Transplant and Non- Transplant Therapy  
 The fo llowing instruments will be used to assess QOL  at study entry, and then serially 6, 12, 18, 
24, and 36 months from enrollment.  Only English - or Spanish- speaking trial participants will be 
included in the QOL studies.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147029] -G that evaluates the health -related quality of life (HQL) of patients receiving treatment for 
cancer, and a specific module, BMT Concerns, that addresses disease and treatment -related 
questions specifi c to bone marrow transplant.  In this protocol, only t he FACT -G will be used, 
which consists of four subscales developed and normed in cancer patients: Physical Well -being, 
Social/Family Well- being, Emotional Well- being, and Functional Well -being.  Each subscale is 
positively scored, with higher scores indicating better functioning.   
 
The MOS SF -36 instrument35, 36, 37 is a general assessment of health qual ity of life with eight 
components: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Pain Index, General Health Perceptions, 
Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health Index.  Each domain is positively scored, indicating that higher scores are asso ciated with positive outcome.  This scale has been 
widely applied in a variety of outcome studies and is being used in this protocol as a generic measure of quality of life.  To facilitate comparison of the results with published norms, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) will be used as the outcome measures in summarizing the SF -[ADDRESS_147030]- utility 
analyses.  The EQ -5D contains a  five item survey with three response levels per item measuring 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort , and anxiety/depression.  The EQ -5D takes 
approximately 1 minute to complete (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2005).  
 3.2.4. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis  
 The primary endpoint for the CEA will be the cost per quality -adjusted life year (QALY) from the 
third party payer perspective with two time horizons: (1) within trial (at [ADDRESS_147031]- enrollment), 
and (2) lifetime using simulating mo deling.  
 The secondary endpoint for the CEA is the cost per QALY from the societal perspective, a broader measure that captures health insurer direct medical care costs and patient out -of-pocket direct 
medical and direct non -medical costs. Patient productivity costs (captured as part of QALY 
calculations) will be reported separately.

 4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT A ND EVALUATION 
 4.1. Enrollment Procedures  
 4.1.1. Screening and Eligibility Procedures  
 Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN Electronic Data Capture System (AdvantageEDC
SM).  The following procedures should be followed:  
1. After the patient has given informed consent to participate on the study, a n authorized user 
at the transplant center  completes the BMT CTN 1102  Segment 0 Enrollment Form (patient 
demographic data, and  the date that informed consent was signed ).  A study number will 
be generated for the patient with the submission of the  BMT CTN [ADDRESS_147032] obtain a CIBMTR Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_130008] (CRID) number at the time of treatment assignment and enter it on the BMT 
CTN 1102 Segment A CIBMTR Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_130009] (see CIBM TR Data Collection below).  
 4.1.2. Evaluations and R esearch S amples at E nrollment  
 Since non- HCT patients may not return to the BMT CTN transplant centers after enrollment, the 
baseline demographics and research samples will be collected at this time point.   Patients will have 
a history and physical examination, KPS /ECOG  assessment, and baseline laboratory studies 
(CBC/differentials, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum ferritin level ) performed as shown in 
Table 4.1.2.  
1.  Disease-  and patient -specific data:  A modified  CIBMTR MDS/MPN Pre -HCT data form 
(CIBMTR Form 2014 MDS) will be used to collect the clinical data at enrollment.  The 
pre-HCT data form (2400) will be used to derive the HCT co -morbidity index.  However, 
it is anticipated that some data  may be mis sing at the time of enrollment (i.e., DLCO, 
FEV1).  Bone marrow data must be current (within 60 days of  consent ).  If a marrow 
examination is not recent, a bone marrow examination will be repeated for trial entry.  An attempt to ascertain the HIGHEST prior  IPSS and IPSS- R score should be made by [CONTACT_1275] .  Response to prior hypomethylating or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130010].

4-2 2. Laboratory tests : See Table 4.1.2. 
3. OPTIONAL r esearch samples: At consent  (or within 3 months  after consent ), a peripheral 
blood sample (50 mL) and buccal swab will be collected for future unspecified research  
from those patients that provide consent to optional research samples .  The BMT CTN 
clinical sites will collect the peripheral blood/buccal swab samples from consenting 
patients prior to receiving study treatment and ship to the BMT  CTN repository on the day 
of collection without having to process and freeze (see Appendix C).  
4. QOL data: The baseline QOL survey will be collected within 1 month a fter Segment A 
enrollment.  QOL interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_130047] (SRG).  The 
transplant centers will contact [CONTACT_130048] a patient is enrolled, either by e- mailing or 
faxing a form with the patient’s contact [CONTACT_3031].  A separa te database will be created 
to house the contact [CONTACT_3031]; no patient contact [CONTACT_130049]; it will only contain the 3 QOL questionnaires (FACT -G, MOS SF -36 
and EQ -5D).  Interviewers will call the patient at a day and time that is convenient for 
them , and the interviewers will be trained to enter the data collected into AdvantageEDCSM. 
5. OPTIONAL cost -effectiveness analysis study data: At the time of enrollment, patients 
consenting to the ancillary Cost -Effectiveness analysis study (see Appendix F) will need 
to complete the HIPAA Authorization Form and Patient Contact [CONTACT_130050]/Optional Alternate Contact [CONTACT_130051] .

4-3 4.1.3. Donor Search  
 
The transplant coordinator at the transplant center should proceed with their insti tution’s standard 
procedure to identify a sibling donor, if applicable.  If an unrelated donor search is to be pursued, 
then the coordinator should inform the transplant center’s assigned NMDP coordinator through the standard procedure for any unrelated donor . 
 4.2. Treatment Group Assignment  
 The primary purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of subject s assigned to 
transplantation with outcomes of those assigned to non- transplant therapy.  Since this is not a 
randomized study, minimizing bias in treatment assignment is critical.  Subjects will be assigned to the transplantation arm on the basis of a  having an available 6/6 related or 8/8 unrelated  matched 
(HLA -A, B, C, D RB1) donor  as defined in section 2.4, found within [ADDRESS_147034] undergoes transplantation 70 days from consent.

4.3. Methodology and Documentation of Study Events  
 4.3.1. Approaching Patients, Eligibility , Screening, and Obtaining Consent  
 Subjects will be approached for this study when they are considered to be  potential alloHCT 
candidates and the decision to proceed with a donor search is made.  Transplant physicians will 
evaluate the patient eligibility.  Eligible patients willin g to participate in the study will sign an 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent form  for this protocol .  Transplant center 
personnel will record the documentation of patient consent in EMMES AdvantageEDC
SM 
(Electronic Data Capture, an Internet -based data entry system) and patients will be enrolled 
through the AdvantageEDC..   4.3.2. Search Commencement   
 Transplant centers will initiate the donor search by [CONTACT_130054]’ HLA types 
when potential sibling donors are available.  If no healthy siblings are available or no siblings are 
HLA -match, an unrelated donor search will be performed.  Transplant center will initiate the 
unrelated donor search by [CONTACT_130055], HLA, and disease information to the NMDP coordinati ng center using standard NMDP forms.  The date of requesting sibling HLA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or unrelated donor search will be recorded if informed consent and enrollment do not 
occur on the same day.  
 4.3.3. Search End  and Assignment to alloHCT versus non- HCT Arm (Donor  versus no- Donor)  
 
Search end is defined as the date when a 6/6 match ed related or 8/8 matched unrelated donor as 
defined in section 2.4 is identified (confirmation of HLA match is completed).  The assignment 
(biologic allocation) to alloHCT occurs on this  date.   If a 6/6 match ed related or 8/[ADDRESS_147039] arm (no donor).  
 Patients must receive either RIC alloHCT or non -HCT therapy according to their t reatment 
assignment.   The specific transplant or non- transplant therapy will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  Patients assigned to the alloHCT arm will receive more information about the 
specific transplant procedures and will be required t o sign the institution’s consent form which

4-6 4.4.3. Collection of QOL Data 
 
QOL interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_130047] (SRG).  The transplant centers will contact [CONTACT_130048] a patient is enrolled  in Segment A , either by e -mailing or faxing a form 
with the patient’s contact [CONTACT_3031].  A separate database will be created to house the contact [CONTACT_3031]; no patient contact [CONTACT_130049]; it will only contain 
the 3 QOL questionnaires (FACT -G, MOS SF -36 and EQ -5D).  Interviewers will call the patient 
at a day and time that is convenient for them , and the interviewers will be trained to enter the data 
collected into AdvantageEDCSM. 
 The baseline QOL survey will be collected within 1 month after  Segment A enrollment.  For each 
subsequent interview, they may occur within the following windows, calculated from month since Segment A enrollment.   
• 6 months: +/ - 1 month  
• 12 months: +/ - 1 month  
• 18 months: +/ - 1 month  
• 24 months: +/ - 2 month  
• 36 months: +/ - [ADDRESS_147043] person associated with the patient will notify the SRG if a patient’s contact [CONTACT_130056] a patient has died.  
 4.4.4. Locat ing Missing Patients  
 If patients cannot be located through the contact [CONTACT_130057], or through the transplant center, then Accurint, a government website accessible to only those with permission will be used by [CONTACT_130058].  Patients give their permission for the SRG to use this site when they sign the informed consent.  4.4.5. Adverse Event Reporting 
 Only adverse events related to the study consent process , collection of th e optional research 
sample s, or completing Q OL Surveys  will be reported .  Since no other therapy is mandated in this 
study, adverse events associated with transplantation or non- transplantation will not be collected 
nor reported for this protocol .  
 4.4.6. Patien t Evaluations prior to HCT Therapy  
 Pre-HCT testing will be performed per institutional standards .  The CIBMTR MDS/MPN Pre -
HCT data form (CIBMTR Form 2014 MDS) will be used to collect the clinical data pre -HCT.  The

  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147044] dat a form (2400)  will also be used to derive HCT co -morbidity index  
at the time of transplantation .  
 
4.5. OPTIONAL Research Samples  Pre-transplant and at Relapse (RIC alloHCT  Arm 
only)  
 In addition to research samples at enrollment ( Section  4.1.2)  collected from consenting patients, a 
pre-transplant bone marrow sample ( 1 mL) will be collected for those assigned to the alloHCT arm  
(within 3 months prior to transplant) .  This sample is asked for only when a clinically indicated 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] i s performed at BMT CTN centers.  Additionally, at the time of disease 
relapse for those patient s assigned to the alloHCT arm , an additional peripheral blood sample (50 
mL, or specified amount based on weight if < 50 kg) and bone marrow sample (1 mL) will be collected if possible.  
 4.6. OPTIONAL Cost -Effectiveness Analysis Information  
 Patients consenting to the optional Cost -Effectiveness Analysis ancillary study (see Appendix F) 
will be interviewed by [CONTACT_130047] (SRG) at 1, 7, and 19 months after  enrollment 
to gather information about their out -of-pocket costs.

 5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 5.1. Study Overview  
 This study is designed as a multicenter trial, with biological assignment to one of two study arms;  
Arm 1 : Reduced intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (RIC alloHCT),  Arm 2: 
non-transplant  therapy  / best supportive care.  Patients with an HLA -matched related or unrelated 
donor found within [ADDRESS_147045] arm.  Patients without a matched 
donor in that time period will be assigned to the non- transplant therapy arm.  
 The primary objective is to compare  the three -year overall survival (OS) probabilities between the 
RIC alloHCT arm ve rsus the non- transplan t arm.  The primary analysis will include all enrolled 
subjects, classified according to their biological treatment assignment,  irrespective of treatment 
actually received (intent -to-treat analysis).   (See S ection 4.2.)   
 5.1.1. Accrual  
 The length of time required to accrue the targeted sample size for this study depends on the proportion of enrolled patients with a matched related or matched unrelated donor.  Although this proportion is not exactly known, it is believed that 60% -  70% of  patients will have a matched 
donor.  To ensure the study is sufficiently powered to detect a 15% improvement in three -year 
overall survival, accrual will remain open until  135 patients are assigned to the non- transplant arm 
if the proportion of patients w ith a matched donor is 60% and until [ADDRESS_147046] therapy arm if the proportion with a matched donor is 70%.  The sample size and power calculations are given in Section 5.2.  Based on historical CIBMTR data, it is estimated that [ADDRESS_147047] 50% 
of these patients have had Intermediate- [ADDRESS_147048] arm.  Assuming an accrual rate of 40%, we expect annual 
enrollment of [ADDRESS_147049] arm.  Table 5.1 provides estimated annual accruals for various proportions of donor availability.  
 
Table 5.1: ESTIMATED ANNUAL ACCRUAL  
 Donor A vailability  
60%  70%  
Donor  84 84 
No Donor  56 36 
Total  140 120 
 Based on these assumptions, it is estimated that 2.5 -  3.5 years of accrual will be necessary to 
enroll the targeted sample size if 60% -  70% of patients have a matched donor.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147050] 90 days will stay in the non- transplant arm.  Patients without a donor 
identified who die before 90 days will be analyzed in the non- transplant arm, although this number 
is expected to be small.   There are many possible sources of heterogeneity in a multi -center clinical trial .
37  In a large 
randomized trial, chance ensures balance on average of both known and unknown risk factors across treatment arms.  A non -randomized study is vulnerable to differential assignment of higher 
risk patients to one or the other treatment arm.  Potential sources of heterogeneity include: degrees of compliance with biological assignment, differences in baseline characteristics such as age, r ace, 
gender, performance status, and disease risk status.  To address these concerns, the DCC will monitor compliance rate throughout the study and the final analysis will adjust for baseline characteristics potentially affecting outcomes.   
 5.1.3. Intention- to-Treat Principle  
 In the primary analysis of overa ll survival at three years post -consent , patients will be classified 
according to their biologic assignment regardless of their actual treatment in accordance with the intent -to-treat principle.  Secondary analyses using an as-treated principle will be considered.  
 5.2. Sample Size and Power Calculations  
 The primary analysis will compare three -year OS probabilities between arms using adjusted 
survival estimates provided by [CONTACT_130059]
[ADDRESS_147051] of binomial proportions.    
The targeted sample size is specified in terms of minimal number of patients without a matched 
donor whose final assignment is non- transplant therapy.  Data from the CIBMTR suggests a three-
year OS probability  after transplant for high -risk MDS patients older than 50 to be approximately 
35%-40%.  Three -year OS for the non- transplant group based on data from European patients 
under a compassionate use program of AZA
39 are estimated to range between 20% and 25%.  From 
these estimates, we propose a design with sufficient power to detect a 15% increase in three- year 
OS probability in the RIC alloHCT  arm compared to the non- transplant  arm.  The sample size was

  5.3. Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130013], we recommend monitoring treatment assignment to assess the proportion of donor availability and to ensure enough patients will be enrolled in each arm to have sufficient power to detect the specified treatment effect.  If the proportion of donor availability reaches 90%, an action plan wil l be developed to address future 
accrual.  The DCC will also monitor compliance rate throughout the study to ensure patients will receive their assigned treatment.  Noncompliance in the no n-transplant arm is defined as a patient 
without a matched donor ide ntified receiving  alternative donor  HCT within the first 90 days  or a 

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147055] 90 days after consent receiving  a transplant with in 
six months from  the final assignment.  Noncompliance in the transplant arm is defined as a patient 
with a matched donor identified not receiving a transplant within six months from  the final 
assignment.  If noncompliance in each arm exceeds 25%, an action plan will be developed to 
address future accrual.  
 In addition to monitoring for compliance and enrollment imbalance between assignment arms, we recommend monitoring the proportion of patients enrolled by [CONTACT_551] (< 65 years of age vs. ≥ 65) to ensure sufficient number of patients will be available in each age group for secondary subgr oup analysis.   
 We do not recommend interim analysis for futility for two reasons.  First, we expect the risk of mortality in the early period to be higher after HCT and in the later period to be higher with non-transplant therapy , resulting in crossing h azards.  Although we expect the survival curves to cross 
approximately two years after enrollment, no data exist to estimate the crossing point.  If the survival curves happen to cross later than two years, we do not want to prematurely stop the study for futility.  Secondly, the investigators are also interested in using the lower bound of the 
confidence interval of the survival difference at three years to learn about the magnitude of the survival difference.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130014] s ubstantially wider confidence 
intervals, leading to greater uncertainty about the magnitude of the survival difference when it is not likely to be as large as targeted.   
 We recommend interim analysis for efficacy after accrual is complete starting at [ADDRESS_147056] (DSMB) at 
approximately one year intervals.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN’s Manual of Procedures.  Toxicity, adverse events, and other safety endpoints will be 
monitored regularly and reported to the DSMB at each interim analysis.  These stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would mandate automatic closure of the study enrollment.    5.3.1. Interim Analysis for Efficacy  
 Analyses will be performed as described below for the primary endpoint.  At the time of each 
interim analysis, a two -sided test to detect either an increase or decrease in the proportion of 
patients surviving will be performed.  The test statistic  used at each interim analysis  will be the 
difference between treatment arms  in adjusted estimates of three year overall survival .  All patients 
enrolled prior to the time of the interim analyses will be used to compute the se adjusted probability 
estimate s.  If the test statistic exceeds the critical value, the DSMB will discuss whether the trial 
should continue . 
 In order the preser ve the overall Type I error rate at 5%, the critical value for the test statistic will 
be inflated above 1.96, the value that would be used if no repeated testing were used.  Equivalently, the nominal p- value at which an observed difference is declared sig nificant will be reduced below

  Version 5.0 –  November 28, 2018  
 
 
5-5 0.05.  The actual critical values and nominal p- values will be computed using statistical methods 
for group sequential testing with Haybittle -Peto boundaries40,41.  Because differences in adjusted 
survival estimates are not kno wn to follow an independent increments structure asymptotically, a 
Bonferroni adjustment  will be used to ensure that the overall type I error rate does not exceed 0.05.   
Letting 𝐾𝐾 denote the total number of analyses and 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗 the nominal type I error rate for the analysis 
performed at analysis 𝑗𝑗, the overall type I error rate will not exceed 0.05  if these are chosen such 
that ∑𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗 𝐾𝐾
𝑗𝑗=1 =0.05.  The Haybittle -Peto design uses a critical value of 3 .00 at each intermediate 
analysis, giving  𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗=2[1−Φ(3)]=0.0027  for stages 𝑗𝑗<𝐾𝐾 and 𝜋𝜋𝐾𝐾=0.05−2(K−1)[1−
Φ(3)] for the final analysis, where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. The 
critical value for the final analysis, then, is Φ−1(1−𝜋𝜋𝐾𝐾/2).  
 
We recommend interim analyses starting four years after the beginning of the study and yearly thereafter, until the last patient has been followed for three years.  Four years was chosen as the time of the first interim analysis to ensure enough patients have reached the primary endpoint to provide reasonable e stimate s of three -year survival.  The number of subsequent analyses depends 
on the length of time required to complete accrual.   Assuming donor availability rate of 60%, the total accrual time is estimated to be 2.[ADDRESS_147057] the null hypot hesis at each 
analysis conducted at the end of year 4, 5, and 6.  This is estimated using a simulation study with two different survival probability scenarios, uniform accrual over 2.5 years, and assuming exponential censoring with 10% rate by 3 years ; we use an unadjusted test statistic for simulation 
study purposes, even though the primary analysis will use the difference in adjusted survival probabilities at 3 years .  The power at each look is the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130016] 15% in the HCT arm 
compared to the non- HCT arm.  In particular, there is 32% power to detect a 15% improvement in 
three- year survival by [CONTACT_130060], 51% by [CONTACT_130061], and 83% by [CONTACT_130062] 35% vs. 20%.  There is 29% power to detect the same improvement by

based on a binomial test of proportions for treatment -related mortality will be used as described 
below.  This sequentia l testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks 
for TRM.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each interim analysis, the number of patients received HCT is plotted against the total number of patients who have experie nced TRM 
by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_147060] patients.  Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment reaches the target goal.  
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α and β of rejecting H
0 
when θ = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size E(N| θi).  
Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite sample size, the 
size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level.  The test to be used in this protocol was developed from the following SPRT:

rate of 20% and 30%.  
 5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
 Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.   Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, disease status , donor type, donor 
gender, all components of IPSS score, co -morbidity index, duration of disease, cytogenetics, prior 
treatment , and response to prior trea tment.  
 5.5. Analysis Plan  
 5.5.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
 The primary outcome of the trial is overall survival at three years after consent .  The primary null 
hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference in overall survival between the treatment a rms 
at three years post consent .  In the primary analysis, the intent -to-treat principle will be used.  
Because of the potential bias resulting from biological assignment
42, the comparisons of overall 
survival will be adjusted for the following pre -specifie d patient characteristics: age, race/ethnicity, 
performance status, disease status, co -morbidity index, IPSS score, duration of disease (time from 
diagnosis to enrollment), cytogenetics, and response to prior therapy.  The primary analysis will be performe d using the difference in adjusted overall survival probabilities at three years, using 
the method of Zhang et al
38.  In this analysis, the time to event is the time from study consent to 
the time of death  from any cause; surviving patients will be censored at  last follow -up.  T he 
adjusted survival probabilities are estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by [CONTACT_3148].  A 95% confidence inter val for the difference in adjusted OS at three years will also 
be constructed.  In addition to a point -wise comparison at three years, adjusted survival curves will 
be constructed and confidence bands for the difference between treatments will be generated to 
compare the survival probabilities across time.   5.5.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Overall survival at three years (as treated analysis)  
 In addition to the primary intent -to-treat analysis, three- year survival probabilities will be 
compared using the adjusted OS probabilities in several exploratory analyses.  In the first one, the patients who die or drop out before 90 days without a donor identified will be removed from the non-transplant group.  The second analysis will be an as treated analysis, whe re patients are 
classified by [CONTACT_130068].

Overall survival post three years will be compared between arms using the linear combination test proposed by [CONTACT_130069]

years, and accounts for patients enrolled early in the study having additional follow -up beyond 
three years.

 Probabilities of leukemia -free survival three years post consent will be compared between 
treatment groups using the method of Zhang et al .

status, disease status, co -morbidity index, IPSS score, duration of disease (time from diagnosis to 
enrollment), cytogenetics, and response to prior therapy.  A 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in adjusted OS at three years will also be constructed.  In addition to a point -wise 
comparison at three years, adjusted survival curves will be constructed and confidence bands for 
the difference between treatments will be generated to compare the leukemia- free survival 
probabilities across time.  An as -treated analysis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will also be 
conducted to compare leukemia -free survival probabilities at three years.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Quality of Life  
 QOL w ill be described and compared between treatment ar ms utilizing the FACT -G, the MOS -
SF36 Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS), and the EQ -5D 
utility score.  The questionnaires will be scored according to standard procedures.  The self report questionnaires will be completed at en rollment and subsequently at six months, [ADDRESS_147063]:  
1. Response to hypomethylating therapy (response versus no r esponse) , where response is 
defined as achieving complete or partial response or hematologic improvement.  
2. Patient age (< 65 years of age vs. ≥ 65),  
3. Disease duration,  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147064] of the following factors on transplantation outcomes (i.e. OS, disease -free or 
progression- free survival, relapse, TRM, acute/chronic GVHD) will be evaluated:  
1. Response to hypomethylating therapy (complete response, partial response and no 
response) , 
2. Patient age (< 65 years of age vs. ≥ 65),  
3. Disease duration,  
4. IPSS,  
5. Revised -IPSS, and  
6. Donor type (HLA -matched sibling donor vs. matched unrelated donor).  
 Cox proportional hazards models will be performed in these analyses.  The proportional hazards assumption will be tested.  When test indicated differential effects over time (non -proportional 
hazards), models will be constructed breaking the post -transplan t course into two time periods, 
using the maximized partial likelihood method to find the most appropriate breakpoint.  
 QOL will be described and compared between age groups (< 65 years of age vs. ≥ 65) utilizing the FACT -G using the same approach describe d in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].

B-3 1. Introduction  
We invite you to join this clinical trial, also 
known as a research study. You are invited 
to join this study because:  
1) You have myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) , also called 
myelodysplasia;  
 
2) Your  MDS is at an advanced stage. 
This means that you are at medium 
(intermediate) to high risk for your MDS to become acute leukemia or cause death; and
 
 
3) Your doctor recommends that you have an allogeneic stem cell transplant (transplant)  if a donor is 
found whose DNA or tissue type matches your DNA or tissue type.
 
We are doing this study because we want to find out if patients with MDS who have a 
matched donor and get a reduced -intensity 
conditioning (RIC) transplant  do better 
than those who get drugs to treat their MDS 
(no transplant).  
This study also wants to learn more about 
the cost -effectiveness of transplant and 
collect extra blood and tissue samples for future studies.  
(See Section 2. Study Background for a definition of the bolded terms)  
This study will take about 6.5 years and will  
include about 338 – [ADDRESS_147069] 
information on how you’re doing (your health condition and how you feel)  for 3 – 4 
years.   
This Consent Form tells you about the 
purpose of the study, the possible risks and benefits, other treatment options available to 
you, and your rights as a participant in the 
study . Please take your time to make your

2. Study Background  
The National Institutes of H ealth (NIH), 
through the Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), are 
providing staff support and money for this research study. The BMT CTN will direct the research study. The BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions about how to 
mana ge the study.  
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) , also 
called myelodysplasia, is a disease where 
the bone marrow does not make enough 
normal blood cells for the body. This can 
lead to a fast -growing blood cancer called 
acute leukemia. It mostly affects people who are 50 or older.   
There are different  ways to treat MDS. 
Some treatments  use blood transfusions and 
drugs. These treatments can improve MDS and slow it from becoming acute leukemia. 
However, drugs don’t cure MDS.  
Allogeneic stem cell transplant  
(tran splant) is another treatment option for 
advanced stage MDS . A transplant uses 
blood- making cells from a family member 
or an unrelated donor to remove and replace 
your abnormal blood cells. It requires a 
close tissue match between you and the donor.  Your donor could be a sibling (a sister or brother) or an unrelated person. We use the 
Be The Match
® Registry to find unrelated 
donors.   
The best experience with transplant for 
MDS is with well- matched sibling or 
unrelated donors. If you do not have one of 
these donors there may be other potential donor options such as umbilical cord blood or mismatched donors. Since the outcome from transplant with these donors is not as 
good, only well -matched sibling and 
unrelated donors are being offered on this 
trial. 
A transplant first  uses chemotherapy and 
radiation to destroy the abnormal blood cells 
or stop them from growing. For your MDS 
and your condition, your doctor wants  to use 
lower amounts of chemotherapy and 
radiation. This type of transplant is called 
redu ced-intensity  conditioning (RIC)  or 
non-myeloablative. There are different 
combinations of RIC drugs and radiation. 
Your doctor will decide on the best 
combination for you.  
Because of your age or health problems, you may have a higher chance of side effect s and 
health problems from a standard transplant 
that uses very high doses of chemotherapy 
and radiation. The possible benefit of RIC is 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147071] and 
RIC transplants. The side effects  can be very 
serious, sometimes even causing death. We 
don’t know if patients with MDS in an 
advanced stage do better with transplant or with drug therapy only (no transplant). Both 
treatments are common.  
If you don’t find  a donor whose DNA or 
tissue type is a close match, you might be 
able to get a transplant that uses a donor who isn’t a close match or that  uses an 
umbilical cord blood unit  (CBU) . However, 
other research studies showed that transplants that use a less -closely matched 
donor or a CBU don’t treat the disease as 
well, so transplants with these donor types 
are not included in this study.  
 
3. Study Purpose  
We are inviting you to join this study because you have MDS and your doctor 
recommends reduced -intensity transplant as 
a treatment option for you (if you find or 
have a matched donor).  
The main goal of this study is to learn if 
MDS patients who have a matched donor 
and receive transplant do better than other MDS patients who don’t have a donor and only get drugs to treat their MDS (no 
transplant). We want to know how well 
you’re able to do your normal activities after your treatment.  We will ask you survey questions (health evaluations) by [CONTACT_130074] . 
We also want to learn more about the cost -
effectiveness of transplant (see Ancillary 
Cost -Effectiveness Analysis  Informed 
Consent Form (Optional) ) and collect 
extra blood and tissue samples for future research (see Section 17: Blood and Tissue Samples for Future Research ). These 
studies are optional. This means you can still 
be part of the main study (health evaluations 
by [CONTACT_648]) if you say ‘no’ to these studies .  
 
4. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  
You have the right to ask questions about 
the study at any time. If you have questions about the study or you want to leave the 
study, please contact:  
[insert contact [CONTACT_29075] ] Being in this study is voluntary. You can 
choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any time. If you choose not to take 
part or to leave this study, it will not affect 
your regular medical care in any way.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147072] one before you join the study. Your 
doctor will tell you if you need a bone marrow biopsy.  
Study Participation  
If you join this study  and you don’t have a 
known sibling donor , your doctor will 
determine if you have a suitable matched 
donor. Your donor could be a sibling (sister 
or brother) or an unrelated person. If a donor is found within 90 days (about 3 months)  of 
your consent to be on this study , you will 
have a transplant as soon as  you and your 
doctor feel you are ready for it.   
If we can’t find a matched donor for you, you will continue to see your regular cancer 
doctor. Together, you and your doctor will 
decide on the standard treatment or a different treatment for your MDS. We will be in touch with you and your cancer 
doctor’ s office to collect information on how 
you’re doing.  Once you and your doctor decide on your 
treatment, you will get more information 
about the treatment . 
Health Evaluations  
After you join the study, we will ask you 
questions about your health and how you ’re 
feeling over the phone.  
We will also contact [CONTACT_130075]:  
 6 months  
 1 year (12 months)  
 1 ½ years (18 months)  
 2 years (24 months), and  
 3 years (36 months)   
These phone calls will take approximately 
[ADDRESS_147073] information on how you’re doing. The surveys will ask you about:  
 Your general health 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, 2018  
 
 
B-7  Any side effects you may have from 
your treatment  
 How well you can do your normal 
activities  
 Your feelings  
You do not  need to answer all of the 
questions or complete the surveys at all. It is okay to only answer the questions you feel comfortable answering. If any of the questions make you uncomfortable, you can 
skip them. 
If your phone number changes, it’s 
important that you  let us know your new 
number so we can reach you. You can call:  
[Insert contact [CONTACT_130076]]  If we can’t reach you by [CONTACT_648], we may use 
an Internet search service to find you. By 
[CONTACT_130077], you are giving us 
your permi ssion to use  search firms to find 
your contact [CONTACT_3031]. The service uses public and non- public information to reach 
you.  
We will also give you the choice to provide a list of what you and your insurance company pay for your treatment (see  
Ancillary Cost -Effectiveness Analysis 
Informed Consent Form (Optional) ) and 
extra samples of your blood and tissue for 
future research (see Section 17: Optional 
Blood and Tissue Samples for Future Research ).
 
6. Risks and Discomforts  
The risks and side effects of transplant are the same if you join this study or if you don’t join this study. Your doctor will give 
you drugs to help ease side effects, such as 
feeling sick to your stomach (nausea). In some cases, side effects can be long lasting or ne ver go away.  
a) Risks and side effects of transplant  
If you have a matched donor, the following  
general  problems m ight happen from your  
transplant. Your doctor will explain t he 
possible risks and benefits for the drugs used 
with your transplant before you get your 
transplant.  
Anyone who has a transplant will experience 
the risks described below:  1. Slow recovery of blood counts. You will 
need blood and platelet transfusions after your transplant because red blood cells, 
white blood cells, and platelets can  be slow 
to recover. This will make you at risk for 
bleeding and infections.  
2. Graft failure. The peripheral  blood or 
bone marrow stem cells (the “graft”) may fail 
to grow inside your body. There is a low chance of this happening (about [ADDRESS_147074] e), and can result in low blood counts 
for a long time. If your counts don’t recover, 
you might need another transplant. Graft 
failure can be fatal.  
3. Graft -Versus -Host Disease (GVHD) . 
This happens  when the graft sees  your body 
as foreign and attacks it. Sometimes GVHD 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147075] a biopsy (a 
small sample of your tissue for testing) of 
your skin, gut, or liver.  
4. Damage to the vital organs in your body. The transplant coul d cause problems in any 
body organ such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, 
kidneys and bladder, or brain. The kidneys 
and the liver are most likely to be damaged. 
Some patients will experience serious lung 
problems from infections, or the chemotherapy and ra diation.  
5. Serious infections. There is an increased 
risk of infections when your immune system 
is recovering. Most infections can be 
successfully treated, but some infections may 
result in death.  
6. Relapse of MDS. Your MDS may come 
back even if the transplant is successful at 
first. 
7. Risk to the unborn. Transplant has not  
been proven to be safe at any stage of 
pregnancy. If you are a woman and can 
become pregnant, it’s very important that you aren’t pregnant when you start the study and don’t become p regnant while in the 
study.  
8. Reproductive Risks. The drugs used in transplant  may damage your reproductive 
organs, affect your ability to have children or possibly cause birth defects if you take 
them while you are pregnant. It is important 
that a woman is not pregnant or breast -
feeding and does not become pregnant during the course of transplant . 
 If you are a woman and can become pregnant:  
You will need to take a pregnancy test before you start transplant. You should 
discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while 
you are going through transplant.  
 If you are a man:  
Your body may not be able to make 
sperm (become sterile). You should talk 
with your doctor about banking your 
sperm before having a transplant. 
Please check with your doctor to 
understand more about these risks.  
b) Risks and side effects of RIC drugs  
Your doctor decided that a RIC transplant is 
the best treatment for you if you have a 
matched donor.  
The drugs used in RIC transplants are likely 
to cause infection, bleeding, feeling tired (fatigue), feeling sick to your stomach (nausea), and throwing up (vomiting). You 
might also have diarrhea, feel numb in your 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, 2018  
 
 
B-9 hands and feet, or notice changes in your 
eyesight.  
Other side effects that are very rare (but 
serious if they happen) include a lung infection (pneumonia), feeling confused, coughing and trouble breathing, serious 
brain damage, and death. Your doctor wil l 
tell you more about the side effects of the 
specific RIC drugs you will receive before 
you get your transplant .    
c) Risks and side effects of drug therapy 
for MDS (no transplant)  
If you don’t have a matched donor, you will 
be treated with drugs for MD S. Your doctor 
will discuss with you more details about the side effects, risks, and benefits of these drugs. Some of the drugs can cause low blood counts, nausea, and stomach upset. 
Drug treatments can improve MDS and slow 
it from becoming leukemia. Howev er, 
because drugs alone don’t cure MDS, the 
risk of your disease coming back is very 
high.  
d) Risks of being in this study  
The [ADDRESS_147076] -effectiveness of 
transplant research, and optional blood and tissue samples for future research. Each of these studies has their own risks. These risks are described below :  
1. Health evaluations by [CONTACT_648]  (see 
Section 5 ). You may feel uncomfortable 
about some of the questions on the surveys. If this happens, you can skip these questions . You can also decide not 
to take the  entire survey.  
2. Ancillary Cost -Effectiveness Analysis 
(Optional)  (see  Ancillary Cost -
Effectiveness Analy sis Informed 
Consent Form ). The risks to 
participating in the cost- effectiveness 
study are small. A possible risk is the 
loss of confidentiality of your medical 
information, but the chance that this 
information will be given to someone 
else is very small.  
3. Blood and Tissue Samples for Future Research  (Optional)  (see Section 17). 
The risk of injury from having your 
blood taken is very small. If your blood samples are collected from your arm, 
you may bleed a little bit and/or develop 
a small bruise.  Infection from blood 
draws is rare, but it may happen. If you 
are uncomfortable at the sight of blood, you may feel light- headed or faint. The 
risk of injury from having your bone 
marrow taken also is small. You may 
feel stiff or sore for several days 
afterwards. Yo u may bleed a little bit 
and/or develop a bruise. The risk of 
injury from having a cheek swab from 
the inside of your mouth is very small. 
4. Unforeseen risks . New risks might 
appear at any time during the study. We 
may learn new things that might make 
you wa nt to stop being in the study. We 
will let you know if this happens and 
you can decide if you want to stay in the 
study.

  Version 5.0 –  November 28, [ADDRESS_147077] a 
matched donor, y ou might be able to get a transplant that uses a donor who isn’t a close 
match or that  uses an umbilical cord blood 
unit (CBU) . Since the out come from 
transplant with these donors is not as good, 
only well -matched sibling and unrelated 
donors are being offered on this trial . 
Your study doctor will talk with you about your options. If you decide not to join this study, your medical car e will not be affected 
in any way.
 
8. Possible Benefits
You will not benefit from taking part in this study. Your participation in this study allows us to collect specific information about your treatment for MDS. You can still 
receive the same or similar treatments if you 
don’t take part in this study. Information from this study will help doctors learn more ab out treatments for 
MDS. This information could help people with MDS who may need a transplant in the 
future.
 
9. New Information Available During the Study  
During this study, the study doctors may learn 
new information about the risks and benefit s 
of the study. If this happens, they will tell you 
about the new information.  
The new information may mean that you can 
no longer take part in the study, or that you 
may not want to continue in the study.   If this happens, the study doctor will stop 
your participation and offer you all available 
care to meet your needs and medical 
conditions.

17. Blood  and Tissue  Samples for Future Research (Optional)  
This section of the consent form is about 
future research studies that will use blood 
and tissue (blood, cheek cells , and bone 
marrow) samples from people who are 
taking part in the main study. You may choose to give blood and tissue samples for 
these future studies if you want to. You or 
your insurance will not be charged for these research samples.  
You can still be a part  of the main study  
(health evaluations by [CONTACT_648])  even if you 
say ‘no’ to give blood and tissue samples for 
future studies.  
The risk of injury from  having your blood 
taken is very small. If your blood samples 
are collected from your arm, you may bleed 
a little bit and/or develop a small bruise. Infection from blood draws is rare, but it may happen.  
If you are uncomfortable at the sight of 
blood, you may feel light -headed or faint. 
Only trained people will draw your blood.  
The risk of injury from  having your bone 
marrow taken is small. You may feel stiff or sore for several days after the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. You may bleed a little bit and/or develop a bruise. Only trained people will collect your 
bone marrow.  
 The risk of injury from  having a cheek swab 
from the inside of your mouth is very small.   
If you agree to provide blood and tissue 
samples, this  is what will happen:  
a.) We will collect [ADDRESS_147080] about 4 tablespoons (50 m L). If you weigh less 
than 110 pounds (50 kg), the amount of 
blood we collect will be based on your 
weight.  
b.) We will also collect cells from your 
mouth by [CONTACT_130083] a cotton swab on the inside of your cheek. 
c.) Additionally, if you are going to get a transplant, w e will also collect about ¼ 
teaspoon (1 mL) of bone marrow fluid 
and cells through a  needle put into your 
bone (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], if you and your doctor 
choose to perform this procedure)  before 
you get your transplant .  
 
The skin will be cleaned with a special 
solution and a medicine (local 
anesthetic) will be used to numb the 
area. Then the as pi[INVESTIGATOR_130020]. During an 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], you may feel a quick, shooting pain as the sample is taken. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November 28, 2018  
 
 
B-15 d.) If you get a transplant and your MDS 
comes back:  
a. We will collect another blood samp le 
(no more than 4 tablespoons).  
b. We will collect another  ¼ teaspoon 
(1 mL) of bone marrow fluid and 
cells through a needle put into your 
bone (if you and your doctor choose 
to perform this procedure). 
 
e.) The blood and tissue samples will be 
sent to the BMT CTN Repository for processing and storage. A repository is a place that protects, stores , and sends 
out samples for approved research studies. All research samples will be given a number that cannot be linked to 
you.  
f.) Samples  stored in the Repository will be 
used mainly by [CONTACT_130084]. In the future, the unused blood and tissue samples and 
health information will be made 
available outside of this network (see 
section s ‘g’ below).  
g.) Researchers can apply to study the 
health information and blood and tissue 
samples in the Repository. The BMT 
CTN Steering Committee and/or the 
BMT CTN Executive Committee must 
approve each request before they will 
share samples or information with 
researchers. This is to make sure that the invest igators requesting the samples are 
qualified, and that the research is of high 
quality.  
h.) DNA from your stored blood and tissue 
samples might be used in genome -wide association (GWA) studies for a future 
project either done or supported by [CONTACT_4878] (NIH). Genome -wide association studies are a 
way for scientists to find genes that have a role in human disease or treatment. 
Each study can look at millions of 
genetic changes at the same time. 
If your coded samples are used in such a 
study, the researcher is required to add 
your test results and sample information into a shared, public research database. This public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it 
is managed by [CONTACT_130085] (NCBI). The 
NCBI will never have any information that would identify you, or link you to 
your information or research samples  
although the results of genetic studies 
could theoretically include identifying information about you.  
Your name [CONTACT_130114] i nformation that could 
directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will not be placed into any scientific database. However, 
because your genetic information is unique 
to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to  you. The risk of this 
happening is small, but may grow in the future. Researchers have a duty to protect 
your privacy and to keep your information 
confidential.  
Some general things you should know about letting us store your blood and tissue 
samples for r esearch are:

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of acquired malignant bone marrow 
disorders with an annual incidence rat e of approximately [ADDRESS_147095] commonly 
occurs in older individuals, with 80% diagnosed at ≥65 years of age in the [LOCATION_002].3 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) is the only curative treatment 
modality for MDS, and with the introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, 
alloHCT is now a viable treatment option for many older patients. Hypomethylating agents 
([HMA] azacitadine and decitabine) also on  average improve progression free (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) in patients with MDS and, unlike transplantation, these agents do not require the 
demanding preparation or carry the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and other 
transplant related mor bidity and mortality.  BMT CTN [ADDRESS_147096] to provide a comprehensive 
evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of these MDS treatment approaches from multiple 
perspectives.

F-7 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
MDS is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, which may progress to acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). Data from the Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) national 
cancer registries estimate that approximately 10,[ADDRESS_147102] not been observed.4 
 
The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is used 
to classify MDS into four risk groups (low, intermediate- 1, 
intermediate- 2, and high). Table 1 shows the median survival 
for each risk group, as published by [CONTACT_130089].7 Low-
risk MDS patients are often not treated until they become 
transfusion- dependent,5 while patients with high -risk MDS (intermediate -2, and high) are 
considered for alloHCT.8,[ADDRESS_147103] remains low among older patients. For example, records fr om the 
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) show that out of a 
total of 3,101 alloHCTs performed in the US between 2000 and 2010 for MDS, only 232 (7.5%) 
were among persons aged ≥65 years (personal communication, W. Saber) . HMA, including 
azactidine and decidabine, are recommended for the treatment of high -risk MDS patients who 
are not candidates for or are not willing or able to undergo alloHCT.8,[ADDRESS_147104] is approximately 
40% (95% CI 36% -45%). This is better than the median time to AML progression of 18 months, 
and median time of AML transformation or death of 21 months observed for azacitidine in two 
randomized controlled trials,11,12 however it should be noted that the cumulative incidence of 
transplant -related mortality at 3 -years in the CIBMTR study was 37% (95% CI 32% -42%).10 The 
substantial risk of morbidity (including graft versus host disease and post -alloHCT infection) and 
mortality associated with transplant undoubtedly tips the balance for some physicians and 
patients considering alloHCT, especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. A biologic 
assignment, non -randomized trial is currently underway in Europe comparing non- transplant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130024] a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor, 
but results are not expected until June 2017. The BMT CTN clinical study recently opened in the 
[LOCATION_002], providing the opportunity to collect clinical and ancillary economic data to 
address the use of alloHCT in older patients in a multi -payer system. If the results of BMT CTN 
[ADDRESS_147105], the number of alloHCTs performed i n the US among patients 
age ≥65 years rose nearly 3.5 fold, from 65 to 220 respectively (personal communication, W. 
Saber). Given that this still represents a small proportion of eligible MDS patients, it is expected Table 1.  Median survival estimates

number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130025] [ADDRESS_147107] been 
estimated to be between $96,000 and $204,[ADDRESS_147108] nonmedical costs (transportation, food, lodging) or indirect nonmedical costs 
(lost wages and productivity). These additional costs can be especially burdensome for older 
MDS patients receiving alloHCT, as they may need extensive caregiver support and may be 
living on fixed incomes that cannot absorb the financial shock of unexpected medical expenses. 
Direct medical costs can be obtained retrospectively from insurance claims, and are thus often 
the only data available t o compare the economic impact of treatment strategies, however the 
Public Health Service’s Panel of Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine and the 
International Society for Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research Randomized Control Trials –  cost-
effectiveness analysis (CEA) Task Force both recommend that a societal perspective be taken 
to comprehensively assess the economic consequences of alternative treatments.15,16  
 
BMT CTN 1102 Trial  
Given this knowledge gap and as a response to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS) Coverage- with-Evidence- Development (CED) for National Coverage Determination 
(NCD) of Stem Cell Transplantation,17 the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 
(BMT CTN) launched the BMT CTN 1102.[ADDRESS_147109] to non- transplant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130026]. 
Suitable donor is defined as either a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched related donor, or 
an 8/8 (HLA -A, -B, -C, and - DRB1) well matched unrelated donor. If no suitable donor is 
identified duri ng a 90 -day interval (from enrollment), subjects will be permanently assigned to 
the no donor arm. The 90- day interval was chosen based on the likelihood that a donor will be 
found, according to the median search times reported by [CONTACT_130090] 
(NMDP). Four hundred patients will be enrolled over roughly [ADDRESS_147110] of age & response to HMA on treatment effects. Figure [ADDRESS_147111] supportive care. Findings from this

This study will provide important information about the comparative effectiveness of alloHCT 
relative to standard care with HMA or best supportive care. The outcome measures include life 
years, quality -adjusted life years, health plan direct medical expenditure and patient out of 
pocket expenditure, and productivity impact. The primary analysis will c alculate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a measure that reflects expenditure per QALY gained. Results 
will be calculated over the plausible range of willingness to pay in the [LOCATION_002] (from 
$20,000 to $200,000 per QALY gained).20-[ADDRESS_147114] and quality of life outcomes for MDS patients treated 
with alloHCT23-31 and non- transplant therapy32-35. However, none of the previous studies 
included patients as old as age 75, or long- term tracking of outcomes. As a result, the findings 
of this ancillary study will be an important contribution to the literature by [CONTACT_130091] (age 50 -75), and t racking outcomes for up to [ADDRESS_147115] -
effectiveness of these two alternative options.  
 
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Objective 1  
From the perspective of the payer (health insurer), to determine direct medical expenditure 
associated with alloHCT and HMA or best supportive care over the course of the trial.  
a. Based on trial results, use modeling to estimate lifetime direct medical expenditures  
 
Hypothesis 1 : Direct medical expenditure will be significantly greater for patients who receive

in the ancillary CEA. This will involve a cooperative effort between transplant coordinators, CEA 
coordinating center staff at the Fred Hutchinson, and the SRG at CIBMTR.  
 
The SRG is already conducting the Quality of Life (QoL) assessments to be used in both the 
clinical study and the CEA. Therefore, communication about those patients enrolled in both 
studies will be necessary for the SRG to administer the additional surveys ascertaining cost 
data for the CEA.  
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_147121]. 
Search for a donor also begins at the time a patient signs their BMT CTN 1102 study consent 
form. If the patient’s bone marrow biopsy indicates they are not eligible for HCT, then they are 
not enrolled in the study, even though they have signed a consent form. If the patient’s bone 
marrow biopsy indicates they are eligible for HCT, the patient’s transplant center completes an 
enrollment form. The parent study’s Quality  of Life (QOL) survey time points are then based on 
that enrollment date, post -bone marrow biopsy.  
 
The enrollment date for the CEA ancillary study will also be the date a transplant center 
completes a parent study enrollment form, which may be up to 30 days after signing the consent 
forms for both the parent and ancillary studies. To be enrolled in the BMT CTN 1102 ancillary

Participants who consent to participate in BMT CTN 1102 will be given the option to participate 
in the parallel economic analysis. Those providing consent will be asked to provide the name(s) of their health insurer(s), the policy holder’s name [CONTACT_130117], the health insurance group 
number(s) and policy identification number(s) (we anticipate that some patients will have multiple insurance plans).  
This information will be used to request health care claims records from insurers for the period beginning 12- months prior to the date of enrollment, through [ADDRESS_147127] 42 -
months following  the date of enrollment. Claims will be requested from health insurers in 
batches with batch size dependent on patient accrual to the parent study and subsequent accrual into the CEA. Requests will be made regardless of outcome (i.e. for patients who remain in remission, relapse, or die).

unable to provide information due to illness; patients usually have a team of people supporting 
them in different capacities and at different times; and to encourage discussion, recall, and reconciliation of potential expenses.  These costs will include direct medical care costs for 
patients (e.g. copays, deductibles and uncovered medical bills) and direct non- medical patient

need for an internet connection or fluency with filling out online surveys.   
 
3.4.7  Measuring Quality Adjusted Life Years  
Quality of life and clinical data collected from the parent study will be used for the CEA study to 
provide an estimate for quality adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs make up the denominator of 
the ICER, the cost effectiveness measure for this study.  
 
The EQ-5D contains a five- item survey with three response levels per item measuring mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.  Since there are 5 
dimensions with 3 levels there are a total of 720 different health states, each with their own health utility value.  The health utility value is then multiplied by [CONTACT_130100]’s QALY. SF- 36 scores will also be converted to health 
state utilities using the SF6D algorithm i n order to calculate QALYs per patient.
40 We will 
estimate and compare results using the QALYs (and health utility values) estimated from both 
instruments since there is no single agreed upon “best” way to measure health state utilities. 
Measuring QALYs using these two approaches will allow us to evaluate the stability of estimates 
as a function of survey instrument selection.

CTotal = C Direct Medical Expenditures  
 
Reimbursement records will be used to measure health plan expenditure for MDS care. The trial 
includes MDS patients that are age 50 –  75, and a substantial proportion are expected to be

  Version 5.0 –  November  28, [ADDRESS_147137] -effectiveness from a broader s ocietal perspective 
that includes health plan expenditure, patient out of pocket expenditure, and patient productivity 
costs.  
 
CTotal = C Direct Medical Care Payer  + C Direct Medical Care Patient + C Direct Non -Medical Patient  
 
To avoid double counting, indirect productivity costs for patients will not be included in the ICER 
calculations but recorded separately (patient indirect productivity costs are captured in the 
QALY).  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_147138] between 
patients ( i.e. the incremental cost) who receive alloHCT and hypomethylating therapy or 
standard or care will be analyzed. In order to estimate potential differences in cost in the two 
arms of the BMT CTN [ADDRESS_147139] data are often highly skewed (e.g., small 
portions with very high costs), which calls into question the validity of a direct comparison of 
arithmetic means. Therefore, we will also eval uate differences in total costs of the two treatment 
strategies using non -parametric bootstrap methods42 and the Kaplan -Meier Sample Average 
estimation (KMSA) technique.[ADDRESS_147140] ( M) over the time period of interest as:  
 
 
 
where Si denotes the probability of the event occurring in the ith month  and  is the average 
cost among patients who are alive at the beginning of the ith month and is the estimated 
survival probability obtained from the Kaplan- Meier curve.  Specifically, is the estimated 
probability of being alive at the beginning of the ith month. Lin et al .43 demonstrate that the 
KMSA estimator is unbiased and consistent as long as (i) censoring is independent in time and 
(ii) the time intervals for the cost analysis are sufficiently narrow. The design of the treatment  
trial is consistent with independent censoring and the time intervals incorporated into cost data collection provide appropriately narrow time intervals. Lin et al . also show that the KMSA 
estimator is asymptotically normal with easily estimated variances , permitting standard two-
sample parametric testing.
43 For the purposes of this analysis, monthly time intervals will be 
used.  ∑=

4.2 Analysis of Effectiveness: Quality Adjusted Life Years  
Health state utilities derived from the EQ -5D. Secondary analyses will use the SF- 36 (using the 
SF-6D algorithm)40,46 to derive utilities. Utility scores will be combined with survival data from 
BMT CTN 1102, to calculate QALYs using the area under the curve method.44 The analysis of 
QALYs will follow the same analytic approach used for the analysis of; using KMSA for the base 
case followed by [CONTACT_130101]. Baseline health state utilities will be included as a 
covariate in multivariate analysis of the difference in QALYs between alloHCT and HMA or best 
supportive care to account for possible differences in baseline utility between groups.[ADDRESS_147142] Effectiveness  
If objectives 1 and 3 show either treatment alternative is less costly and more effective (greater 
QALYs) than the other alternative, it is said to dominate and no numerical estimate of 
incremental cost -effectiveness is required. Instead the estimated reduction in cost and 
improvement in quality -adjusted survival, and the associated uncertainty in these estimates, will 
be reported. If no strategy dominates, t he incremental difference in cost and/or QALYs, and the 
associated uncertainty in these estimates, will be reported.  
 
The incremental cost -effectiveness of one alternative over another is derived using the following 
formula:  
 
Incremental cost -effectivenes sA = (C A – CB )/(E A –EB) 
 
Where C A and C B refer to average total costs of each alternative and E A and E B refer to average 
total effectiveness for each alternative, respectively. The resulting incremental cost -
effectiveness ratio (ICER) can then be used to make a judgment on the value provided by 
[CONTACT_124774] A when compared to alternative B as it represents the investment required for each 
additional unit of effect gained.  
 All analyses of cost and effectiveness will be completed on an intent -to-treat basis .

within trial results, including: Weibull, Gompertz, exponential, log -normal and generalized 
gamma distributions.48 The base case analysis survival function will be selected using the 
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).[ADDRESS_147144] died within 6 months of their survey, we will use patient ’s 
baseline utility scores as an estimate for quality of life in the last [ADDRESS_147145] 
costs over a lifetime horizon modeled as described above, dividing costs into two periods: 
continuing care and death costs. Continuing care costs will be based on monthly trends in costs 
observed for those who have survived the year following treatment initiation or transplant. Death 
costs, defined as costs of care duri ng the last [ADDRESS_147146] died, will be 
based on costs of care observed for those who die during the year following treatment initiation 
or transplant. Costs will be modeled based on projected survival (see above).

evaluate the joint uncertainty in outcomes by [CONTACT_130102], 
propagating those values through the model, and obtaining the resulting distribution of 
incremental Q ALYs, incremental expenditure, and the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio. In 
this procedure we will assign mathematical distributions to all of the model inputs (hazard 
ratio=log -normal, expenditure=normal, quality of life=beta), conduct 10,000 Monte Carlo

  Version 5.0 –  November  28, [ADDRESS_147151] Counting and Discounting  
All costs will be converted to base year costs (2014, the year 1102 began enrolling patients). 
The medical consumer price index55 and the US Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Consumers56 will be used to covert d irect medical costs and non- medical costs, respectively. 
Costs and outcomes that occur 12- months post study entry, will be discounted at a rate of 3% 
annually with sensitivity analyses completed with discount rates of 1% and 5%.[ADDRESS_147152] medical care costs (payer) data is not anticipated. However, missing quality of 
life, out -of-pocket, productivity and caregiving cost data may occur for several reasons including 
entire surveys being incomplete due to censoring due to death or loss to follow up or intermittent patient non -response. If the amount of missing data exceeds 10% for any particular item, we will 
explore the mechanism of missingness. Random effects models will be used if data is missing 
completely at random (MCAR) and the presence of informative missingness is assumed. Under 
the assumption that the data are missing at random (MAR),
[ADDRESS_147153]-effectiveness analysis is determined by [CONTACT_130103], BMT CTN 1102 and by [CONTACT_130104] a matched donor within 90 days of enrollment in the parent study. Assuming 
that 80% of BMT CTN 1 102 participants agree to enroll in the economic study, and a 10% loss 
to follow up over the study period, the targeted sample size is 270 ([ADDRESS_147154]) 
if donor availability is 60%. If donor availability is 70%, the targeted sample size is 320 ([ADDRESS_147155]).  
 The primary research question is whether costs and/or effects, measured as QALYs, differ 
between MDS patients age 50 –  [ADDRESS_147156] at the Medical College of Wisconsin ($172,532 (95% CI: $79,618- $265,446), SD=$92,914) and the mean disease- attributable direct medical 
expenditure of MDS patients receiving HMA presented in Wang et al.
58 Minimally clinically 
important difference in QALYs based on utility values provided by [CONTACT_20367] -5D and SF- 6D (0.147, 
SD 0.294) were used to estimate the expected difference in effects,[ADDRESS_147157] of 0.25.  
 
Estimates of power for ICERs use the Incremental Net Benefit (INB) method to calculate the 
point estimate and confidence interval.[ADDRESS_147158] of 
whether the net monetary benefit is significantly different from zero by [CONTACT_746] a sensitivity 
analysis of the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold. Because there is not an explicit WTP 
threshold in the [LOCATION_002], we will evaluate INB over a plausible range of WTP values 
ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 (Table 3).  
The results of the power calculations show that regardless of the assumptions used, the 
difference in costs and effects between the treatments with the target sa mple size results in 
power of >0.98 for all analyses.

INFORMED CONSENT
Study Title : Ancillary Cost- Effectiveness Study to BMT CTN 1102  
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_130033], MD, PhD; Email: [EMAIL_2562] ;  
Tel: (206) 667- 7846  
 
Mailing Address:  [ADDRESS_147179] N, MS: M3- B232; Seattle, WA [ADDRESS_147180] -Effectiveness Research (Optional)  
This section of the consent form is about 
cost-effectiveness  research  that will look at 
how much you and your insurance pay for your treatment . The researchers want to 
understand how much different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130034]. You may choose to let the researchers 
collect information on the cost of your 
treatment for this study  if you want to.  
You can still be a part of the main study 
(health evaluations by [CONTACT_648]) even if you 
say 'no' to give information on the cost of 
your treatment.  
Study purpose:  The study doctors want to 
learn more about the costs of the two types of treatments that are being compared in the main study: 1) transplant from a well matched fami ly donor or unrelated donor; 
and, 2) blood transfusion and drug therapy 
only (no transplant) .  
This research will help doctors understand the cost -effectiveness of these treatments. In 
particular, researchers want to know if costs are a problem for patient s and their families. 
They also want to know how out -of-pocket 
financial costs (costs not covered by [CONTACT_123864]) differ by [CONTACT_130107]. This will help them understand cost barriers for patients with different treatments.  
Lead study doctor : Scott Ramsey of the 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle is the lead study doctor for the cost -
effectiveness research. [CONTACT_130121] is a medical doctor and well -known health 
economist who has studied costs of many different cancer treatments.  
Your health insurance and out -of-pocket 
medical costs: If you agree to join this study, 
we will ask for the following information 
about your health insurance:  
1) Type  
2) Provider  
3) Policy number  
4) Group number  
5) Policy holder’s name [CONTACT_18131]. 
We will also want to know about your out -of-
pocket costs. The out -of-pocket costs you and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  RIC Allo vs. Hypometh/Best Supportive Care  in MDS –  Protocol 1102  
  Version 5.0 –  November  28, [ADDRESS_147181] this information as 
well. For example, we want to k now how 
much you spend on:  
1) Medical costs (for example, co -pays, 
prescriptions)  
2) Travel and lodging  
3) Cost of time away from work  
Your health insurance and out -of-pocket 
information is called the ‘study data’ in this 
consent form.  
How we will use your health  insurance 
information: After you finish the study, we 
will use your insurance information to learn 
about the payments  your health insurer made. 
We will calculate the cost of your medical 
care (both groups that are being compared, 
the transplant group and the no transplant 
group ). Because treatment (either transplant 
or non -transplant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) can impact your 
health for many years after you join the 
study, we want to collect insurance payment  
information for the 12 months before you 
joined the study,  and for 3 years after your 
treatment start date .   
Privacy, confidentiality and use of 
information:  Only the study doctors at the 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  
(FHCRC)  will have access to your health 
insurance information and out -of-pocket cost 
information (study data). The FHCRC will 
contract with the Survey Research Group 
(SRG) at the CIBMTR to collect out -of-
pocket cost data, who are also administering 
the telephone health surveys as part of the parent study. To maintain your 
confidentiality, w e will not link your name [CONTACT_130118]. Also, all of the study doctors 
signed a confidentiality agreement and promised to keep electronic data protected under passwords and physical data (paper or 
other media such as CDs) in secure facilities 
(for exa mple, on -campus locked offices and 
locked filing cabinets).   
Collecting the study data: We will collect 
your health insurance information at the time 
of study enrollment. O ut-of-pocket  cost data 
will be collected by [CONTACT_2319]- out survey . The 
mail- out surveys  were designed to be very 
user friendly, but w e will help you with the 
cost diary over the phone if needed. We will also place phone call  reminders.  
We will ask you about your out -of-pocket 
costs only 3 times during the course of the 
study: at 1, [ADDRESS_147182] : We ask that you give us 
the name [CONTACT_130119] . This m ay be 
your spouse, partner, parent, adult child or sibling, or friend.  You may not feel like 
answering the questionnaires or need help gathering cost information, so we ask that this individual  help with this information    
Risks to participating: The risks to participating in the cost- effectiveness study 
are small. A possible risk is the loss of confidentiality about your medical 
information , but t he chance that this

Right to ask questions and/or withdraw: 
You do not have to be part of the cost -
effectiveness research study. Your 
participation is voluntary . If you decide not 
to be part of this study, it will not affect your 
regular medical care or services. You can 
quit the study at any time.

ssessments  
4.5.1 Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events:   
Following the first laser  treatment, adverse device effects (ADEs) will be assessed post -treatment and at 
each subsequent subject visit using the following  scale:  
 
1= mild: requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the Subject’s daily activities.  
2= moderate: may cause some interference with functioning.  
3= severe: interrupts Subject’s usual daily activity and may require treatment.  
4.5.[ADDRESS_691986]’s face  at baseline, prior to all laser 
treatments and at both follow -up visits . Any jewelry will be removed from the area being photographed. 
Hair will be pulled away from the face with a headband and subject will have recently cleansed skin. Facial 
photographs wil l be obtained from 3 angles: with the subject facing forward, 45° to the right  and 45° to 
the left. Photographs will be taken in the same windowless room equipped with adequate lighting. The room lighting, camera positioning and subject positioning should be consistent for all study visit 
photographs. Digital camera settings should remain the same for all photographs and the highest 
resolution settings should be utilized.

 Enrolled subjects who received at least one treatment will be included in the safety analyses.  Device -
related and procedure -related adverse effects (AEs) and subjects who prematurely terminate from the 
study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment- related pain ratings, as reported on case 
report forms will be tabulated and analyzed . For a given AE term, counting will be done by [CONTACT_1130], not by 
[CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once, the event will be counted only once, at the 
most severe and most -related occurrence.  The number and percentage of subjects expe riencing each AE 
Term will be descriptively summarized. Statistical hypothesis testing will not be performed for safety data.

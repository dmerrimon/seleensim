TITLE  Tolerability and efficacy of daylight aminolevulinic -acid-photodynamic 
therapy (ALA -PDT) compared with conventional ALA -PDT for 
treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp

NUMBER OF SITES  1 
  RATIONALE  Actinic keratoses (AK) are common precancerous skin lesions that 
arise on sun- damaged skin. Treatment is aimed at preventing 
progression to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). First -line 
therapy for clinically apparent lesions includes cryotherapy and 
curettage; and field therapy options are topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5- fluorouracil, 
imiquimod, ing enol mebutate, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT 
involves the topi[INVESTIGATOR_866696] (ALA), or one 
of its derivatives, as a photosensitizing agent. In response, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_866697], dysplastic cells preferentially accumulate 
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by [CONTACT_866712], singlet oxygen species are produced, resulting in cell death. 
PDT is beneficial due to its brief treatment course and efficacy in 
clearing AK. However, its main drawbacks are the adverse effects of 
pain, burning, pruritus, erythema, crusting, and inflammation 
associated with treatment. While conventional PDT uses red or blue 
artificial light to activate a high concentration of accumulated 
protoporphyrins, daylight PDT uses natural daylight to a ctivate lower 
levels of protoporphyrins in a continuous manner. Daylight PDT, 
when compared with conventional PDT, has been associated with 
significantly less pain while achieving comparable effiacy for the 
treatment of AK. Daylight PDT is also more cost- effective and 
reduces the amount of time spent in clinic. Previous  randomized 
studies comparing daylight PDT with conventional PDT have largely 
used methyl -aminolevulinate as the photosensitizer, have been intra -
individual comparative studies, and have been performed in Nordic 
countries. Because the effective light dose from natural daylight 
depends on geographic location and seasonal and weather changes, 
randomized trials in different geographic and environmental 
conditions are of interest . The proposed randomized clinical trial 
investigates the tolerability and efficacy of daylight ALA -PDT for the 
treatment of AK in San Francisco for the first time; subjects will be 
randomized to various treatment arms, as opposed to previous split -
face and intra- individual  studies.

  EVALUATIONS   
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  Primary objective is to determine whether daylight PDT affords a  
reduction in treatment symptoms of pain, stinging/burning, and 
itching/pruritus.   
Primary endpoints will be : 
 1) peak symptom level and composite score  during the treatment 
period  
 2) symptom level and composite score at the end of treatment 
exposure.  
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS  1) To determine  efficacy in cl earance of AK at 12 weeks:  
A. percent reduction in number of AK s from baseline to 12 weeks  
B. proportion of subjects with complete and partial clearance of 
AKs as described above  
2) To determine whether daylight PDT affords , at end of treatment, a 
reduction in composite loc al skin reaction  
3) To determine whether daylight PDT has a faster resolution of 
composite treatment symptoms and local skin response during  
days 8, 29, and 84.  
 
    STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Symptom level over time during the treatment period will be graphed 
for visualization along the three axes of pain, stinging/burning, and 
itching/pruritus as well as a composite symptom score. Peak symptom 
level during the treatment period and pain at the  end of treatment 
exposure will be compared between the conventional treatment arm 
(A), the combination treatment arm B), and the daylight treatment arm 
(C), with unpaired t -tests.  
 
Percent reduction in the number of actinic keratoses and proportions 
of pa tients with partial and complete clearance of actinic keratoses 
will be presented descriptively and visualized as histograms.  We will 
compare the percent reduction in the number of AKs and the 
proportions of patients with clearance between the conventiona l 
treatment arm (A) and the combination treatment arm B), and between 
the conventional treatment arm (A) and the daylight treatment arm 
(C), using unpaired t -tests.

2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
The risks of aminolevulinic acid HCl are primarily local site reactions such as pain, 
erythema, burning, pruritus, and crusting. These typi[INVESTIGATOR_866701] 1 of treatment. 
Adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients treated with aminolevulinic acid were 
erythema, crusted skin, desquamation, burning, sting ing, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], pruritus, skin erosi on. In 1 -10% of treated patients , edema, 
dysesthesia, local flare, urticaria, localized vesiculation, drug eruption, dermal ulcer, 
scabbing, excoriation, oozing , hemorrhage, localized tenderness, or local pain  were 
reported . As muc ous membrane irritation and ocular injury are risks of treatment, the eyes 
and mucous membranes will be avoided. During artificial light treatment, the subject, 
health care personnel, and all present will wear appropriate eye protection; all will be 
counseled to avoid looking directly at the light source. Due to photosensitization 
associated wi th treatment, patients will be advised to avoid sunlight and prolonged or 
intense light that is not part of the treatment regimen for 40 hours.  
Photodynamic therapy with ALA has accepted benefits for the treatment of AK which 
outweigh the risks. Other fiel d treatments require a longer duration of therapy and require 
patient compliance at home. Participants in this study will benefit from ALA -PDT, either 
illuminated by [CONTACT_866716] -U blue light phototherapy 
illuminator .

11 ADVERSE EVENTS  REPORTING AND DOCUM ENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clin ical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s  Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_1209123] the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
 
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4 .0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be  
found in the study manual.  If the event  is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious. 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The  subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/thera py required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threaten ing (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse event  as it occurred. 
This does not refer to an event  that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug Comment 
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_866709]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].

explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes l isted.  
 
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug)  per 
UCSF IRB Guidelines .  The collecti on period for a ll SAEs  will begin  after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
In accordance with the standard operating  procedures and policies  of the local Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB) , the site investigator will r eport  SAEs to  the IRB .

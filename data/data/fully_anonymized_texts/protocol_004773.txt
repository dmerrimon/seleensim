Use of Electrical Impedance Tomography for Optimization of 
Positive End -Expi[INVESTIGATOR_893316]  
 
1 Background  
Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) is a common condition in the  intensive 
care unit [1] which requires invasive mechanical ventilation. Because the administration 
of mechanical breaths from the ventilator can exacerbate lung injury, patients with ARDS are treated with lung protective ventilation (LPV), which entails  providing a low 
tidal volume in order to maintain a plateau pressure under 30 cm H2O [2]. LPV decreases lung inflammation as a means of improving outcomes [2,3]. In ARDS, the distribution of delivered gas via mechanical ventilation is heterogeneous: there are areas of atelectatic lung which are not ventilated and this accounts for the refractory hypoxemia seen in ARDS.  
 Efforts to recruit areas of atelectatic lung via the administration of a high positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) have been employed in an attempt to further improve the outcome of patients with ARDS; but this has met with mixed results [4,5].  On a breath 
by [CONTACT_152233], during mechanical ventilation with ARDS and PEEP some areas of the lung may become over -distended, ostensibly worsening lung injury, a phenomenon 
called tidal hyperinflation [6]. In addition, patients with ARDS receiving LPV c an develop 
ventilator asynchrony which results in the intermittent development of potentially injurious large tidal volumes [7,8].  
 In ARDS, there is also heterogeneity between patients: some patients respond to PEEP with recruitment of atelectatic lung r egions and improvement in gas exchange while 
others do not [9]. Ideally, mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients would be individualized  such that the right amount of airway pressure is applied to each patient, 
maximizing recruitment while avoiding potenti ally harmful over -distension and tidal 
hyperinflation.  
 At present, it is unknown how to make the best tradeoff between lung recruitment and over-distension. The best work in this area has been performed utilizing CT scanning, a 
tool not routinely available to clinicians [9,10]. The work of Chiumello, using CT 
scanning, has suggested the best tradeoff among four different approaches to mechanical ventilation in ARDS is the PEEP table utilized in the Canadian LOVS trial [10,11 ].   
 Electrical impedan ce tomography (EIT) offers an opportunity to evaluate regional lung 
ventilation at the patient’s bedside [12 -14].  Although EIT has been utilized to assess 
the distribution of lung ventilation in ARDS patients, large clinical trials are lacking. Single -center pi[INVESTIGATOR_893317] a determination regarding whether 
ventilator optimization via EIT improves clinical outcomes. Lung protective ventilation 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  7 results in some mitigation of lung inflammation and can  be a useful surrogate endpoint 
in smaller trials [3,1 5].  Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from intubated 
patients with ARDS are studied for biomarkers of lung inflammation which reflect the 
relative success or failure of different forms of mecha nical ventilation to protect the lung 
from additional injury.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1251066] only assessed the distribution of 
ventilation and not whether lung inflammation is decreased. Our research goals are to assess markers of lung inflammation: IL- 6, IL-8, TNFR1, sRAGE, SP -D, Angiopoentin- 2, 
and VWF in conjunction with ventilator changes made in ARDS patients correlated with EIT in order to determine whether the optimization of mechanical ventilation may be achieved by [CONTACT_77203].  
 
One arm of the protocol will have best PEEP determined by [CONTACT_893339] a PEEP/FiO2 combination table, similar to the one used in the LOVS protocol  
[11]. A modified version of the LOVS’s  table (High -PEEP) has been incorporated into 
the University of Michigan ARDS protocol.  EIT findings will be determined but the 
bedside respi[INVESTIGATOR_893318]. Alternatively,  in the second arm of the protocol , EIT will be used to determine 
the best PEEP – i.e. the PEEP level at which recruitment is maximized and over -
distension minimized. Lung inflammatory markers obtained at [ADDRESS_1251067] recruitment via EIT will be compared with markers obtained 6 hours after the time when PEEP h ad 
been guided by [CONTACT_893340] -PEEP table.   In addition, following crossover to the opposite 
group,  biomarkers will be obtained after an  additional 14 to 18 hours.  
 
2 Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
• To compare the effect of EIT in patients with moderate to severe  and severe  
ARDS for the optimization of PEEP titration with standard PEEP titration using the High-PEEP table on changes in relevant physiological and biomarker 
outcomes.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
• The BAL fluid will be examined for the pr esence of monocytes to determine 
whether mini -BAL is an effective method for collecting this type of specimen for 
future research.  
 
2.3 Primary Hypothesi s 
• The use of electric al impedance tomography (EIT) to titrate positive end-
expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) will result in less lung inflammation and better physiologic parameters than use of the High -PEEP table in patients with 
moderate to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS).

5 Study Procedures  
5.0 Study  Design:   
Single -center, prospective, 2- arm, unblinded, randomized, cross -over clinical trial.    
 5.1. Study Initiation  
At the time of randomization all study subjects will be receiving the standard University of Michigan ARDS protocol high PEEP arm (Appendix B).  All patients will receive lung protective ventilation (LPV), attempting to achieve a plateau pressure (Pplat) <  30 cm 
H2O with tidal volume by [CONTACT_893341] 8 cc/kg and as low as 4 cc/kg in so doing.  
 Following randomization patients will undergo a mini -BAL according the methodology 
undertaken by [CONTACT_893342] [16] prior to institution of the protocol arm.  
 5.1.2 Mini -BAL Procedure  
After the administration of sedation, consisting of an increase in the baseline amount of propofol or midazolam already being administered, local anesthesia will be administered by [CONTACT_89062] 1 -3 cc aliquots of 2% lidocaine via the endotracheal tube port.   The use of 
local anesthesia is optional and will only be administered if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_893343].  
 
1. FiO2 will be increased to 1.0 ten (10) minutes prior to the start of the procedure.  
• Mini-BAL will not be performed if the P/F ratio is < 100 or the imputed S/F  
(Appendix G) ratio is less than 89. [ 17] 
• Mini-BAL will not be performed if the platelet count < 50 K/uL.  
2. Sedation with appropriate increases in propofol or midazolam will be made prior to insertion of the catheter.  
3. When diffuse infiltrates are seen on chest radiography , the mini -BAL catheter will 
be directed toward the right middle or lower lobes. When an ar ea of localized 
pulmonary infiltrate is present the mini -BAL catheter will be directed toward the 
lower lobe of the opposite lung.  
4. A Halyard  mini- BAL catheter will be inserted into the endotracheal tube and 
blindly advanced to the area noted above in #3.

group will continue to receive mechanical ventilation according to the University of Michigan ARDS protocol H igh-PEEP arm  (Appendix C) .  Confirmatio n will be 
made to assure compliance with the High- PEEP table.  
2. Approximately six hours after randomization a second mini -BAL will be 
performed (5.1.2 above).  
3. Following completion of the second mini -BAL procedure Usual Care First 
patients will crossover and receive PEEP titration by [CONTACT_893344] ( see 5.1.5 below) for an 
additional 14- [ADDRESS_1251073] mini -BAL has been performed and the patient will 
return to mechanical ventilation PEEP titration via the University of Michigan ARDS protocol high PEEP arm .  All ventilator management will return to the 
clinical team.  
 
5.1.4 Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) F irst Group 
1. Following completion of the initial mini- BAL, patients in the EIT  first group will 
have best PEEP determined by  [CONTACT_893344] (see 5.1. 5 below).    
2. Approximately six hours after randomization a second mini -BAL will be 
performed (5.1.2 above).  
3. Between initial PEEP setting and the [ADDRESS_1251074] mini -BAL has been performed and the patient will continue to be receive 
mechanical ventilation PEEP titration via the University of Michigan ARDS protocol high PEEP arm . All ventilator management will return to the clinical 
team.  
 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  12 5.1.5 EIT PEEP Titration  
Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non -invasive, non- radioactive, 
bedside imaging tool .  EIT entails the use of a belt like apparatus which is placed 
circumferentially around a patient’s chest.  A small, imperceptible current is 
applied and regional voltages are subsequently measured to determine ventilation related impedance changes across the thoracic cross section created by [CONTACT_275711].  Reconstruction algorithms are then utilized to generate real time tomographic images on a breath by [CONTACT_152233] . The Drager Pulmovista 500, 
which is commercially available in Europe and Canada will be used for the generation of EIT images (Appendix D ).   
 
In a review of the recent EIT literature, we found 7 studies [18-22] using the 
Drager EIT device in adults to either provide feedback on the effects of PEEP or to determine a specific level to s et PEEP (see Appen dix E).  All [ADDRESS_1251075] pressure level (recruitment maneuver) to open the maximum number of lung units for that pressure and then gradually 
reduced the end- expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (decremental PEEP) to observe the 
patterns of variation in ventilation.   
 
The most common EIT variables used to assess PEEP include:  
1. Regional compliance: it is analogous to dynamic compliance, but rather 
than using a change in tidal volume in the numerator, it uses the tidal impedance variation ( TIV).  Also, dynamic and static compliance are 
global measurements, while EIT regional compli ance reflects the 
compliance in each of the four regions of interest (generally dorsal, medial -dorsal, medial -ventral and ventral)  
2. EELI  (end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_893322]): it is analogous to the end-
expi[INVESTIGATOR_893323] (FRC)  
3. ODCL  (overdistension- collapse): this index estimates the percentage and 
location of lung overdistension and atelectasis (collapse) during a decremental PEEP trial  
4. GI (global inhomogeneity) index : this quantifies the ventilation distribution 
in the lungs and provides information on the degree of homogeneity of lung ventilation  
5. COV  (center of ventilation): it reflects the distribution of regional ventilation 
in a dependent -to-non-dependent direction  
 Patient preparation:  
1. The patient should be sedated adequat ely to suppress respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266].  
2. The EIT belt will be placed at the level of the 5
th intercostal space.  A period of 5-
10 minutes will be allowed for electrode stabilization and calibration.  
 PEEP Titration Procedure:  
1. The procedure involves two phases: a recruitment phase followed by a gradual reduction in the end- expi[INVESTIGATOR_893324] e (Decremental PEEP) . 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  13 2. Recruitment Phase: Pressure control with a drive pressure of 15 cm H2O and 
PEEP of 20 cm H2O (ie, 35/20) will be applied for 5- 10 breaths and then 
increased to a PEEP of 25 cm H2O (ie, 40/25) for 1 minute.  
3. Decremental PEEP: In volume control, VT will be se t to 6 mL/kg PBW and PEEP 
to 20.  Every  5-10 minutes , PEEP will be reduced by 2 cm H2O.  PEEP will be 
reduced until one of the following occurs: 1) drop in EELI in any region during the stabilization period by >10%, 2) PEEP = 5 cm H2O, or 3) patient develops hemodynamic instability or SpO2 <88%.  
4. The best EIT -PEEP is identified as that which demonstrates the best 
compromise in over -distension (OD) and collapse (CL), as determine by [CONTACT_893345].  
 5.1.6 Rescue Procedures  
If PaO2 ≥ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≥ 8 8% with  FIO2 of 1.0  cannot be maintained or if acidosis 
is severe and cannot be controlled, and alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (rescue procedures ) can be 
employed. Rescue procedures  will be chosen according to the University of Michigan 
ARDS protocol  (Appendix  C), and may include repeated recruitm ent maneuvers, prone 
positioning,  neuromuscular blockade, inhaled nitric oxide,  inhaled epoprostenol sodium, 
airway pressure release ventilation, high frequency ventilation, or ECMO.   5.1.7 Other Aspects of C are 
All other aspects of care such as fluids, antibiotics etc. will be determined by [CONTACT_893346].

6.3 Assessments During Study  
The following data will provide the basis for assessing protocol compliance and safety as well as between- group dif ferences in several efficacy variables. Data for each of the 
variables will be recorded at the times  shown in the Time -Events schedule (Appendix 
F).   
 It is expected that setting PEEP using EIT will take between 20- 40 minutes and 5- 10 
minutes using the High -PEEP table. T o standardize the time from new PEEP exposure 
until inflammatory mediators are obtained, t ime 0 is defined as the time at which the 
PEEP setting is finally estab lished .  Hour 6 is subsequently six hours after PEEP is 
initially established and the time of the 2
nd mini-BAL.  Time 0 resets at the point of 
crossover, as the time at which the new PEEP level is established.  (see Appendix F )

EIT 
January 16, 2020  16 7 Statistical Considerations  
This study will compare the physiologic and biomarker endpoints from various  time 
points:  Usual care first and EIT first groups will be compared with each other at 
baseline and between groups at 6 hours.  The 6 -hour crossover point will yield a 
comparison between groups 14- 18 hours later, at the completion of the protocol as well 
as a comparison between groups from the 6- hour crossover point.  Quantitative, 
normally distributed variables such as cytokine levels and P/F ratio will be tested via t -
test.  Qua ntitative, non -normally distributed variables such as driving pressure and 
plateau will be tested via Mann Whitney test.  Categorical  variables, such as cause of 
ARDS will be tested via Chi- square. 
 
[ADDRESS_1251081]’s FiO2 will be increased to 1.0 ten ( 10) minutes 
prior to the start of the procedur e.  Mini -BAL will not be performed if the P/F ratio is < 
100 or the imputed S/F ratio is less  than 89.  Mini-BAL will not be performed if the 
platelet count < 50 K/uL.  During performance of the mini -BAL t he procedure will be 
terminated for a saturation <89% sustained for greater than [ADDRESS_1251082] for the ART trial, which used a 
decremental P EEP approach following an aggressive high pressure, long duration 
recruitment maneuver.  This was felt to be largely accountable to the aggressive recruitment maneuver, which will not be used as part of this protocol. [25] Recruitment 
maneuvers in both groups  (if required in  the High -PEEP group during routine 
management)  will be performed in accordance with University of Michigan protocol 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  17 (Appendix I).  High -PEEP management will also follow our standard University of 
Michigan guidelines for clinical practice.  
 
9.3 Risk  of Death  
It is unlikely that one treatm ent arm may lead to more deaths; mortality will be monitored 
during the course of the 24- hour study, but is not a clinical outcome of this trial.  
 9.4 Minimization  of Risks  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111(a)(1) require that risks to subjects are minimized 
by [CONTACT_196750]. Oxygen 
saturations and arterial blood gases, if indicated, will be monitored during the mini -BAL 
procedures.  We will use  a high PEEP protocol based on those used in multiple large 
clinical trials, that were shown safe, feasible, and of potential clinical benefit  for the 
intended population or moderate to severe ARDS . The DSMB will be reviewing data as 
outlined above and will examine not only efficacy but safety (inclusive of mortality) and will reserve the right to halt the study at any time.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1251083] clinicians.  Titration of PEEP by [CONTACT_893344], if anything, should be safer than using the customary PEEP table insofar as it provides real time insight into whether lung zones are being over ventilated and manifesting tidal hyperinflation.  
 9.6 Risks  in Relation to Anticipated Benefits  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46. 111 (a)(2) require that “the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expect ed to result.”  Based on the preceding 
assessment of risks and potential benefits, the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.   
 Procedures  – Mini-BAL can result in transient worsening of hypoxemia. This is usually 
transient in nature. Mini -BAL will not be performed for a P/F ratio <100 or an S/F ratio 
<89 and will be terminated for a S/F ratio of <[ADDRESS_1251084] atelets < 50 
K/uL.  
 Treatments  – High PEEP is routinely used in clinical practice. The EIT belt is 
noninvasive and minimally discomforting to wear. There is potential for benefit to society and individual patients should EIT  prove to be result in less lung inflammation and a 
large clinical trial were to demonstrate clinical benefit.  
 
 
EIT 
January 16, [ADDRESS_1251085] is entered into the study.  
 10.1 Selection  of Subjects  
10.1.1 Equitable Selection of Subjects  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46(a)(3) require the equitable selection of subjects. The Emergency department and Critical Care Medic ine Unit  will be screened to determine if 
any patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data that have been collected as part of the routine management of the subject will be revi ewed to determine eligibility. No 
protocol -specific tests nor procedures will be performed as part of the screening 
process.  If any subjects meet criteria for study enrollment, then the attending physician 
will be asked for permission to approach the patient or his/her LAR for informed 
consent. Study  exclusion criteria neither unjustly exclude classes of individuals from 
participation in the research nor unjustly include classes of individuals from  participation 
in the research.  Hence, the recruitment of subjects conforms to the principle of 
distributive justice.  
 10.1.2 Ju stification of Including Vulnerable Subjects   
The present research aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of a type of treatment for patients with ARDS .  Due to the nature of ARDS and its risk factors ( e.g., sepsis, 
trauma) , the vast majority of these  patients will have impaire d decision- making 
capabilities.  This study cannot be conducted if limited to enroll ing only those subjects 
with ret ained decision- making capacity.  Hence, subjects recruited for this trial are not 
being unfairly burdened with involvement in this research simply because they are easily available.  
 10.2 Informed  Consent  
Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.111(a)(5) require that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative (LAR). As we will enroll critically ill, intubated patients, we anticipate almost all consents will be 
from the subject’s LAR, and thus the remainder of this section will focus on LARs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the LAR  understands the risks and benefits 
of participating in the study, and answering any questions the LAR  may have throughout 
the study and sharing any new information in a timely manner that may be relevant to the LAR ’s willingness to continue the subject’s  participation in the trial. The consenter 
will make every effort to minimize coercion. All study participants or their LARs will be 
informed of the objectives of the study and the potential risks. The informed consent document will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study participation to the LAR 
in simple terms before the patient is entered into the study, and to document that the LAR is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in 
the study and desires to participate in the study.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by [CONTACT_893347] . This includes obtaining the 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  19 appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent document prior to the 
performance of any protocol procedures.  
 10.3 Withdrawal of Consent  
Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by [CONTACT_191647] ) from the trial at any time 
without prejudice. Data recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be included in the trial analysis, unless consent to use th eir data has also been withdrawn.   
 10.[ADDRESS_1251086]’s legally authorized representative.   
 Regarding proxy consent, the existing federal research regulations (‘the Common Rule’) states at 45 CFR 46.116 that “no investigator may involve a human being as a  subject 
in research…unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative”; and defines at 45 CFR 46 102 (c) a legally authorized representative (LAR) as “an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s participation in the procedures(s) involved in the research.”  OHRP defined 
examples of “applicable law” as being state statutes, regulations, case law, or formal opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a State Attorney General that addresses the issue of surrogate consent to medical procedures. Such “applicable law” could then be considered as empowering the 
LAR to provide consent for subject participation in the r esearch.  
 According to a previous President’s Bioethics Committee (National Bioethics Advisory Committee), an investigator should accept as an LAR…a relative or friend of the potential subject who is recognized as an LAR for purposes of clinical decision making under the law of the state where the research takes place (National Bioethics Advisory Commitee (NBAC), 1998) . Finally, OHRP has opi[INVESTIGATOR_299360] a 
surrogate could serve as a LAR for research decision making if such an individual is authorized under applicable state law to provide consent for the “procedures” involved in the research study  (Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), 2002) .      
 10.[ADDRESS_1251087] two ethical 
convictions; first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that person with diminished autono my are entitled to protection. One method that 
serves to protect subje cts is restrictions on the participation of subjects in research that 
presents greater than minimal risks. Commentators and Research Ethics Commissions have held the view that it is permissible to include incapable subjects in greater than minimal risk res earch as long as there is the potential for beneficial effects and that the 
research presents a balance of risks and expected direct benefits similar  to that 
available in the clinical setting (Dresser, 1999) . Several U.S. task forces have deemed it 
is permissible to include incapable subjects in research.  For example, the American 
 
EIT 
January 16, 2020  20 College of Physicians’ document allows surrogates to consent to research inv olving 
incapable subjects only “if the net additional risks of participation are not substantially  
greater than the risks of standard treatment.” (American College of Physici ans, 1989) . 
Finally, the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) stated that an IRB may 
approve a protocol that presents greater than minimal risk but offers the prospect of direct medical benefits to the subject, provided that…the potential subjec t’s LAR gives 
permission…” (National Bioethics Advisory Commi ttee (NBAC), 1998)  
 Consistent with the above ethical sensibilities regarding the participation of decisionally incapable subjects in research and the previous assessment of ri sks and benefits in the 
previous section, the present trial presents a balance of risks and potential direct benefits that is similar  to that available in the clinical setting, with the exception of the 
additional blood draws.     
 10.6 Additional Safeguar ds for Vulnerable Subjects   
The present research will involve subjects who might be vulnerable t o coercion or 
undue influence. As required in 45CFR46.111(b), we recommend that additional 
safeguards be included to protect the rights and welfare of these su bjects. Such 
safeguards might include, but are not limited to: a) assessment of the potential subject’s capacity to provide informed consent, b) requirement for subject’s assent, c) the availability of the LAR to monitor the subject’s subsequent participation and withdrawal 
from the study; d) augmented consent processes.  
 
10.7 Confidentiality  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46 111 (a) (7) requires that when appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintai n the confidentiality 
of data. To maintain confidentiality, study related data and reports will identify subjects by a coded number only . Only t he study research teams  will have access to the codes. 
All records will be kept in a secure password protected c omputer.  All computer entry 
and networking programs will be done with coded numbers only. All paper case report 
forms will be maintained in a locked cabinet inside a locked office.  Clinical information 
will not be released without the written permission of the patient . 
 
11 Adverse Event s  
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. Each participating investigator has primary responsibility for the safety of the individual participants under his or her care. The Investigators will determine daily if any clinical adver se experiences 
occur during the period from enrollment through the end of the protocol, 24 hours after enrollment .   
 The following adverse events will be collected in the adverse event case report forms:  
• Serious adverse events  
• Non-serious adverse events t hat are considered by [CONTACT_893348] 16, 2020  21 • Adverse events that lead to permanent discontinuation of the study 
procedures  
A clinical trial adverse event is any untoward medical event associated with the use of a 
drug or study procedure in humans, whether or not it is considered related to a drug or study procedure.    If a patient's treatment is discontinued as a result of an adverse event, study site personnel must report the circumstances and data leading to discontinuation of treatment in the adverse event case report forms.   
 Clinical Outcomes  
Routine  clinical outc omes  of ARDS  are exempt from  adverse event reporting unless the 
investigator deems the event to be related to the conduct of study procedures . The 
following are examples of events that will be considered clinical outcomes:  
• Death related to ARDS or a sequela of ARDS based on the interpretation 
of the investigator.  
• Cardiovascular events: the need for vasoactive drugs or fluids for hypotension or hypotension.  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]: decreased PaO 2/FiO2, hypoxia, worsening acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] s yndrome, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], unless related to 
performance of the mini -BALs.  
• Hepatic events: hepatic injury or liver dysfunction that leads to an increase from baseline in the serum level of bilirubin.  
• Renal events: renal failure, renal insufficiency,  or renal injury that leads to 
an increase from baseline in serum creatinine.  
• Hematologic/coagulation events: coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis.  
• Systemic inflammatory response syndrome related cri teria: tachypnea, 
tachypnea, leukocytosis, leukopenia, hypothermia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, or bradycardia that does not meet the definition of severe and 
prolonged.  
Note: Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, heart block, ventricular tachycardia or 
ventricular fibrillation are not considered clinical outcomes and should be recorded as adverse events if they are serious events, are considered by [CONTACT_893349] , or lead to discontinuation of the protocol.  
 Serious Adve rse Events  
Serious adverse event collection begins after the patient or surrogate has signed informed consent.  If a patient experiences a serious adverse event after consent, but prior to protocol initiation, the event will NOT be collected unless the inv estigator feels 
the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  
 
 
EIT 
January 16, [ADDRESS_1251088] alert the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_893325] 24 hours of investigator awareness 
of the event .   
 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes and is not classified as a clinical outcome of ARDS using the definitions noted above:  
• Death that is not related to ARDS or a sequela of ARDS or death that is 
considered by [CONTACT_274432]  
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Impo rtant medical events that may not result  in death or be life- threatening may be 
considered serious adverse events when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Board This study will use a DSMB  to regularly monitor data from this trial, review and assess 
the performance of its operations, and make recommendations .  Three members of the 
Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Division of Acute Care Surgery 
and/or Division of Emergency Critical Care who are not involved in this project will independently review this study on a semi -annual basis.

January 16, 2020  30 G. Imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 
 
 
 
The table is used when an ABG is not available to calculate the PaO 2/FiO 2.  Instead , the 
SpO 2 and FiO 2 are used to impute what the PaO 2/FiO [ADDRESS_1251093] be met:  
1. SpO 2 between 80- 96% 
2. SpO [ADDRESS_1251094] be >8 cm H 2O 
4. An adequate pulse oximetry waveform tracing is present

1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating efficacy and safety of 
rozanolixizumab in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.  
Short Title:  
A Phase  3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in patients with 
myasthenia gravis.  
Rationale:  
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a serious, sometimes life threatening, debilitating condition 
associated with numerous symptoms including muscular weakn ess and fatigue. The major 
pathophysiology leading to MG is the abnormal production of immunoglobulin (Ig)G 
autoantibodies directed toward nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), or muscle -specific 
kinase (MuSK) protein. Several commonly prescribed treatm ents act, at least in part, by [CONTACT_368760]. While the standard of care for MG involves 
the utilization of a variety of therapeutic agents including cholinesterase inhibitors, 
immunomodulators, corticosteroid , biologics, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), 
plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption, there remains a need for a safe and effective treatment 
devoid of significant side effects to conveniently treat patients with MG.  
By [CONTACT_730847] (FcRn), rozanolixizumab accelerates the 
catabolism of antibodies and reduces the serum IgG concentration, including pathogenic IgG in 
MG patients, thus offering a potentially safe, effective, and convenient alternative to existing 
treatme nts. This Phase 3 study will provide the required data to establish the safety and efficacy 
of rozanolixizumab in anti -AChR or anti -MuSK autoantibody -positive patients with generalized 
MG who experience moderate to severe symptoms and are being considered for additional 
treatment with IVIg or plasma exchange (PEX).

Overall Design  
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_998244] the opportunity to rollover into an OLE study, as described below. The OLE 
study, MG0004 (52 -week chronic treatment) will be replaced by [CONTACT_4224]0007, which consists of 
6-week treatment cycles based on MG worsening. Upon study site approval of MG0007, as well 
as fulfilment of regu latory requirements, study participants will have the opportunity to rollover 
directly into MG0007. In the event a study participant has already started MG0004, a minimum 
treatment duration of 6 visits (if IMP treatment is held for low IgG, study participa nts missed 
dose(s) can be counted as part of the total 6 visits for completion of MG0004 and meet eligibility 
requirements for MG0007) must be completed prior to moving into MG0007. Once the site is 
active for MG0007, no further participants will enroll in  MG0004 and the study will be closed at 
the site once all eligible study participants have discontinued MG0004 and had the opportunity to 
rollover into MG0007.  
The study is composed of a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, followed by a 6 -week double -
blind Treatment Period and a blinded Observation Period of 8 weeks:  
1. All study participants who complete the 6 -week Treatment Period will roll over into an 
8-week Observation Period.  
2. All eligible study participants who complete the Observation Period will be inv ited to be re -
randomized into an open -label extension (OLE) study.  
3. Study participants who experience disease worsening during the 6 -week Treatment Period 
(eg, an increase of 2 points on the MG -ADL or 3 points on the QMG scale between two 
consecutive visits ) may be considered for rescue therapy (IVIg or PEX) at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
4. Study participants who need rescue therapy during the 6 -week Treatment Period will receive 
IVIg or PEX and complete any subsequent visit(s). No further infusions of  IMP in MG0003

premature end of treatment ( PEOT) Visit (Visit 10), he or she will move into the 8 -week 
Observation Period.  
5. Study participants who complete the Trea tment Period and require initiation of rescue 
therapy after they start the 8 -week Observation Period, may either opt to receive IVIg or PEX 
or complete the End of Study (EOS) visit and immediately roll over into an OLE study where 
the participant will rece ive rozanolixizumab. Study participants who opt to receive IVIg or 
PEX will complete any remaining visits in the Observation Period and will not be invited to 
join an OLE study.  
6. Study participants who did not complete the [ADDRESS_998245] been treated and are evaluable for the primary endpoint , ie, approximately  study 
participants per dose group. If the study is not stopped for futility after the interim analysis, then 
depending upon the selection of one,  or two, of the doses after the interim analysis and the 
calculation of conditional power, a further  eligible study participants will be randomized 
into the study. Thus, the total sample size of the study could range between  and study 
partic ipants if the study is not futile (for sample size determination, see Section  9.9). 
Treatment Groups and Duration  
The maximum duration of the study per study participant will be up to 18 weeks, consisting of a 
Screening Period (1 to 28 days to account for central laboratory t urn-around time), a Treatment 
Period (6 weeks), and an Observation Period (8 weeks).  
Fixed unit doses across body weight tiers and study arms will be employed.  
The placebo arm will be 0.9% sodium chloride aqueous solution (physiological saline, 
preservati ve free) for subcutaneous (sc) administration.  
Two sc treatment arms will assume fixed unit doses stratified on weight tiers as described below:  
Treatment Arm 1 (rozanolixizumab) – equivalent to approximately  
• Bodyweight <50kg: dose to be administer ed  
• Bodyweight ≥50kg and <70kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥70kg and <100kg: dose to be administered

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  will be formed to monitor the ongoing 
safety and efficacy of the study. Futility and samples size adjustment will also be reviewed and 
assessed by [CONTACT_730848] a formal interim analysis at the end of Stage 1, when  enrolled 
study participants are eva luable for the primary endpoint. Approximately 3 periodic data reviews 
(in addition to the futility analysis mentioned above) will be performed: the first periodic data 
review will be performed when approximately study participants have completed the 6 -week 
Treatment Period; the second periodic data review will be conducted after approximately  
study participants have completed the 6 -week Treatment Period (ad hoc as needed); and a third 
review will be conducted after approximately  study part icipants (dependent on the 
outcome of the interim analysis) have completed the 6 -week Treatment Period. The timing of 
any further data reviews will be decided by [CONTACT_730849]. Further 
details of the IDMC will be provided in a DMC ch arter.

UCB   [ADDRESS_998249] shown that FcRn rescues both IgG and albumin from intracellular lysosomal 
degradation by [CONTACT_368766] ( Roopenian and 
Akilesh, 2007 ). FcRn may also mediate transcytosis of IgG to facil itate its distribution within 
tissues. Rozanolixizumab has been specifically designed to block IgG binding to FcRn without 
blocking the binding and recycling of albumin.  
Rozanolixizumab binds with high affinity to FcRn at both neutral and acidic pH. 
Immuno globulin G that is constitutively taken up by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_730820],

Production of pathogenic IgG autoantib odies is the major pathophysiology leading to a number 
of autoimmune diseases, which include MG, pemphigus vulgaris, immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP), Goodpasture’s syndrome, neuromyelitis optica, Guillain -Barré Syndrome, and chronic 
inflammatory demyelinatin g polyradiculoneuropathy.  
As individual disease entities, IgG autoantibody -mediated conditions are relatively rare. 
Treatment of these disorders remains a difficult clinical problem, requiring in many of these 
conditions the long -term use of corticosteroid s alone or combined with other immunomodulatory 
therapy. These therapeutic approaches are not effective in all patients and conditions and have 
broad immunosuppressive effects causing considerable toxicity and treatment -related morbidity.  
Treatments aimed at reducing the quantity of circulating IgG autoantibodies, including 
plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, or high dose IVIg, are being used for primary and secondary 
therapy of autoimmune diseases. The therapeutic approach of these treatments is thought in p art 
to be based on lowering levels of pathogenic autoantibodies, which represents rational and 
effective treatment modalities of autoimmune diseases.  
Therefore, specific removal of the IgG autoantibodies by [CONTACT_730850] c option for IgG autoantibody -mediated autoimmune disorders.

there remains a need for a safe and effective treatment devoid of significa nt side effects to 
conveniently treat patients with MG.  
By [CONTACT_730851], rozanolixizumab accelerates the catabolism of antibodies and 
reduces the concentration of pathogenic IgG in MG patients, thus offering a safe, effective, and 
convenie nt alternative to existing treatments. This Phase 3 study will provide the required data to 
establish the safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in anti -AChR or anti -MuSK autoantibody -
positive patients with generalized MG who experience moderate to severe symptoms and are 
being considered for additional treatment such as IVIg or PEX.  
2.2 Background  
To date, rozanolixizumab has been administered to human study participants in the following 
clinical studies: UP0018, MG0002, TP0001, TP0003, TP0006, CIDP01, CIDP04 and UP0060. 
UP0018 is a completed first -in-human study (FIH), and MG0002 is a completed Phase 2 study in 
study participants with generalized MG; and TP0001 is a completed Phase 2 study in study 
participants with primary ITP. CIPD01 is a Phase 2a study in s tudy participants with chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and UP0060 is a Phase [ADDRESS_998251] on total IgG levels of single ascending doses of 
intravenous (iv) and sc rozanolixizumab. Doses of rozanolixizumab  were 
administered by [CONTACT_730852] 3 cohorts, respectively, as a  The 
information from the study is summarized below.  
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during UP0018. 
Rozanolixizumab was tolerated with an acceptable safety profile after the single administration 
of  iv and sc doses. Four  TEAEs with a maximum intensity of severe were 
reported in this study: headache (3 study participants [50.0%]) and back pain (1 study participant 
[16.7%]); all of which were reported in the rozanolixizumab  iv group. For sc 
administration of rozanoli xizumab, the most frequently reported TEAEs were headache (5 study 
participants [27.8%]), back pain and diarrhea (each reported by 3 study participants [16.7%]). No 
severe adverse events (AEs) were reported following sc administration. The peak and total 
exposure of rozanolixizumab showed nonlinear increases consistent with target -mediated drug 
disposition. Dose -dependent statistically significant reductions in levels of total IgG and dose -
dependent reductions in levels of IgG subclasses (IgG 1 to 4) were o bserved after 
rozanolixizumab was administered by [CONTACT_730853].  
MG0002 is a completed Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
treatment -sequence study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rozanolixizumab in 
study participants with moderate to severe MG. The study included 2 Dosing Periods:

results in undesirable side effects such as those seen with high -dose chronic steroid use. Many 
treatments of choice often require invasive, expensive and time -consuming inpatient procedures 
such as PEX, or intravenous administration of immunoglobulins at a healthcare facility.  
Rozanolixizumab represents an innovative, subcutaneous anti -FcRn monoclonal antibody that 
may provide a novel and specific therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with gM G. 
Data shows that rozanolixizumab markedly lowers serum IgG and IgG autoantibody levels in 
patients with gMG. The completed Phase 2 study MG0002 established supportive evidence of 
efficacy for the treatment of MG, achieving significant and clinically mean ingful improvements 
to Day 29 in MG -ADL with rozanolixizumab compared with placebo (p=0.036). 
Repeated administrations of rozanolixizumab were generally and well tolerated, with an 
acceptable safety profile and in -line with subcutaneous dosing in the Phase [ADDRESS_998253] common adverse drug reactions observed after use of rozanolixizumab across 
indications are headaches and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances (diarrhea, naus ea, vomiting). 
Potential risks are serious infusion/hypersensitivity reactions, serious infections , and effects on 
vaccination response. The risks of serious infusion/hypersensitivity and serious infections can be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_368770], exclusion  of at-risk study participants, and appropriate protocol 
withdrawal and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. Additionally, protocol guidance for management of GI 
disturbances, severe and/or serious headaches, and infusions is also provided as well as 
expedited reporting req uirements of AESM.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, repeat dose 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses of rozanolixizumab and matching placebo 
in patients with generalized MG who experience moderate to severe  symptoms (Myasthenia 
Gravis Foundation of America [MGFA II -IVa]) and are being considered for additional 
treatment such as IVIg or PEX (study schematic is provided in Figure  1-1). 
Fixed unit doses across body weight tiers and study arms will be employed:  
Treatment Arm 1 (rozanolixizumab) – equivalent to approximately   
• Bodyweight <50kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥50kg and <70kg: dose  to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥70kg and <100kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥100kg; dose to be administered   
Treatment Arm 2 (rozanolixizumab) – equivalent to approximately   
• Bodyweight <50kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥50kg and <70kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥70kg and <100kg: dose to be administered  
• Bodyweight ≥100kg; dose to be administered   
The placebo arm will be 0.9% sodium chloride aqueous solution (physiological saline, 
preservative free) for sc administration.  
Approximately up to study participants will be screened at about [ADDRESS_998254] the opportunity to rollover into an OLE study, as described below. The OLE 
study, MG0004 (52 -week chronic treatment) will be replaced by [CONTACT_4224]0007, which consists of 
6-week treatment cycles based on MG worsening. Upon study site approval of MG0007 , as well 
as fulfilment of regulatory requirements, study participants will have the opportunity to rollover 
directly into MG0007. In the event a study participant has already started MG0004, a minimum 
treatment duration of 6 visits (if IMP treatment is he ld for low IgG, study participants missed 
dose(s) can be counted as part of the total 6 visits for completion of MG0004 and meet eligibility 
requirements for MG0007) must be completed prior to moving into MG0007. Once the site is

UCB   [ADDRESS_998255] discontinued MG0004 and had the opportunity to 
rollover into MG0007.  
The maximum duration of the study per study participant will be u p to 18 weeks, consisting of a 
Screening Period (1 to 28 days to account for central laboratory turn -around time), a Treatment 
Period (6 weeks), and a blinded Observation Period (8 weeks).  
1. All study participants who complete the 6 -week Treatment Period wil l roll over into an 
8-week Observation Period.  
2. All eligible study participants who complete the Observation Period will be invited to be re -
randomized into an OLE study to either active dose arm 1 or 2.  
3. Study participants who experience disease worsening during the 6 -week Treatment Period 
(eg, an increase of 2 points on the MG -ADL or 3 points on the QMG scale between two 
consecutive visits) may be considered for rescue therapy (IVIg or PEX) at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
4. Study participants who need  rescue therapy during the 6 -week Treatment Period will receive 
IVIg or PEX and complete any subsequent visit(s). No further infusions of rozanolixizumab 
will be administered after initiation of rescue therapy. Once the participant completes Visit 
10, he o r she will move into the [ADDRESS_998256] be completed before 
enrolling into an OLE study . Alternatively, they can be treated with IVIg or PEX. Study 
participants who opt to receive IVIg or PEX will complete any remai ning visits in the 
Observation Period and will not be invited to join an OLE study .  
7. Study participants who discontinue study medication for any reason other than requiring 
rescue therapy will not be eligible for enrollment into an OLE study . 
In exception al circumstances (eg, pandemic, hurricanes, etc) where study -specific investigations 
may not be conducted according to study protocol, contingency measures will be in place (see 
Section  8). 
An IDMC will be formed to monitor the ongoing safety and efficacy of the study. Futility and 
samples size adjustment will also be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_730848] a formal interim 
analysis at the end of Stag e 1, when  enrolled study participants are evaluable for the primary 
endpoint. Approximately 3 periodic data reviews (in addition to the futility analysis mentioned 
above) will be performed: the first periodic data review will be performed when approxima tely 
study participants have completed the 6 -week Treatment Period; the second periodic data

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
MG0003 is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of rozanolixizumab given in 
dose exposures at  or  in study participants with MG. The previously 
conducted FIH study, UP0018, provided the safety, tolerability, and PK information for multiple 
dose exposures of  administered as iv or sc infusion over 
 in healthy volunteers.  
The duration of the Treatment and Observation Periods were defined based on data from UP0018 
and MG0002. In UP0018, results showed that upon administration of rozanolixizumab, the mean 
percentage change in total IgG over time demonstrated dose -dependent reductions across both 
the iv and sc routes of administration. Similar maximal reductions were observed for both the 
rozanolixizumab iv and sc doses (approximately 48% and 43%, respectively). The lowest level 
of IgG at maximum dose (both iv and sc) was reached by [CONTACT_2006] 10 on average. The total IgG 
levels generally returned to Baseline values by [CONTACT_2006] 57 on average.  
Results from MG0002 showed that sc administration of rozanolixizumab resulted in a rapid 
reduction of serum IgG concentrations (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), which also showed th e greatest 
reductions from Baseline in QMG, MG -C, and MG -ADL after 6 infusions (Day 50). Therefore, a 
treatment duration of [ADDRESS_998258] been defined to replicate PD effects throughout the weight range that is similar to weight -
based (mg/kg) dosing. The proposed doses and regimen of rozanolixizumab were selected based 
on the results from FIH study UP0018, alongside the efficacy and safety data from the MG Phase 
2 study  (MG0002).  
UP0018 was a randomized, Investigator - and study participant -blind, placebo -controlled, single 
dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and PK and to explore the PD of rozanolixizumab 
doses of  administered as iv or  sc infusion over  in  
healthy male and female volunteers. Data indicate that mean absolute decreases in IgG and mean 
percent change from Baseline IgG were greater in the active dose groups ( ) compared to

Rozanolixizumab was tolerated with an acceptable safety profile after the single administration 
of a sc dose, and all participant -reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.

for the Placebo Group. The difference between treatment groups was (p=  [ upper 
confidence interval (CI): ]). Smaller but numerical differences in favor of rozanolixizumab 
 vs placebo were observed in reductions from Baseline in QMG on Day 29 with the LS 
mean (SE) change from Baseline of  for the  Rozanolixizumab Group and  
 for the Placebo Group. The LS mean (SE) change from Baseline in MG -C score to Day 29 
was  for the Rozanolixizumab  Group and  for the Placebo Group. In 
general, responder rates for QMG score, MG -C score, and MG -ADL score were higher for the 
rozanolixizumab group than the placebo group. Serum total IgG concentrations and 
AChR autoantibodies rapi[INVESTIGATOR_730821] 1 and c ontinued to decline on further dosing with to a mean nadir of 
 for total IgG (  reduction from Baseline). Overall, repeated administrations of 
rozanolixizumab at dose levels of  and sc have been generally and well 
tolerate d, with an acceptable safety profile. No new safety concerns have been identified to date. 
The TEAE profile was similar between rozanolixizumab and placebo, except for headaches 
where increased frequency and severity was observed in the rozanolixizumab -treated study 
participants.  
Consistent with the mechanism of action of rozanolixizumab, an increased catabolism of IgG 
will reduce disease -specific autoantibodies with corresponding improvements in clinical signs 
and symptoms. Two sc treatment arms, equivale nt to individual  and  dosing, 
have been selected to provide maximal reduction in autoantibody concentration and result in 
clinically significant improvements in the primary endpoint. A dose of  has demonstrated 
clinical improvements in MG-ADL in study MG0002 (as described above). Additional data from 
the Phase 2 study in study participants with ITP (TP0001) demonstrated that rozanolixizumab 
was well tolerated at doses at  with further IgG reduction achieved. An individual 
equiva lent dose of has been included to assess if further improvements in MG -ADL 
(magnitude of response and time to onset of symptom relief) can be achieved at a higher dose 
level with greater and more rapid IgG reduction.  
A population PKPD model that ch aracterizes the dose -exposure -IgG relationship was used to 
guide, through simulation, the choice of fixed unit doses at each weight bracket that achieved 
equivalent IgG reductions (mean and prediction interval) to the weight -based (mg/kg)

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
An interactive response technology (IRT) will be used for assigning eligible study participants to 
a treatment regimen (as applicable) based on a predetermined production randomization and/or 
packaging schedule pro vided by [CONTACT_18338] (or designee). The randomization schedule will be 
produced by [CONTACT_352240]. The IRT will generate individual assignments for kits of study 
medication, as appropriate, according to the visit schedule.  
To enroll a study participant (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_368775]. Each study participant will receive a 
5-digit number assigned at Screening that serves as the study participant identifier throughout the 
study. The study participant number will be required in all communication between the 
Investigator or designee and the IRT regarding a particular study participant. Study participant 
numbers and kit numbers will be tracked via the IRT.  
To randomize a study pa rticipant, the Investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_730858]. The IRT will automatically inform the 
Investigator or designee of the study participant’s randomization number. The IRT wil l allocate

The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_716]:  
• MG-specific autoantibody (MuSK+ or AChR+)  
6.3.1  Procedures for maintaining and breaking the treatment blind  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Maintenance of study treatment blind  
All study participant treatment details, rozanolixizumab treatment arm, planned dose, or placebo 
will be allocated and maintained by [CONTACT_6606] s ystem.  
The following individuals will receive the randomization code at the start of the study:  
• Designated bioanalytical staff analyzing PK samples  
• IRT provider  
Study site pharmacists or other suitably qualified site personnel who are responsible for 
prepa ration of IMP treatments will have access to treatment allocations for individual study 
participants via the IRT. The unblinded pharmacy monitors from the Contract Research 
Organization (CRO), and the Clinical Supply Manager will also have access to the tr eatment 
allocations and to the drug accountability records, if applicable.  
The following individuals may, as necessary, have access to the randomization code as indicated:  
• Sponsor Patient Safety staff as needed for reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities.  
• Members of the IDMC who participate in unblinded sessions will be given information about 
the IMP allocation for those study participants for whom data are provided at these sessions.  
• CRO staff supporting preparation of the data outputs for the IDMC revie w and/or any interim 
analyses.  
• Independent Medical Monitor external to the sponsor for monitoring unblinded clinical 
laboratory data, such as total IgG levels.  
If IgG levels drop below 1g/L, the IMP must be temporarily discontinued. If IgG levels is  ≥1 
and <2g/L, and study participant is experiencing a nonserious infection which is persisting or 
recurrent, rozanolixizumab treatment may be temporarily discontinued (Section  7.1.4 ). 
Temporary treatment discontinuation due to low IgG levels may informally unblind the treatment 
assignment to the participant and site personnel. Therefore, infusions will be continued but given 
as mock infusions with only placeb o irrespective of IMP designation. Allocation of mock kit 
numbers will be handled via the IRT. An unblinded Medical Monitor will inform the Investigator 
of the initiation of mock infusions and bring attention to any potential infection risk. The 
Medical Mo nitor will continue to review available safety information for these study participants 
(eg, AEs for infection and white cell count) while the IgG levels are at the protocol -defined low 
threshold values, and directly contact [CONTACT_730859]. When the IgG levels have 
returned to the protocol -defined levels to re -initiate IMP (Section  7.1.4 ), the unblinded Medical 
Monitor will inform the Investigator of this decision. Based on the clinical situation, the 
Investigator has the option of holding the dose until deemed appropriate.

• Vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine)  
If a study participant needs or takes any prohibited medication or therapy, the Inve stigator will 
(where possible) discuss with the Medical Monitor and/or sponsor’s Study Physician and a 
decision will be made whether the study participant can continue in the study or must be 
withdrawn. If the study participant is treated with rituximab, t he study participant must be 
withdrawn from the IMP, but should be encouraged to continue with Observation Period visits.  
For study participants who require a medical or surgical procedure that requires the use of 
general anesthesia, discussion must occur prior to the procedure with the Medical Monitor or 
study physician. In an emergency situation, discussion should occur as soon as possible after the 
procedure, such that a decision on the study participant's continued participation in the study can 
be made .

8.1 Efficacy Assessments  
8.1.1  MGFA Classification  
The Investigator will classify the study participant’s MG using the MGFA Clinical Classification 
(Appendix 12, Section  10.12 ) (Jaretzki et al, 2000 ). This is a 5 -stage classification (I to V), with 
a higher class indicating more severe disease. To be eligible for this study, a participant must be 
graded MGFA CLASS II to IVa at Visit 1, as per inclu sion criteria (Section  5.1).  
8.1.2  Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis scale  
For assessment of the QMG scale, investigators or qualified designee will follow the MGFA’s 
QMG Manual instructions (Appendix 13, Section  10.13 ). Clinical personnel must complete 
mandatory training to assess study participants’ QMG score (details are provided in the Study 
Procedures Manual). If not medically appropriate, then the treatment can be continued but the 
testing should be performed as best as possible at the same timeframe post last 
acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor dosin g for each evaluation during the study. Study 
participants should not take pyridostigmine (or other AChE inhibitor medication) from midnight 
before testing when medically safe to do so to standardize testing (ie, if AChE inhibitors cannot 
be stopped). The scale tests 13 items, including ocular and facial involvement, swallowing, 
speech, limb strength, and forced vital capacity (FVC). For the assessment of FVC, the same 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_368735] a study participant is tested, and if possible, the s ame person 
should carry out the assessment. The QMG is a validated assessment ( Barnett et al, 2012 ), with a 
higher score indicating more severe disease. Scoring for each item ranges from no weakness (0) 
to severe weakness (3), with an overall score range f rom 0 to 39. A 3 -point change in the total 
score is considered clinically relevant. Where possible, the same person should carry out the 
assessment at each visit.  
8.1.3  MG-Composite scale  
For assessment of the MG -C scale, the Investigator or qualified designee w ill examine the study 
participant to score all items, except for talking, chewing, and swallowing for which the study 
participant will self -assess. Study participants should not take pyridostigmine (or other AChE 
inhibitor medication) from midnight before testing when medically safe to do so to standardize 
testing. The MG -C scale is a validated assessment ( Burns et al, 2010 ), with a higher score 
indicating more severe disease (Appendix 14, Section  10.14 ) and a 3 -point change being of 
clinical relevance ( Muppi[INVESTIGATOR_258946], 2011) . The scale tests [ADDRESS_998286] complete

PGI-C, EQ -5D-5L, MGII  (optional assessment), and MG -QOL15r. The PROs should only be 
checked for completeness. On dosing days, the PR Os will be completed prior to dosing. Study 
participants should not take pyridostigmine (or other AChE inhibitor medication) from midnight 
before the days when efficacy assessments are performed, when medically safe to do so to 
standardize testing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MG-Activities of Daily Living  
Independently of study visit type (site, home, or virtual), the MG -ADL must be completed by 
[CONTACT_284195] a quiet place by [CONTACT_730863] a partner or caregiver, 
before any clinical examination takes place. S tudy participants should be informed of the 
importance of this questionnaire and instructed to read the items and instructions carefully. They 
should be informed that there are no correct or incorrect answers.  
Study personnel are not allowed to interpret t he items for the participant. If a participant asks for 
guidance, study personnel should instruct him/her to respond according to their best 
understanding of the item. The MG -ADL should only be checked for completeness by [CONTACT_25617]. In the event a fe w questionnaire items have not been completed, study personnel 
should only query this with the study participant, if this results from an omission. Study 
personnel shall neither complete missing data nor suggest changes to participant responses. As 
with ot her study data, responses to the questionnaire should be treated as confidential 
information. Data privacy considerations apply.  
In the specific context of virtual and home visits, paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_730825] -ADL should be made 
available to study participants a head of the visit. Site coordinators or study personnel (or an 
automatic alert mechanism) should remind study participants to complete the MG -ADL before 
visit start and to record the date upon completion of the questionnaire. Once they have completed 
the M G-ADL, study participants should transfer it electronically to site personnel. In the event 
study personnel finds out that the MG -ADL has not been completed before the visit, study 
participants should be allowed some additional time to complete the questio nnaire before any 
study related assessment is initiated.  
The MG -ADL is an 8 -item PRO instrument developed on the basis of the QMG ( Wolfe et al, 
1999 ) (Appendix 15, Section  10.15 ). The MG -ADL targets symptoms and disability across 
ocular (items #7 [double vision] and #8 [eyelid droop]), bulbar, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and axial symptoms. 
In a recent study, reliability, validity, an d responsiveness of the MG -ADL were further assessed. 
The questionnaire showed strong construct validity when evaluated against the MG -C as well as 
against the MG -QOL15r; high test -retest reliability in a 1 -week interval; and it was demonstrated 
that a 2 -point improvement indicates clinical improvement ( Muppi[INVESTIGATOR_121732], 2012 ; Muppi[INVESTIGATOR_258946], 
2011 ). The total MG -ADL score ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more 
disability.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MG Symptoms PRO  
The MG Symptoms PRO instrument (Appendix 16, Section  10.16 ) consists of 42 items across 5 
scales: ocular symptoms (items 1 -5); bulbar symptoms (items 6 -15); respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] 
(items 16 -18); physical fatigue ( items 19 -33) and muscle weakness fatigability (items 34 -42).

higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Global Impression of Severity  
Patient Global Impression of Severity is a single -state, self -report measure that rates a 
participant's severity of specific condition (App endix 17, Section  10.17 ). The PGI -S is a 5 point 
scale depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a participant's rating of overall symptoms (“none,” “mild,” “moderate,” “severe,” 
“very severe,”).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Global Impression of Change  
Patient Global Impression of Change is a single -state, self -report measure that reflects a 
participant's belief about the efficacy of treatment for a specific condition (Appendix 18, 
Section  10.18 ). The PGI -C is a 7 -point scale depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a participant's rating of overall 
improvement (“very much improved,” “much improved,” “minimally improved,” “no change,” 
“minimally worse,” “much wors e,” or “very much worse”).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EQ-5D-5L 
The 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L) is designed to improve the instrument’s sensitivity and to 
reduce ceiling effects (Appendix 19,  Section  10.19 ).  
The EQ -5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EuroQol 
visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).  
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and a nxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to 
indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_730864] o f 
the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1 -digit number that expresses the level selected for 
that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit number that 
describes the patient’s health state.  
The EQ VAS records th e patient’s self -rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the 
endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can 
imagine’. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the 
patient’s own judgement.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MG Impairment Index  
The MGII is a measure of disease severity based on the signs and symptoms of MG patients 
(Appendix 20, Section  10.20 ). It was developed using a patient -centered approach and following 
current guidelines for outcome measure development, incorporating patient input throughout the 
different development phases ( Barnett et al, 2014 , Barnett et al, 2016 ). The MGII ha s 22 
patient -reported and 6 examination items, and scores are presented as a sum of all items for a 
total score but also as an ocular and generalized sub -score. The MGII is an optional assessment 
(see Section  1.3). The Investigator or qualified designee will examine the study participant prior

UCB   [ADDRESS_998289] compared to other commonly used outcome measures, and it can effectively discriminate 
among patients with different degrees of severity ( Barnett et al, 2016, B arnett et al, 2017 ). The 
MGII is sensitive to detect clinical change after interventions. Additionally, the MGII showed 
more relative efficiency than the QMG scale, MG -C, and MG -ADL to detect change in 
short -term interventions for MG. Estimates for the min imal important difference were developed 
(5.5 for individuals).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MG-QOL15r  
The MG -QOL15r is a brief survey, completed by [CONTACT_87755], that is designed to assess 
some aspects of "quality of life" related to MG. The MG -QOL15r was designed to assess the 
"patient perspective" in the everyday clinic setting or in a clinical study (Appendix 21, 
Section  10.21 ). 
When completing the 15 -item MG -QOL15r, MG study participant should consider only how 
their MG affects these items. For example, if a study participant has no leg weakness but has a 
painful hip (unrelated to the MG) that causes walking trouble, the study participant should report 
"not at all" to  the item of, "I have trouble walking.” This is because any hip -related walking 
trouble is unrelated to the MG. One other note of clarification: if the study participant is retired 
(unrelated to MG), he or she should report “not at all” to the item about w hether the MG 
negatively impacts job/occupational status.   
8.2 Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1.3). 
Study participants must be observed at site postdose for at least [ADDRESS_998290] 2

Brief physical examination  
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, 
cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).  
For full and brief physical exa minations, Investigators should pay special attention to clinical 
signs related to previous serious illnesses, as well as signs and symptoms of infections.  
Clinically relevant findings or worsening of previous findings will be recorded as AEs.

Appropriate rigorous precautions are being taken within this protocol to monitor the risk of TB 
infection in  this study (see Section  5.2). Any presumptive diagnosis or diagnosis of a TB 
infection is a reportable event.  
Physical Examination  
The Investigator  should consider all potential sites of infection when assessing for TB during the 
physical examination, and other evaluations, and based on the study participant’s medical or 
social history. Sites commonly infected by [CONTACT_18404]: the lungs, larynx, lymph glands, pleura, 
GI system, genito urinary tract (including renal), bones and joints, meninges, peritoneum, 
pericardium, and skin. This is not an exhaustive list and unusual presentations and areas of 
involvement should always be considered.  
Some common sym ptoms that the study participant may present are dependent on the primary 
focus of infection and may include cough, blood in sputum, night sweats, lymphadenitis, joint 
pain/swelling, spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262], headache/confusion, abdominal pain (mimicking inflammat ory 
bowel disease), etc. Unusual presentations should always be considered.

TB signs and symptoms questionnaire  
In addition to a physical examination done intermittently throughout the study, study participants 
will be evaluated both for signs and symptoms of latent or active TB infection an d for risk 
factors for exposure to TB using the TB questionnaire as indicated in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1.3). 
The TB questionnaire shou ld be completed accurately and filed as a critical source document. 
The questionnaire will assist with the identification of study participants who may require 
therapy for TB.  
A “Yes” response to any of the questions in the TB questionnaire during the  study may trigger  
further assessment  to determine  if the  study participant has either  LTBI and must receive  
prophylactic  LTBI therapy or active  TB infection and must be withdrawn from  the study. As an 
example, a  study participant  who answers  “Yes” at Scree ning to  the question “

UCB   [ADDRESS_998293] may be performed if indicated ( eg, 
presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of TB, recent exposure ).  
In high TB incidence countries, it is recommended that the IGRA be the first test perfo rmed at 
screening to reduce the number of unnecessary screening procedures on any IGRA positive study 
participants that may need to be treated for TB prophylaxis or potentially withdrawn from the 
study.  
The test results will be reported as positive, negat ive, or indeterminate.  
If an IGRA is positive or indeterminate the study participant must be evaluated by a TB 
specialist.  
• Positive IGRA  
The positive IGRA may represent new LTBI or active TB infection. The positive IGRA result 
may also reflect positivity from a recently diagnosed and adequately treated (in progress or 
completed within the past 12 months) LTBI or from adequately treated past TB infection. In such 
cases, the study participants must be evaluated by a TB specialist.  
• Indeterminate IGRA  
If the I GRA test result is indeterminate, the IGRA previously performed may be repeated once. 
The retest must be done during the protocol -defined screening window. If the test is positive or 
indeterminate on retest, the study participant must  be evaluated by a TB specialist . 
Study p articipants who have two indeterminate or any positive IGRA test and are cleared by a 
TB specialist will be potentially eligible to be randomized into the stud y after discussion with 
and approval from study physician (medical monitor).  
In such circumstances, the study participant must be subsequently evaluated by a TB specialist at 
protocol defined TB monitoring visits (in lieu of IGRA testing as it is likely to be positive).  
TB assessment by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray  
Chest X -ray is not required at Sc reening in countries where TB incidence is low (≤20 per 
100,000, 2018 TB incidence estimate by [CONTACT_730866] 
(WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report ANNEX 4). It can, however, be performed at the 
Investigator’s discretion in  study participants with risk factors (ie, patient aged 60 or older, 
prolonged steroid use).  
In countries (eg, Russian Federation) where TB incidence is >[ADDRESS_998294] X -ray (or a computed tomography of the chest) has been 
done from [ADDRESS_998295] after Screening should be performed only if indicated (eg, 
presence of signs  and symptoms suggestive of TB, close exposure to persons with TB), and 
interpreted by a qualified specialist (ie, radiologist or pulmonologist).

UCB   [ADDRESS_998296] conversion is defined as a positive or indeterminate (and confirmed 
indeterm inate on repeat) IGRA result for the current test when previous IGRA test results were 
negative. The IGRA result must be negative for study participants to enroll in this study. During 
the study, all study participants with positive or indeterminate IGRA t est results must 
immediately stop study drug administration.  
In case of an IGRA test conversion, the study participant must be considered as having either a 
suspected new latent or an active TB infection and be promptly referred to an appropriate 
speciali st (eg, pulmonologist, infectious disease specialist) for further evaluation. If test 
conversion indicates LTBI, active TB, or NTMB then, TB test conversion (confirmed) should be 
classified adequately, either as due to LTBI, active TB infection, or NTMB, r espectively. 
Additional assessments (eg, blood tests or IGRA, chest X -rays, or other imaging) should be 
performed where medically relevant and documented. Such conversions should be reported as 
AEs as described in the protocol. The AE term would need to be  updated with final diagnosis 
once available.  
Latent TB  
Latent TB infection is defined as the absence of signs, symptoms (eg, evidence of organ specific 
involvement), or physical findings suggestive of TB infection with a positive IGRA test (or [ADDRESS_998297] results) and a chest X -ray (or other imaging) without evidence of TB 
infection.  
LTBI must be reported as an AE and graded appropriately as described in the protocol. Follow -
up reports should be completed as per protocol requirement until suc h time as the LTBI resolves.  
Active TB or non -tuberculosis mycobacterium infection  
Study participants who develop active TB or NTMB infection during the study (conversion 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_18406]) must be withdrawn from the study. The study participant must b e 
immediately permanently discontinued from study medication and a PEOT Visit must be 
scheduled as soon as possible, but no later than the next scheduled visit. Treatment for active TB 
or NTMB should be started immediately based on local guidelines.  
Confir med active TB is always considered Serious Adverse Event. UCB’s process requires that 
these must be captured on an SAE report form and provided to the Sponsor in accordance with 
SAE reporting requirements. Follow -up reports should be completed as per proto col requirement 
until such time as the TB infection resolves.  
LTBI, active TB or other NTMB identified during study  
During the study, study participants who develop evidence of LTBI, active TB or NTMB 
infection must immediately stop further administration of study medication and will be referred 
to an appropriate TB specialist (pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) for further 
evaluation. Study participants diagnosed with active TB or LTBI should receive appropriate TB 
or prophylaxis therapy. The study participant should be transferred to the care of their physician 
and managed according to the standard of care.  
If infection with NTMB is identified during the study, the same procedure as for active TB 
acquired during the study and compliant TB tre atment shall be followed.

biochemical safety parameters, X -ray evolution data, and TB diagnostic procedures used to 
follow -up and confirm recovery of TB.  
8.3 Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). 
Adverse events can be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any design ees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue the study treatment or MG0003  (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information  
All SAEs will  be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS visit at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS visit at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the s ponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). The Investigator will s ubmit any updated SAE data to the sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_998299] and report to UCB (or its representative) any 
SAEs (even if the Investigator is certain that they are in no way associate d with the study 
medication), up to [ADDRESS_998300] be reported to 
UCB regardless of the time between the event and the end of the study.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE report s are provided in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). 
8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs, (and non -serious AEs of special 
interest and adverse events of special monitoring [ AESM ], as defined in Section  8.3.6  and 
Section  8.3.7 , respectively ), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the Investigator 
determines that it is no longer  clinically significant, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information o n follow -up 
procedures is given in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3).

Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_203790].  
8.6 Pharmacokinetics and Anti -drug Antibodies  
Whole blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of 
rozanolixizumab and ADA as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1.3). Additional 
PK samples will be collected (Section  1.4) at selected sites for study participants who have 
consented to participate in the sub -study. Blood samples may be collected at additional time 
points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the Investi gator and the sponsor. 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by [CONTACT_103]. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of rozanolixiz umab and ADA and may be used for 
establishing assay parameters (eg, ADA cut point setting and PK selectivity assessment). 
Samples collected for analyses of rozanolixizumab concentration may also be used to evaluate 
safety or efficacy aspects related to con cerns arising during or after the study.  
Participant confidentiality will be maintained. At visits during which plasma/serum samples for 
the determination of multiple aspects of r ozanolixizumab will be taken, one  sample of sufficient 
volume can be used.  
Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to study sites or 
blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.  
Any changes in the timing or addition of time points for any planned study assessments must be

8.9 Biomarkers  
Collection of samples for exploratory biomarker rese arch is also part of this study. Blood 
samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all study participants  in 
this study as specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). Exploratory samples are 
collected predose. Additional exploratory safety samples must be collected 4 hours postdose or 
as soon as possible before the next IMP in case of AESM of severe headache and/or AESM of 
severe GI disorders, regardless of severity at Visits 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.  
Protein and metabolites biomarkers may be measured to assess the effect of rozanolixizumab on 
exploratory biomarkers, and explore the relationship between protein, and meta bolite biomarkers 
and cause, progression, and appropriate treatment of MG.  
If not used immediately, these samples will be stored at -80°C for up to 20 years for later 
exploratory analyses. Any exploratory biomarker will only ever be related to the explorat ion of 
cause, progression, and appropriate treatment of MG. They may also be used to develop 
tests/assays including diagnostic tests related to rozanolixizumab and/or FcRn inhibitor and MG.  
The nature and format of these tentative additional analyses will be determined at a later time.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
A description of statistical methods follows and will be described in more detail in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The statistical design of this study involves two stages, with an interim analysis at the end o f 
Stage 1.  
9.1 Definition of Analysis Sets  
• Enrolled Set: All study participants who have signed the informed consent.  
• Randomized Set (RS): All enrolled study participants who were randomized.  
• Safety Set (SS): All randomized study participants  who received at l east one dose of IMP. 
Analysis of this set will be according to the treatment the study participants actually received, 
and will be used for the demographic and safety analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic Per -Protocol Set (PK -PPS): A subset of the Safety Set, consist ing of those 
study participants who received [ADDRESS_998306] dose 
of study treatment, and no important protocol deviations affecting the PK variable, as 
confirmed during a pre -analysis review of the data prior to data base lock.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): Consists of all study participants in the SS, who have a Baseline 
and least [ADDRESS_998307] -Baseline MG -ADL measurement.  
• The RS is the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. Analysis of the RS will be according 
to the treatm ent to which the study participants were randomized.  
9.2 General Statistical Considerations  
Statistical evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_730869]. Data will be summarized as follows:   
• Summarized by [CONTACT_730870] (SAS®) version 9.3 or later 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]). Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_765] (where 
applicable) with the statistics including the number of study participants (n), mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by

UCB   [ADDRESS_998308] available predose value and will be 
clearly defined in the SAP. All relevant data will be listed by [CONTACT_730871]. Placebo -treated study participants will be summarized globally.  
9.3 Estimands  
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate the ‘hypothetical’ estimand in anti -AChR or anti -
MuSK autoantibody -positive participants with generalized MG who experience moderate to 
severe symptoms and are being considered for additional treatment such as IV Ig or PEX, where 
the main intercurrent events are the use of rescue medication prior to Day 43 and treatment 
discontinuation (or withdrawal from study) due to TEAEs. The primary efficacy analysis is the 
change from Baseline in MG -ADL score to Day 43 (Visit  10).  
A hypothetical strategy will be used for rescue medication, ie, the intervention effect will be 
estimated under the hypothetical condition where rescue medication is not given.  In the case of  
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation , observed dat a after treatment discontinuation will 
be utilized where possible . 
The reason why a hypothetical estimand approach has been selected as the primary approach is 
because the use of rescue medication is likely to have a significant effect on subsequent effica cy 
data and for those study participants who discontinue treatment due to AEs, they are likely to 
also commence rescue medication  in which case the hypothetical strategy will be applied once 
rescue medication has been initiated . 
Missing data will be impute d under a missing at random assumption.  
Data handling conventions for data affected by [CONTACT_4113] -19 will be detailed fully in the SAP.  
To check the assumptions of the primary analysis and definition of the Estimand, sensitivity and 
supplemental analyses of the  change from Baseline in MG -ADL score to Day 43 (Visit 10) will 
be provided and are detailed in  Table  9-1.

9.4.[ADDRESS_998309] based on the inv erse normal 
method ( Lehmacher and Wassmer, 1999 ) with equal weighting of Stage 1 (up to the formal 
interim analysis) and Stage 2 (post -interim analysis) data. Confirmatory testing of single 
hypotheses is based on a closed -testing procedure. For the closed testing procedure the 
Bonferroni approach is used as the intersection test for testing the global and intersection 
hypotheses. If a dose other than that defined by [CONTACT_941] “Select the best dose (and any dose with a 
mean response not worse than 1 point than the  selected “best dose”)" option (see Section  9.8 for 
details) is chosen for Stage 2 the adjusted p -value for the chosen dose(s) will be used in the 
combination test.

UCB   23 Feb 2021  
Clinical Study Protocol  Rozanolixizumab  MG0003  
   
Confidential  Page 81 of 188 The primary efficacy analysis of the study will include the cohort of stu dy participants from 
Stage 1 (n= ) and those who received the selected doses in Stage 2. The primary 
endpoint, Change from Baseline in MG -ADL, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_64367] -wise mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) ANCOVA including a term f or Baseline MG -ADL score, region, 
treatment group, the treatment group by [CONTACT_730875], and a term for the stratification 
factor (categorized as AChR or MuSK). The model will define patient as a random effect and 
utilize an unstructured covariance  pattern. If the model does not converge using the unstructured 
pattern then an autoregressive covariance structure will be used.  
The t -test statistics for each dose group (at each stage) will be used to calculate unadjusted p -
values and these will be used  to form the p -value combination test(s) as described above. The 
multiplicity introduced by [CONTACT_730876] [ADDRESS_998310] will be the upper 1.25% percen tile of 
the standard normal distribution (because no alpha will be spent in Stage 1, the futility criterion 
is not binding and in Stage 2 the alpha is divided between the 2 doses). Similar presentations 
within each stratification factor may be provided.  
9.4.2  Analysis of secondary and other efficacy endpoints  
All continuous secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the combination testing 
strategy and model defined for the primary analysis. The binary secondary efficacy variable of 
MG-ADL responder (≥2 .0 points improvement from Baseline) at Day 43 (Visit 10) will be 
analyzed using logistic regression, including a term for Baseline MG -ADL score, treatment 
group, and a term for the stratification factor (categorized as AChR or MuSK).  
In addition, all cont inuous secondary efficacy variables will be listed and summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_339614]. Descriptive statistics will be generated for the 
observed values and the change from Baseline. For the binary variable, frequency counts and 
percen tages will be produced.  
A sequential hierarchical test procedure will be applied to protect the overall significance level 
for the multiplicity of endpoints. The predefined order of formal hypotheses testing for the 
secondary endpoints will be performed i n the following sequence:  
• Change from Baseline to Day 43 (Visit 10) in MG -C score.  
• Change from Baseline to Day 43 (Visit 10) in QMG score.  
• Change from Baseline to Day 43 (Visit 10) in the MG Symptoms PRO ‘Muscle Weakness 
Fatigability’ score.  
• Change from Ba seline to Day 43 (Visit 10) in the MG Symptoms PRO ‘Physical Fatigue’ 
score.  
• Change from Baseline to Day 43 (Visit 10) in the MG Symptoms PRO ‘Bulbar Symptoms’ 
score.  
All other variables will be listed and summarized descriptively. Time to first MG -ADL res ponse 
(defined as ≥2.0 point improvement from Baseline) will be analyzed using a Cox Proportional 
Hazards model including a fixed term for treatment, and a term for the stratification factor 
(categorized as AChR or MuSK). The statistical model will be appl ied to each stage and the 
results combined using in a similar fashion to the primary analysis. An overall study used to

of interest will be presented. The time t o first MG -ADL response will be presented graphically 
using a Kaplan -Meier curve. Study participants will be censored at time of initiation of rescue 
therapy or end of treatment.  
Further exploratory analysis may be performed using adequate statistical met hods; details will be 
provided in the SAP.  
9.5 Planned Safety and other Analyses  
9.5.1  Safety analyses  
The frequency and severity of all TEAEs will be presented for each treatment group separately 
by [CONTACT_1196], high level term, and preferred term (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities [MedDRA]®). The data will be displayed as number of study participants experiencing 
the TEAE, percentage of study participants, and number of TEAEs. A TEAE is defined as any 
event that was not present prior to the first  administration of IMP or any unresolved event 
already present before the first administration of IMP that worsens in intensity following 
exposure to treatment.  
Laboratory evaluations and vital signs as well as ECG data will be analyzed over time. All safe ty 
analyses will be listed and summarized for the SS.  
9.5.2  Other analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic analyses  
The PK -PPS dataset will be used. Pharmacokinetic variables of rozanolixizumab like AUC (area 
under the curve), C max (maximum concentration) cannot be derived, sin ce blood sampling will be 
performed at [ADDRESS_998312] -dosing per visit only. Thus, PK is restricted to concentration data. 
In addition to the general descriptive display, concentration data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_730877], mean, median, SD, 
minimum, maximum, geometric mean (and associated 95% CI), and geometric coefficient of 
variation (assuming log -normally distributed data). Values below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) will be rep orted with a clear sign indicating that they were below the 
LLOQ. Descriptive statistics of concentrations will be calculated if at least two -thirds of the 
individual data points are quantifiable (≥LLOQ). The concentration data will be also summarized 
by [CONTACT_730878]. Individual concentrations of rozanolixizumab will also be 
displayed graphically.  
A population PK and population PKPD analysis will be performed to evaluate PK and PKPD of 
rozanolixizumab. Details of such analysis will be further des cribed in a separate Data Analysis 
Plan. The results of the analysis would be reported in a separate report outside the CSR. If 
required, an unblinded and relevant data transfer may be planned in order to initiate the PKPD 
analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti-drug antibodies a nalyses  
A tiered ADA approach will be used for the study. Anti -drug antibody assessment will involve 
Screening (above or below the cutpoint) of all samples for ADA, followed by a confirmatory 
assessment (confirmed or not confirmed positive) leading to an a nti-rozanolixizumab antibody 
positive or negative assessment for each sample and a subsequent titration of those anti -

rozanolixizumab antibody positive samples (or  subset of) further characterization for neutralizing 
ADA potential in vitro will be performed.  
The impact of ADA will be evaluated on PK, PD, efficacy and safety endpoints when relevant.  
9.6 Handling of protocol deviations  
Important protocol deviations are id entified as part of the data cleaning process in the Data 
Cleaning Plan (DCP). Ongoing data cleaning meetings will be held throughout the duration of 
the study. Objectives of these meetings include to review and update (if necessary) the important 
protocol  deviations in the DCP. Furthermore, overall trends in protocol deviations will be 
discussed at the Data Evaluation Meeting. Through this ongoing data cleaning and evaluation 
process, all decisions regarding important protocol deviations are made on an ong oing basis.  
9.7 Handling of dropouts or missing data  
All imputation of missing or partial dates for safety assessments, as well as handling missing 
efficacy data (where applicable), will be detailed in the SAP.  
9.8 Planned interim analysis and data monitoring  
9.8.1  Interim analysis  
A formal interim analysis is planned for this study at the end of Stage 1, once approximately 
(see Section  9.9 for sample size detail s) enrolled study participants ) are evaluable 
for the primary endpoint (having completed up to Day 43). Study enrollment will not be halted 
during planned IDMC review of the safety and efficacy data. The interim analysis is based on an 
adaptive  design and is based on the primary efficacy analysis of Change from Baseline in MG -
ADL. Data will be presented to and reviewed by [CONTACT_730879]:  
1. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_730827].  
2. If futility is not established, then the “best dose” of rozanolixizumab (and any dose with a 
mean response not worse than 1 point than the selected “best dose”) is selected for Stage [ADDRESS_998313], ie, there is no al pha spending function 
implemented.  
Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_730828] (non -binding) utilized for the study requires that the nominal Stage 1 
p-value of each dose to be greater than  This corresponds to both estimated treatment effe cts 
being in the wrong direction, ie, inferiority.

and not worse than epsilon” option of ADDPLAN MC, where epsilon is equal to 1. This 
approa ch selects the dose with largest effect defined in terms of the observed mean responses 
and any doses with a mean response no worse than the best dose by [ADDRESS_998314] b e less than  However, 
this may not be the sole criterion for selecting the dose, since, additionally, the IDMC will take 
account of factors, including safety, which will be detailed in the IDMC charter.  
Sample Size Re -estimation   
The sample size re -estimation will be performed with the only option to increase the sample size. 
The default sample size of  for the study study participants per arm in each of Stage 1 and 
Stage 2) is based on a set of assumptions concerning the ef fect sizes and variability (see 
Section  9.9 for details). However, it is  considered  prudent to conduct a mid -study sample size re -
estimation to assess the se important assumptions.  The approach to be used is to determine the 
Stage [ADDRESS_998315] sizes at the interim analysis.  
9.8.2  Periodic Data Reviews  
Approximately  3 periodic data reviews (in addition to the futility analysis) will be performed for 
the IDMC to oversee the safety of the study: the first periodic data review will be performed 
when approximately  study participants have completed the 6 -week Treatment  Period; the 
second periodic data review will be conducted after approximately study participants have 
completed the 6 -week Treatment Period (ad hoc as needed) ; and a third periodic data review will 
be conducted after approximately  study part icipants (dependent on the outcome of the 
interim analysis) have completed the [ADDRESS_998316] of 
or more versus placebo, is   
These results suppor t the strategy of entering eligible study participants per dose group in 
Stage 1 and between  to study participants per dose group in Stage 2. Note that ADDPLAN 
MC implements the sample size increase rule ‘per arm’ rather than ‘per stage’, so that if only one 
dose is selected for Stage 2, then the maximum sample size for this stage is  whereas if two 
doses are selected than the maximum Stage 2 sample size is  Therefore, if an overall study 
sample size cap of  (ie,  in Stage 2) were imp lemented, irrespective of whether one or two 
doses are selected, then we would expect power for each scenario to be slightly increased 
compared to those contained in Table  9-2.

approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participants. 
For minor changes to a previously approved protocol during the period covered by [CONTACT_18424], it may be possible for t he Investigator to obtain an expedited review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC as 
allowed.  
As part of the IRB/IEC requirements for continuing review of approved studies, the Investigator 
will be responsible for submitting periodic progress reports to the IRB/IEC (based on I RB/IEC 
requirements), at intervals appropriate to the degree of participant risk involved, but no less than 
once per year. The Investigator should provide a final report to the IRB/IEC following study 
completion.  
UCB (or its representative) will communicat e safety information to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities and all active investigators in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
The appropriate IRB/IEC will also be informed by [CONTACT_352292], as specified 
by [CONTACT_730880]. Where applicable, 
investigators are to provide the sponsor (or its representative) with evidence of such IRB/IEC 
notification.

Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
10.3.1  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered 
related to the study medication.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study medication.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal labora tory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from Baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientifi c judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of 
underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study medication administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
medication or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequel ae. 
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of e fficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE 
or SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the under lying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_13142]’s condition.

disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the study 
participant’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience ad mission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
10.3.2  Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256975]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
Baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in pe rsistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

f. Important medical  events:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330997]. These events should usually 
be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, potenti al Hy’s law, invasive 
or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.3.3  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.  
• The Invest igator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to UCB in lieu of completion of the UCB AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when co pi[INVESTIGATOR_730830]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_730831].  
• The Investigator will a ttempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will  make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:   
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activit ies. 
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.

Confidential  Page 97 of 188 • Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category u tilized for rating 
the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe (eg , a severe 
AE may be either serious or not serious, depending on whether these criteria are also 
met).  
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -
CTCAE) should be used as a supportive standardization instrument to eva luate AEs and 
SAEs but the final intensity grading by [CONTACT_671437], moderate, or 
severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study medication and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study medication 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult th e Investigator’s Brochure (IB) in his/her 
assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred  and the Investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to UCB. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to UCB.  
• The In vestigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirem ents.

• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_368811]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• An AE should be followed until it has resolved, has a stable sequelae, the Investiga tor 
determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the participant is lost to 
follow -up. This follow -up requirement applies to AEs, SAEs, and AEs of special 
interest.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognize d follow -
up period, the Investigator will provide UCB with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to UCB within 24 hours of receipt 
of the information.  
10.3.4  Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to UCB via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to UCB will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section).  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the  electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electron ic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section).  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT

Pregnancy Information  
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP : 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bi lateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the  absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
− Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue t heir HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance  
Male participants  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible t o participate if they 
agree to ONE of the following during the Treatment Period and for at least 90 days after the final 
dose of study treatment : 
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent 
on a long term  and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
• Agree to use a male condom when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a woman of 
childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant.  
In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm fo r the duration of the study and 
for at least [ADDRESS_998322] 90 days after the final dose of study 
treatment . 
Female participants  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table  10-1.

• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
• Pregnancy testing, with a sensitivity of ≥25mIU/mL will be performed. A serum and urine 
pregnancy test will be completed at Screen ing and Baseline, respectively.  
 
Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study. T his applies 
only to male participants who receive study medication. If the study participant is later found 
to be on placebo, then pregnancy data collection can stop.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the sponsor within once working day of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnan cy. Information 
on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, the follow -
up will be at least 12 months after the delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will 
be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or a bsence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure.  
Female Participants who become pregnant  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information  on any female participant who becomes

Assessments  
Participants with potential drug -induced liver injury must be assessed to determine if study 
medication must be discontinued. In addition, all concomitant medications and herbal 
supplements that are not medically necessary should also be discontinued.  
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on study participants in th e case of study 
medication discontinuation to complete the final evaluation.  
Study participants with potential drug -induced liver injury should not be withdrawn from the 
study until investigation and monitoring are complete. All results of these evaluatio ns and 
observations, as well as the reason(s) for study medication discontinuation and/or participant 
withdrawal (if applicable), must be recorded in the source documents. The CRF must document 
the primary reason for discontinuation of study medication.  
A specific monitoring plan must be agreed between the UCB study physician and the 
Investigator for study participants who have ALT >[ADDRESS_998325]. The monitoring plan should include 
any necessary follow -up assessments (until resolution of the abnormal lab values).

Amendment 3 (29  Jul 2020)  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  
The primary reason for this protocol amendment is to introduce the MG0007 study as the 
open -label extension (OLE) study to MG0003 and closure of MG0004 once MG0007 study is 
available, decrease the complexity o f assessments to be performed, clarify some operational 
aspects of the study, and to include the management of study participant treatment during the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic including contingency measures.  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

Confidential  Page 173 of 188 10.23  Appendix 23: Management of Headache  
Based on current available clinical  data, headache is the most commonly reported adverse drug 
reaction in study participants treated with rozanolixizumab. Study participants should be well 
informed of this potential adverse drug reaction and should be instructed on how to manage it.  
Determi nation of the severity of headache will be consistent with Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) version 5.0 (Appendix 3, Section  10.3). Severe headache is 
defined as severe pain limiting self -care activities of daily living (ADL). Self -care activities of 
daily living (ADL) refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, and 
taking medications.  
In the event of headache investigators will take medical history of previous headaches, 
concomitant medication, and co -morbidities (eg, asthma) in consideration.  
Study participants experiencing severe and/or serious headache will complete the Headache 
Questionnaire ( Section  10.27 , Appendix 27 ) daily until resolving or resolution (ie, if headache 
becomes non -serious, moderate or mild, or completely resolved, whichever comes first). The 
questionnaire should be administered via an interview with the study participant. If the severe or 
serious hea dache is initially reported at a home visit or during a telephone call, the study 
participant should be reviewed at the study site as soon as is practically possible for further 
investigations. Study participants should be monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of 
central nervous system involvement and evaluated immediately if other causes (eg, meningitis, 
intracranial bleeding) are suspected. Further neurological workup may be performed (if 
indicated) at the discretion of the investigator or the treat ing physician and may include, a 
computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging and/or a lumbar puncture for cerebral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_730842]. In addition, samples for exploratory safety biomarkers should be collected 
for study participants experienc ing severe headache or serious headaches when possible. These 
investigations will be performed to further understand the mechanism of headaches in the study 
participants.  
Treatments must be permanently discontinued if a study participant has a serious head ache that is 
considered related to the IMP in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. Treatment may be temporarily 
put on hold if a study participant experiences a severe AE of headache that is considered related 
to the IMP in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], and  is not resolved prior to the next scheduled 
study treatment. If deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_730888], the study treatment can resume upon the resolution of the severe 
headache event. The benefit a nd risk of the treatment should be carefully considered prior to 
reinitiating the IMP. However, if a treatment related severe headache reoccurs, the treatment 
must be permanently discontinued.  
Headaches will be treated as clinically indicated according to  national guidelines. It is 
recommended to start the analgesic at early onset of headache. At the discretion of the 
Investigator, study participants may carry a recommended analgesic with the instruction for 
frequency and dosage provided. Study participant s experiencing any treatment related headache 
will be followed until resolution of the event.  
Prophylactic treatment of headaches may be permitted for study participants who have 
experienced previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_730843] e after discussion 
with the medical monitor.

Severe (Grade 3) diarrhea is defined as an increase of ≥7 stools per day or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730844] -care ADL. Determination of the severi ty of diarrhea will 
be consistent with CTCAE version 5.0 ( see Appendix  3, Section  10.3).  
Diarrhea will be treated as clinically indicated according  to the local guidelines.  
Stool samples may be collected for stool analysis to rule out infection for study participants 
reporting severe diarrhea. Stool sampling will be as clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_730845]. In addition, collection of blood samples for 
assessment of exploratory safety biomarkers is required for study participants with severe GI 
disturbances including diarrhea.

Hypogammaglobulinemia  
Study pa rticipants who have signs or symptoms of any infection should be monitored closely and 
managed according to local guidelines. This may include tests for specific organisms if clinically 
indicated .  
Study participants  MUST discontinue IMP AND move into the SFU Period if any of the 
following events occur: Study participant has a serious infective epi[INVESTIGATOR_730846] (ie, bacteremia or sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis or 
septic arthritis, pneumonia, or visceral absce ss).  
To maintain the study integrity, IgG level will remain blinded to the study sites and the UCB 
study team. To ensure patient safety, serum IgG level will be monitored by [CONTACT_730889]. The IMP may be temporarily discontinued as requested by [CONTACT_730890]. Mock infusions will be administered to 
maintain the blind in case of low IgG levels (see Section  7.1.4 ). 
In the event of a non -serious infection, the Benefit -Risk of continuing treatment with IMP must 
be carefully evaluated by [CONTACT_730891]. Treatment 
may be temporarily discontinued for the study participant who develops a non -serious persisting 
or recurrent infection with a serum total IgG level between ≥1g/L and <2g/L. Upon resolution of 
infection and the IgGs returning to the level of ≥2g/L, the study participant may be allowed to 
resume treatment with the IMP. Ad hoc assessment can be performed to monitor the recovery of 
IgG levels.  
Treatment must be temporarily discontinued for the study participant who develops an event of 
hypogammaglobulinemia with a serum total IgG of <1g/L irrespective of infection. When the 
IgG level reaches ≥2g/L, the study participant may be allowed to continue treatment with IMP .

Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Study participants must be closely monitored for reactions during and after the study drug 
administration period. Standard precautions must be taken for the study participants with regards 
to potential infusion related reactio ns. Suggested management guidelines for infusion -related 
reactions or anaphylaxis are provided in Table  10-4. Definitions of severity of the relevant eve nts 
should be consistent with CTCAE version 5.0 (Section  10.3). 
Table  10-4: Suggested management guidelines for infusion reactions or 
anaphylaxis  
Type of reaction  Suggested action  
Acute – Mild  
Grade 1  Monitor vital signs every 10 min.  
If the reaction worsens to Grade 2, follow the instruction below.   
Acute – Moderate  
Grade 2  Interrupt/hold infusion temporarily to further assess and initiate 
treatment if necessary.  
Consider the use of iv fluid and antihistamine iv/im.  
Consider administering paracetamol or NSAIDs.  
Monitor vital signs initially every [ADDRESS_998367] ion improves and upon further assessment it is clear that the 
event is not an anaphylaxis, restart the infusion cautiously. Continue 
monitor vital signs every 5 minutes.  
If reaction recurs or worsens to Grade 3, discontinue infusion.  
Acute – Severe  
Grade [ADDRESS_998368]; ensure oxygen is available.  
Administer:  
− Antihistamine iv/im, corticosteroids iv, epi[INVESTIGATOR_368757], and iv 
fluids as appropriate.  
− Monitor vital signs every 2 min.  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552], if condition not improving or worsens  
− Monitor patient until symptoms resolve.  
CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; im=intramuscular; IMP=investigational medicinal 
product; iv=intravenous(ly); NSAID=nonsteroidal anti -inflamma tory drug  
Note: Management criteria were adapted from the CTCAE v5.0 (National Cancer Institute, 2017).  
In case of suspected anaphylaxis, the Sampson’s Criteria (Sampson et al, 2006) should be 
accessed and Appendix 28 (Section  10.28 , Sampson Criteria Questionnaire) should be 
completed . The infusion must be discontinued immediately and emergency resuscitation 
measures implemented.

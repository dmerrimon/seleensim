Non-inferiority study of immediate or delayed provisionalization at posterior healed sites using 
NobelParallel ™ CC implants  
 
 
STUDY PURPOSE  AND RATIONALE 
Dental implants are a widely used treatment option for the replacement of lost teeth due to trauma or oral 
diseases. The original protocol for placement of dental implants in edentulous spaces in the maxilla or the 
mandible was introduced more  than thirty years ago and called for a two -stage approach, i.e., surgical 
placement of submerged dental implant s and subsequent uncovering with abutment connection, prosthesis 
fabrication and  functional loadi ng approximately 6 months after  (Brånemark et al., 1983) . Today, the time 
between surgery and loading in a two-stage protocol has been commonly abbreviated to 3 -4 months, while 
immediate implant provisionalization has emerged as  a reliable and predictable option in cases of adequate 
osseous support,  having similar surv ival and success rates to the two-step procedure  (Esposito et al., 2009) . 
Comparison of histological healing has demonst rated no significant  differences in bone to implant contact 
[CONTACT_694427] a two -stage protocol and those immediately provisionalized  
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_694421]., 1993) . However, Esposito et al. (2009) also  noted a substantial variability among the clinical 
protocols used in the studies carried out so far , and concluded that additional  well-designed randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to fully appreciate the clinical outcomes  of immediate and early loading 
protocols.  
 
The design of dental implants is a subject of continuous improvement, and implant manufacturers regularly 
introduce new products the use of which  may result in accelerate d soft and hard tissue healing, increase d initial 
implant stability, and enhance d esthetic outcomes. The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to compare 
treatment outcomes when usi ng a newly -introduced dental implant (NobelParal lel™ CC) in a one -stage or a two -
stage protocol.  This new implant has the same titanium oxide surface coating (TiUnite®) and the same design 
principles of the parallel-walled NobelSpeedy Groovy ™ implants, and an internal conical connection . The implant 
is marketed  under the premarket notifications K050406 and K073142  (510 (k), Food and Drug Administration ).  
 
 
SUMMA RY OF STU DY PURPOSE  
To compare  two loading protocols using the new implant (NobelParallel™ CC)  in posterior healed sites in two 
treatment arms: one in which the implant will be immediately provi sionalized at the time of surgery , and 
another where the provisional crown will be delivered 3 months after the surgical procedure .  
 
 
STUDY DESIGN  AND STATISTICAL P ROCEDURES OVERVIEW 
This is a non -inferiority study of 12 -month duration  comparing the two treatment arms described above.  
Eligible patients with edentulous spaces at the maxillary or mandibular premolar/molar areas will be 
randomized to either an immediate provisionalization or a delayed provisionalization treatment arm. Patients 
in both treatment  arms will receive their final fixed restoration  at 4 months after surgery. The primary outcome 
of the study will be the radiographically assessed alveolar bone level change at the mesial and distal surface 
of the implant at 6 and 12 months after surgical placement. Secondary outcomes  will include implant survival, 
 2 
 volumetric soft tissue changes , peri-implant probing depth, and implant stability by [CONTACT_694428]. 
 
 
POWER CALCUL ATIONS AND STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS 
Determination of sample size was based on anticipated differences in the primary outcome  between the two 
treatment arms at 6 months  (change in alveolar level from the time of implant placement). Based on similar 
data published in the literature  (Esposito et al., 2013) , we calculated with 1 mm bone remodeling in one 
treatment arm, and 1.5 mm bone remodeling in the second arm ( i.e., expected mean difference between the 
two arms amounting to 0.5 mm). With a common standard d eviation in both arms of 0.[ADDRESS_942064] (Cohen’s d) amounts to 0.[ADDRESS_942065] for unmatched samples , after checking for data normality . Additional analyses will include regress ion 
models in which insertion torque (a measure of primary implant stability at the time of surgical placement) 
will be also used as a covariate along with treatment group allocation.  
 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
Eligible participants (i.e., adults ≥18 years old in need of a dental implant at a posterior maxillary or 
mandibular region ) who have been referred for dental implant treatment at the Clinics of  the College of Dental 
Medicine  will be approached by [CONTACT_694429] s tudy will be explained. Signed 
informed consent will be obtained.  
 
All patients will be referred for limited field cone beam computer tomography to assess presence of adequat e 
bone volume at the area of in terest, according to stand ard clinic protocol . Alginate i mpressions will be 
obtained to fabricate diagnostic stone casts. A vacuum-formed stent will be manufactured in the laboratory to 
offer fixed reference points for longitudinal  probing measurements, and a radiographic stent using polyvinyl 
siloxane interocclusal record  material will allow standardized positioning of the radiographic holder to obtain 
periapi[INVESTIGATOR_694422] .  
 
At the day  of surgery  (baseline) , a computer -generated sequence will assign patient s to either the one-stage 
or the two-stage treatment arm. In both arms, the implant will be placed fl ush with the bone crest, after flap 
elevation, according to standard treatment protocol. A periapi[INVESTIGATOR_694423] o f surgery.  
 
Patients in t he one-stage group will receive  a temporary acrylic crown manufactured chair -side at the same 
visit. Care will be taken to reli eve the crown f rom occlusal and laterotrusive contacts . The distance from the 
soft tissue margin to the occlusal stent will be measured using a periodontal probe at six sites around the 
implant (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual and distolingual)  at the time of post -
surgical follow -up, 1-[ADDRESS_942066] protocol for fabri cation of the fin al implant supported restoration  (a full contour 
Zirconia abutment crown with an angulated screw channel ), which will be delivered approximately 2 weeks 
later. Resonance frequency analysis measurements will be obtained to determine implant stability using an 
Ostell™ device. After delivery of the final restoration, a periapi[INVESTIGATOR_694424], soft tissue 
margin measurements will be carried out as des cribed above, and peri-implant probing depths will be 
assessed at the same six sites. An  alginate impression will also be obtained to produce a stone cast to be 
used in volumetric measurements.  
 
At seven months after implant surgery , patients in both treat ment groups will return for a follow up visit to 
reinforce oral hygiene and will receive oral prophylaxis.  
 
At twelve  months after implant surgery , patients in both treatment groups will return for a follow up visit 
to reinforce oral hygiene and to receive oral prophylaxis. Resonance frequency analysis measurements will 
be obtained to determine implant stability using an Ostell™ device. A periapi[INVESTIGATOR_694424], 
soft tissue margin measurements will be carried out as described above, and probing depths will be assessed 
at the same six sites around the implant. An impression will be obtained to produce a cast to be used in 
volumetric measurements. The 12 -month examination will conclude the study visits.  
 
 
Research procedures  
 
1. Radiographic measurements of alveolar bone level mesial and distal to the implant (at baseline, four months 
and 12 months) will be carried out using the MIPACS software. The implant platform will be the reference 
point. Note that although the measurements will be  carried out for the purposes of the study, periapi[INVESTIGATOR_694425], at the time of delivery of the final restora tion, and at [ADDRESS_942067] of care.  
2. Measurements of soft tissue margin from a vacuum -formed stent at 6 sites per tooth (obtained at the day 
the provisional crown is delivered, i.e. at the post -operative visit [ADDRESS_942068]-operative visit 1 -2 weeks after implant uncovering  in the two -stage 
arm). 
3. Probing depth measurements around the implant (at 4 and 12 months) . 
4. Volumetric  assessments , based on digit ally super-imposed casts (obtained at screening, 4 months and 12 
months). 
5. Resonance frequency analysis measurements using a Ostell™ device  (at 4 and 12 months) . These are non -
invasive measurements of implant stability .

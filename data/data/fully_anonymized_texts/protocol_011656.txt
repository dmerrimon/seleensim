2) Objectives  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of breast computed 
tomography (CT) for breast cancer detection. A breast CT scanner has been built 
using a flat panel detector and cone beam techniques. The breast CT system will be evaluated to determine the efficacy of the scanner in the detection of lesions and the results will be compared to breast MRI, mammography and the histopathological findings of the detected lesions.  
  We have studied the potential of breast CT (bCT) for breast imaging under an NIH -
funded Biomedical Research Partnership (BRP) grant (R01 EB002138 -10), and [ADDRESS_752999] imaged over 600 women to date (under more than one IRB -approved protocol).  The BRP grant cannot be 
renewed, and with this (resubmitted) R01 grant application, we seek to finalize our research in breast CT – The specific aims have been significantly modified as a 
result of the first critique, and we now focus on a narrower set of remaining issues.  
 
Specific Aims:  
 Contrast injections are used to identify breast cancer lesions in clinical p rocedures, 
most notably breast MRI (gadolinium contrast agent).  Other investigators have demonstrated the utility of iodine contrast agent injection for breast cancer delineation in projection mammography techniques, using both dual energy subtraction (Le win) and temporal subtraction (Yaffe) to highlight the visualization 
of the breast tumor.   Specific Aim 1: Develop scatter correction and image processing methods to improve Hounsfield Unit (HU) accuracy.   
The UC Davis bCT scanners do not use an anti -scatter grid to keep radiation dose 
low. We have developed an inverse beam stop method for accurate scatter -
correction, but this needs to be implemented in software. In addition to this 
physics -based scatter correction method, additional image processing meth ods 
will be explored to maximize the quantitative integrity (Hounsfield unit accuracy) 
of bCT images while minimizing cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. We hypothesize that improvements in HU

  Template Revision: June 15, [ADDRESS_753000] injection ( ΔHU).  
 
Specific Aim 2: Optimize non -contrast bCT imaging for microcalcification detection.  
The ultimate goal of the breast tomography project is to improve breast cancer screening beyond the lim itations of projection mammography, and for practical 
reasons this precludes contrast injection for screening normal risk patients.  Since the (4th) Doheny scanner has >4 times the MTF (at 10%) than earlier scanners, we 
believe that bCT can now compete with mammography for microcalcification 
detection. In this aim, image optimization in terms of microcalcification detection performance will be performed. Using physical phantoms with microcalcifications, image reconstruction parameters (apodization filter, m atrix dimensions, 
preprocessing techniques, etc.) will be optimized and evaluated using mathematical metrics and human observer performance studies on phantoms containing microcalcifications.  
 Specific Aim 3:  Clinical Trial: Imaging women using breast CT and CE -MRI 
Women with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352] (BIRADS 4+5) will undergo digital mammography (“2D”) and tomosynthesis (“3D”) as standard of care workup. Patients who participate will undergo both unenhanced and contrast enhanced breast CT imaging, and also contrast -enhanced breast MRI. Both breasts (affected and 
unaffected) will be imaged  with bCT and MRI.  Our facility biopsies 2400 patients 
over 5 years, and power analysis shows that we will need a total of 400 patients 
whose images will be used for the normal- risk patient screening comparisons (Aim 
4) and for the high risk patient screening comparisons (Aim 5).  
 Specific Aim 4:  Normal Risk Screening Performance: Comparison of non -contrast 
bCT with 2D and 2D+3D mammography.  The 4th bCT scanner (“Doheny”) is now operational and has four times the spatial resolution of our earliest scanner.  Non -
contrast bCT has demonstrated better mass -lesion detection performance than 
mammography (Lindfors, et al, 2008) but using the earlier bCT systems, microcalcification detection was inferior to mammography.  Doheny now has vastly improved spatial resolution, and we hypothesize that bCT is (now) equal to or better than screening mammography for microcalcification detection. In this aim, digital mammography and non -contrast bCT images will be compared in a 
standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study.  Mammography with 
Tomosynthesis will also be compared against non -contrast bCT, using ROC 
methods.  A full- search methodology will be used.  
 
Specific Aim 5:  High Risk Screening Performance: CE breast CT and CE -breast MRI.  
To evaluate the potential of CE -bCT for use in high risk screening (as MRI is used 
now), CE -bCT ROC performance will be compared against CE -MRI ROC 
performance.  Radiologists will perform full 3D search of the CT and MRI (independently) volume data sets (both with and without contrast) and report

potential FROC or LROC analysis will also be captured.  Assessme nt of ΔHU will also 
be performed to quantitatively evaluate predictive performance for malignancy.  
 
Specific Aims 1 and 2 do not require changes in hardware; these two aims are completely focused on post -acquisition image processing techniques (software). 
Therefore, accrual to the clinical trials as described in Aim [ADDRESS_753001]. The acquired projection image data from the scanner is always 
saved, and once the scatter -correction and flat fielding techniques (Aim 1) and 
optimized reconstruction methods (Aim 2) are finalized, images will be re -
reconstructed and become available for the ROC studies on normal -risk screening 
(Aim 4) and high -risk screening (Aim 5) performance.  We believe that this [ADDRESS_753002] can outperform 2D & 3D 
mammography in breast cancer screening for normal risk patients, and that CE -
bCT is (at least) equivalent to CE -MRI for screening high -risk women.  
 
3) Background  
 
Breast cancer is a disease with high incidence that will affect the life of one of every eight women in the [LOCATION_002]. Early detection of breast cancer is the most important factor determining prognosis, and X -ray mammography is the 
principal screening tool for breast cancer world -wide.  While mammography is not 
without shortcomings, it nevertheless plays an important and documented role in reducing mortality associated with breast cancer. The principal weakness of mammography is in its application to women with extremely dense, glandular breasts. Imaging the dense breast with good sensitivity has taken on more 
importance as younger women (40 -49 year age group) are now screened routinely, 
as the use of hormone replacement therapy has expanded, and as genetic testing identifies younger women at risk. Equalizatio n techniques have been shown to 
increase the effective dynamic range of mammography, however their technical complexity has hampered widespread adoption. Digital radiographic systems, finally nearing wide -scale clinical use, have the promise of improving 
mammography of the dense breast due to their increased dynamic range over 
screen -film mammography. However, like screen -film mammography, digital 
mammography integrates all anatomical structures in the breast onto a planar projection image. The fundamental problem of detecting breast cancer in dense 
breasts is the superposition of multiple overlaying glandular structures, which can 
obscure the visualization of a breast tumor. A fundamental solution to this problem lays in the use of tomographic imaging techniques, which vastly reduces

  Template Revision: June 15, [ADDRESS_753003] computed tomography (bCT ) is a fully tomographic cone beam x -
ray based imaging modality that generates three dimensional images of the breast. In initial clinical trials, bCT was shown to provide significantly better visualization 
of mass lesions than that capable with mammograph y; however mammography 
outperformed bCT in visualizing microcalcifications.[1] Further work using injected 
iodine based contrast medium in conjunction with bCT, or so called contrast-enhanced bCT (CE -bCT), verified that mass lesions are seen better on CE -bCT than 
on mammography. However, the visualization of microcalcifications, specifically those associated with a malignant lesion, was similar at CE -bCT and 
mammography, suggesting that the use of iodine contrast medium may close the gap between bCT and mam mography in visualizing malignancy.[2] Due to the 
contrast injection, CE -bCT is a more invasive procedure than mammography and 
may not be appropriate as a modality for breast cancer screening in the general population. CE -bCT may have more potential as a tool for screening in high risk 
patients, for cancer staging, and for tumor targeting. Unenhanced bCT may still serve as an important imaging modality for tumor staging and targeting in patients with contraindications to iodine contrast imaging.  
 Contrast Enhanced Breast CT Significance  
 Contrast injections are used to identify breast cancer lesions in clinical procedures, most notably breast MRI (gadolinium contrast agent).  Other investigators have demonstrated the utility of iodine contrast agent injectio n for breast cancer 
delineation in projection mammography techniques, using both dual energy subtraction (Lewin) and temporal subtraction (Yaffe) to highlight the visualization of the breast tumor.

 5) Study Timelines  
 
The duration of the subject’s active participation  is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_753009]’s pathology follow- up is ~2 -3 months.  
The estimated date to complete the study is approximately December 31, 2022. 
 6) Study Endpoints  
 Primary: The primary study endpoint will be the assessment of patient safety and 
comfort at the conclusion of the imaging phase of the study.  
 Secondary: The secondary study endpoint will be the comparison of breast MRI 
versus breast CT in terms of sensitivity and specificity using biopsy findings as the standard of truth for lesion characterization. True positives & negatives and false positive & negatives will be defined and ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves will be generated.

The patient’s biopsy appointment typi[INVESTIGATOR_573581] [ADDRESS_753010]’s scheduled breast biopsy appointment.  
 
Breast CT : 
 The subjects will arrive at the Ambulatory Care Center, Suite [ADDRESS_753011]. The woman to be scanned will lie prone on a large table (which is covered by a foam pad), and she will place the breast to be scanned in a small hole in that tabletop. The hole is surrounded by a soft neoprene “hammock,” which will allow the woman’s entire upper torso to slump into the scan plane of 
the device. After positioning of the breast by a female mammography 
technologist, two single projection scout images will be acquired to confirm proper positioning  and two additional single projection images will be acquired with a 
tungsten collimator placed at the X -ray tube for scatter correction. The woman will 
be instructed to hold her breath (for approximately 15  seconds) and the scan will 
commence. There will be no breast compression (as in mammography), and other

(Note: If the study subject cannot tolerate i odinated contrast, or IV placement is 
not possible, the subject may still participate in the non -contrast CT scanning.)  
 
After aseptically preppi[INVESTIGATOR_467433]’s skin, a intravenous catheter will be 
inserted into the antecubital vein. The patient will be positioned in the scanner as described above and the IV will be connected to the power injector. [ADDRESS_753013] agent (Omnipaque -350 350 mg I/ml) at a rate of 4ml/sec will be injected 
over the course of approximately [ADDRESS_753014] at 4ml/sec will be injected prior to scanning the first breast, and a second 50 ml at 4ml/sec will be injected prior to imaging the sec ond 
breast. The total radiation dose will be the same as that for those subjects who receive the single [ADDRESS_753015] MRI : 
 The subjects will arrive at the Ambulatory Care Center, Suite [ADDRESS_753016]’s forearm. The subject will 
then be positioned on the scan table prone, with each breast hanging into separate holes of the MRI coil. Pre -contrast scanning will then take pla ce (short T -1 
inversion recovery (STIR) and T -1 weighted pulse sequences). MRI contrast will 
then be injected (Omniscan (Gadodiamide) GE Healthcare) at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg and at a rate of 2 ml/second by a power injector. [ADDRESS_753017]’s visit will be complete. Total time for this visit is approximately 45 minutes.  
  
 NOTE: If a subject wishes  to participate, but cannot or will not, undergo MRI 
scanning, the subject may  still be enrolled for the CT portion only.  
 
 After the scans have finished, the participant will be given a questionnaire to complete about their experience during the study.  A fter completion of the scans 
and completing the questionnaire, their active participation in the study will be

 8) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality  
 
Statistics  and Determination of Study Sample and Data Analysis : 
 
For this next cohort of 400 subjects, the following statistical analysis has been 
performed:  
 
Over the past three years, the UC Davis breast imaging facility has averaged 15,[ADDRESS_753019] 4 years of the proposal, so that a “forgetting” time of at least 6 months can be enforced from the time of imaging to the reader studies. All cases will be recruited from BIRADS 4 & 5 women who will be biopsied in our facility, and we assume the historical 38% positive biopsy rate for our facility. The recruited w omen will undergo pre - and post - contrast bCT imaging, as 
well as pre - and post- contrast CE -MRI imaging. These women will all have had 
bilateral 2D and 3D mammography imaging as part of their screening and diagnostic workup. The biopsy findings will serve  as ground truth for all cases. In 
addition, the vast majority of women will have all findings limited to a single breast, leaving the unaffected breast available as a non -cancer image (i.e. normal) 
for the screening study in Aim 4. Based on the power studies described below, the minimum number of women we need to recruit to run the study is 150 with biopsy -verified cancer and an additional 50 with benign findings (i.e., 150 / 0.38 = 
395 ≈ 400). At a minimum, we plan to recruit 400 and will strive to recrui t 
substantially more. Given a total of 1,920 candidate women, the 38% positive rate for biopsy, and a 25% rate of recruitment, we would expect to be able to acquire 182 cases (1920 × 0.38 × 0.25) with cancer over the recruitment period, and this would corr esponding to ~298 (1920 × 0.25 × [1- 0.38]) women with benign findings.

  Template Revision: June 15, 2017  These recruitment figures are conservative in terms of the recruitment rate, and 
they still provide more than enough cases for our studies.  
 
Numbers of patients needed: To size the s tudies, we have conducted power  
analyses [Abbey et al., 2013] based on the Roe and Metz simulation (2,000 runs)  
for a fixed effects ANOVA model instead of the usual mixed effects model  
proposed by [CONTACT_573586], Berbaum, and Metz (DBM) or correlated error model of  
Obuchowski and Rockette (Hillis SL, et al., 2005). For the normal- risk bCT -screening  
study (Aim 4), we have sized the study on the basis of 4 readers, an improvement  
of 0.05 in AUC, and with average AUC near 0.85 (i.e. AUC = 0.825 vs AUC =  
0.875). At th ese performance benchmarks, 82% power is achieved with 150  
positive cases and 250 negative cases. This is a reasonable number of cases given  
the recruitment procedures described in §D3.1. For the CE -bCT/CE -MRI (high risk  
screening) comparison (Aim 5), we investigate the non- inferiority of breast CT  
relative to MRI. We will consider breast CT to be successful in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_573582] -averaged AUC values is greater than -0.025 (i.e.  
AUC(BCT) – AUC(MRI) > - 0.025), for a study in  which average AUC is approximately  
0.85. The Roe and Metz simulation [Abbey, et al, 2013] with 4 readers and 150  
cases (60 positive and 90 negative) yields 82% power for finding non- inferiority as  
defined above in 2,[ADDRESS_753020] accountability : 
  There will be a clear accounting of all subjects involved with the study. This includes subjects who are consented, screened, eligible and enrolled as well as ineligible subjects. If a candidate is deemed ineligible for enrollment, the reason for ineligibility will be recorded. There will also be a listing of all patients discontinue d or withdrawn from the study after enrollment. These statistics will be 
reported to the IRB during annual reviews  when required . 
 
All subjects participating in this study will provide written consent in the form of the Informed Consent Form. The investigators will allow the candidate to read the consent form and will ask the candidate if they have any questions prior to enrollment. Subject initials, signatures, and date and time will be required in the 
appropriate places on the form.

Amendment 1 (10 September 2019)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:   The overall reasons for the amendment are to modify the study 
design with regards to the planned and optional doses and to remove the option for preoperative dosing.
Section Number
and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Title Page The study name “ AXIOMATIC-TKR -
Antithrombotic treatment with factor XIa 
inhibition to Optimize Management of Acute 
Thromboembol icevents in TKR ” was added 
to the title page.The title page was revised to 
include the study name [CONTACT_713016].
1.1. Synopsis Objectives
and Endpoints;
3. Objectives and EndpointsParenthesis placement was moved in the 
primary objective to include all deaths in the 
definition of total venous thromboembolism 
(VTE). Editorial error in the primary 
objective did not align with efficacy evaluations in the 
assessment of study outcomes.
1.1. Synopsis Objectives 
and Endpoints; 1.1. Synopsis Hypothesis; 
3. Objectives and EndpointsThe hypothesis and the primary endpoint were 
revised to specify that the event rate will be analyzed by [CONTACT_941] “combined twice daily (BID)
dose group” instead of the “combined dose 
group”.
Also, the secondary endpoint was modified in 
regard to the bleeding criteria because there is 
no International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) assessment for clinically 
relevant nonmajor bleeding in the surgical 
setting. The language pertaining to the 
hypothesis, primary and secondary endpoints modified 
for enhanced clarity.

review of the data.
1.1. Synopsis; 1.2. Schema; 4.1. Overall Design; 6.1. Study Drugs 
AdministeredThe option to administer preoperative doses of 
JNJ-70033093 was removed throughout the protocol.Academic leadership advised 
that preoperative dosing would not be adopted by [CONTACT_712957], 
therefore testing was removed from the protocol.
1.1. Synopsis; 1.2. Schema; 6.1. Study Drugs 
Administered; 
6.3. Measures to Minimize 
Bias: Randomization and 
Blinding; 9. Statistical 
Considerations•    Once daily dose regimens of 
JNJ-70033093 were moved from the start of 
the study to possible doses after the interim 
analysis and the doses were changed from 
25 mg once daily and 200 mg once daily to 
50 mg once daily and 200 mg once daily.
• Initial randomization changed from
1:1:1:1: 1:1:2 to 1:1:1:1:2
• Initial number of dose groups changed 
from 7 to 5• Removed text noting the number of 
ongoing doses of JNJ-70033093 is expected to 
be no fewer than 4 doses.The once daily doses were re-
evaluated, and the 50 mg once 
daily dose will be evaluated
because it more closely parallels 
the 25 mg BID dose and will 
allow for a more meaningful comparison between the once 
daily and BID doses.
1.1. Synopsis, Number of 
Subjects; 1.2. Schema; 
4.1. Overall Design; 
9. Statistical ConsiderationsTarget and maximum number of subjects was 
changed from 1,200 and 1,500 to 900 and 
1,200, respectively. Text revised to specify 
that this is based on the possible addition of once daily doses and/or the evaluability rate.
It was also clarified that the number of 
subjects who were planned to be randomized 
into the dropped dosing regimen can be allocated to one of the other dosing groups.The target number of subjects 
was changed based on the 
change in the study design.

4.1. Overall Design; 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for 
Study Design; 6.1. Study 
Drug Administered• Regarding the first dose of study drug, the 
specification for “the day after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery” was changed to 
“after the end of TKR surgery” and “next 
day” was removed.
• “PO” was removed in front of days of the 
visit• 10- to 14- postoperative days was changed 
to 10 to 14 days.
• Postoperative Day 10-14 visit was 
changed to Day 10-14. 
• Footnote “r” added to SoA to specify 
optional pharmacodynamic (PD) samples for 
subjects randomized to enoxaparin.During initiation of the study it 
was determined that standard-of-care in certain regions should 
initiate anticoagulation on the 
day of surgery, not the morning 
after surgery. 
Collection of the PD sample was 
made optional for enoxaparin 
subjects in order to make dosing 
on the evening of surgery more 
practical.

enrollment is appropriate.
For Group G, the 50 mg once daily dose was 
added (2 capsules JNJ-70033093: 25 mg in the morning and 2 placebo capsules in the 
evening). Text noting that enrollment in 
Group G will become optional per 
Amendment 1 was also added.
Optional Group H removed. Text noting that no optional dose will exceed

• Laboratory samples at the up to Day -30 
timepoint were removed. The Factor XI (FXI)
antigen required at this time point was also 
moved to 0 hour.• Specified that enoxaparin may be administered preoperatively [ADDRESS_970281] dose of study drug will not be administered 
until 12 to 24 hours after wound 
closure. In addition, laboratory 
samples to be collected prior to 
surgery are no longer necessary since the 0-hour samples will becollected prior to study drug for all subjects. Because randomization will now occur 
postoperatively, clarification 
added that 0-hour samplescannot be drawn until after randomization because some are conditional samples based on the treatment group.
1.3. Schedule of Activities (SoA)Text added to footnote d: Day 4 procedures 
may be conducted up to +2 days (ie, samples may be drawn on Days 5 or 6) and Day 7 
procedures may be conducted +2 days(ie, Day 8 or 9).Text added to allow flexibility 
with laboratory testing on weekend days.
1.3. Schedule of Activities (SoA), Footnote e; 
6.1. Study Drugs

window to allow the 12-hour sample to be 
drawn the following morning, the evening 
dose of study drug on Day [ADDRESS_970282] be a minimum 
of 6 hours between doses on these days.Twice daily dosing should

Brochure, Edition 5.
4.1. Overall Design  Modified text to specify the OC may unblind 
any member of the Steering Committee and that any member unblinded will no longer be involved in the operational aspects of the trial.Revised to allow the OC 
flexibility in consulting with the 
Steering Committee members 
when discussing data resulting in 
recommendations to revise the 
study design.
4.1. Overall Design  Deleted sentence: Pharmacokinetic, PD, and 
biomarker samples will also be collected and 
assessed.Corrected error, since PK/PD 
samples will not be collected at 
Week 6.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for 
Study Design, Choice of ComparatorClarified text to add that 40-mg daily dose of 
enoxaparin will be used in this study as it is the dosage regimen used in “most” approved 
countries for the indication being studied.Text modified because some 
countries use enoxaparin [ADDRESS_970285] TKR surgery.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for 
Study Design, Choice of 
BiomarkersText changed from postoperatively “at 
approximately 12 to 24 hours” to “on Day 1 
(0 hour) prior to study drug administration”.Text edited to reflect the correct 
time the cardiac troponins would 
be drawn postoperatively.
4.3. Justification for Dose Additional justification provided for using a 
more conservative approach for the lowest 
proposed once daily dose based on 
maintaining pharmacological effect of aPTT 
prolongation at ≥1.[ADDRESS_970286] proposed once 
daily dose.
5.1. Inclusion Criteria; 5.3. Lifestyle 
ConsiderationsHalf-life restrictions for birth control 
measures were increased by 2 days. The following criteria were updated accordingly:
•  #8 Requirement for birth control for females 
was increased from 32 to 34 days• #9 Requirement for egg donation for females was increased from 32 to 34 days• #10 Requirement for birth control for males was increased from 92 to 94 days
• #[ADDRESS_970287]-induced nephropathy instead of
neuropathy
Exclusion Criterion 8 modified to include 
sensitivities to heparin and pork productsExclusion criteria revised for 
clarity.
5.3. Lifestyle 
ConsiderationsThe following criterion was modified:
#3 Timepoint requirement for the restriction 
on donating blood was changed from “at least Lifestyle restriction revised for

4 days after completion of the study” to “until 
after completion of the study”
5.4. Screen Failures Text noting subjects eligible for rescreening 
only in cases when TKR surgery is 
rescheduled outside of the 30-day window 
was removed.Text was deleted to allow 
subjects to be rescreened for 
reasons other than rescheduled 
surgery.
6.1. Study Drug Administered, Drug AdministrationLanguage added to specify that if a dose of 
JNJ-70033093 is missed, the capsule should be taken as soon as possible; 2 doses can also be taken together in the evening if the morning dose is missed.  No more than 
2 doses should be taken in 1 day.Instructions added to give 
direction for what to do for a missed dose of JNJ-70033093 study drug.
6.2. Preparation/Handling/ Storage/AccountabilityTemperature range for storage of study drug 
was removed and text was added noting the storage conditions would be specified in the 
product label.Text removed for consistency 
with the product label.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy Removed text specifying that “in those 
situations where the study drugs are administered preoperatively, intermittent 
pneumatic compression is still permitted until 
the time of the first postoperative dose of the study drug”.Text removed, given that the 
option for preoperative dosing was removed.
7.2. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the StudyThe last sentence in this section was revised to 
state that if a subject discontinues study drug 
and does not withdraw consent, then the 
subject should continue to have all remaining 
assessments completed.Language modified because 
continuation of remaining study 
procedures should not be 
applicable to subjects who 
withdraw consent.
8. Study Assessments Blood volume in the table for high-sensitive 
cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) sample is 4.0 
mL not 2.7 mL, and the total blood volume 
was changed from 155.7 to 134.9 mL. Total blood volume collected in the study noted in 
the table also was corrected (approximately 
135 mL, with 95 mL for PD/biomarkers).
Total blood volume for subjects randomized 
to enoxaparin was also added (115 mL) to the 
text because no PK samples are drawn.Corrected discrepancy in the 
volume of laboratory samples 
between volume of blood to be 
collected for each subject and the actual volumes of the collection 
tubes that are supplied by [CONTACT_19979].
8. Study Assessments; 8.2.4. Clinical Safety 
Laboratory AssessmentsThe timepoint for collection of the 
hematology and chemistry laboratory tests 
and urine sample for urinalysis at screening 
was removed.Text revised to align with the 
sequence of laboratory 
assessments specified by [CONTACT_19979]. In addition, 
timepoints of hematology and 
chemistry laboratory tests and urine sample were modified.
Screening laboratory testing was 
removed because preoperative 
dosing will not be implemented.
[IP_ADDRESS].  Liver Enzyme Elevations and Clinical Liver EventsModified language to clarify the criterion of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/oraspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3 times (x) 
upper limit of normal (ULN), confirmed by 
[CONTACT_712959].Expected reporting of liver 
enzyme elevations as adverse events of interest clarified.
Previous language was unclear, 
the liver enzyme elevations do 
not meet the criteria for

discontinued from further study intervention.Pregnancy is an exclusion 
criterion for the study, therefore 
study drug should be 
discontinued in the event of 
pregnancy.
8.4. Treatment of Overdose Text edited to specify the threshold for 
reporting an overdose applied to both JNJ-70033093 and enoxaparin and overdose that is considered excessive and medically 
important by [CONTACT_712960] a serious adverse event (medically important event).Corrected language to include 
enoxaparin because the protocol 
text defined the threshold for 
reporting an overdose of 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_970289] 
PK specimen type.
9.1. Sample Size 
Determination, Table 2Assumed total VTE rate for 25 mg once daily
was deleted and the assumed rate of 24% was 
added for [ADDRESS_970290] once daily dose being 
tested, would perform at a level 
equivalent to enoxaparin.
9.2. Populations for AnalysesWeek 6 visit was removed from the 
description of the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population.  The description for the mITT 
population revised because
subjects will have only 1 valid 
venography visit at Day 10-14.
9.3.1. Efficacy Analyses The study objective was modified to add text 
noting the importance of showing a 
statistically significant <30% event rate in 
total VTE in the combined dose group.
The text noting that data from preoperative 
dose regimens will not be used in the 
modified MCP-Mod analysis and separate analysis was deleted.The statistical rationale for the

1.1. Synopsis
A Randomized, Open-Label, Study Drug-Dose Blind, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of JNJ-70033093 (BMS-986177), an Oral Factor XIa Inhibitor, Versus Subcutaneous Enoxaparin 
in Subjects Undergoing Elective Total Knee Replacement Surgery
JNJ-70033093 (Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company [BMS]-9 [ZIP_CODE]) is a small-molecule therapeutic agent 
that binds and inhibits the activated form of human co agulation Factor XIa (FXIa) with high affinity and 
selectivity. It is being codeveloped under a collaboration agreement between BMS and its global affiliates and Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, LLC. JNJ-70033093 is being developed as an 
orally administered anticoagulant for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events (eg, venous 
thromboembolism [VTE]).

Hypothesis
The primary hypothesis is that JNJ-70033093 reduces the risk of total venous thromboembolism (VTE)
during the treatment period. This can be achieved by e ither a statistically significant dose-response trend 
or an event rate for the combined twice daily (BID ) doses of JNJ-70033093 that is statistically lower than 
30%. The event rate of 30% is a conservative estimate of the total VTE rate in subjects given placebo.
OVERALL DESIGN
This is an open-label, study drug-dose bli nd, active-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging study of 
JNJ-70033093 in subjects undergoing primary unilateral elective total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. 
The study uses the prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design. Men and 
women who are ∀50 years of age are eligible to participate if they are considered medically stable and 
appropriate for anticoagulant prophylaxis as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
The study will be conducted in 3 phases, which include s an up to 30-day screening phase before surgery, 
a 10- to 14-day postoperative dosing phase, and a 4-week #[ADDRESS_970292]’s own 
smartphone/tablet to confirm study drug administration (JNJ-70033093 capsules only) and to receive 
notifications as per protocol scheduled events (eg, next clinical site visit) as well as additional study information.
An Operations Committee (OC), Steering Committee, and independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) 
will be commissioned for this study. The OC will be unblinded, the Steering Committee will be blinded to 
the dose and frequency of JNJ-70033093, and the CEC will be blinded to both the study drug and the 
dose. The OC will be responsible for reviewing ongoing safety and efficacy data by [CONTACT_712968] 3 to 8 weeks on a periodic basis.
Unblinded periodic and interim analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_712969]. The firs t interim analysis will be triggered when approximately
300 subjects (approximately 50 subjects in each of the JNJ-70033093 BID treatment groups) have 
completed venography or have had a symptomatic VTE event. Both periodic and the interim analyses results will be used to guide the decision to drop a dose of JNJ-70033093 and/or readjust the 
randomization ratio. The number of subjects who were planned to be randomized into the dropped dosing

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019regimen can be allocated to one of the other dosi ng groups. The interim analysis will also serve as the 
formal venue to assess study status and possibly add once daily 50 or 200 mg dose of JNJ-70033093 
based on available efficacy and safety data. If pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis 
results are available at the time of the interim analysis, the results will be included in the review.
Additional interim analyses will be conducted, as needed, at the discretion of the OC.
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS
A target of 900 subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment in this study, with an option to increase 
the randomization target to approximately 1,200 subjects based on the possible addition of once daily
dose groups, and/or the evaluability rate. The number of subjects who were planned to be randomized into 
the dropped dosing regimen can be allocated to one of the other dosing groups.
STUDY DRUG GROUPS AND DURATION
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin
postoperatively following unilateral elective TKR surgery. Subjects will know the treatment to which they 
were assigned but subjects randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093 will remain blinded to the dose and 
frequency (ie, BID versus once daily). 
First dosing of both study drugs will occur while the subject is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], with administration 
beginning a minimum of [ADDRESS_970293] dose of eith er JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin is taken. Study visits 
should be conducted in the morning, when possible study drug dosing should not occur until after the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sample has been drawn. On the day of the Day 10-[ADDRESS_970294] randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093 will take 4 capsules a day, 2 capsules in the morning 
and 2 capsules in the evening at approximately the same time each day, as follows:
Group A: JNJ-70033093 25 mg BID (1 capsule JNJ-70033093 25 mg and 1 placebo capsule, BID)Group B: JNJ-70033093 50 mg BID (2 capsules JNJ-70033093 25 mg BID)
Group C: JNJ-70033093 100 mg BID (1 capsule JNJ-70033093 100 mg and 1 placebo capsule, BID)
Group D: JNJ-70033093 200 mg BID (2 capsules JNJ-70033093 100 mg BID)
Group E: JNJ-70033093 25 mg once daily (1 capsule JNJ-70033093 25 mg and 1 placebo capsule in the 
morning and 2 placebo capsules in the evening). Enrollment in this group discontinued per Amendment 1. Subjects randomized to this group prior to Amendment 1 will complete study procedures.
Group F: JNJ-70033093 200 mg once daily (2 capsules JNJ-70033093 100 mg in the morning and 
2 placebo capsules in the evening). Enrollment in Group F suspended per Amendment 1 and may become

17
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019optional depending on OC decision. Subjects rando mized to this group prior to Amendment 1 will 
complete study procedures.
Group G: JNJ-70033093 50 mg once daily (2 capsules JNJ-70033093 25 mg in the morning and 2 
placebo capsules in the evening) Enrollment in Group G will become optional per Amendment 1.
Subjects randomly assigned to JNJ-[ADDRESS_970295] dose of study drug on the evening of 
surgery should take the 2 capsules assigned to the Da y 1 morning dose (left side of blister card). On 
subsequent days the first dose should always be the left 2 capsules and the evening dose should be the 
2 capsules on the right.
Subjects randomly assigned to enoxaparin (Group I) will take a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 
enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, supplied as a prefilled syringe.
EFFICACY EVALUATIONS
Efficacy evaluations will include unilateral venography assessment of the operated leg and assessments of 
symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or death to assess the primary, 
secondary, and exploratory efficacy outcomes.
PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS
Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of JNJ-70033093 using a validated, 
specific, and sensitive (eg, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) method by [CONTACT_170166]. Pharmacoki netic samples will be collected from all subjects 
randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093. 
In addition, residual plasma PK samples may be stored for future analysis of the metabolite profile, if 
needed. 
Based on the individual plasma concentration-time data,  using the actual dose taken and the actual 
sampling times, PK parameters (eg, apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution) and exposure for exposure-response analysis of JNJ-70033093 and associated variables will be derived using population 
PK modeling. 
PHARMACODYNAMIC AND BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS
Venous blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation of aPTT, PT, Factor XI 
(FXI) clotting activity, anti-Factor Xa (anti-FXa) activity, thrombin generation assay (TGA), and biomarker evaluation (D-dimer, high-sensitive cardiac troponin T [hs-cTnT], and FXI antigen). Factor XI 
clotting activity will be assessed in subjects rando mly assigned to JNJ-[ADDRESS_970296] PD samples collected 
as soon as practically possible after the event occurs.
Blood samples will also be collected and a plasma sample archived for future exploratory PD research 
related to the safety and/or efficacy of JNJ-70033093. 
SAFETY EVALUATIONS
The safety and tolerability of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970297] (ie, bleeding events, liver enzyme elevations and clinical liver events, and wound or joint complications), clinical laboratory tests 
(ie, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), and physical examination. Safety evaluations may be 
performed at unscheduled timepoints, if deemed by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator or appropriate designee as necessary 
to ensure the safety of the subject. All suspected symptomatic efficacy events (VTE) will also be captured 
as adverse events of interest.

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019STATISTICAL METHODS
Assuming the evaluability rate (rate of subjects with a valid assessment of potential efficacy outcome and 
who take a least 1 dose of study drug) is 80%, if the true underlying total VTE event rates are as 
projected, the study is expected to have over 99% power to declare proof-of-efficacy at a 1-sided, 
5%∃-level. Proof-of-efficacy is defined as either a statistically significant dose-response trend or primary 
endpoint event rate for the combined BID JNJ-70033093 groups that is statistically lower than 30%. The exact power will vary because of the nature of the adaptive study design. 
Comparison with enoxaparin will be based on th e comparison between the highest dose of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970298] enoxaparin, at 1-sided, 5% ∃-level, is over 90%.
The study objectives include proof-of-efficacy and es timation of dose-response relationship in total VTE. 
The dose-response trend and estimation of the dose-response relationship will be addressed by a unified (modified) multiple comparison procedures and modeling (MCP-Mod) approach, utilizing collective data 
from postoperative regimens. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects who have signed an informed 
consent. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populati on will be a subset of the ITT population consisting 
of subjects with a valid assessment of potential efficacy outcome and who take at least [ADDRESS_970299] 
1 dose of the study drug. The analyses of bleeding adverse events will be based on the CEC-adjudicated 
events; all other nonefficacy or nonbleeding adverse even ts will be based on investigator-reported events 
in the safety population.
Estimation of the dose-response relationship in any bleeding will be addressed by a unified (modified) 
MCP-Mod approach as with efficacy. Any bleeding, major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and minimal bleeding will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_712970].
Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_154924].
Population PK analysis of plasma concentration-time data of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970300] deviation (SD),
coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and max imum will be calculated for all individual derived

summarize JNJ-70033093 plasma concentrations at each sampling time point. Exposure-response 
analyses will be conducted to explore the relati onship of the plasma concentration of JNJ -70033093 with 
efficacy and safety endpoints. 
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum will be provided for the 
percent change from baseline of the PD (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], prothrombin time[PT], FXI clotting activity, anti-FXa activity, thrombin generation assay [TGA]) and biomarker (D-dimer, 
hs-cTnT) parameters by [CONTACT_712971] e and regimen level. The parameters may be 
statistically analyzed using mixed models. FXI antigen levels will be summarized.
The relationship between observed plasma concentration of JNJ-70033093 and measured PD markers will 
be investigated graphically. If appropriate, PK/PD exposure and response relationships may be further analyzed quantitatively. 
The relationship between the plasma PK exposure of JNJ-70033093 derived from the population PK 
model will be correlated with the measured PD mar kers and safety/efficacy endpoints via graphical 
analysis.

Approved, Date: 10 September [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
JNJ-70033093 (Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company [BMS]-986177) is a small-molecule 
therapeutic agent that binds and inhibits the activated form of human coagulation Factor XIa
(FXIa) with high affinity and selectivity. It is being codeveloped under a collaboration agreement 
between BMS and its global affiliates and Janssen Pharmaceutical Research and Development, 
LLC. JNJ-70033093 is being developed as an orally administered anticoagulant for the
prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events (eg, venous thromboembolism [VTE]).
JNJ-70033093 is expected to provide noninferior or superior efficacy with reduced bleeding risk 
versus active comparators. Evidence to support this target profile includes the following:
!Congenital deficiency of Factor XI (FXI) appears to provide protection from both arterial 
and venous thrombotic events and is rarely associated with unprovoked major bleeding 
(ie, less bleeding than with other factor deficiencies like Factor X).18
!Knockout mice with essentially no FXI develop normally, are resistant to both venous and 
arterial thrombosis, and do not have any spontaneous bleeding.37
!A Phase 2 study in subjects undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) with preoperative 
dosing of a FXI antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that resulted in >80% reduction in FXI 
levels demonstrated superior efficacy compared with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (total VTE 4% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1, 12] vs 30.0% [95% CI: 20, 43], p<0.001) with numerically less major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events (3% [95% CI: <1, 9] vs 8% [95% CI: 3, 17], p=0.16).

2.1. Study Rationale
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970308], small-molecule inhibitor of human coagulation FXIa,
with an inhibition constant (K i) of 0.11 nM. JNJ-70033093 has >5,000-fold selectivity for FXIa 
over other blood coagulation proteases and structurally related enzymes involved in digestion, 
fibrinolysis, and inflammation, except chymotrypsin and plasma kallikrein where the K ivalues 
are 35 nM and 44 nM, respectively. Human deficiency of plasma prekallikrein is tolerated

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_970309] plasma coagulation assays, JNJ-70033093 produced 
concentration-dependent increases in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), but not 
prothrombin time (PT), indicating a selective effect on the intrinsic pathway. In the in-vitro 
thrombin generation assay (TGA) using human platelet-rich plasma, JNJ-70033093 (0.1 – 10 
μM) increased the lag time and time to peak, while reducing peak thrombin and endogenous 
thrombin potential. In the thromboelastography assay using human whole blood, JNJ-[ADDRESS_970310] on 
platelet aggregation induced by [CONTACT_712973], collagen, or arachidonic acid in human 
platelet-rich plasma in-vitro. Evaluations of the antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of 
intravenous (IV) JNJ-70033093 infusions were performed in anesthetized rabbits. JNJ-70033093 
caused dose-dependent inhibition of thrombosis formation in injured arteries. In this experiment, 
the JNJ-70033093 plasma concentrations required to reduce thrombus weight by 20% and 50% 
were 34.5 ng/mL (55 nM) and 235 ng/mL (375 nM), respectively. In the same model, 
JNJ-70033093 also restored blood flow to an artery partially occluded by a preexisting thrombus. 
In this experiment, the JNJ-70033093 plasma concentration required to reduce thrombus weight 
by 50% was 665 ng/mL (1,060 nM). JNJ-70033093 did not increase bleeding times in rabbits, 
even at doses that produced approximately 80% inhibition of thrombus formation. The 
combination of JNJ-70033093, at a dose that produces approximately 80% inhibition of 
thrombus formation, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], at a dose that increases bleeding time by [CONTACT_3450] 2-fold, 
did not lead to increased bleeding in rabbits over aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712935]. Additional rabbit 
cuticle bleeding-time studies were conducted with JNJ-70033093 in combination with 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_278663]. However, off-target effects due to thrombin inhibition (as observed by a 
1.8-fold increase in ex-vivo thrombin time coagulation assay) at these high drug exposures 
observed in rabbits confounded the interpretation of those studies.21
Safety Pharmacology
JNJ-70033093, at maximum-tested concentrations of 15.66 to 93.97 %g/mL (serum/protein free), 
did not exhibit substantial off-target activity against a panel of 42 targets that included G-protein 
coupled receptors, monoamine neurotransmitter transporters, ligand-gated and non-ligand-gated 
ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, or selected enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, monoamine 
oxidase, and phosphodiesterase). In in-vitro studies, JNJ-70033093 inhibited cardiac human 
ether-a-go-go gene/rapi[INVESTIGATOR_712936] (hERG/IKr) potassium 
channel currents, with a concentration at which 50% inhibition was observed (IC 50) of 4.2 %g/mL 
(6.7 %M; 33 times [x] and 14x the projected free/unbound maximum plasma concentration [C max]
in humans at 200 mg once daily and twice daily [BID], respectively). At 6.26 %g/mL (10 %M), 
JNJ-70033093 had minimal effects on cardiac sodium channel currents (22.9% to 25.3% 
inhibition at 1 and 4 Hz, respectively) and calcium channel currents (13.9% inhibition).21

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019In an exploratory study in anesthetized rabbits, JNJ-70033093 was associated with decreased 
blood pressure (up to -14.1% pretest) and increased heart rate (up to +20.9% pretest) at plasma 
concentrations ∀5.7 %g/mL, with prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia’s formula (by ~6.5 ms) also noted at 19.61 %g/mL (13x and 5.5x the projected C maxat 
200 mg once daily and BID, respectively. In a non-Good Laboratory Practice telemetry study in 
rats, there were minimal increases in blood pressure ( &5%) at C max∀5.0%g/mL and heart rate 
(&6%) at C maxof 16.14 %g/mL. These rabbit and rat findings were considered nonadverse due to 
their small magnitude. Importantly, in conscious monkeys, no JNJ-70033093-related 
hemodynamic or electrocardiogram changes were identified at any dose tested in 2 telemetry 
studies (C max&5.46%g/mL) or 3 repeat-dose toxicity studies after approximately 2 weeks 
(Cmax&21.2%g/mL, electrocardiogram not assessed), 6 weeks (C max&7.24 %g/mL), and 9 months 
(Cmax&6.56%g/mL) of dosing. The exposure at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in 
the 9-month monkey study was 4.3x and 1.8x the projected C maxin humans at 200 mg once daily
and BID, respectively. Taken together, the in-vitro and in vivo data indicate low potential of 
JNJ-70033093 for cardiovascular effects in humans.21
Toxicology
The nonclinical safety profile of JNJ-70033093 has been evaluated in a comprehensive battery of 
in-vitro studies and in vivo toxicity studies mainly in rats and monkeys. JNJ-70033093 has a 
high affinity for human FXIa (K i= 0.11 nM) and cynomolgus monkey FXIa (K i= 0.15 nM), but 
has a very weak affinity for rat FXIa (K i= 490 nM). As such, the rat was chosen for evaluation 
of potential off-target toxicity, and the monkey was chosen as a non-rodent species to assess both 
on-target as well as off-target toxicity. 
The scope of the toxicology evaluations, as summarized below, supports continued testing of 
JNJ-70033093 in humans. Unless otherwise specified, exposure multiples at NOAELs and 
pertinent findings in toxicology studies are expressed relative to the projected exposures at 
200 mg once daily (C maxof 1.512 %g/mL and area under the concentration versus time curve 
from [ADDRESS_970311] measurable concentration [AUC 0-24h] of 14.634 %g•h/mL) and 
200 mg BID (C maxof 3.579 %g/mL and AUC 0-24h of 60.514 %g•h/mL), the highest once daily and 
BID doses proposed for the Phase 2 study.
The protein binding for of JNJ-70033093 is comparable in rat, monkey, and human sera 
(97.1%, 89.1%, and 91.5%, respectively). As such, the exposure multiples have not been 
corrected for free fraction and are expressed as ratios of total exposure unless otherwise 
specified.
JNJ-70033093 was nongenotoxic in-vitro (Ames and cytogenetics assays, tested at maximum 
concentrations required by [CONTACT_25039] [ICH] guidelines) and in 
vivo (micronucleus assessment; conducted as part of a 6-week toxicity study) in rats at doses up 
to 200 mg/kg/day (AUC 0-24h of 319 %g·h/mL; 22x and 5.3x the projected exposure in humans at 
200 mg once daily and BID, respectively). Likewise, BMT 210370, an aniline metabolite of 
JNJ-70033093, was negative in the exploratory assays for mutagenicity and clastogenicity.21

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019In definitive embryo-fetal development studies,21JNJ-70033093 was neither embryo-fetal lethal 
or teratogenic. The exposures at the developmental NOAEL were 11x and 2.7x in rats 
(166%g·h/mL) and 4.7x and 1.1x in rabbits (68.4 %g·h/mL) relative to the projected human area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at 200 mg once daily and BID, respectively.
JNJ-70033093 was well tolerated by [CONTACT_712974] 2 and 6 weeks (10, 50, and 
200 mg/kg/day) and for 6 months (10, 30, and 50 mg/kg/day).21Relative to Day 1 values, 
AUC exposures to JNJ-70033093 were decreased following repeated dosing. This finding was 
rat specific, noted in both sexes (with greater eff ects in males), and most evident in the 6-month 
study (with Week-26 AUCs 0.3x in males and 0.5x to 0.6x in females, relative to Day-1 values). 
Other noteworthy findings in rats were limited to increased serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and/or glutamate dehydrogenase at ∀50 mg/kg/day in 
the subchronic studies and at ∀10 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study. These findings were 
considered nonadverse due to their minimal to mild magnitude, transient and/or non-progressive 
nature with continued dosing, lack of concurrent increases in serum bilirubin suggestive of 
altered liver function, full reversibility upon dosing cessation, and absence of microscopic 
evidence of liver injury. The NOAEL in the 6-m onth study was 50 mg/kg/day and the associated 
AUC values at Week 26 (26.1 %g•h/mL in males and 96.3 %g•h/mL in females) were &6.6x and 
&1.6x the projected exposures in humans at 200 mg once daily and BID, respectively.
JNJ-70033093 was clinically well tolerated by [CONTACT_712975] 2 weeks (10, 50, 
and 150 mg/kg/day), 6 weeks (5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day), and 9 months (10, 30, and 
50 mg/kg/day).21There was no substantial accumulation or loss of exposures after repeated 
dosing. Consistent with the intended pharmacology of JNJ-70033093, exposure-dependent 
prolongations of aPTT were noted at ∀10 mg/kg/day across all studies. At 50 mg/kg/day in the 
2-week and 9-month studies, there were also accompanying increases in PT in some monkeys. 
Overall, the increased aPTT and PT were considered nonadverse as they were not associated 
with clinical or microscopic signs of bleeding and were fully reversible after cessation of dosing. 
Additional JNJ-70033093-related changes in monkeys were limited to decreases in red blood cell 
parameters and serum albumin at ∀50 mg/kg/day in the 2-week study and were considered
adverse only in 1 female at 50 mg/kg/day with very high JNJ-70033093 exposure (AUC of 
540%g•h/mL). As such, the high dose in the subsequent 6-week and 9-month studies was capped 
at 50 mg/kg/day. Based on the absence of adverse findings at any dose tested, the high dose of 
50 mg/kg/day was considered the NOAEL for the 9-month study and the associated AUC 
(76.2 %g•h/mL at Week 39) was 5.2x and 1.3x the projected exposure in humans at 200 mg once 
daily and BID, respectively. 
Collectively, the results of nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile and support the use of JNJ-70033093 in humans at doses up to 200 mg BID.
Pharmacokinetic Profile
The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of JNJ-70033093 were evaluated in rats, rabbits, dogs, 
and monkeys after IV and oral dosing.21The absolute oral bioavailability of JNJ-70033093 was 
18% and 32% in rats and monkeys, respectively. JNJ-70033093 was a substrate of human efflux 
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
28
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-gp). After IV administration, the terminal elimination 
half-life was short (1.4, 2.5, 4.0, and 2.7 hours in rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys, respectively) 
and the total plasma clearance was low in all the species (9% to 23% of the reported liver blood 
flow). JNJ-70033093 distributed extravascularly in animals. Serum protein binding was 91.5% in 
human, and 89.1% to 97.1% in animals. Uptake studies with human hepatocytes suggested that 
active transport processes are at least partially involved in the hepatic uptake of JNJ-70033093. 
Further studies with rifamycin SV (an organic an ion-transporting polypeptide [OATP] inhibitor) 
suggested that OATPs are not involved in the hepatic uptake of JNJ-70033093 (confirmed in a 
clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study [CV010014]).21.
In-vitro, JNJ-70033093 was the predominant drug-related compound (repre senting 94% to 99% 
of total drug-related ultraviolet [UV] peak area) in incubations with liver microsomes or 
hepatocytes. No unique metabolite was observed in human hepatocyte or microsome incubates. 
In rats, intact monkeys, and monkeys from a cho lecystocentesis study, following a single oral 
dose of 200-, 150-, and 30-mg/kg, respectivel y, JNJ-70033093 was the predominant drug-related 
compound detected in plasma (approximately 99%, 87.2%, and 90.8% of total drug-related UV 
peak area at C max, respectively). In rats and monkeys, several metabolites were detected 
including an aniline containing metabolite, Met 17 (BMT 210370), which represented 6% to 
36% of the AUC of JNJ-70033093 in monkey, but was present at very low levels in rat plasma 
(metabolite was nongenotoxic as described later). In monkeys from the cholecystocentesis study, 
numerous metabolites were detected in bile including BMT 210370. No glutathione conjugate 
was detected in-vitro or in vivo. In bile duct-cannulated rats and monkeys, orally administered 
[14C] JNJ-70033093 was cleared primarily through biliary elimination.21In dogs and monkeys, 
following IV doses of 0.5 mg/kg, urinary excretion was found to be a minor route of elimination.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 was identified as the primary enzyme responsible for the 
oxidative metabolism of JNJ-70033093. The potential DDIs with CYP3A inhibitors were 
confirmed in a clinical DDI study. JNJ-70033093 exhibited little or no reversible and 
time-dependent inhibition of the CYPs. JNJ-70033093 did not inhibit uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzyme (IC 50∀20%M or 12.5 %g/mL). Relative to the 
Cmaxvalues of JNJ-70033093 in humans (6.09 %M or 3.8 %g/mL after 200-mg BID doses), 
JNJ-70033093 showed low potential to induce the CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 messenger 
ribonucleic acid levels in primary human hepatocytes (absence of CYP3A induction confirmed 
in a clinical DDI study).
JNJ-70033093 was a substrate of P-gp, but not of organic anion transporter (OATPs). 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_970312] cancer resistance protein (IC 50=19.6 %M or 12.3 %g/mL), 
OATP1B1 (IC 50=4.8 %M or 3.0 %g/mL), OATP1B3 (IC 50=9.7%M or 6.1 %g/mL), 
sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, IC 50=19.6 %M or 12.3 %g/mL), bile salt 
export pump (IC 50=7.1 %M or 4.4 %g/mL), multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) protein 1 
(IC 50=9.0%M or 5.6 %g/mL), and MATE2K (IC 50=28.7 %M or 18.0 %g/mL) transporters. No or 
low inhibition (IC 50>50%M or 31.3 %g/mL) of P-gp, multiple drug-resistance protein (MRP) 2, 
OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, and OCT2 was observed.

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019Overall, from a perpetrator standpoint and based on the IC 50values and observed C maxvalues of 
6.09 %M (3.8 %g/mL) in humans (at the highest BID dose of 200 mg proposed for Phase 2), 
JNJ-70033093 is not anticipated to cause clinically relevant DDIs with substrates of CYPs, 
UGT1A1, P-gp, NTCP, MRP2, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, or OCT2 (IC 50=19.6 %M to 
>50%M). However, there is a potential for DDIs with substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
MATE1, or bile salt export pump at anticipated clinical doses and associated concentrations. In addition, a low potential for gastrointestinal interaction exists with substrates of P-gp and breast 
cancer resistance protein. From a victim standpoint, there is a potential for DDIs with inhibitors 
of CYP3A4/5 and P-gp, but not with inhibitors of OATPs.

Human Pharmacokinetics
The first-in-human study with JNJ-70033093 inve stigated single oral doses between 4 and 
500 mg and multiple oral doses between 5 and 500 mg taken over a 14-day period. In the 
single-dose portion of the study, approximately dose proportional increases were observed 
between 20 and 200 mg once daily. Coadministration of a high-fat diet resulted in an 
approximately 1.4-fold increase in exposure at doses of 200 mg while 500 mg of JNJ-70033093
was associated with approximately 2-fold increases in exposure (AUC). Table 1 summarizes the 
clinical pharmacology of JNJ-70033093.

Efficacy/Safety Studies
A recently completed multicenter, crossover, randomized, Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study in 
subjects undergoing hemodialysis for ESRD demonstrated that single doses of JNJ-70033093 up 
to 300 mg were safe and well tolerated and there were no reports of serious bleeding or other 
serious adverse events. An exploratory assessment of efficacy showed that the extent of clot

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019formation in the hemodialysis circuit for JNJ-70033093 was similar to the active comparators 
(unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin), suggesting that JNJ-70033093 has clinically 
meaningful antithrombotic activity at the doses tested (See IB, Edition 5).21
A recently completed DDI study showed that JNJ-70033093 200 mg BID, taken by [CONTACT_712976] a 7-day period with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], was safe and well tolerated, and the bleeding time did 
not increase significantly. Subjects enrolled into this study were allowed to take, if clinically 
indicated, low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (<100 mg once daily).
[ADDRESS_970314] Characteristics
(SmPC), is intended to provide a brief, representative overview of enoxaparin.
Enoxaparin sodium is a low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), with a mean molecular-weight 
of approximately 4,500 daltons. In the in-vitro purified system, enoxaparin has a high anti-Factor 
Xa (anti-FXa) activity (approximately 100 IU/mg) and low anti-Factor IIa or antithrombin 
activity (approximately 28 IU/mg). These anticoagulant activities are mediated through 
antithrombin III, resulting in antithrombotic activities in humans. At the recommended doses, 
enoxaparin sodium does not influence bleeding time and global blood coagulation tests 
significantly, nor does it affect platelet aggregation or binding of fibrinogen to platelets.
Enoxaparin sodium is indicated in the European Union for the:
!Prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders of venous origin, in particular those which may be 
associated with orthopedic or general surgery
!Prophylaxis of VTE in medical patients bedridden due to acute illnesses, including cardiac 
insufficiency, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or severe infections
!Treatment of venous thromboembolic disease presenting with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
pulmonary embolism (PE), or both
!Treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), administered 
concurrently with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]
!Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation MI, including patients to be managed medically or 
with SC coronary intervention
!Prevention of thrombus formation in the extracorporeal circulation during hemodialysis
In patients with a higher risk of thromboembolism, such as orthopedic surgery, the recommended 
dosage of enoxaparin sodium given by [CONTACT_712977] 40 mg (4,000 IU) once daily, with the 
initial dose administered preferably at least [ADDRESS_970315]-of-care for an average period of 10 to 14 days or 
until the risk of thromboembolism has diminished. A longer treatment duration may be 
appropriate in some patients following hip replacement, and enoxaparin sodium may be

2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
An estimated 920,000 patients in Japan and Europe experience VTE annually, which includes 
DVT and PE6,22and in the [LOCATION_002] it is estimated that 900,000 patients experience a VTE 
annually, with 60,000 being fatal5. Joint replacement surgery of the lower extremities carries a 
high risk of VTE due to prothrombotic processes such as soft tissue and bone injury during 
surgery, which causes coagulation activation from thromboplastin release, venous stasis from 
peri- and postoperative immobilization, and inflammation from the healing process.42This has 
led to recommendations in the guidelines that all patients undergoing TKR surgery should 
receive pharmacologic and/or mechanical VTE prophylaxis.12,22Low molecular-weight heparin
and several DOACs, including api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban have been used 
in the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing TKR surgery. However, limitations of these 
drugs include the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding at their recommended dosages. The 
concern of orthopedic surgeons about bleeding is a major obstacle to the use of anticoagulation 
in the perioperative period, even when clinical study data show that the absolute risk of bleeding 
is lower than the risk of VTE.[ADDRESS_970317] equal or greater efficacy with a reduced risk of bleeding.
Given that TKR surgery carries a high risk of VTE combined with the hemostatic challenges of 
surgery, it provides a good setting to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety (bleeding) 
characteristics of novel anticoagulants.
7Patients who undergo elective total knee arthroplasty are 
at a high risk for the development of VTE with a 40% to 60% chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_712939]. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of distal 
DVT will extend into the proximal veins that carries with it a high risk of embolization and PE. 
In this setting, upwards of one-third of PEs will be fatal.19Therefore, TKR is an appropriate 
setting for testing new and potentially safer means of anticoagulation.
The available preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that direct inhibition of FXIa by 
[CONTACT_206178]-70033093 has the potential to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events with a lower risk of

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
This is an open-label, study drug-dose b lind, active-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging study
of JNJ-70033093 in subjects undergoing primary unilateral elective TKR surgery. The study uses 
the prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) design. Men and women 
who are ∀50 years of age are eligible to participate if they are considered medically stable and 
appropriate for anticoagulant prophylaxis as determined by [CONTACT_712983]. A target of 
900 subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment in this study, with an option to increase the 
randomization target to approximately 1,200 subjects based on the possible addition of once 
daily dose groups, and/or evaluability rate.
Subjects meeting all of the enrollment criteria will be eligible to enter the study. The study will 
be conducted in 3 phases, which includes an up to 30-day screening phase before surgery, a 
10- to 14-day postoperative dosing phase, and a 4-week #[ADDRESS_970319] dose of postoperative study drug. Eligible subjects will be randomly 
assigned to treatment with either JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin postoperatively following 
unilateral elective TKR surgery. Subjects will know the treatment to which they were assigned 
but subjects randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093 will remain blinded to the dose and frequency 
(ie, BID versus once daily).
First dosing of both study drugs will occ ur while the subject is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], with 
administration beginning a minimum of [ADDRESS_970320] dose of either JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin is taken.

Selected sites may also use scanning technology to manage clinical study supplies and drug 
compliance activities. Subject’s enrolled at selected sites may use an application on the subject’s 
own smartphone/tablet to confirm study drug administration (JNJ-70033093 capsules only) and 
receive notifications as per protocol scheduled events (eg, next clinical site visit) as well as 
additional study information.
An OC, Steering Committee, and independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be 
commissioned for this study. The OC will be unblinded and the Steering Committee will be 
blinded to the dose and frequency of JNJ-70033093, unless the OC finds it necessary to consult 
with and unblind select members of the Steering Committee. If any members of the Steering 
Committee are unblinded, they will no longer be involved in the operational conduct of the 
study. The CEC will be blinded to both the study drug and the dose. The OC will be responsible 
for reviewing ongoing safety and efficacy data by [CONTACT_712984] [ADDRESS_970322] interim analysis will be triggered when 
approximately 300 subjects (approximately 50 subjects in each of the JNJ-70033093 BID 
treatment groups) have completed venography or have had a symptomatic VTE event. Both 
periodic and the interim analyses results will be used to guide the decision to drop a dose of 
JNJ-70033093 and/or readjust the randomization ratio.  The number of subjects who were 
planned to be randomized into the dropped dosing regimen can be allocated to one of the other 
dosing groups. The interim analysis will also serve as the formal venue to assess study status and 
possibly add once daily dosing of JNJ-70033093 based on available efficacy and safety data. If 
PK/PD analysis results are available at the time of the interim analysis, the results will be 
included in the review.
Additional interim analyses will be conducted, as needed, at the discretion of the OC.

4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Intervention Groups
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to study drug and 
dose groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes 
(eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across study drug groups, and

unblinded as to the study drug assignment (JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin); however, they will 
remain blinded to the dose and frequency and the adjudication of clinical endpoint events will be 
conducted in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_712985].
Study Population
Total knee replacement is most commonly performed in older men and women to correct 
arthritic disease of the joint. Given that the risks of VTE and bleeding increase with age, the 
study has been appropriately designed to include both men and women who are at least [ADDRESS_970323] 20 years, Phase 2 studies of 
injectable anticoagulants (LMWH, fondaparinux) and newer oral anticoagulants (api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], 
rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban) were conducted in this population using venography to 
detect asymptomatic DVT.11,17,20,27,28,[ADDRESS_970324] widely used anticoagulants in joint arthroplasty, enoxaparin has been used as 
a comparator for the currently approved DOACs.41Consistent with this approach, enoxaparin 
was chosen as the comparator in this study. Enoxaparin is approved worldwide for this indication
and has demonstrated favorable efficacy and saf ety (ie, bleeding) results. Refer to Section 2.2.[ADDRESS_970325] approach for the Phase 2 
orthopedic surgery setting.7The assessment time between Days 10-14 is appropriate given that it 
is a usual period of anticoagulation following TKR surgery as well as other forms of 
anticoagulation (eg, DOACs).

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019Ultrasound is a noninvasive, widely available technique, with a high sensitivity and specificity 
for symptomatic DVT that has replaced venography in clinical practice for the diagnosis of 
DVT events (all DVT sensitivity 88%, specificity 96%).23However, ultrasound has repeatedly 
been shown to have very low sensitivity compared with venography for detecting asymptomatic 
DVT in the postoperative setting.23,34In a meta-analysis of 15 studies, the sensitivity of 
ultrasound compared with venography f or detecting asymptomatic DVT was 47%.23More recent 
data are from the Phase 2 studies of rivaroxaban in DVT prophylaxis following hip and knee 
replacement surgeries, where a substudy (VENUS study) was conducted comparing venography 
to ultrasound. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_504329], including separate adjudication sites for each 
technique and a large number of matching pairs of evaluable venography assessments and 
ultrasounds, the authors concluded that ultrasound cannot replace venography for DVT diagnosis 
in this setting. The observed frequency of any DVT was 18.9% with venography and 11.5% with 
ultrasound. The sensitivity of ultrasound compared with venography was 31.1% (95% CI: 23.4, 
38.9) for any DVT, 21.0% (95% CI: 2.7, 39.4) for proximal DVT, and 30.8% (95% CI: 23.1, 
38.6) for distal DVT. The results for specificity were 93.0% (95% CI: 91.0, 95.1), 
98.7% (95% CI: 98.0, 99.5), and 93.3% (95% CI: 91.5, 95.3), respectively.[ADDRESS_970326] likely explanations for the poor 
performance of ultrasound compared with venography in this setting are the nature of the clots 
that form early after surgery (small and compressible) compared with symptomatic clots 
(larger and noncompressible) and the distortion of the veins produced by [CONTACT_712986].
Although research into new anticoagulants has slowed in recent years, all proof-of-concept 
studies using the postoperative orthopedic model ha ve continued to use venography to assess the 
primary endpoint.
4,14,26,40Venography produces plausible and reliable results in clinical 
studies7,19,36and no anticoagulant has been approved by a health-authority for postoperative 
orthopedic DVT prophylaxis without venography data. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_712940], it remains the standard for detecting DVT after TKR surgery and is the most 
appropriate method for use in this study.
Bilateral venography has been used in most but not all previous Phase 3 studies.15,17Venography 
of the operated leg will be performed in this study. Unilateral venography of the operated leg 
detects over 90% of DVTs after TKR surgery16and exposes subjects to less risk (radiation, 
contrast dye, venipuncture) and less discomfort.
Choice of Safety Measures/Assessments
Bleeding events are the standard primary safety endpoint in studies of anticoagulant 
VTE prophylaxis after TKR surgery. Because the occurrence of major bleeding events is 
infrequent and previous dose-ranging studies have demonstrated that all categories of bleeding 
events increase with dose in a similar manner, the any bleeding event composite will be the 
primary safety endpoint in this study.25Published guidelines that describe how to define major 
bleeding events after major orthopedic surgery will be followed.35For nonmajor bleeding events, 
standardized definitions, as utilized in the Phase 3 TKR studies of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], will be

perioperatively with an estimated frequency of approximately 8%. Affecting about 8 million 
adults worldwide, patients experiencing myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery (MINS) are at 
increased risk of death or cardiovascular complication. It is estimated that 85% of MINS occurs 
within 48 hours of surgery.8Unlike the traditional definition of MI, MINS does not require 
symptoms or evidence of ischemia (eg, ST changes). In the VISIONS study, only 16% of 
subjects experiencing MINS had symptoms of an ischemic feature.2In an observational study 
involving a tertiary care center, Rubin and colleagues estimated that the incidence of MINS in 
orthopedic procedures is approximately 19%.[ADDRESS_970328] cardiac troponins drawn postoperatively on Day 1 (0 hour) prior to study drug administration and Day 10-14; data derived from these analyses will be used to 
estimate the presence of MINS.
Factor XI antigen will also be used as a biomarker for potential bleeding and as an efficacy 
signal. Recent studies suggest that high levels of FXI are associated with increased risk for 
venous thrombosis and stroke, whereas reduced FXI levels are associated with protection from 
VTE. In addition to activation by [CONTACT_712987], FXI can also be activated by [CONTACT_712988] a 
positive feedback reaction, further propagating thrombus growth. Measurement of FXI antigen in 
plasma at baseline, using a validated immunoassay, may help to improve understanding of 
thrombotic conditions and help identify subjects susceptible to cardiovascular events.

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019JNJ-70033093 is an investigational drug that is being developed for multiple thrombosis-mediated 
conditions. The nonclinical and clinical data obtained to date with JNJ-70033093 support 
administration of multiple doses in a well-controlled clinical research study. The present study is 
needed to support further clinical development of JNJ-70033093, and the study design is based on 
sound scientific rationale, as described in this protocol. Thorough scientific evaluation of any 
promising treatment before marketing authorization is an ethical requirement. In the continuing
search for medications with improved efficacy and safety profiles, it is necessary to fully 
investigate and understand new products.
The primary ethical concern is that the safety and efficacy profile of JNJ-70033093 has not been 
fully established as it has only been studied in a limited number of subjects. Subjects in this study 
who are at risk for VTE following TKR surgery are being asked to take a new treatment for the 
prevention of VTE. Based on the nonclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies, a range of doses of 
JNJ-70033093 has been selected for further evaluation in this study. Preclinical studies looking at 
clot formation demonstrated that doses equivalent to 25 mg BID reduced clot formation by 50%.
The primary risk with any anticoagulant drug is the potential for bleeding events. Based on the 
nonclinical evaluations of JNJ-70033093, the risk for these events is anticipated to be low (ie, all 
planned doses are below those shown to have a statistically significant increase in bleeding risk). 
No bleeding signal was detected at the 200-mg BID dose in healthy male subjects. Subjects in this 
study will be carefully observed for bleeding events throughout the duration of the study and 
management strategies for each type of event are outlined in the protocol (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ,
Approach to Subjects With a Bleeding Event).
Venography assessments will be used to evaluate for the presence of DVT. The x-ray used in the 
imaging exposes the body to a small dose of ionizing radiation. The risks of radiation exposure 
may be tied to the number of x-rays and x-ray treatments a person has had over their lifetime. 
Given that all subjects in this study will be ∀[ADDRESS_970330] frequently used form of medical 
imaging. Other risks associated with venography assessments include pain, infection, and/or bleeding at the site of venous access and the risks from contrast medium administration (ie, allergy, 
nephrotoxicity, and/or possible irritation of the venous system leading to the development of 
DVT). In previous studies, venography assessments have been well tolerated and do provide 
clinically useful information about the presence or absence of DVT following surgery.

Approved, Date: 10 September [ZIP_CODE].3. Justification for Dose
Identification of effective doses of JNJ-70033093 was based on inhibition of thrombus formation 
in a rabbit model of electrically induced carotid artery thrombus (ECAT) in rabbits. The rabbit 
ECAT model has been calibrated against clinical results in VTE prevention based on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. 
In this model, targeting the concentration that led to 50% reduction in thrombus weight was 
correlated with the steady-state trough concentration of the clinical dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. In the 
rabbit ECAT model, JNJ-70033093 caused a dose-dependent decrease in both clot weight 
(Figure 2 ) and preservation of blood flow without a significant increase in bleeding time. The 
equivalent to half the maximal effective concentration (EC 50) plasma concentrations in the rabbit 
ECAT model was 235 ng/mL (375 nM). Making corrections for the difference in potency in 
human versus rabbit FXIa (where JNJ-70033093 is more potent than rabbit FXIa) and the 
differences in plasma protein binding between human versus rabbit (where protein binding is 
lower in human versus rabbit plasma) yields a human target of 34.5 ng/mL (55 nM) as the trough 
target concentration.21

safety and efficacy of reducing FXI activity. Subjects were treated for 36 days prior to surgery 
with an ASO to reduce the level of FXI. The study showed a dose-dependent reduction in the 
risk of VTE events compared with enoxaparin. Doses that did not reduce FXI levels to 20% or 
less of normal did not reduce the risk of VTE events compared with enoxaparin.4About a 
1.5-fold prolongation in aPTT was observed at the dose that reduced FXI levels to 20% or less of 
normal. Figure 3 shows the dose-dependent decrease in FXI levels and clot weight observed in

reduction of FXI concentrations observed in the ASO VTE prevention study (ISIS 416158), a 
trough concentration of approximately 150 ng/mL of JNJ -[ADDRESS_970333] equal to the 80% reduction in FXI level in the rabbit ECAT model.

ASO=antisense oligonucleotide; C=concentration; FXI=Factor XI; FXI ASO=Factor XI antisense 
oligonucleotide; VTE=venous thromboembolism
Based on data obtained from healthy subjects, population PK modeling indicates that doses 
likely to achieve the trough concentration targets based on api[INVESTIGATOR_712941] a 
VTE prevention study are between 100 to 200 mg once daily and 25 to 50 mg BID. A 50-mg 
once daily dose prolongs the aPTT 1.5-fold for about 24 hours in healthy volunteers and the 
plasma concentrations achieved are above those required for antithrombotic efficacy (EC50) in 
the rabbit ECAT model of thrombosis for a sustained period time. The data indicating coverage 
of the target concentrations in the rabbit ECAT model for both api[INVESTIGATOR_712942], supports the potential for JNJ-70033093 to provide  similar or greater efficacy in patients. 
Finally, a lower risk of bleeding is anticipated with inhibition of FXIa than with inhibition of 
Factor Xa (FXa), based on the mechanistic rati onale for targeting the intrinsic pathway via 
inhibition of FXIa.

as possible; 2 doses can also be taken together in the evening if the morning dose is missed. If 
an evening dose is missed it should not be taken with the next morning dose; no more than 2 
doses (4 capsules) should be taken in 1 day.
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either JNJ-70033093 or enoxaparin 
postoperatively following unilateral elective TKR surgery. Subjects will know the treatment to 
which they were assigned but subjects randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093 will remain blinded 
to the dose and frequency (ie, BID versus once daily).
First dosing of both study drugs will occ ur while the subject is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], with 
administration beginning a minimum of [ADDRESS_970346] 1 hour after the dose is taken.
At the time of the interim analysis, the OC may implement a once daily dosing regimen(s) of 50 
and/or [ADDRESS_970347] is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712946] a minimum of 12 hours and a

PK samples should be drawn before administering the next scheduled dose of study drug. If 
using the +6-hour window to allow the 12-hour sample to be drawn the following morning, the 
evening dose of study drug on Day [ADDRESS_970349] be captured in the source documents and the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Study-site personnel will instruct subjects on how to store study drugs for 
at-home use as indicated for this protocol.
Dosing
This study has an adaptive design, with the intent to optimize data collection for the 
dose-response evaluation using multiple comparison procedures and modeling (MCP-Mod).
Initially, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_970350] randomly assigned to JNJ-70033093 will take 4 capsules a day, 2 capsules in the 
morning and 2 capsules in the evening at approximately the same time each day, as follows:

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_970351] dose of study drug on the 
evening of surgery should take the 2 capsules assigned to the Day 1 morning dose (left side of 
blister card). On subsequent days, the first dose should always be the left [ADDRESS_970352] of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
Enoxaparin
Subjects randomly assigned to enoxaparin (Group I) will receive a SC dose of enoxaparin 40 mg 
once daily, supplied as a prefilled syringe.
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
All oral study drug must be stored at controlled temperatures ranging as specified on the product 
label. Enoxaparin will be stored in accordance with the approved product labeling which is also 
specified on the product label.
Refer to the pharmacy manual/study-site investigational product and procedures manual for 
additional guidance on study intervention preparation, handling, and storage.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study drug received at the site is inventoried 
and accounted for throughout the study. The dispensing of study drug to the subject, and the 
return of study drug from the subject (if applicable), must be documented on the drug 
accountability form. Subjects must be instructed to return all original containers, whether empty 
or containing study drug. All study drug will be stored and disposed of according to the sponsor's 
instructions. Study-site personnel must not combine contents of the study drug containers.
Selected sites may use scanning technology to manage clinical study supplies (JNJ-70033093 
and enoxaparin) and drug compliance activities (JNJ-70033093 only).
Study drug must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label, and 
must be stored at the study-site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate 
environmental conditions. Unused study drug, and study drug returned by [CONTACT_423], must be 
available for verification by [CONTACT_456]'s study-site monitor during on-site monitoring visits.
The return to the sponsor of unused study drug, or used returned study drug for destruction, will 
be documented on the drug return form. When the study-site is an authorized destruction unit and 
study drug supplies are destroyed on-site, this must also be documented on the drug return form.
Potentially hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes and vials containing 
hazardous liquids, should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner in a disposal container. 
The disposal container will be retained for verification purposes.
Study drug should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or an appropriate 
delegate and qualified member of the study-site personnel, or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. 
Study drug will be supplied only to subjects partic ipating in the study. Returned study drug must

Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_970353] brings his or her study drug 
to the study-site for pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], this is not considered a return of supplies. Study drug may not be 
relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_23837]. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the 
study drug from, nor store it at, any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Intervention AllocationProcedures for Randomization and Stratification
Dynamic central randomization will be implemented in conducting this study. Initially, subjects
will be assigned to 1 of 5 study drug groups based on an algorithm implemented in the 
interactive web response system (IWRS) before the study. Following the interim analysis, the 
IWRS will be updated for randomization accordingly. Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_712989]. Based on the algorithm, the IWRS will assign a unique study 
drug code, which will dictate the study drug assignment and matching study drug kit for the 
subject.
Blinding
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained 
within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the dosing blind 
for an individual subject.
Subjects will be unblinded as to their treatment assignment but those subjects randomly assigned 
to JNJ-70033093 will be blinded to the dose and regimen (ie, BID versus once daily). Under 
normal circumstances, the JNJ-[ADDRESS_970354] completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be 
broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_184903]. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency determine the 
dose of the treatment by [CONTACT_23793]. While the responsibility to break the blind in 
emergency situations resides solely with the inves tigator, it is recommended that the investigator 
contact [CONTACT_97499], before breaking 
the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_97500] [ADDRESS_970355]’s source documents in a 
secure manner.
Subjects randomized to JNJ-[ADDRESS_970356] whenever possible, even in a special situation where the 
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
52
Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_970357] had their 
treatment dose assignment unblinded should continue to return for scheduled evaluations.
In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed and the 
clinical database is closed. However, if the randomization codes and, if required, the translation 
of randomization codes into treatment and control groups will be disclosed to those authorized
individuals of the OC for the periodic data review s and interim analyses, it will only be for those 
subjects included in the analysis. Refer to Section 10.3, Appendix 3: Regulatory, Ethical, and 
Study Oversight Considerations for additional details.
Data that may potentially unblind the JNJ-70033093 dose assignment (ie, study drug plasma
concentrations, PD and biomarker laboratory data) will be handled with special care to ensure 
that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can 
include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by 
[CONTACT_431], the clinical team, or others, as appropriate until the time of database lock and 
unblinding. 
To maintain the blind of the study, the investigator should not measure PD markers (eg, aPTT) 
locally unless considered necessary for subject clinical care. If performed locally, the results of 
these laboratory assessments should not be us ed to determine clinical care. In addition, the 
investigator will not receive the results of the PD parameters from the central specialty 
laboratory during the conduct of the study.
6.4. Study Drug Compliance
Drug supplies will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The IWRS will track 
the study drug dispensed. In addition, the sites will enter the study drug returned by [CONTACT_712990].
Subjects randomly assigned to JNJ-[ADDRESS_970358]’s own smartphone/tablet 
to confirm study drug administration (JNJ-70033093 capsules only).
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
Only selected therapi[INVESTIGATOR_712947] (eg, tranexamic acid, antiplatelet 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs [NSAIDs]) administered up to [ADDRESS_970359] dose of study drug to the final 
visit.

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019All pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prescription or over-the-counter medications, including products to 
manage bleeding, vaccines, vitamins, and herbal supplements) concomitant with and different 
from the study drug must be recorded in the eCRF. All concomitant non-pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_712948], foot-pump devices, continuous passive 
motion devices, compression stockings, electrical stimulation, and acupuncture must also be 
recorded in the eCRF. Recorded information will include a description of the type of therapy, 
duration of use, dosing regimen, route of administration, and indication. Modification of an 
effective preexisting therapy should not be made for the explicit purpose of entering a subject 
into the study.
Study drug must be the first anticoagulant administered after surgery. The following 
medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_712949]:
!Additional anticoagulant(s) (eg, vitamin K antagonists, Factor IIa or FXa inhibitors). The 
study drug will be discontinued in subjects who develop any condition that requires long-term anticoagulation (eg, DVT, atrial fibrillation)
!Antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, platelet adenosine diphosphate P2Y12 receptor antagonist 
[clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticagrelor, prasugrel]), except for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] &100 mg/day
!Strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors or strong C YP3A4/P-gp inducers in the 7 days before 
randomization or concomitant use with the study drug (concomitant use with study drug 
applies only to subjects taking JNJ-70033093)
!Intermittent pneumatic compression after the first postoperative dose of study drug 
(all mechanical VTE prevention methods such as foot pumps, graduated compression stockings, and continuous passive motion devices are permitted)
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, if possible, during the study because 
their use can increase the risk of bleeding and may interfere with collagen formation. If NSAID use is necessary, it is recommended that the minimum dose is used for the shortest possible 
duration. If the investigator deems anticoagulation to be indicated after the last dose of study 
drug, anticoagulation therapy may begin after the venography per standard-of-care.
6.6. Dose Modification
The assigned dose of JNJ-70033093, matching placebo, and enoxaparin will not be modified
during the course of the study. Subjects will receive the full dose of study drug on Day 1 and will 
remain on their assigned dosages throughout the treatment phase (ie, until Day 10-14 or early 
discontinuation of the study drug).
6.7. Study Drug After the End of the Study
Subjects will be instructed that study drug will not be made available to them after they have 
completed/discontinued study drug and that they should return to their primary physician to 
determine standard-of-care.

DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
It is imperative for the integrity of the study and results to have complete data. If a subject
withdraws from the study before the end of the follow-up phase and is unwilling or unable to 
return for follow-up visits in person or have follow-up contacts, the study-site should collect as 
much follow-up visit information as possible, including contact[CONTACT_504410]’s 
representative or health care professional by [CONTACT_41492]. If applicable, vital status may 
be obtained by [CONTACT_52536]’s medical or public records unless this contact [CONTACT_712991].
Study drug assigned to a subject that discontinues the study drug or withdraws may not be 
assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced.
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug
A subject’s study drug must be discontinued if:
!The investigator believes that for safety reasons or tolerability reasons (eg, adverse event) it 
is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue the study drug
!Bleeding into a critical site (eg, intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, 
intra-articular in a nonoperative joint, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, 
retroperitoneal)
!Drug-induced liver injury meeting the criteria for discontinuation (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Liver 
Enzyme Elevations and Clinical Liver Events)
!Development of any condition that requires open-label treatment with an anticoagulant or 
other prohibited medication
!The subject requests to discontinue the study drug permanently
!The subject becomes pregnant during the study 
!At the (exceptional) request of the sponsor
If a subject discontinues study drug for any reason before the end of the postoperative dosing 
phase, the assessments should be continued as scheduled.
7.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation
The study drug may be interrupted if a subject develops bleeding or elevated liver enzymes as 
described in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , Approach to Subjects With a Bleeding Event and [IP_ADDRESS] , Liver
Enzyme Elevations and Clinical Liver Events, respectively.
7.2. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will not be automatically withdrawn from the study if he or she has to discontinue 
study drug before the end of the study drug regimen. 
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
55
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019!Lost to follow-up
!Withdrawal of consent
Withdrawal of consent should be a very unusual occurrence in a clinical study. Subjects
who elect to stop the study drug are not automatically considered to have withdrawn consent. The investigator should make every effort to maintain a good relationship with subjects to avoid this occurrence. Withdrawal of consent will be recorded in the eCRF for this study after a discussion between the investigator and the appropriate sponsor representative has taken place.
At the time of signing the ICF, a subject will agree to be contact[CONTACT_55883]-up 
information should he or she decided to withdraw from the study. If a subject withdraws from 
the study before the end of the follow-up phase and is unwilling or unable to return for follow-up 
visits in person or have follow-up contacts, th e study-site should collect as much follow-up visit 
information as possible, including contact[CONTACT_712992]’s representative or health 
care professional by [CONTACT_712993], as agreed to by [CONTACT_504454]. For subjects who withdraw consent from study participation, the reasons for the 
withdrawal of consent should be documented in the source documents and entered in the eCRF. 
If applicable, vital status may be obtained by [CONTACT_52536]’s medical or public records 
unless this contact [CONTACT_504438].
For subjects who withdraw consent and are not agreeable to any follow-up contact, it is 
recommended that the subject withdraw consent in writing, and the subject will be asked to 
supplement the withdrawal of consent with a signed written statement documenting refusal from 
all subsequent contact. If the subject refuses or is physically unavailable, the study-site should 
document and sign the reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing and 
maintain it with the subject’s source records. If the subject chooses to withdraw from the study 
completely and does not allow further contact [CONTACT_109309], then the investigator or 
designee will consult sources available in the public domain to check the health status of the 
subject as permitted by [CONTACT_1769].
When a subject withdraws consent before completing the study, it is not required for he/she to 
give a reason. If the reason for withdrawal is known, it should be documented in the eCRF and in 
the source document. Study drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to 
another subject. Additional subjects will not be entered. If a subject discontinues study drug and
does not withdraw consent from the study before the end, Day 10-14 assessments should be 
obtained, including the venography of the operated leg (unless a PE or symptomatic proximal 
DVT has been diagnosed), and the remaining visits through the Week [ADDRESS_970361] may withdraw consent for use of samples for future research (refer to Long-Term 
Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research in Section 10.3, Appendix 3, Regulatory, 
JNJ-70033093

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations). In su ch a case, samples will be destroyed after 
they are no longer needed for the clinical study. Details of the sample retention for research are 
presented in the main ICF.
7.3. Lost to Follow-Up
If a subject is lost to follow-up, every reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel 
to contact [CONTACT_712994]/withdrawal, 
including the possible use of locator agencies to determine vital status, as local laws and 
regulations permit. The measures taken to follow-up must be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. A subject will be considered lost to follow-up only after all means of subsequent 
contact [CONTACT_45538]. Refer to Section 7.2, Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the 
Study.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
The Schedule of Activities summarizes the frequency and timing of efficacy, PK, PD, 
biomarkers, and safety measurements applicable to this study.
If multiple assessments are scheduled for the same timepoint, it is recommended that procedures 
be performed in the sequence specified in the central laboratory manual. Blood collections for 
PK, PD, and biomarker assessments should be kept as close to the specified time as possible. 
Other measurements may be done earlier than specified timepoints, if needed. Actual dates and 
times of assessments will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF.
The total blood volume collected in the study by [CONTACT_712995]: for the 
JNJ-70033093 group - approximately 135 mL (20 mL for safety, 20 mL for PK, and 95 mL for 
PD/biomarkers) and for the enoxaparin group – approximately 115 mL (20 mL for safety, and up 
to 95 mL for PD/biomarkers).
Additional blood samples may be collected, if n ecessary, for additional safety, PK, PD, or 
biomarker assessments based on emerging data, but the maximum amount of blood drawn from 
each subject in this study will not exceed 200 mL without prior Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) and health-authority approvals. Repeat or 
unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples
and do not require prior IEC/IRB and health-authority approvals.

Note: An indwelling IV cannula may be used for blood sample collection.
Sample Collection and Handling
The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the eCRF and/or laboratory 
requisition form. It is important to record the exact date and time for PK sample collection even 
if the time deviates from the scheduled time of collection. If blood samples are collected via an 
indwelling cannula, an appropriate amount (eg, 1 mL) of serosanguineous fluid slightly greater 
than the dead space volume of the lock will be removed from the cannula and discarded before 
each blood sample is taken. After blood sample collection, the cannula will be flushed with
0.9% sodium chloride, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (or equivalent) and charged with a volume 
equal to the dead space volume of the lock.
Refer to the Schedule of Activities for the timing and frequency of all sample collections.
Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples are found in the 
laboratory manuals that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples 
must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated 
in the laboratory manual.

8.1. Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy evaluations will include unilateral venography assessment of the operated leg and 
assessments of symptomatic DVT, PE, or death to assess the primary, secondary, and 
exploratory efficacy outcomes.
8.1.1. Assessments for DVT
Venography assessments of the operated leg will be performed by [CONTACT_504405] a 
foot vein and obtaining x-ray images of the proximal and distal leg veins. Evaluable venography 
assessments require the visualization of all the deep veins except for the muscular, anterior tibial, 
and deep femoral veins. An ultrasound will be performed in those subjects with suspected 
symptomatic DVT prior to the Day 10-[ADDRESS_970363] 1 primary person to perform the venography 
assessments for subjects. Evaluability of the venography assessments based on centrally 
adjudicated data will be monitored for each site on an ongoing basis. If venography assessment performance is considered not acceptable, then further randomization by [CONTACT_712996]. Additional details regarding the 
venography procedure and study-specific training requirements will be provided in a venography 
manual, which will be provided separately to the study sites.

Approved, Date: 10 September [ZIP_CODE].1.2. Assessments for PE
For all subjects with symptoms of PE, spi[INVESTIGATOR_85004], pulmonary angiography, or 
perfusion/ventilation lung scanning combined with chest radiography will be performed. A 
diagnosis of PE will be made only if the subject has symptoms of PE (eg, sudden onset of 
dyspnea, chest pain, or fainting), and 1 of the following criteria is met:
!Positive spi[INVESTIGATOR_712950] a segmental or more 
proximal thrombus
!Positive pulmonary arteriogram
!High probability ventilation/perfusion lung scan (defined as 1 or more segmental or large 
[>75% of a segment] subsegmental perfusion defects associated with ventilation mismatch)
!Intermediate probability ventilation/perfusion lung scan and ultrasound or venographic 
evidence of DVT
!Autopsy confirmation
If a subject is objectively diagnosed with a PE meeting the specified definitions prior to 
Day 10-14, a subsequent venography assessment of the operated leg is not required.
8.2. Safety Assessments
The safety and tolerability of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970364] 
(ie, bleeding events, liver enzyme elevations and clinical liver events, and wound or joint 
complications), clinical laboratory tests (ie, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), and 
physical examinations. All bleeding events will be classified according to the definitions of 
bleeding events in Section 10.6, Appendix 6, Definition of Bleeding Events. Safety evaluations 
may also be performed at unscheduled timepoints, if deemed by [CONTACT_712997]. All suspected symptomatic efficacy 
events (VTE) will also be captured as adverse events of interest.
The OC will be responsible for reviewing ongoing safety and efficacy data by [CONTACT_712998] 3 to 8 weeks on a periodic basis. They will also 
review the interim analysis data and make dose decisions, including but not limited to deciding 
whether to proceed with the optional dose regimen and at what dose(s). Details regarding the OC
are provided in Committees Structure in Section 10.3, Appendix 3, Regulatory, Ethical, and 
Study Oversight Considerations.
Adverse events will be reported and followed by [CONTACT_23803] 8.3, 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Section 10.4, Appendix 4, Adverse Events:

8.2.1. Bleeding Events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Classification of Bleeding Events
All subjects will be observed for signs and symptoms of bleeding events throughout the study 
and at each study visit as indicated in the Schedule of Activities.
The investigator’s classification of bleeding events according to the protocol classification will 
be collected in the eCRF (Section 10.6, Appendix 6, Definition of Bleeding Events). Additional 
information, including but not limited to the list below, will be collected for subjects with 
bleeding events and captured in the source documents and entered into the eCRF:
!Location of the bleeding and duration
!Provocation of the bleeding
!Association with any procedure
!Action taken regarding the study drug
!Concomitant or additional treatment given for this bleeding event
!Any associated hemoglobin (and/or hematocrit) levels
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) due to bleeding events
!Outcome
All available information related to the classification of bleeding events will be collected and 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_10987].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Approach to Subjects With a Bleeding Event
If a subject has a bleeding event requiring intervention during the study, the following measures 
should be considered:
!Discontinue the study drug (refer to Section 7.1, Discontinuation of Study Drug)
!Usual treatment measures for bleeding events, including local pressure, fluid replacement 
and hemodynamic support, blood transfusion, and fresh frozen plasma, if physical

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019Currently, there is no reversal agent for JNJ-70033093; however, the anticoagulant effect of 
JNJ-70033093 dissipates in 48 to 72 hours. At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of 
JNJ-70033093 will not be reflected by [CONTACT_365187] (INR) values but may be 
reflected by [CONTACT_712999]. In-vitro spi[INVESTIGATOR_712951]-70033093 
resulted in concentration-dependent increases in aPTT, which is consistent with its mechanism of 
action. Pre-incubation with activated 4-facto r prothrombin concentrate complex (FEIBA) and 
Factor VIIa (Novo-Seven(), 2 commercially available nonspecific reversal agents, were able to 
prevent JNJ-70033093-induced prolongations in aPTT. These data demonstrate that FEIBA 
(and Factor VIIa by [CONTACT_713000]), can promote clotting and provide hemostasis.9
Furthermore, FEIBA was able to reverse bleeding induced by a FXIa-inhibitor compound in a rat-tail transection model of bleeding in anesthetized rats.
10Also, in FXI-deficient patients, 
recombinant Factor VIIa has been used successfully to prevent surgical bleeding without 
complication.
Therefore, if bleeding cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_221732], administration of FEIBA or 
Factor VIIa according to the dosages and dosing schedules that are recommended in their 
respective package inserts could be considered (Note: consultation with a coagulation expert is 
recommended before use).
Protamine sulfate partially reverses the anticoagulant activity of enoxaparin. For subjects 
receiving enoxaparin, if bleeding cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_713001].
8.2.2. Physical Examination
The physical examination consists of a routine medical examination that includes general 
appearance and a review of the following systems: neurologic, eyes/ears/nose/throat, thyroid, 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdominal/gastrointestinal, hepatic, musculoskeletal, and 
dermatologic. Any bleeding observed during the examination (eg, skin, gingiva, nares) will be 
recorded as a potential bleeding event as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Classification of Bleeding 
Events. Additional body systems or further detailed physical examinations 
(eg, rectal examinations) should be performed if considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_1275]. Physical examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_1720] a designated health 
care professional who is licensed and/or certified in accordance with applicable local laws to 
perform physical examinations.
Height and weight should be obtained at the screening visit, with weight only on the final visit. 
The physical examination will be conducted at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities. An assessment of the wound will be made at all visits as part of the adverse event 
assessment. Any new, clinically significant findings (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]) that were 
not noted at the time of the screening visit must be captured as adverse events and will be
followed to resolution.

For this study, the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of JNJ-70033093 or 
enoxaparin that is considered both excessive and medically important by [CONTACT_713002] a serious adverse event (medically important 
event). The sponsor does not recommend specific intervention for an overdose (consult the 
approved product information for enoxaparin). There is no known antidote for overdose with 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_970370] been performed to assess methods of reversing JNJ-70033093
absorption effects; however, in theory, activated charcoal may reduce the absorption of JNJ-
70033093 if given early after administration of JNJ-70033093.
In the event of an overdose with JNJ-70033093, the investigator or treating physician should:
!Contact [CONTACT_713003].
!Closely monitor the subject for adverse event/serious adverse event and laboratory 
abnormalities until JNJ-70033093 can no longer be detected systemically (at least 2 days).
!Monitoring aPTT may be of help in determining the extent of anticoagulation.
!Obtain plasma samples for PK and PD (aPTT and PT) analysis as soon as possible from the 
date of the last dose of study drug if requested by [CONTACT_1689] (determined on a 
case-by-case basis).
!Document the quantity of the excess dose (number of capsules), the nature 
(accidental, intentional) as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_180819].
8.5. Pharmacokinetics
Plasma samples will be used to evaluate the PK of JNJ-70033093. Plasma collected for PK may 
additionally be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects that address concerns arising during or 
after the study period. Genetic analyses will not be performed on these plasma samples. Subject 
confidentiality will be maintained.
8.5.1. Evaluations
Venous blood samples of approximately [ADDRESS_970371] PK samples collected as soon as practically 
possible after the event occurs.

In addition, residual plasma PK samples may be stored for future analysis of the metabolite 
profile, if needed. If these analyses are conducted, they will be reported separately from the CSR.
The Schedule of Activities lists the sampling schedule to be followed for the assessment of PK. 
In addition to the times listed in the table, a sample for measurement of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970372] who experiences 
a suspected symptomatic thrombotic or bleeding event, or if requested by [CONTACT_1689] 
(determined on a case-by-case basis) in the event of an overdose.
8.5.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Evaluations
Parameters
Based on the individual plasma concentration-time data, using the actual dose taken and the 
actual sampling times, PK parameters (eg, apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution) 
and exposure for exposure-response analysis of JNJ-70033093 and associated variables will be 
derived using population PK modeling. Baseline covariates (eg, body weight, age, sex, creatinine 
clearance, race) may be included in the model, if relevant. The analysis of these parameters will 
be outlined in the population PK modeling plan and reported separately from the CSR.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Evaluations
The relationship between the observed plasma concentration of JNJ-70033093 and measured 
PD markers will be investigated graphically. If appropriate, PK/PD exposure and 
response-relationships may be further analyzed quantitatively.
The relationships between the plasma PK exposure of JNJ-70033093 derived from the 
population PK model will be correlated with the measured PD markers and safety/efficacy 
endpoints via graphical analysis. When necessary, these data may be analyzed statistically using 
a suitable model. The details of the analyses plan will be presented in a population PK modeling 
plan that is separated from the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The results will be reported 
separately from the CSR.

Thromboplastin Time’ comes from the original form of the test in which only the phospholipid 
concentration of the test was controlled (as oppos ed to the phospholipid and the surface activator 
concentrations) and the name 'partial thromboplastin' was applied at the time to phospholipid 
preparations that accelerated clotting but did not correct the prolonged clotting times of 
hemophilic plasma. The term 'partial' means phospholipid is present but no tissue factor. The 
normal and reference ranges vary depending on reagent and instrument combinations, 
particularly with the phospholipid composition. It is used to evaluate the coagulation Factors XII, 
XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein and high 
molecular-weight kininogen. Heparin, DOACs, and direct thrombin inhibitors, including hirudin, 
argatroban, and dabigatran have an effect on the assay. Blood will be collected for measurement 
of changes in aPTT clotting time.
Prothrombin Time
Prothrombin time is a global clotting test that is used for the assessment of the extrinsic pathway 
of the blood coagulation cascade. It is a 1-stage test based upon on the time required for a fibrin 
clot to form after the addition of tissue factor (historically known as tissue thromboplastin), 
phospholipid, and calcium to decalcified, platelet-poor plasma. The test is sensitive for 
deficiencies of fibrinogen and Factors II, V, VII, and X, with sensitivity being best for Factors V, 
VII, and X and less pronounced for Factor II. Prothrombin time and the normalized version, 
INRs are used to monitor warfarin therapy. It should be noted that currently, 3 types of 
PT reagents are used: recombinant thromboplastins, tissue thromboplastins (which are usually 
from rabbit brain or human placenta), or combined thromboplastins (tissue thromboplastin 
diluted into fibrinogen). These reagents differ in factor sensitivity, heparin responsiveness, 
lot-to-lot consistency, and absolute value of the clotting times.
Factor XI Clotting Activity
Factor XI clotting activity is determined utilizing an aPTT-based 1-stage clotting time assay. 
Serial dilutions of normal pooled plasma are mixed with FXI-depleted plasma and the clotting 
times are measured according to standard aPTT protocol, to establish a reference range. Subject
test plasma is treated in the same way and compared with the reference plasma. The assay will be 
performed at a specialty laboratory.

Archive Sample for Exploratory Research
Blood samples will be collected at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities and a 
plasma sample archived for future exploratory PD re search related to the safety and/or efficacy 
of JNJ-70033093. Refer to the PD laboratory manual for detailed instructions for sample 
collection, processing and shipment of archive samples for exploratory research.
8.7. Biomarkers
Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of D-dimer, high-sensitive cardiac 
troponin T (hs-cTnT), and FXI antigen assessment at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of 
Activities.
D-dimer
The various states of coagulation activation that o ccur in vivo lead to the production of thrombin 
and then, cross-linked fibrin. What follows is a reactive fibrinolysis, during which plasmin 
breaks down fibrin. D-dimer is the ultimate degradation product of cross-linked fibrin. The 
presence of D-dimer in plasma is an indirect marker of a coagulation activation followed by a 
reactive thrombolysis. Increased levels D-dimer can be found in patients with DVT, PE, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemorrhages, surgery, cancers, and severe infections. 
The D-dimer assay is an enzyme immunoassay procedure for the quantitative determination of 
D-dimer levels.

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019High-sensitive Cardiac Troponin T
The troponin complex, consisting of troponin C, T, and I subunits, regulates the contraction of 
striated muscles. Damage to cardiac muscle tissue causes release of troponins into the 
bloodstream and circulating troponin levels correlate to the degree of muscle damage; 
accordingly, cardiac troponins are considered primary biomarkers for diagnosis of acute MI and 
risk assessment in acute coronary syndrome. Immunoassays are performed to detect cardiac 
troponin T in plasma samples prepared from venous blood collection. 
Factor XI Antigen
Measurement of FXI antigen in plasma at baseline, using a validated immunoassay, may help to 
improve understanding of thrombotic conditions and help identify subjects susceptible to 
cardiovascular events.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_35522]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined 
below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP.
This study will use an adaptive design intended to optimize data collection for dose-response 
modeling. It is estimated that approximately 900 subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment 
in this study, with an option to increase to approximately 1,200 subjects based on the possible 
addition of once daily dose groups, and/or evaluability rate. Initially, subjects will be randomly 
assigned to BID doses of JNJ-70033093 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg and enoxaparin 40 mg once 
daily in a 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_970375]-
analyses, depending on the analysis results and safety review. These adjustments include 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_712953] (especially bleeding) 
as well as adding dose regimens (ie, once daily dose regimen). The randomization ratio may be 
modified to optimize data collection for dose-response estimation.
9.1. Sample Size Determination
Assuming the evaluability rate (rate of subjects with a valid assessment of potential efficacy 
outcome and who take at least 1 dose of study drug) is 80%, if the true underlying total VTE 
event rates are as shown in Table [ADDRESS_970376] over 99% power to declare 
proof-of-efficacy at a 1-sided, 5% ∃-level. Proof-of-efficacy is defined as either a statistically

Approved, Date: 10 September 201970033093 groups that is statistically lower than 30%. The exact power will vary because of the 
nature of the adaptive study design. 
Comparison with enoxaparin will be based on the comparison between the highest postoperative 
dose with acceptable safety and enoxaparin. For example, if the highest dose for acceptable 
safety is [ADDRESS_970377] enoxaparin, at 1-sided, 5% ∃-level, is over 90%.

(4 E maxdose-response modules with varying degrees of ED 50, Figure 4 ), which provide estimates 
of dose-response (taking BID and once daily into consideration). 
Figure 4: Canonical Candidate E maxDose-response Models Used in the MCP-Mod Analysis
The efficacy of the drug is established when the maximum of the t-test statistics for the dose-response trend exceeds the critical value. Predicted event rates at a specific dose will be 
derived for the candidate model. 
The details of the adaptive decision guidelines will be specified in the OC charter and the SAP.
The primary analyses of efficacy endpoints will be based on CEC-adjudicated events from the 
mITT population. Subjects who do not receive any study drug will be excluded from the primary 
analysis. However, they will be included in se nsitivity analyses as defined in the SAP. The 
primary efficacy endpoint and its components will be summarized by [CONTACT_713006].
Prespecified clinical variables of interest for the efficacy subgroup analyses include region, age, 
sex, body mass index, renal function, surgery duration, and tourniquet use.

Adverse Events
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by [CONTACT_713007] (MedDRA). Study drug-emergent 
adverse events are adverse events with onset during the postoperative dosing phase or that are a 
consequence of a preexisting condition that has worsened since baseline. All reported adverse 
events will be included in the analysis. For each adverse event, the percentage of subjects who 
experience at least 1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In 
addition, comparisons between treatment groups will be provided if appropriate.

Estimation of the dose-response relationship in any bleeding will be addressed by a unified 
(modified) MCP-Mod approach as with efficacy. Any bleeding, major bleeding, clinically 
relevant nonmajor bleeding, composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and 
minimal bleeding will be summarized by [CONTACT_712970]. The same variables 
specified for the efficacy subgroup analyses will be used for the safety subgroup analysis with 
the addition of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_154924]. Reference ranges and markedly 
abnormal results (specified in the SAP) will be used in the summary of laboratory data. 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each laboratory analyte at baseline and at each 
scheduled time point. A listing of subjects with any laboratory results outside the reference 
ranges will be provided. A listing of subjects with  any markedly abnormal laboratory results will 
also be provided.
Physical Examination
Height and weight will be summarized.

results will be reported separately from the CSR.
Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Analyses
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum will be provided 
for the percent change from baseline of the PD (aPTT, PT, FXI clotting activity, anti-FXa 
activity, TGA) and biomarker (D-dimer, hs-cTnT) parameters by [CONTACT_713008]. The parameters may be statistically analyzed using mixed models. FXI 
antigen levels will be summarized.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
The relationship between observed plasma concentration of JNJ-70033093 and measured 
PD markers will be investigated graphically. If appropriate, PK/PD exposure and response 
relationships may be further analyzed quantitatively. 
The relationship between the plasma PK exposure of JNJ-70033093 derived from the population 
PK model will be correlated with the measured PD markers and safety/efficacy endpoints via 
graphical analysis. When necessary, these data may be analyzed statistically using a suitable 
model. The details of the analyses plan will be presented in a population PK modeling plan that 
is separate from the SAP. The results will be reported separately from CSR.
9.4. Periodic and Interim Analyses
Unblinded periodic and interim analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_713009]. The interim analysis will be triggered when 
approximately 300 subjects (approximately 50 subjects in each of the JNJ-70033093 BID 
treatment groups) will have completed the venography or have had a symptomatic VTE event.
Both periodic and interim analyses results will be used to guide the decision to drop doses of

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019JNJ-70033093 and/or adjust the randomization ratio. The number of subjects who were planned 
to be randomized into the dropped dosing regimen can be allocated to one of the other active 
dosing groups. The interim analysis will also serve as the formal venue to assess study status and 
possibly add once daily dosing of 50 mg and/or 200 mg of JNJ-70033093 based on available 
efficacy and safety data. If PK/PD analysis results are available at the time of the interim 
analysis, the results will be included in th e review. Additional interim analyses will be 
conducted, as needed, at the discretion of the OC. A  futility analysis will also be included as part 
of the interim analysis, which may lead to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_461147]. These decisions will be 
made only after taking the safety and efficacy profiles of JNJ-[ADDRESS_970382] interim analysis and any subsequent interim analyses as determined to 
be appropriate by [CONTACT_713010].
9.4.1. Committees
An OC, Steering Committee, and independent CEC will be established as noted in Committees

The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions. 
After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded 
by [CONTACT_19720]’s personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy 
of the ICF must be given to the subject.
If the subject is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present for the entire 
informed consent process (which includes reading and explaining all written information) and 
should personally date and sign the ICF after the oral consent of the subject is obtained.
DATA PROTECTION
Privacy of Personal Data
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be 
limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the study.
These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality 
and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized 
disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be 
put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to 
keep the identity of subjects confidential.
The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of 
personal data and for the investigator/institution to allow direct access to his or her original 
medical records (source data/documents) for study-related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, 
and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities 
and to other countries.
The subject has the right to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and 
the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps 
will be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the 
conditions of the study, and the applicable laws and regulations.
Exploratory PD, biomarker, and PK research is not conducted under standards appropriate for 
the return of data to subjects. In addition, the sponsor cannot make decisions as to the 
significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research 
data will not be returned to subjects or investigators, unless required by [CONTACT_67827]. 
Privacy and confidentiality of data generated in the future on stored samples will be protected by

Approved, Date: 10 September 2019MONITORING
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques: central, remote, or on-site 
monitoring to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study-site visit log that will be kept at the study-site. The first 
post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, 
the monitor will compare data entered into the eCRF with the source documents 
(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/physician’s office medical records); a sample may be reviewed. The nature 
and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data 
required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are 
accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786]-site contact. If electronic records are maintained 
at the study-site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study-site personnel.
Direct access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verifying that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this 
review will be discussed with the study-site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during 
monitoring visits, the relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will 
be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related 
documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to 
provide feedback on the study conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study at the site. 
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by [CONTACT_70467].
ON-SITE AUDITS
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study-site at 
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance 
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy must, however, be 
respected. The investigator and study-site personnel are responsible for being present and 
available for consultation during routinely scheduled study-site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_170192].
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_67840], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a 
regulatory submission. The investigator should immed iately notify the sponsor if he or she has 
been contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.

accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study 
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any 
documentation relating to this study, the investigator/institution must permit access to such 
reports.
STUDY AND SITE CLOSURE
Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study-site or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A 
study-site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study-site by [CONTACT_11004]:
!Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
!Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093]
!Discontinuation of further study drug development

Evaluating, Follow-Up, and Reporting
ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONSAdverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) produ ct. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the intervention. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) 
product, whether or not related to  that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. 
(Definition per ICH)
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to All 
Adverse Events under Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_970392] adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and European Union Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death.
!Is life threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
!Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.
!Is Medically Important.*
*Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712954]. 
These should usually be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis), the event must 
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
92
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of 
the study endpoint (eg, all-cause mortality).
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For JNJ-70033093, the expectedness of an 
adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_70471]. For enoxaparin, the 
expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_713015].
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, 
probable, or very likely by [CONTACT_8128] (see Attribution Definitions).
ATTRIBUTION DEFINITIONS
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg, concomitant 
treatment(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal 
relationship is unlikely.
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, 
eg, concomitant treatment(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg, confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg, concomitant 
treatment(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible a dverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg, concomitant treatment(s), concomitant disease(s). The 
relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by [CONTACT_35719]).
SEVERITY CRITERIA
An assessment of severity grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
93
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity.
Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal everyday activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgement in assessing the severity of events not directly 
experienced by [CONTACT_423] (eg, laboratory abnormalities).
SPECIAL REPORTING SITUATIONS
Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drug in an interventional study that may require 
expedited reporting or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:
!Overdose of a sponsor study drug 
!Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug 
!Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study drug 
!Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to 
the sponsor study drug, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the eCRF.
PROCEDURES
All Adverse Events
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, 
must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever 
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology 
(eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]"). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_712955]. All measures required for adverse event 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open-label studies, the subject must be 
provided with a "wallet (study) card" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration 
of the study indicating the following:
!Study number
!Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study
!Investigator's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828]
!Local sponsor's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828] (for medical staff only)

Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study, must be followed until 
any of the following occurs:
!The event resolves
!The event stabilizes
!The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
!The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct
!It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a 
serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
that occurs during the course of a subject’s participation in a study must be reported as a serious 
adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (eg, social reasons 
such as pending placement in long-term care facility)
!Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the 
eCRF). Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743], and where 
the underlying condition for which the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23744], will not be considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.
The cause of death of a subject in a study through Week 6, whether or not the event is expected 
or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse event.

PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINT HANDLING
A product quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect related to 
manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality, 
durability, or reliability of a product, including its labeling or package integrity. A PQC may have 
an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and 
analysis of PQC information from studies are c rucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, 
JNJ-70033093
Clinical Protocol 70033093THR2001 Amendment 1
95
Approved, Date: 10 September 2019and the sponsor, and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. The sponsor has 
established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure 
appropriate reporting of PQC information; all studies conducted by [CONTACT_111168].
Procedures
All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel within [ADDRESS_970393] report the 
PQC to the sponsor according to the serious adverse event reporting timelines (refer to 
Section 8.3.2 , Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information). A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further 
investigation if requested by [CONTACT_456].

Pregnancy Information
Subjects must follow contraceptive measures as outlined in Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria. 
Pregnancy information will be collected and reported as noted in Section 8.3.6 , Pregnancy, and 
Section 10.4, Appendix 4 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording,
Evaluating, Follow-Up, and Reporting.
Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).
Woman Not of Childbearing Potential
!premenarchal
A premenarchal state is one in which menarche has not yet occurred.
!postmenopausal
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (>40 IU/L or mIU/mL) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.
!permanently sterile
Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral 
tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (eg, a premenarchal woman 
experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a woman who is not heterosexually 
active becomes active), a woman must begin a highly effective method of contraception, as 
described throughout the inclusion criteria.

Number of Participants: Assuming approximately a 40% screen failure rate, approximately 
1400 participants may be screened  to randomize 888 participants  with previously untreated  locally 
advanced NSCLC (1:1:1) to the 3 treatment arms. 
Treatment Arms and Duration: Participants will be randomized (1:1:1) across the 3  treatment 
arms: 
• Arm  A: 
− CCRT Period:  Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3  
− Maintenance  Period: Nivolumab (360  mg flat dose  IV Q3W)  + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (1 mg/kg  IV 
Q6W) for up to 12 months

 • Arm  B: 
− CCRT Period:  Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3  
− Maintenance  Period:  Nivolumab (480 mg flat dose IV Q4W)  for up to 12 months  
• Arm  C: 
− CCRT Period:  Platinum doublet chemotherapy (IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy 
(total dose of 60-66 Gy) for cycles 2 to 3 
− Maintenance  Period: Durvalumab  (10 mg/kg IV Q2W)  for up to 12 months.  
 
If radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  Period  (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer therapy (Cycle 2). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT Period  are still to be followed. The Recovery  Period  will begin after the final dose of radiotherapy 
and the completion of Cycle 3 procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities.  An additional 
cycle of consolidation chemotherapy + nivolumab (Arms  A and B) or chemotherapy  alone 
(Arm C) will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
CA20973L is a phase 3, randomized, open label study to compare nivolumab plus concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by [CONTACT_104076][INVESTIGATOR_103954]- small cell lung 
cancer (LA NSCLC).  
Immunotherapeutic approaches have recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancer 
types, including NSCLC.
[ADDRESS_115112]  immune response through a 
number of mechanisms, including down regulation of tumor -specific antigen expression and 
presentation, secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. T 
cell checkpoint regulators such as CTLA -4 and programmed death -1 (PD -1, CD279) are cell 
surface molecules that, when  engaged by [CONTACT_20378],  induce signaling cascades down- 
regulating  T cell activation  and proliferation.  One proposed model by [CONTACT_104091]  T cell 
checkpoint inhibitors  derive antitumor activity is through breaking of immune  tolerance  to tumor 
cell antigens.  
Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD -1 on 
activated  immune cells and disrupts  engagement of the receptor  with its ligands PD-L1 
(B7-H1/CD274) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), thereby [CONTACT_104092] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 3.2.3  for clinical 
background on nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43809]). 
Durvalumab is  a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that 
inhibits binding of PD -L1 (B7 -H1, CD274) to PD -1 (CD279) and CD80 (B7- 1). In the phase 3 
PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was compared with  placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with 
stage III NSCLC that did not progress after CCRT. Durvalumab significantly prolonged PFS 
(median 17.2 months vs 5.6 months, HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63), and OS (HR 0.68; 99.73%  
CI, 0.47 to 0.997, P=0.0025).2 Updated analyses  at 48 months further  observed an estimated PFS 
and OS rate of 35.3% and 49.6%, respectively.3 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103955] a fully  human  monoclonal IgG1κ  that binds to the CTLA -4 antigen expressed on a 
subset of T cells from human and nonhuman primates. The proposed mechanism of action for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103956] -4 with B7 molecules on antigen-presenting 
cell (APCs),  with  subsequent blockade of the inhibitory  modulation of T- cell activation  promoted 
by [CONTACT_102429]-4/B7 interaction. 
The CA20973L study will allow for direct comparison of novel therapeutic strategy: CCRT with 
concurrent programmed  cell death  protein-1 /programmed  death -ligand 1 (PD-1/PD -L1) blockade 
followed by [CONTACT_4002] -1/PD -L1 blockade with or without CTLA -4 blockade, compared with  PD-1/PD - 
L1 blockade alone after CCRT,  as measured  by [CONTACT_16625],  OS, and other clinical endpoints in previously

 3.1 Study Rationale  
Adding anti PD -1 concurrently to CCRT is hypothesized to improve anti -tumor activity (see 
Section 5.4.2). In the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was given after the completion of CCRT. In 
subgroup analyses,  more  pronounced improvement in median  PFS and OS was seen in participants 
randomized within [ADDRESS_115114] radiation dose compared to participants randomized later, 
suggesting that initiating PD -1/PD -L1 blockade closer to CCRT may be beneficial.4 In a mouse 
model, different  combination  schedules were  assessed.  It was observed that initiating  PD-1/PD -L1 
blockade during radiotherapy  led to longer survival times,  whereas starting  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade 
7 days after the completion of radiotherapy yielded similar survival results when compared with radiotherapy  alone, which might be due  to an acute increase in PD -L1 expression on tumor  cells 
during radiotherapy.
5 Ineffective  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade when  given in a delayed manner might be 
explained by [CONTACT_104093]- reactive CD8+ cells. In a phase 2 trial  (NICOLAS), 
nivolumab is given concurrently with chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC. Preliminary data (see Section 3.2.4 ) suggested this approach is feasible and safe.

indirect data from peripheral T cell assessments suggest that a given T -cell checkpoint inhibitor 
may modulate host immune cell phenotype rendering them more susceptible to alternate 
checkpoint inhibitors  and thereby [CONTACT_104094]-tumor activity.  Available  evidence also indicates 
that incorporating ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103957] -based  strategy  holds promise  as, besides  abscopal 
effect, durable response has been observed with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103958], refractory NSCLC (see Section 5.4.3).

 3.2 Background  
3.2.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]/Indication  
Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades. There were 
estimated to be 1.8 million new cases in 2012 (12.9% of the total). Lung cancer is the most 
common cause of death  from  cancer  worldwide, estimated  to be responsible for nearly  one in  five 
(1.59 million deaths, 19.4% of the total).8 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers 
and 30% of patients present with Stage III disease. Standard treatment for patients with a good 
performance status and unresectable Stage III NSCLC was definitive chemoradiation. A meta- 
analysis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus sequential chemoradiotherapy showed better outcomes with concurrent therapy.
9 With  improvements  such as in staging  by [CONTACT_104095], 5- year overall survival (OS)  was reported  up to 30-35%.10 
Attempts to improve OS include radiotherapy dose escalation/acceleration; new chemotherapy combinations, addition of biological agents, targeted agents, and cancer vaccines to standard regimens.  Technical  radiotherapy  modifications have also  been  explored. However,  none of these 
efforts has led to an improvement in OS thus far, except for acceleration of radiotherapy in the non-concurrent setting.

two years of therapy (18-month PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 
3 years.4,12 As this stage of disease is potentially curable, new treatment strategies are needed.  
3.2.2 Mechanism of Action 
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized  as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by [CONTACT_20397]. An effective immune 
response in this  setting is  thought to rely on immune  surveillance of tumor antigens  expressed  on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses
.13,14,15 
Current immunotherapy  efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_104096].  T-cell stimulation  is a complex process 
involving the integration  of numerous positive  as well as negative co-stimulatory  signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by [CONTACT_104097] . 16 Collectively, these signals govern the balance 
between T -cell activation and tolerance.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103961] -4, an activation- induced T -cell surface molecule, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that competes with CD28 for B7. CTLA -4 mediated signals are 
inhibitory and turn off T cell-dependent immune  responses.  17 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103955] a fully  human

In vitro, nivolumab (BMS -936558) binds to PD -1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39- 2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 (IC50 ± 1 nM). Nivolumab binds

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience with Nivolumab in NSCLC  
Approval of nivolumab in advanced NSCLC was based on 2 phase 3 trials (CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057) which demonstrated survival benefit over docetaxel across histologies in previously treated patients. 
The approval in squamous NSCLC was based on the results of CA209017, a randomized trial  of 
nivolumab versus docetaxel. The median OS for patients in the nivolumab arm was 9.2 months versus 6 months for those in the docetaxel arm (HR = 0.59). Improvement in survival was observed 
for nivolumab regardless of PD -L1 expression, although there was a trend toward better efficacy 
for those with PD -L1 expressing tumors. A single -arm trial (CA209063) of [ADDRESS_115121] 1 
additional systemic regimen showed a 15% objective response rate (ORR); 59% of participants  
with a response had response durations of 6 months or longer.
21 
The approval of nivolumab for the treatment of non-squamous NSCLC  is based  on a second phase 
3 study, CA209057, which  met its primary  endpoint of superior OS of nivolumab versus  docetaxel 
in patients  with previously treated  non-squamous NSCLC  at a preplanned interim analysis.

 Patients in  the nivolumab arm had a 27% reduction in risk of death  (HR = 0.73; P = 0.0015). The 
safety profile was also more favorable for nivolumab vs docetaxel.[ADDRESS_115123] evaluated nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103963].  
CA209012 was a multi -arm phase 1b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in 
patients with chemotherapy -naïve advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as either 
monotherapy or in combination with other agents including ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at different doses and schedules. The primary endpoint of the study was safety with secondary endpoints of objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and 24- week progression- free survival (PFS). Participants 
were assigned to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q12W (n=38), nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W (n=39) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n=52). The confirmed  ORR was 47% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q12W), 39% (N3 Q2W + I1 Q6W)  and 23% 
(N3 Q2W).  
The rate of treatment -related  adverse events (AEs)  in the Q12W (82%)  and Q6W  (72%) arms  were 
comparable to monotherapy (72%). In the study, Grade 3/4 adverse events were 37%, 33%, and 19% for the Q12W, Q6W, and nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment -related 
Grade  3-4 AEs led to discontinuation in 5% and 8% of participants in the Q12W and Q6W  cohorts, 
respectively,  and were  similar  to nivolumab monotherapy. There  were  no treatment -related  deaths. 
The treatment- related  select  AEs in patients  administered  the optimized  dosing schedule (3 mg/kg 
of nivolumab Q2W plus 1 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] Q6W) were skin related (36%), gastrointestinal

complete response) versus 30.0% (95% CI: 25.5, 34.7) with chemotherapy (1.8% of patients had 
a complete response). The median duration of response was 23.2 months and 6.2 months, respectively. The response rate and duration of  response for nivolumab monotherapy was 27.5% 
and 15.5 months, respectively, showing the added anti -tumor activity of the nivolumab plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103967]. An OS benefit  was also observed in patients  with PD-L1 expression  less 
than 1%, with a median survival duration of 17.2 months (95% CI: 12.8, 22.0) with nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966] 12.2 months (95%  CI: 9.2, 14.3) with chemotherapy. Across trial participants 
(irrespective of PD -L1 expression), the median duration of OS was 17.1 months (95% CI: 15.2, 
19.9) with  nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966] 13.9 months (95%  CI: 12.2, 15.1) with  chemotherapy. 
The percentage of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AE in the overall population was 
32.8%  with nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966] 36.0%  with  chemotherapy. The  overall safety  profile 
was consistent with previously reported data, with no new safety signals. 
Overall,  the results from the CheckMate [ADDRESS_115126] -line NSCLC 
was based on the results of CA2099LA, a randomized trial of nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks 
(Q3W)  plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg Q6W  plus 2 cycles  of chemotherapy (treatment arm)  vs 4 cycles 
of chemotherapy with optional pemetrexed as maintenance (control arm) for non -squamous 
histology. This trial met its primary  endpoint of OS at the interim analysis with a minimum follow 
up of 8.1 months (HR = 0.69, 96.71% CI: 0.55, 0.87; p = 0.0006). After a minimum follow up of  
12.7 months, median OS was 15.6 months in the treatment arm, and 10.9 months in the control a
rm, yielding  a HR of 0.66 (95%  CI: 0.55, 0.80) with OS benefit  also observed across  prespecified 
subgroups. A PFS advantage was demonstrated  in the treatment  arm vs control arm with a median 
of 6.7 vs 5.0 months (HR  = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.82), respectively. A  significant improvement in 
ORR was also observed with a response rate of  38% in the treatment arm vs 25% in the control 
arm (Odds Ratio = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.6). The safety profile remains consistent with previous findings with no new toxicity signals and Grade  3/4 treatment- related  AEs rates being 47% in the 
treatment arm and 38% in the control arm.

 3.2.4 Clinical  Experience with Nivolumab and CCRT  
The safety, tolerability, and feasibility of administering nivolumab concurrently with CCRT in 
patients with  stage III locally  advanced NSCLC is supported by [CONTACT_104098] 2 NICOLAS 
trial.27 In the NICOLAS trial, participants received 3 cycles of platinum- based chemotherapy 
(cisplatin or carboplatin combined with etoposide, pemetrexed or  vinorelbine) concurrently with 
radiotherapy (66 Gy/ 33 fractions) and nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks). Radiotherapy techniques during CCRT included VMAT, IMRT or 3DRT, with a mean lung dose of <  20 Gy. 
Following CCRT,  participants  received  nivolumab maintenance therapy for up to 1 year at a dose 
of 480 mg every 4 weeks. 
The primary endpoint in the NICOLAS trial was pneumonitis -free rate (Grade ≥ 3) observed at 
any time during [ADDRESS_115128]-radiotherapy follow -up. Success at the interim 
analysis would be declared if there were zero Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_115129] 33 of the 41 participants  would be required  to 
be Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_115130] the null hypothesis.  
At the interim analysis (completed in September 2017), zero Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_115131] -CCRT follow- up. Thirty- six 
participants had not experienced Grade ≥  3 pneumonitis, above the boundary for null hypothesis 
rejection of ≥ 33 participants remaining event -free. These results provide additional support for 
the interim analysis conclusion that nivolumab + CCRT is safe and tolerable.  
In this ongoing trial, up to May 2019, data are available for [ADDRESS_115132] 41 participants, and the incidence of pneumonitis Grade ≥  3 in the full 
safety  cohort of 77 participants,  NICOLAS  study investigators determined  that no unexpected AEs 
or increased safety risk was observed in the trial.  
In part 2 of another phase 2 trial (DETERRED) combining atezolizumab concurrently with 
chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC also suggested that PD -L1 blockade given 
concurrently with chemoradiation  was feasible and safe.7 The chemotherapy component consisted 
of weekly  low dose carboplatin  and paclitaxel  concurrently  with radiotherapy  followed  by 2 cycles 
of full dose carboplatin/paclitaxel as consolidation. Of the [ADDRESS_115133] 1 
dose of therapy, 3 participants  (10%) reported pneumonitis (two Grade  2 events and one Grade 3 
event). The overall toxicity  profile  of atezolizumab  with CCRT  followed  by [CONTACT_104099].  
In the Keynote 799 study, patients with unresectable, locally advanced, Stage III NSCLC were

Cohort A and 70.5% (n = 43; 95% CI: 57.4- 81.5) in Cohort B was observed with an estimated 
response duration of ≥ [ADDRESS_115135] patients  with a response.  1-year OS rates in both cohorts 
were > 80%. Safety results were also consistent with findings in other similar studies. Given a 
median  follow up of  8.3 months  in Cohort A and 5.8 months in Cohort B, Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis 
occurred in 9 (8.0%) patients in Cohort A, and in 4 (5.5%) patients in Cohort B.29 
Collectively, the results from the NICOLAS, DETERRED, and Keynote 799 trials support the 
combination of nivolumab with CCRT in the CA20973L trial. 
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world for several decades and the most 
common cause  of death from  cancer  worldwide. Non- small cell lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  represents 
approximately 80% to 85%  of all  lung  cancers  and 30%  of patients  present with  Stage  III disease. 
Standard treatment for patients  with a good performance  status and unresectable Stage  III NSCLC 
has been  definitive  chemoradiation. CCRT  as standard of care has a well-established  safety  profile. 
A meta -analysis of concurrent versus sequential chemoradiotherapy showed better  outcomes with 
concurrent therapy.[ADDRESS_115136] two years of 
therapy (18-month PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 3 years.4,12 Updated 
analyses  at 48  months further observed a decrease in PFS and OS with  an estimated  rate of 35.3% 
and 49.6%, respectively.[ADDRESS_115137]  shown the potential  for concurrent administration  of 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 therapy with CCRT to improve clinical outcomes.5,12 Safety data from the 
NICOLAS trial provides evidence for the feasibility of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W given 
concurrently with CCRT, with no increased safety  risk.6,27,28 Furthermore, clinical evidence from 
CheckMate 227 supports the potential for the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103968].25

 reached  at any dose tested  up to 10 mg/kg. Most  AEs were  low-grade (Grade  1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level. 
A pattern  of immune -related adverse events has been defined, for which management algorithms 
for nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103971]; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most  high- 
grade events were manageable with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy 
(endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms.  
Additional details on the safety  profile  of nivolumab, including  results from other clinical  studies, 
are also available in the nivolumab IB. 
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) has given consideration regarding the benefit/risk of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccination during participation in BMS clinical trials of nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Based  on the review  of current available data and evidence to date,  knowledge of

the vaccine and the IPs that would negatively impact the benefit/risk for participants in BMS clinical trials of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103973]; however, data will continue to be reviewed. Therefore, at this time, a COVID -19 vaccine given to participants in this trial is 
considered a concomitant medication with no interaction.

However,  the efficacy  and safety  of non-live vaccines (including non- live COVID-19 vaccines)  in

To assure an ongoing favorable risks/benefit assessment for participants, an independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety and efficacy of treatments throughout the conduct of the trial. Furthermore,  quality  assurance for radiotherapy  will be in place 
to ensure adherence to the radiation plan.

5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Overall Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study to compare nivolumab plus CCRT 
followed  by [CONTACT_104107][INVESTIGATOR_103967] (Arm A) or nivolumab plus CCRT  followed 
by [CONTACT_104082] (Arm  B) with CCRT  followed  by [CONTACT_38219] (Arm C) in previously untreated 
LA NSCLC.  The safety  and efficacy  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103981] A vs Arm B descriptively.  
The study is  divided into a Screening  Period, a Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy  (CCRT) Period, a 
Recovery  Period, a Maintenance Period,  and a Long -term Follow-up Period.  The treatment period 
will contain a CCRT Period, a Recovery Period, and a Maintenance Period.  
Participants  will be randomized  (1:1:1) across 3 treatment  arms:  
• Arm  A: 
− CCRT  Period: Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total dose of 60 -66 Gy) for 
cycles 2 to 3  
− Maintenance Period: Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W) + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 mg/kg IV 
Q6W) for up to 12 months

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 • Arm  B: 
− CCRT  Period: Nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV Q3W) for cycles 1 to 3 + platinum doublet 
chemotherapy (IV Q3W)  for cycles 1 to 3 + radiotherapy (total  dose of 60-66 Gy) for cycles 
2 to 3 
− Maintenance Period: Nivolumab (480 mg flat dose IV Q4W)  for up to 12 months  
• Arm  C: 
− CCRT  Period: Platinum doublet chemotherapy (IV  Q3W) for cycles  1 to 3 + radiotherapy 
(total dose of 60-66 Gy) for cycles 2 to 3 
− Maintenance Period: Durvalumab  (10 mg/kg IV Q2W)  for up to 12 months  
 
If radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  Period  (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer therapy (Cycle 2). All study procedures for Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 during the CCRT Period  are still to be followed. The Recovery  Period  will begin after the final dose of radiotherapy 
and the completion of Cycle  3 procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities.  An additional 
cycle of consolidation chemotherapy + nivolumab (Arms  A and B) or chemotherapy  alone 
(Arm C) will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy in this situation. 
• Randomization will be stratified  by: 
• Age: 
− < 65 years 
− ≥ 65 years  
• T
umor PD-L1 status:  
− ≥ 1% 
− < 1% 
− indeterminate  or not evaluable  
• Stage  (per AJCC  8th edition):  
− IIIA 
− IIIB 
− IIIC 
 
The proportions of participants with indeterminate or not evaluable tumor PD -L1 status will be 
monitored and reassessed as needed to  ensure that the sample size in this stratum is adequate for 
analysis. Details will be described in the statistical analysis plan.

5.1.1 Screening Period  
Participants will provide written informed consent (ICF) to participate in the study before 
completing any protocol -specified procedures or evaluations not considered to be part of the 
participant’s standard care. After signing the ICF, participants will be evaluated for entry  criteria 
during the Screening Period within 28 days before randomization. Re -enrollment after screen 
failure will be allowed. Tumor imaging during Screening will include whole body PET/CT (including contrast) of the base of the skull through the upper thighs, within [ADDRESS_115150] or MRI of upper abdomen  (including adrenal glands, 
and full liver),  and other suspected  sites of disease  is required if the CT component of the PET/CT 
is not of sufficient  diagnostic quality for RECIST  1.1 assessments.  Imaging  of the brain  with MRI 
(with  and without contrast)  is required of all participants  during Screening  within  28 days prior to

nivolumab  
Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: [ADDRESS_115151] of the brain (without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is 
contraindicated or based on Investigator discretion. 
All participants  must have  tissue submitted  during screening. See Section 6.1 (Inclusion  Criteria) 
and Section  9.8 (Biomarkers) for specifications. Sufficient, recent tumor tissue  obtained within 
3 months prior to enrollment from a tumor lesion (formalin -fixed, paraffin- embedded block or 5 
to 10 unstained slides, obtained from core biopsy, excisional  biopsy or surgical specimen) will be 
submitted to the central laboratory along with an associated pathology report. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_103982]. In order for the participants to be treated, the sample must be submitted to the central laboratory for the PD -L1 test, and the PD -L1 status must be 
available to IRT prior to randomization. PD -L1 testing will be performed using the validated 
Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-[ADDRESS_115152] received  any local  or 
systemic anticancer therapy after the date that the submitted tumor tissue was obtained.  
Clinical TNM  staging  should be performed  per major guidelines (eg, ESMO,  NCCN).  Participants 
must be evaluated  by [CONTACT_779]’s  multidisciplinary  team  (eg, medical  oncologist, surgeon, radiologist) 
during screening to assess the suitability of the participant for the study. 
Except for overt cT4 disease, nodal  status N2 or N3 must  be proven by [CONTACT_104084] N2 
or N3 node via endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS),  mediastinoscopy, or thoracoscopy. In addition, 
T3N1  status must be proven in  at least one N1 node (if lesion  amenable or medically  feasible)  via 
one of these modalities. See Appendix 8 for summary for recommendations for nodal GTV 
delineation.  
5.1.2 CCRT Period  
Participants in all arms will receive CCRT. Participants in Arm A and Arm B will receive the 
addition of nivolumab concurrently  with CCRT;  whereas participants  in Arm C will receive CCRT 
alone during the CCRT  Period. After randomization, participants  must commence systemic study 
treatments (chemotherapy ± nivolumab) within 7 days.  
Chemotherapy consists  of up to 3 cycles of platinum -based  doublet treatment,  administered  in 
3-week cycles (Cycles 1 to 3). Prior to randomization, the planned chemotherapy regimen, the 
planned number of cycles of chemotherapy (up to 2 cycles or up to 3 cycles), the planned dose level  of chemotherapy at the start  of treatment for agents with more  than 1 possible dose level  per 
protocol (e.g. carboplatin, paclitaxel), and the radiation modality must be pre -defined and 
documented in the IRT and medical records by [CONTACT_093]. Please note that if the actual treatment regimen administered to the participant during the CCRT Period changes from the planned regimen  documented in  the IRT prior to randomization, the rationale  for the  change must 
also be recorded  in the case report form  (CRF)  and documented in the medical  record.  Participants 
with tumor of squamous histology will receive etoposide/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin. Participants with tumor of non -squamous histology will receive either etoposide/cisplatin, 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, or pemetrexed/cisplatin. If cisplatin cannot be tolerated, cisplatin may be replaced with carboplatin and the rationale must be documented in the CRF and medical record. If pemetrexed cannot be tolerated, pemetrexed may be replaced with etoposide and the rationale 
must be documented in the CRF  and medical  record. Recommended  dose modification  schedule

 (Section  7.4.5) should be followed; however, local  standards and clinical  judgment should be used 
for individual cases.  
Radiotherapy starts  on the first day of  Cycle 2 of chemotherapy and consists  of a target physical 
dose of 60-66 Gy  in 30-33 daily  fractions  of 2 Gy  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_82502] a 5 days on/2 days off schedule as 
appropriate, over 6-7 weeks)  by [CONTACT_2236] -modulated radiation  therapy  (IMRT), 
volumetric -modulated arc therapy (VMAT),  or 3-dimentional RT (3DRT).  It is recommended  that 
radiotherapy be administered on the same day and after the completion of systemic anticancer 
therapy. If logistically infeasible,  a window of ± [ADDRESS_115154] start ± 3 days of 
the start of systemic anticancer therapy in Cycle 2.  
If radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy  at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  period (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic anticancer  therapy  (Cycle  2). All study procedures for Cycle  [ADDRESS_115155] to a QA process. This will involve site 
qualification/credentialization and real time review of radiotherapy  plans with  real time feedback 
to sites. Upon completion of radiotherapy, all data must be submitted for final analysis. QA services will be provided by [CONTACT_104108] a separate radiotherapy manual 
to describe detailed radiotherapy requirements and QA processes.  
In Arm A and Arm B, nivolumab 360 mg IV Q3W  for up to 3 cycles  (Cycles  1 to 3) will be given 
concurrently to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, starting on the first day of each cycle and must be given prior to the administration  of chemotherapy. It is also recommended  that nivolumab 
be given prior to radiotherapy on the same day if logistically feasible.  
Every  e
ffort should be made  to continue radiotherapy  during the CCRT  Period  in an uninterrupted 
manner. In case of severe toxicities, such as high -grade esophagitis necessitating interruption of 
systemic anticancer therapy, radiotherapy may continue as appropriate provided the investigator believes supportive care will enable the participant to complete this part of therapy without excessive risk. Additional details are included in chemotherapy and radiotherapy toxicity management sections of the protocol  (Sections 7.4.5 and 7.6). Compliance will be documented in 
the eCRF.  
Participants who have confirmed disease progression by [CONTACT_19375] (BICR)  during the CCRT Period will  be discontinued from the  treatment  and enter  the Follow-up 
Period. However, all study treatment decisions will be based on the investigator’s assessment of 
tumor images. In case of premature discontinuation of CCRT with reasons other than PD, as confirmed by [CONTACT_19377], continuation of the participant into the recovery period may be considered based on discussion with the Medical Monitor and Investigator.

 5.1.3 Recovery Period  
Recovery  Period  lasts approximately  3 weeks  up to 6 weeks from  the end of the CCRT  Period  (ie, 
last dose of radiotherapy). For participants who are recovering from toxicities associated with 
CCRT treatment, the first dose of maintenance immunotherapy may be delayed up to 6 weeks from the end of CCRT (ie, last dose of radiotherapy). If further delay (> 6 weeks) is needed, approval by [CONTACT_104087], and this must be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
Tumor measurement imaging, safety evaluations, and other procedures should be performed 
approximately 3 weeks following the completion of CCRT (ie,  last dose of radiotherapy). Tumor 
imaging during the Recovery Period will be the first on -treatment scan for the study. Other 
examinations during the Recovery Period should be performed as close as possible to the 
anticipated commencement of maintenance immunotherapy. 
The maintenance immunotherapy begins when  the investigator determines  that the participant has 
recovered from the effects of the combined modality treatment sufficiently. For entry into the Maintenance Period, participants must meet all eligibility criteria detailed in Section 6.1.2. 
Participants receiving pemetrexed during  the CCRT Period should continue their scheduled folic 
acid until [ADDRESS_115157] dosing in maintenance can be initiated  within  2 weeks from the end of CCRT  (ie, last dose of 
radiotherapy) but  no less than 18 days from the previous dosing  of nivolumab  (Arm  A and B) and 
should be given within [ADDRESS_115158] or MRI  of upper abdomen (including adrenal  glands, full liver), 
and other suspected  sites of disease should be performed  24 weeks (± 7 days)  from randomization, 
then every  12 weeks (±7  days) during treatment  according  to Table  2
-5, Table  2-6, and Table  2-7. 
Tumor imaging should be submitted to BICR on an ongoing basis. In the case of  PD as assessed 
by [CONTACT_093] (per RECIST 1.1), the images and any associated documentation should be submitted to BICR for independent review of progression. Tumor assessment imaging should continue per protocol schedule and be submitted  to BICR until progression is confirmed  by [CONTACT_19377], 
regardless of the start of subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, if the PD is assessed as locoregional progression (i.e. still within the thorax) by [CONTACT_737], imaging must continue

RECIST 1.1). These images do not need to be submitted to BICR for review. 
Participants will be treated until Investigator -assessed disease progression, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, the Investigator’s decision to discontinue treatment, 
withdrawal of consent on further treatment,  lost to follow -up, BMS  decision  to terminate  the study, 
or completion  of required treatment  in the Maintenance Period. Additional assessments  may occur 
when the decision is made to discontinue treatment. 
In certain circumstances, participants with PD per RECIST  1.1, but with otherwise stable or 
improved performance and clinical status, may continue to be treated in the event  of a perceived 
benefit per Investigator; see Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_115160], each participant will be contact[CONTACT_104109]/her survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all contact.  
5.1.5 Follow Up Period  
Long- term follow-up should continue until withdrawal of consent,  death, or study termination  by 
[CONTACT_104110]- term follow -up will be as follows: 
Assessments  should continue as described  in Table  2-8. 
Safety  Follow  up: Participants  must be followed for safety  for at least [ADDRESS_115161] dose (± 7 days). If 
participant  delays treatment  and later discontinues treatment  > [ADDRESS_115162] treatment,  the 
Safety  Follow -up Visit 1 may be performed at time of discontinuation. Safety Follow -up Visit 2 
occurs approximately 100 days (± 7 days) from the last dose of study treatment. Both follow -up 
visits  should be conducted in person. If the participant discontinues study treatment  for a clinically 
significant  AE, the participant will be followed  until resolution  of the AE or the event is considered 
to be stable and/or chronic. 
Survival Follow Up : Post the Safety Follow up, all participants will be contact[CONTACT_104111] 3 months (± 14 days), by [CONTACT_765] (if due for tumor assessments) or phone contact [CONTACT_104112]’s discretion.

This study will evaluate the potential for CCRT  + nivolumab followed by [CONTACT_104078]/without 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103985], locally advanced Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC NSCLC. Participants will be enrolled if their NSCLC is amenable to treatment with definitive CCRT.

 (18-month  PFS rate of 44.2%), and only 57% of patients  were  alive  at 3 years.4,12 Updated analyses 
at 48 months further observed a decrease in PFS and OS with an estimated rate of 35.3% and 
49.6%, respectively.[ADDRESS_115172] on the tumor microenvironment.32 Consistently, radiotherapy led to PD -L1 
upregulation in tumor cells which was observed in a mouse model, as well as in patients.5,33 This 
upregulation of PD-L1 was mediated  by [CONTACT_104114]8+  T cell blockade of 
PD-1/PD -L1, which  enhanced the efficacy  of radiotherapy.  
Similarly, chemotherapy may modulate the tumor/immune system interaction in favor of the 
immune system. Chemotherapy can result in tumor cell death with a resultant increase in tumor antigen delivery to antigen- presenting cells. Tumor cell death may also lead to a reduction in 
soluble and membrane -bound factors inhibiting tumor- infiltrating  T-cells.  Chemotherapy may also 
disrupt immune system regulatory networks by [CONTACT_104115] T -regulatory cells. 
Consistently, chemotherapy may induce PD -L1 expression, which relates to cancer 
immunoresistance.
34 
Taken together, combining PD -1/PD -L1 blockade with chemoradiation has the potential to 
orchestrate multi- dimensional anti -tumor activities and maintain a pro -immunogenic tumor 
microenvironment, to improve clinical outcomes in untreated stage III NSCLC.

of immunotherapy. Recently, an anecdotal case of a durable complete abscopal response to 
palliative  radiotherapy and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103986] a patient with metastatic  NSCLC was reported.36 Similar  
clinical findings continue to accumulate in NSCLC and other tumor types.  37 Data from a 
prospective phase 2 trial to evaluate radiotherapy and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103987]- refractory metastatic 
NSCLC indicate an ORR of 18% (7/39) with 2 CR, in addition, 5 patients had SD, leading to a 
DCR  of 31%. At median  follow-up of 43 months,  median  OS was 7.4 months for the entire  cohort,

 whereas it was 20.4 months for participants who achieved disease control.38 Thus, incorporating

blockade closer to CCRT may be beneficial.  
In a mouse model, different combination schedules were assessed. It was observed that initiating 
PD-1/PD -L1 blockade during radiotherapy lead to longer survival times,  whereas starting 
PD-1/PD -L1 blockade 7 days after  the completion  of radiotherapy  yielded similar  survival  results 
when compared with radiotherapy alone.5 This might be due to an acute increase in PD -L1 
expression on  tumor cells  during radiotherapy; ineffective  PD-1/PD -L1 blockade when  given in a 
delayed manner might be explained by [CONTACT_104093]- reactive CD8+ cells.  
Safety and tolerability may be of concern when further intensifying CCRT by [CONTACT_104116]. Data from the phase [ADDRESS_115176] of care. Therefore, a 1- year maintenance 
duration is opted for in all study arms in the CA20973L trial. Nivolumab (with or without ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125])  will be administered  for a duration of up to [ADDRESS_115177] common regimens

 In the PROCLAIM trial in which pemetrexed/cisplatin was compared with  etoposide/cisplatin in 
the context of concurrent chemoradiation, pemetrexed/cisplatin  failed  to show an  improvement in 
OS; however, high grade drug related  toxicities  were  less with pemetrexed/cisplatin.10 In addition, 
the ongoing phase 2 NICOLAS trial suggested that nivolumab given concurrently with CCRT 
containing cisplatin/etoposide, cisplatin/vinorelbine,  or cisplatin/pemetrexed was well tolerated.6 
A phase 2 trial combining atezolizumab concurrently with chemoradiation with carboplatin/paclitaxel  as the chemotherapy component in locally  advanced  NSCLC also suggested 
that PD -L1 blockade given concurrently with chemoradiation was feasible and safe.
7 Similar 
findings were also obtained from a phase 2 trial with pembrolizumab given concurrently with chemoradiation using carboplatin/paclitaxel  (Cohort A) or cisplatin/pemetrexed  (Cohort B) as the 
chemotherapy component ( Section  3.2.4).
29 Therefore, cisplatin/etoposide,  carboplatin/paclitaxel, 
and cisplatin/pemetrexed have been selected as concurrent chemotherapy options for the 
CA20973L trial. 
Chemotherapy is generally  given in 2 to 4 cycles and up to 3 cycles in the phase 2 NICOLAS  trial. 
In the CA20973L trial, systemic therapy (chemotherapy ± nivolumab)  will start at Cycle 1 in the 
CCRT Period and be administered for up to 3 cycles (Cycles 1 to 3). Radiotherapy will start at 
Cycle  2 and be administered  for Cycles 2 to 3. However,  if radiotherapy  planning is complete  prior 
to the initiation of systemic treatment at Cycle 1 of the CCRT period (Arms A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle 1 of  systemic therapy  alone, and initiate treatment with 
radiotherapy  concurrently with systemic therapy (Cycle 2). All study  procedures for Cycle 2 and 
Cycle  3 during the CCRT  period are still to  be followed.  There is no clinical evidence supporting  
further consolidation therapy, 
41 and as such, an additional cycle of consolidation systemic 
anticancer therapy will not be administered after the completion of radiotherapy if Cycle 1 is 
skipped.  
5.4.7 Rationale for Open- Label Design  
Immune related toxicities require early recognition and prompt intervention with special management algorithms.  Furthermore,  PFS and other key tumor response- based  endpoints will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_104117]. Therefore, an open -label design is not 
expected to introduce bias in this trial. 
5.5 Justification for Dose  
5.5.1 Justification for Dosing Regimen of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab monotherapy was originally  approved as a body-weight based  dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W, 
and was updated to 240 mg Q2W  or 480 mg Q4W  in multiple  indications.
42,43 Nivolumab  360 mg 
Q3W is also under evaluation in monotherapy and in combination therapy studies. Less frequent 
360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W dosing regimens can reduce the burden to patients of frequent, 
lengthy IV treatments and allow combination of nivolumab with other agents using alternative 
dosing regimens. 
The benefit -risk profiles of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, 360 mg Q3W, and 480 mg Q4W are 
predicted  to be comparable to 3 mg/kg Q2W.  This assessment  is based  on a comprehensive

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 characterization of nivolumab PK, safety, efficacy, and exposure -response relationships across 
indications. Population PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no clinically  meaningful differences 
in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model, the exposures following  administration  of several  dosing regimens of nivolumab administered  as a flat dose were 
simulated,  including 240 mg Q2W,  360 mg Q3W,  and 480 mg Q4W.  The simulated  average serum 
concentration at steady state following administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W  are predicted  to be similar to those following  administration  of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W  and 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administered to patients over a wide body weight range (34- 180 kg) 
across tumor types.  
Extensive exposure -response (E -R) analyses of multiple PK measures (maximum serum 
concentration at Day 1, average serum concentration at Day 28 [Cavg28], and trough serum concentration  at Day 28)  and efficacy  and safety  endpoints indicated  that the efficacy  of the 
flat-dose 480 mg IV regimen are similar to that of 3 mg/kg Q2W IV regimen. In E -R efficacy 
analyses for OS and ORR conducted in melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC using Cavg28 as the exposure measure, probabilities of achieving a response and survival probabilities at 1 year and 
2 years for IV 480 mg Q4W were similar to that of IV 3 mg/kg Q2W. In E -R safety  analyses, it 
was demonstrated that the exposure margins for safety are maintained following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, and the predicted risks of discontinuations due to AEs or death, AE Grade ≥ 3, and immune -mediated  AEs (IMAEs)  Grade  ≥ 2 are similar  following nivolumab  480 mg Q4W relative 
to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W across tumor types. In addition, nivolumab exposures with 240 mg Q2W,  360 mg Q3W, and 480 mg Q4W flat -dose IV regimens across tumor types are maintained 
well below the corresponding exposures observed with the well-tolerated  10 mg/kg IV nivolumab 
Q2W dose regimen. 
5.5.2 Justification for Dosing Regimen of  Nivolumab plus Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103989] 2 CA209568 study had a safety lead -in phase which evaluated the safe dosing level of 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103990] -based doublet chemotherapy, which is applied in the 
CA2099LA treatment arm. In CA209568, participants received  nivolumab 360 mg every  3 weeks 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg  every  6 weeks combined with 2 cycles of platinum -based  chemotherapy, 
followed by [CONTACT_20382] 360 mg every 3 weeks and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The safety  lead-in phase  of CA209568 treated  36 participants  with a minimum follow-up of 
11 weeks (longest follow -up of  9 months, median follow -up of  4.7 months). There was 1 case of 
dose limiting toxicities  (DLTs)  as defined by [CONTACT_104118]. No safety  concerns were 
observed with ongoing monitoring (DBL: July, 2018). In August 2017, the independent DMC 
recommended  to initiate  CA2099LA based  of the evaluation of safety  data from study CA209568, 
where the same dosing regimen was investigated.  
Moreover, and in addition to the regular monitoring of the CA2099LA study, the independent 
D
MC had an early review of the safety data after [ADDRESS_115180] 9 weeks of follow -

no modification. As of March 2019, 361 patients were randomized in the nivolumab plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103991] (with 2 cycles of histology -based platinum doublet chemotherapy) in 
the CA2099LA study. 
In CA209568 and CA2099LA trials, nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg 
every 6 weeks combined with  2 cycles of  platinum- based chemotherapy, which was followed by 
[CONTACT_20382] 360 mg every 3 weeks and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, has been tolerated. 
Therefore, the CA20973L study using this same IO combination (nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg Q6W)  without chemotherapy should have a less toxic  profile  and thus should 
be tolerated. Additionally, safety will be regularly monitored by [CONTACT_104119]20973L trial.

Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of the study 
participants and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that participants fully 
meet all eligibility criteria.  
6.3 Lifestyle Restrictions  
During the CCRT Period, esophageal complaints are common with combined modality therapy. Esophagitis does not constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or chemotherapy provided oral intake is sufficient to maintain hydration. Participants should be advised to avoid alcoholic, acidic, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_103995]. 
6.4 Screen Failures  
Screen  failures  are defined  as participants  who  consent to  participate  in the clinical study but who 
are not subsequently randomized in the study/included in the analysis population. A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs.  
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening Period  
Participant Re -enrollment: This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has 
discontinued the study as a pre- treatment  failure  (ie, participant  has not been  randomized / has not 
been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be re -consented and assigned a new participant 
number from IRT.  
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening Period will be permitted (in addition to any  parameters that require a confirmatory value).  
The most current result prior to Randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the participant’s most current clinical state.

 Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2 -1 Screening Procedural 
Outline may be repeated in an effort  to find all possible well -qualified participants. Consultation 
with the Medical Monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular 
parameter is clinically relevant.  
Testing  for asymptomatic  SARS -CoV-2 infection,  for example  by [CONTACT_104122]  (RT) -PCR 
or viral  antigen is not required. However, some participants may develop suspected or confirmed 
symptomatic SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_115208] asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 
infection during the screening period. In such cases, participants may be considered eligible for the study after meeting  all inclusion/exclusion criteria  related  to active  infection, and after meeting 
the following criteria:  
• At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical  illness)  have passed  since symptoms first appeared 
or positive RT -PCR or viral antigen test result, and  
• At least [ADDRESS_115209] fever without the use of fever-reducing medications, 
and 
• Acute  symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath)  have resolved  and 
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871],  there  are no COVID-19- related  sequelae  that may place the 
participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment, and  
• Negative follow -up SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_115210] based on institutional, local,

7 TREATMENT  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study randomization or treatment allocation. 
Study  treatment  includes   both   Investigational   [Medicinal]  Product   (IP/IMP)  and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non -IMP) and can consist of the following: 
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceutical  form of an active substance or placebo being tested  or used as a reference 
in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.

alone if RT planning is completed prior to the first dose of therapy at Cycle 1. While etoposide/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin are applicable to any histology, participants with tumor of  non-squamous histology have an additional  option which  is pemetrexed/cisplatin. In the 
case cisplatin  cannot be given (eg, poor tolerability),  carboplatin can replace cisplatin.  The reasons 
must be recorded in the eCRF  and medical  record. In the case pemetrexed  cannot be given 
(eg, poor tolerability), etoposide can replace pemetrexed. The reasons must be recorded in the eCRF and medical record.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Dosing  
Each  cycle of paclitaxel  + carboplatin will last for 3 weeks.  Treatment  with paclitaxel  and

• Cycle  2 and Cycle  3; Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15: carboplatin  AUC 2 + paclitaxel  45 or 50 mg/m2 
 
Days  8 and 15 may be interrupted,  delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the participant 
tolerates the  treatment and per investigator’s discretion. The carboplatin dose must be calculated 
according to Calvert formula. When calculating creatinine clearance (CrCl), the formula of

creatinine clearance (CrCl), the formula of Cockcroft -Gault should be used or per local standard.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication 
Antiemetic premedication will be administered according to local standards. Recommended antiemetic  treatments  are dexamethasone (dosing according  to local  standards; an equivalent dose 
of another corticosteroid may be substituted) and a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist (type per 
investigator discretion and local standards -of-care). Additional use of antiemetic premedications 
may be employed at the discretion  of the Investigator. Doses of chemotherapy may be interrupted, 
delayed, reduced, or discontinued depending on how well the participant tolerates the treatment. See the following sections for more details: Section 7.4  (dose delays) and Section 8 (dose 
discontinuations).  
Pre- and post -hydration for cisplatin should be administered per institutional protocol or per the 
following recommendation: Pre -treatment hydration of 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused IV prior to 
cisplatin  infusion; Adequate hydration and urinary  output must  be maintained  for at least [ADDRESS_115232]. 
7.1.5 Radiotherapy Planning and Delivery  
Each  participant will receive  thoracic  radiotherapy  in form of IMRT,  VMAT,  or 3DRT.  Irradiation 
commences on D1 of Cycle 2 of systemic anticancer therapy (chemotherapy ± nivolumab) and 
will be delivered  5 days per week  in once daily  fraction,  2 Gy per fraction,  to a target  dose of 60-66 
Gy in 30-33 fractions. 
If radiotherapy  planning is complete prior to the initiation  of systemic anticancer  therapy  at Cycle  1 
of the CCRT  period (Arms  A, B, or C), the investigator has the option to skip Cycle  1 of systemic 
anticancer therapy alone, and initiate treatment with radiotherapy concurrently with systemic 
anticancer  therapy  (Cycle  2). All study procedures for Cycle  [ADDRESS_115233]  be delayed  due to toxicity  (for 
participants  who start systemic treatment  at Cycle  1), radiotherapy  should start ± 3 days of start of 
systemic anticancer therapy in Cycle 2. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if chemoradiation is delayed for administrative  reasons (eg, holidays), provided the full planned dose 
of radiotherapy is delivered. More detailed  radiotherapy  requirements  can be found in the Thoracic 
Radiotherapy Guidelines, and QA & QC processes are subject to the CA20973L Radiotherapy Manual.

 will not be reassigned. An IRT will be employed to manage participant randomization. The 
investigator or designee will register the participant for enrollment by [CONTACT_104126]. The following information is required for enrollment: 
• Date that informed consent was obtained  
• Year  of birth 
• Gender at birth  
 
Once  enrolled  in IRT, enrolled participants  who have met all eligibility  criteria  will be ready  to be 
randomized through the IRT. Refer  to the IRT  manual for the information  required  for participant 
randomization. Please note that prior to randomization, the planned chemotherapy regimen, the planned number of cycles of chemotherapy (up to 2 cycles or up to 3 cycles), the planned dose 
level  of chemotherapy at the start  of treatment for agents with more  than  1 possible dose  level  per 
protocol (eg, carboplatin, paclitaxel), and the radiation modality must be pre -defined and 
documented in the IRT and medical records by [CONTACT_093]. Please note that if the actual 
treatment regimen administered to the participant during the CCRT Period changes from the planned regimen  documented in  the IRT prior  to randomization, the rationale  for the change must 
be recorded in the CRF and documented in the medical record. 
Participants meeting all  eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 treatment arms 
and stratified  by [CONTACT_654], PD-L1 status,  and stage (per AJCC staging system,  8th edition) as described 
below:  
• Age: 
− <65 years old  at time of randomization  
− ≥65 years old at time of randomization  
• Tumor PD-L1 status (from  IRT):  
− ≥1% 
− <1% 
− Indeterminate  or not evaluable  
• Stage  (per AJCC 8th edition) : 
− Stage  IIIA  
− Stage  IIIB 
− Stage  IIIC 
 
The randomization procedures will be carried  out via permuted  blocks within  each stratum,  defined 
by [CONTACT_104127], PD -L1 status, and AJCC Stage at Screening. The exact procedures for 
using the IRT will be detailed in the IRT manual.

Nivolumab administration  should be delayed  for the following: 
• Grade  2 non-skin, drug- related  AE, with the exception of fatigue  
• Grade  [ADDRESS_115237],  ALT,  and/or total bilirubin  abnormalities  
• Grade  3 skin,  drug- related  AE 
• Grade  3 drug-related  laboratory  abnormality, with  the following exceptions:  
− Grade  3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic  amylase  or lipase does not require  dose delay  
− Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_115238],  ALT,  total bilirubin  will require dose discontinuation  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of nivolumab. 
 
Participants who require delay  of nivolumab should be re- evaluated  weekly  or more  frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when retreatment criteria are met.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria  to Resume Nivolumab  
Participants  may resume treatment with nivolumab when  the drug- related  AE(s)  resolve to 
Grade ≤  1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
• P articipants  may  resume  treatment in  the presence of Grade  2 fatigue

designee). Nivolumab therapy must be delayed until such time as this requirement is met. Please 
refer to Section 8.1.1 for special requirements for adrenal insufficiency.  
Protracted delay or discontinuation of nivolumab during the CCRT Period does not prevent 
participants from entering the Maintenance Period in Arm A or Arm B if: 
1) the delay  or discontinuation is not due to nivolumab- related  toxicities,  and 
2) eligibility  criteria  for initiation  of the Maintenance Period  are met. 
 
In addition, nivolumab may not be resumed  sooner than [ADDRESS_115242] both drugs (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]) delayed  until retreatment  criteria  are met.  Exceptions apply to the retreatment criteria

If weekly low dose chemotherapy cannot resume beyond 7 days, this dose should be skipped. If 
weekly dose cannot resume beyond 2 consecutive weeks, chemotherapy should be permanently discontinued. 
7.4.6 Radiotherapy Dose Modification  
In principle,  radiotherapy  should continue with ≤ Grade  3 non-hematological toxicities  and should 
be held for Grade  4 non-hematological toxicities,  then resume when  toxicities  resolve to ≤ Grade  2. 
Holding radiotherapy for Grade  4 hematological  toxicities  other  than lymphopenia and leukopenia 
may be considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Esophagitis from Radiotherapy  
Esophageal complaints are common with combined modality therapy. Esophagitis does not 
constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or chemotherapy provided oral intake is sufficient  to maintain  hydration. Participants  should be advised to avoid alcoholic, acidic,  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_104029]. Viscous xylocaine, carafate, or other medications should be used for symptomatic relief. As the esophageal transit time is clearly prolonged with radiotherapy and reflux may occur, the use of PPIs or H2 antagonists is recommended.

period.  
2) In case of interruptions due  to machine breakdown or public holidays or any interruptions of 
therapy up to 7 days, radiation should be completed to the prescribed doses. Total number of 
fractions and elapsed days should be carefully reported 
3) In the case of Grade 3 esophagitis related to the concomitant treatment, chemotherapy  should 
be suspended if the investigator believes continued use will jeopardize the delivery  of full-dose 
radiotherapy; radiation is to be continued  
 
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator, or designee where permitted, to ensure that investigational 
product is only dispensed to study Participants. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by [CONTACT_20443].  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment should not be dispensed and contact [CONTACT_20445].

treatment will be administered in the clinic by [CONTACT_21724]. Drug accountability should be reviewed by [CONTACT_104133].  
7.7 Concomitant Therapy  
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited and/or restricted  during the study  (unless utilized  to treat 
a drug- related adverse event or as premedication):  
• Immunosuppressive agents  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids  (except  as stated  in Section  7.7.3)  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy other than specified as study treatments (ie, 
chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, extensive, non- palliative  radiation  therapy, 
or standard or investigational agents for treatment of NSCLC) 
• Any complementary medications (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) 
intended to treat the disease under study or provide supportive care. Use of marijuana and its 
derivatives for treatment of symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment are permitted if obtained by [CONTACT_102437] (even without a medical prescription) has been legalized locally  
• Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until [ADDRESS_115279] dose 
• Investigators should refer to the approved local  product labeling for the chemotherapy drugs 
for additional prohibited and restricted concomitant medications. After the first cycle of 
chemotherapy, prophylactic G -CSFs can be administered only to assist with hematologic 
recovery.  
 
7.7.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Any medications (prescription  and OTC),  vitamin  and mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken  by 
[CONTACT_104134],  including start and stop date,  dose and route of administration,  frequency, and indication. 
Medications taken for any procedure are encouraged to be included. 
COVID-19 vaccines that are NOT  live are allowed and should be handled in the same manner  as 
other vaccines. Administration may occur during the study. 
7.7.3 Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Participants are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses >  10 mg 
daily of prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted. 
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>  10 mg 
daily  prednisone equivalent)  or other immunosuppressive medications  within  14 days of

> 10 mg daily  prednisone equivalent, are permitted  in the absence of active autoimmune disease.  
7.7.4 Imaging Restriction and Precaution  
It is the local  imaging facility’s  responsibility to determine,  based  on participant  attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be considered  in this assessment.  Participants  with renal  insufficiency are to be assessed  as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast  and if so, which  contrast agent  and dose is appropriate. Specific 
to MRI,  participants  with severe renal  insufficiency  (ie, estimated  glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR)  
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic  systemic fibrosis and MRI contrast is 
contraindicated. In addition, participants  may be excluded from MRI  if they have tattoos,  metallic 
implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image acquisition manual. 
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. The ultimate 
decision to perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator, and standards set by [CONTACT_61857].  
7.8 Treatment  After  the End of the Study  
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS supplied study treatment to participants/investigators  unless BMS  chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study. 
BMS  reserves the right to terminate  access to BMS  supplied study treatment if any of the following 
occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; b) the development of study drug is 
terminated  for other reasons,  including, but  not limited  to, lack of efficacy  and/or not meeting  the 
study objectives; c) the participant  can obtain medication  from a government-sponsored or private 
health program. In all cases, BMS will follow local regulations.

discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant’s request to stop study treatment. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when  a participant  specifically  withdraws 
consent for any further contact  [CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously authorized  by [CONTACT_104135].  
• A
ny clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the

respectively.  
• Noncompliance of  the participant with protocol- mandated procedures based on the judgment 
and agreement of both the Investigator and Sponsor 
 
If a participant has not progressed following discontinuation of study treatment(s), every effort 
should be made to continue to obtain radiographic tumor assessments until BICR confirmed progression and Investigator -assessed distant metastases.  
A participant may also be withdrawn from investigational product/study by [CONTACT_1034], Regulatory Authorities, or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committees (IECs).  
Participants  may choose to discontinue the study at any time,  for any reason,  and without prejudice 
to further treatment.  
Refer  to Section  2: Schedule of Activities  for data which  must be collected  at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that can be completed. 
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately,  within  24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety).  
All participants  who discontinue study  treatment should comply with protocol specified  follow -up 
procedures as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_115283] -treatment study follow -up or loses the 
ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned  or involuntarily incarcerated  for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study treatment is  discontinued prior  to the participant’s  completion  of the study, the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical  records per local  regulatory 
requirements in each region/country  and entered  on the appropriate case report form  (eCRF)  page.

clinically indicated during such dosing delays. 
Nivolumab should be discontinued for  any adverse event, laboratory  abnormality, or intercurrent 
illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the 
participant with continued nivolumab dosing. 
NOTE: For participants in Arm A, during the Maintenance Period, receiving nivolumab in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately  from  the assessment  made for discontinuation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Although there  is overlap

If a participant meets criteria for discontinuation and the investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related to nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the participant should discontinue nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
8.1.3 Durvalumab Discontinuation Criteria  
The toxicity  management strategy  for durvalumab (see Section  7.4.3) may lead to discontinuation 
or resumption  of durvalumab upon clinical  outcomes.  See local  approved prescribing information 
for durvalumab. 8.1.4 Discontinuation Criteria  for Chemoradiotherapy  
As highlighted in dose modification  for chemotherapy (see Section  7.4.5) and chemoradiation  (see 
Section 7.4.6), despi[INVESTIGATOR_104034], if toxicities remain unmanageable, components in 
question should be discontinued. 
Specifically, one or both chemotherapy components should be discontinued for any of the 
following:  
• Grade  ≥3 drug- related  thrombocytopenia associated  with clinically  significant bleeding 
• Any drug- related grade 3/4 adverse event (eg, ANC, PLT) which recurs after two prior dose 
reductions for the same drug related adverse event requires discontinuation of the drug(s) 
which was/were previously dose reduced

discontinued and a switch  to carboplatin at AUC [ADDRESS_115299] discontinue cisplatin if the calculated creatinine 
clearance decreases to < 50 mL/min (based on the Cockcroft Gault formula). The other drug (pemetrexed) may be continued, and the platinum agent may, at the investigator’s discretion, 
be switched to carboplatin for the remainder of the platinum- based doublet cycles when the 
participant meets retreatment criteria. Carboplatin should be discontinued if CrCl <  20

2) Tolerance of study treatment  
3) Stable  performance  status 
4) Treatment  beyond progression will not delay  an imminent  intervention  to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
5) Participant  provides written  informed  consent prior to receiving additional maintenance 
treatment.  
6) Crossover between  study  treatments/arms  is not allowed.  
 
All other elements of the main consent including description of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options will still apply.  
A radiographic assessment/  scan should be performed  within  6 weeks of initial 
investigator- assessed  progression to determine  whether there  has been  a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD. The assessment  of clinical  benefit  should be balanced  by [CONTACT_104139] A, Arm B, and Arm C.  
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_43893], the participant should remain on the treatment and continue to receive monitoring according to Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).  
For the participants who continue study treatment beyond progression, further progression is defined as an additional  10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase 
from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further progression. 
New lesions  are considered measurable at the time  of initial progression if  the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have  a short axis of at least 
15 mm).  Any new lesion  considered non- measurable at the time of initial  progression may become 
measurable and therefore be included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have a short  axis of at least 15 mm). 
In situations  where  the relative  increase  in total tumor burden by 10% is solely  due to inclusion of 
new lesions  which become measurable,  these new lesions must  demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least [ADDRESS_115302]  continue

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and timing  are summarized  in Section  2: Schedule of Activities.  
• Protocol waivers  or exemptions are not allowed.  
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements,  including those specified in Section 2: Schedule 
of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet  all eligibility  criteria  before randomization.  The investigator will maintain  a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm  eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical management  (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
 
Additional measures, including non- study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply  with local  regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver  enzyme  evaluations)  will be monitored  during the follow- up phase via on- site/local 
labs until all study treatment- related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible.  
If a participant shows pulmonary -related signs (hypoxia, abnormal heart rate or changes from 
baseline) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]) consistent with 
possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity management algorithm in the 
BMS -936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure (and in Appendix 6).

Prior to scanning the first participant sites should be qualified and understand the image acquisition guidelines and submission process as outlined in the CA20973L Imaging Manual provided by [CONTACT_11343]. Screening and on study images should be acquired as outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).  
Collect any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or progression (including scans performed  at unscheduled time points and/or at an outside institution) for RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_115309]/MRI, should be submitted to central imaging vendor. Otherwise, x -rays and bone scans do not need to be submitted centrally. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Measurement  
Contrast- enhanced  CT of the chest,  CT/MRI  of the abdomen, and all other  known and/or suspected 
sites of  disease  should be performed for tumor assessments.  Images should be acquired  with  slice 
thickness of 5 mm or less with  no intervening gap  (contiguous). Every  attempt should  be made to 
image  each participant  using  an identical  acquisition protocol on the same  scanner  for all imaging 
time points. Tumor measurements  should be made  by [CONTACT_104144]. Change in tumor measurements and tumor response to guide ongoing study treatment decisions will be assessed by [CONTACT_104145] 1.[ADDRESS_115310] -enhanced MRI of the abdomen, and other known/suspected sites of disease 
should be obtained. 
Should a participant have contraindication for both MRI and CT intravenous contrasts, a non- 
contrast CT of the chest  and a non- contrast  MRI  of the abdomen, and other known/suspected sites 
of disease should be obtained. 
Should a participant have contraindication for MRI (eg, incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindication to CT intravenous contrast, a non- contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.

(without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is contraindicated or based on Investigator 
discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Assessment  and Imaging  
Tumor assessments should continue at the same frequency even if dosing is delayed or discontinued. Changes in  tumor measurements  and tumor responses will be  assessed  by [CONTACT_104146]  1.1 criteria.  Investigators will report the number and size of new lesions 
that appear while on study. The time point of tumor assessments will be reported on the eCRF based  on the investigator’s  assessment  using RECIST  1.1 criteria  (see Appendix [ADDRESS_115313] 1.1 criteria to be utilized in this study). Specific to this study, lesions that received irradiation  during the CCRT  Period  and remain  measurable,  continue to be considered  measurable. 
Assessments  of PR and CR must be confirmed  at least 4 weeks (28 days) after initial response.  A 
best overall response of SD requires a minimum of [ADDRESS_115314] 1.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BICR Confirmation of Progression or Recurrence  
Sites should submit all scans to the central imaging vendor on a rolling basis, throughout the 
duration of the study until PD is confirmed by [CONTACT_53923]. BICR of scans will occur on a rolling basis, blinded to treatment arm, clinical data, and investigator assessment of submitted scans. When  progression per RECIST  1.1 criteria  is assessed  by [CONTACT_093], the site will inform the 
central  imaging vendor, in order for BICR assessment of progression to be performed. The BICR 
review will be completed and the results provided to the site as specified in the imaging vendor documents, provided there  are no pending imaging  queries to the site. All details  on the timelines 
and associated process requirements will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.

BICR until progression has been  confirmed  by [CONTACT_19377].  If the planned start of subsequent anticancer 
therapy is sooner than the time of next scheduled tumor assessment, every  effort should be made 
to repeat tumor imaging prior to initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy unless clinically infeasible.

Participants will be asked to complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung Cancer (FACT -L) Module, the Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer – Symptom Assessment 
Questionnaire (NSCLC -SAQ), 5 -level version of the EuroQol Group’s EQ -5D (EQ -5D- 5L) and 
the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI- S). 
The NSCLC -SAQ,  PGI-S, FACT -L, and EQ -5D-5L will be administered  via an  electronic  device 
during specified clinic visits, and will be completed prior to any other assessments or study procedures when they are being administered during study visits. In addition, the PRO measures 
will be completed at designated time points during the long -term Follow -up Period and entered 
into the CRF. If exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of measures using planned modalities, then alternate administration methods may be required, after consultation with Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. 
Section  2 (Schedule of  Activities) provides information  regarding  the timing  of PRO assessments 
during the CCRT  Period, Recovery  Period, Maintenance Period,  and during the long- term Follow-

administered) will be used to calculate the LCS, which will be used to assess disease- specific 
symptom severity.  
A total FACT -G score is calculated by [CONTACT_104149] -being (PWB), social/family 
well-being (SWB), emotional well -being (EWB), and functional well -being (FWB) subscale 
scores. A  total FACT -L score is obtained by [CONTACT_104150] -G score with the LCS,  thereby 
[CONTACT_104151] -G with  lung cancer –specific QOL  information.  The FACT -L also contains 
the GP5 item from the FACT -G, which is used to assess the bother associated  with the side effects 
of treatment. Each of the items is scored on a five -point scale from  zero (Not at all) to four (Very 
much). Higher  scores indicate greater  quality of life. The FACT -L uses a recall  period of “the past 
7 days.” 
The FACT -L will be administered per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Small  Cell Lung Cancer  Symptom  Assessment  Questionnaire 
(NSCLC -SAQ)  
The NSCLC -SAQ is a 7-item PRO measure intended  for use in advanced  NSCLC clinical  trials  to 
support medical  product labelling.45 The NSCLC -SAQ uses a 7-day recall  period and verbal rating 
scales. It was developed in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s PRO 
Guidance and scientific best practices, and the resulting qualitative interview data provide 
evidence of content validity. The NSCLC -SAQ total score measures overall severity of the 
following NSCLC symptoms: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue,  and appetite. The NSCLC -SAQ has 
been qualified for exploratory use to measure symptoms of non- small cell lung cancer in drug 
development programs. Further evaluation is needed on the instrument’s longitudinal 
measurement properties and the interpretation of clinically meaningful within -patient change in 
score.  After  the NSCLC- SAQ’s  longitudinal measurement  properties and the interpretation  of 
clinically meaningful within -patient change have been evaluated, the NSCLC- SAQ  total score is 
intended to support labeling claims related to change in overall symptoms of  NSCLC. Data from 
this study will help to interpret the psychometric properties and threshold  for clinically  meaningful 
within -patient change in the NSCLC -SAQ total  score within locally  advanced untreated NSCLC 
participants.  
The NSCLC -SAQ will be administered  per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L46 is a standardized instrument used to measure self -reports of health status and

[IP_ADDRESS] Patient  Global  Impression of Severity (PGI- S) 
PGI-S will be included as an additional exploratory endpoint. The PGI -S is a single item that 
assesses participant’s perceptions of  overall severity  of cancer symptoms for the last 7 days with 
response options ranging from “none” to  “very  severe.” Data  collected  via the PGI -S will be used 
as an anchor measure to assess the psychometric measurement properties and the threshold for 
meaningful change for the NSCLC- SAQ.  
The PGI-S will be administered  per Section  2 (Schedule of Activities).  
9.2 Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or serious adverse  event (SAE)  can be found in Appendix 3 . 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally acceptable representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet  the definition  of an AE or SAE  and remain  responsible for following up 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting  are specified  in Appendix  3.

consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module. 
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported  to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the sponsor or designee within  [ADDRESS_115326]  SAEs for 
30 days from the date of randomization. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE  and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by [CONTACT_53996], when appropriate for the program or protocol. 
Every AE must be assessed by [CONTACT_104152] - 
mediated. For events which are potentially immune -mediated, additional information will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.  
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (see Appendix 3). 
• Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. 
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
 
After the  initial AE/SAE  report,  the investigator is required to  proactively follow  each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in

9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_104153] a product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics 
committees according to local applicable laws including Regulation EU No. 536/2014 and FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_115329] immediately notify the BMS 
Medical  Monitor/designee of this event  and complete  and forward  a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS  Designee within  [ADDRESS_115330]  follow  the 
same transmission timing and processes to BMS as those used for SAEs, in accordance with reporting procedures described in Appendix 3. 
If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment, or re -initiation of study treatment, a discussion between the investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has ended, 
confirmed  by [CONTACT_104154], treatment may be resumed (at least 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of participant/sponsor/IRB/EC, as applicable. 
Follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partner,  the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of  this information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
In cases where a study treatment can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially cause fetal toxicity,  and if any sexual activity  (eg, vaginal, anal,  oral) has occurred

 between  a male  participant and a pregnant WOCBP  partner(s),  the information  should be reported 
to the Sponsor or designee,  even  if the male  participant  has undergone a successful  vasectomy.  In 
order for Sponsor or designee to collect  any pregnancy surveillance information from  the female 
partner, the female partner(s) must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this 
information. Information  on the pregnancy  will be collected  on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

• Any laboratory test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets the definition  of an SAE 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy  
 
It is expected  that wherever possible,  the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
9.2.7 Potential  Drug  Induced Liver  Injury (DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of  a potential  drug induced liver injury (DILI) event.  All occurrences 
of potential DILIs meeting the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 and 
Appendix 3 for reporting details). A potential DILI is defined as:  
1) Aminotransaminases  (ALT  or AST)  elevation  > 3 times  upper limit  of normal (ULN), 
AND 
2) Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_115333],  without initial findings  of cholestasis (elevated  serum  alkaline 
phosphatase), 
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

10 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size is determined  based  on the primary  endpoint of  PFS between  Arm A and Arm C. 
A total of 888 participants are planned to be randomized across the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 
ratio.  
If the PFS comparison between  Arm A and Arm C is statistically  significant,  then 0.05 alpha will 
be passed  to the OS comparison between  Arm A vs Arm C, followed  by [CONTACT_104158] B vs Arm C. All  tests will be 2-sided. Figure  10.1- 1 graphically presents the planned testing 
procedure.  
Figure  10.1- 1: Testing  Procedure for Primary  and Key Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Abbreviations:  OS, overall  survival;  PFS, progression -free survival. 
Note: Arms A, B, and C are described in Section 5.1. 
 
UPDATE: Due to the Ukraine -Russia conflict, the Sponsor made the decision to discontinue 
clinical trials in Russia by [CONTACT_104159] 2022 as a result of increased logistical challenges of 
ensuring continuity of care for study participants.  The study team  performed  an assessment  of data 
quality and concluded that data collected among Russian participants (30 randomized) appeared adequate for inclusion in the primary analysis, though many participants would not be able to receive the full course of their randomized intervention and would have short follow -up. A 
sensitivity analysis for exclusion of all Russian participants is planned. Consequentially, enrollment was permitted to continue slightly beyond the original target of 888 randomized participants  to account for potential data and statistical  power loss in Russian  sites and, ultimately, 
925 participants were randomized.

Arm A and Arm C, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_104043] a 3-month delay  period was assumed.  
 
A total of  (ie, progression events or deaths) in Arms A and C will provide 
approximately 82% power considering the above PFS assumptions with 0.05 2- sided  alpha. Two 
will be based on the actual number of PFS events at the time of the analysis using Lan- DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. 
 
  
 
However, the PFS analyses are driven by [CONTACT_104160], and the actual  analysis time will depend on actual  enrollment speed  and events 
accrual and may be different from projections.

Primary  analyses  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Progression- 
free Survival 
(per BICR) 
A vs C  Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and 
the first date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1, as determined by [CONTACT_19377], or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first, regardless of receipt of subsequent anti -cancer 
therapy prior to the documented progression as confirmed by [CONTACT_19377]. Participants who die without a reported  progression will be considered  to have  progressed  on the date of their death. 
Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable 
tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not 
die will be censored on their date of randomization. First on -study scans are expected only 
after completion of CCRT (ie, last dose of radiotherapy) during approximately the Week 3 Recovery Period check. Following that, tumor assessments are scheduled to be performed at week 24 (±7 days) from the date of randomization, then every 12 weeks (±7 days) for 36 
months (from date of randomization), then every 24 weeks (±7 days) after [ADDRESS_115363] stratified by 3 stratification factors (age, PD -L1 status, and stage) will be used 
to compare PFS between Arm A and Arm C at 0.[ADDRESS_115364]  ratio and corresponding  95% CI. The Kaplan -Meier  method  will be used 
to further summarize PFS, including PFS curves, medians with corresponding 95% CIs. The PFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, etc months will also be estimated depending on minimum follow -up 
duration.  
Secondary/Exploratory  analyses  
 
Overall 
Survival  
A vs C Overall  survival (OS) is defined  as the time between  the date of randomization  and the date of 
death due to any cause. OS will be censored on the last date a participant was known to be alive. OS will be followed continuously while participants are on the study treatment and  
every  [ADDRESS_115365]  after participants  discontinue  the study 
treatment.  
B vs C OS will be analyzed  using  similar  method  as PFS. 
A vs B OS in A vs C, B vs C will be tested  following  the hypothesis  testing  procedure  described  in 
Section 10.1. No hypothesis testing will be performed for A vs B.

Objective 
Response Rate 
(ORR) per 
BICR  
A vs C 
B vs C 
A vs B Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of participants with a confirmed 
BOR of CR or PR divided by [CONTACT_104163]. 
BOR is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the date of randomization 
and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_115367] 1.1 defined progression.  
An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using a Cochran -Mantel 
Haenszel  (CMH) methodology  stratified  by [CONTACT_941] 3 stratification  factors  (age,  PD-L1 status,  and 
stage). The ORR difference between the 2 treatment arms with its 95% CI will be reported.  
The ORR  and its corresponding  95% exact  CI will also be calculated  by [CONTACT_94532] -Pearson 
method for each randomized arm.  
 
 
 
 
Time to 
Response and 
Duration of 
Response (per 
BICR)  Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the first objective documentation of PR or better assessed per BICR. Time to response is restricted to 
the population  of participants  who achieved  a best response  of PR or better  assessed per BICR.  
Duration of objective response (DoR) is defined as the time between the date of first 
confirmed response to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1) 
per BICR assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who 
neither  progress  nor die will be censored  on the date of their last evaluable tumor  assessment. 
Participants who started any subsequent anticancer therapy without a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to or on the date of 
initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. DoR will be evaluated for responders (ie, participants with confirmed CR or PR) only as assessed by [CONTACT_19377].  
The Kaplan -Meier  method  will be used to further summarize  DOR, including DOR  curves, 
medians with corresponding 95% CIs.

DoR,  TTR per 
Investigator 
assessment of

ORR,  PFS, DOR,  TTR assessed  by [CONTACT_104164]  1.1 will be analyzed  similarly  to 
these endpoints assessed by [CONTACT_19377]. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
 
 
 
Time  to death 
or distant 
metastases 
(TTDM)  TTDM is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of distant metastasis or death in the absence of distant metastasis. Distant metastasis is defined as any new lesion  that is outside  of the thorax (except  for heart)  according  to RECIST  1.1, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_737]. Participants who have not developed distant metastasis or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last  
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_115368]  baseline 
data they  will be censored at Day 1 unless they die within 2 visits of baseline.  
TTDM will be analyzed  similarly  as primary  time-to-event  endpoints  as PFS, OS. No 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  
 
PFS on Next 
Line Therapy 
(PFS- 2) PFS on next -line therapy (PFS -2) is defined as the time from randomization to objectively 
documented progression,  per investigator  assessment,  after the next line of therapy or to death 
from any  cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who were alive and without progression 
after the next line of therapy will be censored at last known alive date.  
PFS-2 will be analyzed  similarly  as primary  time-to-event  endpoints  as PFS, OS. No 
hypothesis testing will be performed.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 03 
Date: [ADDRESS_115402]: 
• Provide a copy of the consent form and written  information  about the study in the language in 
which  the participant is most proficient  prior to clinical  study participation.  The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent signed and personally dated  by [CONTACT_104168]'s 
legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_52223].  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_104053],  prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and  the participant subsequently becomes capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent during the study, consent must  additionally be obtained from the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the participant’s signed 
ICF and, in the US, the participant’s signed HIPAA Authorization. 
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
Participants unable to give their written consent (e.g., stroke or participants with or severe 
dementia)  may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally  acceptable representative. 
The participant must also be informed  about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with 
his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she should personally 
sign and date the consent form  as soon  as possible. The explicit  wish  of a participant  who is unable 
to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_104054], or to be withdrawn  from,  the clinical study at any time should 
be considered by [CONTACT_093]. 
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study participants are the most important considerations

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition in a clinical  investigation participant administered  study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom, or disease temporally  associated  with the use of study  treatment,  whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements),  including  those that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of  the investigator.  Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available.  Once  the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing  condition including either an  increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected  or diagnosed after study intervention  administration  even  though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  overdose  of either  study intervention 
or a concomitant  medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported by [CONTACT_093]), 
should not be reported  as an AE/SAE  unless it is an intentional overdose taken  with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of  sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term 
Events NOT Meeting  the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which  an untoward medical  occurrence did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE 
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused  death  if it were 
more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104057]  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104058]:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
• admission  encountered for  another life  circumstance that carries  no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy in the absence of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical  event(s) that may not  be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious  outcomes listed  in the definition  above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.)

 Pregnancy and potential  drug induced liver injury (DILI) must  follow  the same transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).  
Any component of a study  endpoint that is  considered related  to study therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
EVALUATING  AES AND SAES 
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study intervention and  each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors,  as well as the temporal  relationship of the event to study intervention  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information  to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However,  it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality  assessment is one of  the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required.  (Note: Follow- 
up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new 
information  becomes available,  the SAE  report must be updated and submitted  within  24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs  must be followed  to resolution or stabilization.

 REPORTING  OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE 
 
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  Report Form.

 APPENDIX 4  WOMEN  OF CHILDBEARING  POTENTIAL  DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing  Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_115415] a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.  
 
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR  FEMALE  PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL  
One of the highly effective  methods of contraception listed  below is required  during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as [ADDRESS_115416] label requirements for individual chemotherapy agents, 
whichever is longer.*

Highly  Effective  Methods  That Are User Independent  
• Implantable  progestogen -only hormonal  contraception  associated  with inhibition  of 
ovulation b  
• Intrauterine  hormone- releasing  system  (IUS)c  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c  
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male  sexual  partner of the WOCBP  and the absence of sperm  has been  confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual  abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual  intercourse during the entire  period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate  methods of highly effective contraception  must be discussed  in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES:  
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_104059]. Use should be consistent 
with local  regulations  regarding  the use of contraceptive  methods  for participants  participating  in clinical  studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive  method.  Hormonal contraception  is permissible  only when  there  is sufficient  evidence  that 
the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result  in increased  exposures  that could be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative  methods 
of contraception should be utilized.  
c Intrauterine  devices  and intrauterine  hormone  releasing  systems  are acceptable methods  of contraception  in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

 APPENDIX 7  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH  BMS MODIFICATIONS 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS  
Solid tumors will be evaluated using R esp onse Evaluation C riteria In Solid T umors version 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1) guideline with BMS modifications.1 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
1.1 Measurable  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_115435]/MRI  scan  (scan  slice  thickness no greater  than 5 mm),  or ≥2x slice  thickness if 
greater than 5mm.  
Malignant lymph  nodes:  To be considered  pathologically enlarged and measurable,  a lymph node 
must be ≥ [ADDRESS_115436]/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified  as target lesions must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
≥ [ADDRESS_115437]/MRI  scan.  Only  the short axis of  these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_70188]. Nodal  size is normally  reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). The smaller  of these measures is the short  axis. For 
example,  an abdominal node which  is reported  as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies  as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥  10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
Note:  Lesions on X- Ray are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
1.2 Non-Measurable  
All other lesions are considered non-measurable,  including small lesions (longest diameter  
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis)  as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415]. 
Note:  Lesions on X- Ra
 y are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.

 1.3 Special  Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
1.3.1 Bone lesions  
• Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic  bone lesions or mixed  lytic -blastic  lesions,  with identifiable soft tissue  components , that 
can be evaluated by  [CONTACT_104177].  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
•  
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’  And ‘Non -Target’  Lesions  
When more  than one measurable lesion is  present  at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded).  
Note: A maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system. For example, a maximum  of 
two lung lesions can be selected  (selected  from  one lung or one lesion  from each).  A maximum of 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated  measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest  lesion does 
not lend itself to  reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is  added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters  will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’,  ‘absent’,  or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more  details  to follow). In addition, it is  possible to record multiple non -target lesions  involving 
the same organ  as a single item on the case record  form (eg, ‘multiple  enlarged pelvic lymph  nodes’ 
or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

 2 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance  of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must  also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more  new lesions is also 
considered progression). 
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient  shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
• Not Evaluable  (NE):  If one or more  target lesions  cannot be measured  or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to measure (due to missing or poor quality images), and the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above.  
 
2.1.1 Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when  lymph nodes are included as target  lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short  axis of < [ADDRESS_115440] achieve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’  
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded  on the case report form.  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13051], the measurement  should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present  and is faintly  seen but too small  to measure,  a default  value of 5 mm should be assigned 
as the reference diameter. (Note: It is less likely  that this rule will be used for lymph nodes  since 
they usually have a definable size when  normal and are frequently  surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default  value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This

CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing this default value will prevent  false  responses or progressions based  upon measurement 
error.  To reiterate,  however, if the radiologist is able to provide  an actual measure,  that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment  
When non- nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be 
added together  to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
2.2 Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of  the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non- target  lesions. While  some  non- target  lesions may actually  be measurable,  they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at  the time points specified in 
the protocol. 
• Complete  Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non- target lesions.  All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  
• Progressive  Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing  non- target lesions.  
 
2.2.1 Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
The concept of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient  also has measurable disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there 
must be an overall  level  of substantial  worsening in non- target disease  such  that,  even  in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target lesions is 
usually not sufficient  to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites  will not be followed as target  or non- target  lesions and will not contribute  to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
[IP_ADDRESS] W
 hen the patient  has only non- measurable disease  
This circumstance arises in some trials  when  it is not a criterion  of study entry  to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment  to factor  into the interpretation  of an increase in non- measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily  quantified  (by [CONTACT_108]: 
Clinical  Protocol

Approved  v 81.0 930137110  8.0  
 if all lesions are truly  non- measurable)  a useful test that can be applied when  assessing  patients  for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based  on the change 
in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease:  ie, an increase  in tumor burden representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should  be considered  to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal  to have 
objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.  
2.2.2 New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions  denotes disease  progression; therefore,  some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable  to differences in  scanning  technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre- existing lesions).  This is particularly important when  the patient’s baseline 
lesions show  partial or complete  response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion  may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered  new lesions and will not contribute  to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen  on a post- baseline imaging  exam,  a comment may be made,  but the appearance 
of a new fluid  collection alone should not result in an assessment of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion  and will indicate  disease  progression. An  example of this is  the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X -Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).  
If a new lesion  is equivocal,  for example  because of its small  size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG -PET 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’  disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging  can be identified  according 
to the following algorithm:  
1) N
egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of  PD based 
on a new lesion.

 2) No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If  the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of  disease on CT, additional follow -up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If  the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

confirmation  and censoring rules  regarding  subsequent therapy. The patient’s  best overall response

a Non-CR/non -PD is preferred  over SD for non-target  disease since  SD is increasingly  used as endpoint  for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_115447] response determination of complete or partial response requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial  responses may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
≥ 4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3- 1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified 
minimum time from the date of first treatment or randomization date.  
For example, if the first scheduled follow -up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made  after the participant  is on-study for a minimum 
of 6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study of 35 days from  the 
reference start date (reference date is considered  Day 1 on study). If the participant is  not on-study 
for at least this amount of time, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.  
Special  note on response assessment:  When  nodal disease is included in the sum of target  lesions 
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement  should be recorded  even  though the nodes are normal in order  not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

a If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria  relative  to baseline,  makes  the disease PD at that point (since  disease must  have  reappeared  after CR).  Best 
response  would depend  on whether minimum  duration  for SD was met. However,  sometimes  ‘CR’  may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is  PR. 
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans 
Verification  of Response:  To be assigned a status  of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_104179] [ADDRESS_115449] met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmation of a previously identified CR even with an intervening NE or PR  (eg, 
CR NE CR or CR PR CR). Subsequent documentation of a PR may provide confirmation of a 
previously identified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR/CRs for confirmation. 
Verification  of Pr
 ogression : Progression of disease  should be verified  in cases where  progression 
is equivocal. If repeat  scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared  using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the participant is considered to not have progressive disease.

 APPENDIX 8  SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NODAL GTV 
DELINEATION BASED ON FDG -PET–CT AND E(B)US- NA 
 
 
When  incidental nodal irradiation  is low,  such as with IMRT  or VMAT,  it is advised  to add 
E(B)US -NA to FDG- PET–CT for mediastinal staging as it may:  
• decrease geographical miss 
• detect  other benign reasons for PET -positivity  
• confirm malignancy in PET-positive LN 
Do NOT  exclude LN that are PET- positive  and E(B)US -negative from GTV as FN rate 
remains high (14% -16%), except if:  
• a clear  benign  reason  for PET- positivity  is found at pathological examination e.g. 
anthracosilicosis or granulomatosis  
• high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_104061]-avid compared with 
primary tumor; take into account clinical parameters  
• negative pathology at E(B)US -NA is confirmed  by [CONTACT_104180] E(B)US  under local  anesthesia:  
• confirm malignancy or find benign etiology for PET- positivity  
• sample “suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]” PET-negative LN 
• consider to discuss the selection  of critical LN with endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_104062] 
• E(B)US  should be performed  after FDG -PET–CT  scan to avoid  FN PET-positive LN

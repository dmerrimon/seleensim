Protocol #: 16-[ADDRESS_1152195] Title: A Randomized Trial comparing  Physostigmine vs Lorazepam for 
Treatment of Ado lescent Antimuscarinic (Anticholinergic) Toxidrome   
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_830193]: 10/16/19          
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :   
• Specific Aim 1 : Determine the effectiveness of physostigmine as 
compared with lorazepam for control of antimuscarinic agitation.  
• Hypothesis: Physostigmine infusion will decrease agitation more 
effectively than lorazepam bolus 
 
• Specific Aim 2 : Determine the effectiveness of physostigmine as 
compared with lorazepam in the reversal of antimuscarinic delirium.  
• Hypothesis: Physostigmine bolus will reverse a greater proportion of 
patients with antimuscarinic delirium compared to  lorazepam bolus. 
 
• Specific Aim 3 : Demonstrate the safety of physostigmine infusion as 
compared to lorazepam  bolus dosing for antimuscarinic toxicity.  
• Hypothesis: The proportion of adverse events will not differ between physostigmine infusion compared to lorazepam bolus dosing.  
 II. Background and Significance :  
Overdose or abuse of xenobiotics, such as antihistamines or Jimson Weed, with 
resulting antimuscarinic toxidrome is a common scenario in medical toxicology.  In 2014, National Poison Data System (NPDS)  annual report revealed 103,[ADDRESS_1152196] common human exposure.[1]  In addition to antihistamines, several medications are direct muscarinic antagonists, including antipsychotics.[2,3]  The result of antagonism of muscarinic receptors is a constellation of signs and symptoms (toxidrome) which can consist of mydriasis  (large pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]), decreased sweat, decreased bowel sounds, agitation, delirium, 
hallucinations, urinary retention, tachycardia, flushed skin and seizures.[2,3]  This toxidrome is common after supratherapeutic ingestions (overdoses) of these medications.  
Treatment for antimuscarinic toxidrome consists of supportive medical care 
including hemodynamic support with adequate fluid resuscitation, cooling if hyperthermia develops, and treatment of seizures. [4]  In addition to hemodynamic support, the goal of therapy is control of agitation and delirium.  Most medical therapy consists of 
Page 2 of 10  
COMIRB # : 16-1730  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_830192], MD  Protocol Version: 10/16/19  administration of sedative hypnotic pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830194].[4]  However, significant amounts of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830195], which can be a risk factor for hypotension and over sedation, and in loss of airway protection leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.[5]   Furthermore, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830196], and some pati ents may have a 
paradoxical worsening of symptoms. 
Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the 
concentration of acetylcholine at the synapse. The increase in acetylcholine overcomes the competitive antagonism of acetylch oline muscarinic receptor.[2,3]  Physostigmine crosses 
the blood-brain barrier, reversing  both the agitation and delirium associated with the 
antimuscarinic toxidrome.[6]  Safe and adequate control of agitation and delirium with physostigmine in the settin g of antimuscarinic toxicity from various xenobiotics has been 
described. [7-16] Retrospective comparisons of physostigmine to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830197] 1 of 28 patients, while 16 of 22 patients still had agitation after benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_582419].[17]  Delirium was also reversed in 87% patients receiving physostigmine compared with zero with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_99646].  Adverse effects were not different between the treatment groups.   
In the absence of high quality randomized trials, physostigmine has not been 
widely adopted for treatment of  antimuscarinic toxicity. In 2014, NPDS annual review 
reported only 316 patients received physostigmine, while 35,337 patients received benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830198].[1]  Concerns over the use of physostigmine stem from  concerns of adverse events exist due to two  case reports in the setting of 
tricyclic antidepressant overdose complicated by [CONTACT_830210].[18,19] However, mor e detailed evidence has shown that physostigmine can be administered safely 
and effectively  in antimuscarinic toxicity without development of these severe adverse 
effects.[4,7-16,20-22]  Another criticism of physostigmine is the short duration of action.  The onset of effect after IV administration is rapid, with reversal or antimuscarinic toxidrome within several minutes. The duration of action is also short, lasting typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 30-60 minutes (elimination half -life is 16 minutes).[6,7]   Even though physosti gmine has a 
short duration of action, continuous physostigmine infusion for persistent antimuscarinic delirium and agitation of at least 8 hours has been demonstrated to be safe and effective even in pediatric patients.[23,24]   
Although the antimuscarinic toxidrome occurs commonly, physostigmine has been 
used sparingly  despi[INVESTIGATOR_830199].  To demonstrate the utility and 
safety of physostigmine, we propose a randomized clinical trial of physostigmine compared to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830200].
  
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
From August 1, 2013 through January 31, 2016, 56 patients were 
evaluated by a medical toxicology consultation  at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830201]. Several more were evaluated for antimuscarinic toxidrome from other ingestions (antipsychotics and Datura).  Of the antihistamine overdose patients, 8 received physostigmine with complete reversal of agitation and delirium and no reported side effects; the

COMIRB # : 16-1730  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_830192], MD  Protocol Version: 10/16/[ADDRESS_1152197] 
or observed in the emergency department.  There were no cardiac dysrhythmias or seizures from phys ostigmine, and no deaths. 
 
IV. Research  Methods  
A.  Outcome Measure(s):   
Primary outcome measures for this study include evaluation and assessmen t of 
delirium and agitation , as measured by  [CONTACT_830211] -Sedation Score (RASS) 
and modified 3D-Confusion Assessment Delirium (CAM) scores.  Secondary outcomes include adverse effects , which include the following: seizures, bradycardia, dysrhythmias, 
bronchospasm, increased secretions, diaphoresis, vomiting, intubation, and over-sedation.  We will also evaluate treatment satisfaction scores from treating physicians, nursing staff, and parents.  Total benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830202].  The total time requiring physical restraints will also be collected . 
Immediately prior to study treatment, after each medication bolus, and during every hour of treatment, the following will be obtained: vital signs, RASS, determination of delirium, 
adverse effects
 (seizures, bradycardia (<60), bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, 
vomiting, intubation and over- sedation ) and clinical examination (specifically, symptoms 
of antimuscarinic toxicity : flushed skin, dry axillae, dry mucous membranes, mydriasis, 
decreased bowel sounds, seizures, tachycardia, hyperthermic (>38.0C) ).   
Previously validated RASS score will be used to assess agitation: -5 (nonarousable) 
to 0 (alert and calm) to +4 (combative).[25](Table 1) Two separate providers (MD or RN) 
will provide assessment of agitatio n score.  Modified 3D- CAM score will be used to assess 
delirium.[26]  All patients meeting inclusion criteria for RASS scores will automatically have the first 2 criteria for 3D -CAM met: fluctuating course of mental status and 
inattention.[26]  Thus, questions on disorganized thinking will be asked to further assess for delirium: 1) Will a stone float on water? 2) Are there fish in the sea? 3) Does one-pound weight more than two? 4) Can you use a hammer to pound a nail? Reversal of delirium will be defined as ability to correctly answer at least [ADDRESS_1152198].  At the end of the treatment protocol, the study will terminate and treating physicians can medically treat patient at their  
discretion.  A urine sample from either a pre -existing foley catheter  bag collection , or 
volunteer void, will be sent for a comprehensive urine drug screen.[27]

C. Study Design and Research Methods   
This is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, comparing physostigmine and 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830206].  The study will be registered with Clintrials.gov.
 Patients will be initially sc reened by [CONTACT_21171] (RA) or by 
[CONTACT_830212] “Ingestion,” “Overdose,” “XXXX,” or “Altered Mental Status” via EPIC electronic medical record.  The diagnosis of antimuscarinic toxidrome will also be verified by [CONTACT_830213] . 
Page 6 of 10  
COMIRB # : 16-1730  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_830192], MD  Protocol Version: 10/16/19  After signed  or verbal phone consent from the child’s parent/ legal guardian, 
randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_830214].  
Investigational pharmacy will be notified  by [CONTACT_830215].  The patient, caregiver, nursing 
staff, and treating physician will be blinded to the treatment.  To maintain blinding, the bolus and infusion medications will only be labele d with a study  protocol identifier.  
Physostigmine and lorazepam are both clear, and  the bolus and infusion volumes will be 
similar and syringe will be covered  to allow for adequate blinding.  Patients will be on 
continuous cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_42766], receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, laboratory assessment (basic metabolic panel, acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations, and electrocardiogram) and urine foley placement (if needed) per standard treatment protocol for their presenting diagnosis.  They will be allowed to receive other medications, including antipsychotic or other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], during their treatment timeline while in 
the study.  They will not be excluded from the study if they have received these medications prior to enrollment, as long as they have otherwise met study criteria.  
 Enrolled patients will be randomized to a treatment arm of: 
• Physostigmine 0.02 mg/kg IV bolus (max of 2 mg), which can be repeated at 10 minutes, followed by a 0.02 mg/kg/hr (max of 2 mg/hr) infusion for 4 hours. OR 
• Lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus (max 2 mg), which can be repeated at 10 minutes if inadequate patient response, followed by a NS infusion for 4 hours.  During either treatment arm, lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus (max 2 mg) can be administered every 2 hours as needed for continued elevated agitation scores. 
 Urine samples will be obtained (10 -30ml), and sent to LabCorp for analysis using the 
TOXASSURE Comprehensive Drug Analysis  which includes 26 drug categories and 180 
compounds using UPLC/MS-M S analysis platform.  They will be stored at the Research 
Institute Freezer at < 20C until sent to LabCorp for analysis. 
 
D. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: 
Human subjects included in our study will consist of pat ients greater than  or equal 
to 10 years  and less than  18 years of age. Our study does not involve fetuses, prisoners, 
institutionalized individuals, neonates, or pregnant women.  This study will include women, minorities, and children. Parent/Legal Guardian consent will be obtained prior to study procedures being performed. Each patient enrolled will be given a unique study identifier which will be used  for the laboratory samples  and data collection .  Any and all 
protected health information and data obtained will be stored in a password- secured, 
REDCap data system.   
 
• Intravenous (IV) administration of medications : These patients  will have existing 
IV’s for their standard care and treatment. Risks of this procedure include pain, 
infection, local redness and irritation.  Physostigmine, lorazepam , nor normal saline 
can lead to caustic injury with IV infiltration.  
Page 7 of 10  
COMIRB # : 16-1730  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_830192], MD  Protocol Version: 10/16/19  • Urine Sample: If a foley is being placed for their standard care, urine sample will  
be obtained from foley bag.  If the patient can void, they will voluntarily void into a 
collection cup .    
• There is a slight but unlikely risk of loss of confidentiality.  To help protect against this, a password-protected REDCap database will be used to collect and store all 
data. Only study team members  will have access to the database.   
• Reports of seizures and cardiac dysrhythmias have rarely been reported with the use of physostigmine and from anticholinergic toxicity .  Other rare but potentially 
serious side effects can include bronchospasm, bradycardia, and bronchorrhea.  Standard label contraindications will be used for physostigmine (as listed in the exclusion criteria) to avoid these complications, and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_830207]. Adverse effects from lorazepam include over sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Supportive care will be used for any adverse effects from lorazepam .  Patients will be on a full 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y monitor for their diagnosis per standard protocol, and will be 
constantly monitored for adverse events associated with their diagnosis, in addition to their treatment protocol.    
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/Exit Criteria during study protocol: 
o Physician discretion  
o Bradyca rdia (HR <60)  
o Seizures  
o Cardiac Dysrhythmias  
o Wheezing  
o Intubation  
Any possible adverse events reported by [CONTACT_830216]/legal guardians that 
might occur from the urine collection or from medications received during their visit will be documented and reported to the primary investigator and appropriate IRB authorities in real time.  They will be reviewed and determined if any immediate action will need to be taken.   
    
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
One potential issue is misclassification of the patient at the time of enrollment. The 
anticholinergic toxidrome is a clinical diagnosis and there are many conditions that may mimic parts of this toxidrome .  However, members of the medical toxicology service will 
be evaluating t he patients to verify presentation of antimuscarinic toxidrome.  There may 
be provider variability in rating delirium and agitation. We are using standardized scales to decrease this variability.  Although standard dosing is used, the dose of physostigmine or 
lorazepam used for this study may not be adequate in treatment of delirium or agitation, depending on the exposure and amount ingested. 
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_78718] 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two- tailed Fisher 
exact and Mann -Whitney U tests will be used for independent samples.  McNemar’ s and 
Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to assess variable change before and after 
Page 8 of 10  
COMIRB # : 16-1730  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_830192], MD  Protocol Version: 10/16/19  treatment. If continuous or ordinal data is non-normally distributed, non- parametric tests 
will be performed. Due to multiple comparisons, statistical significance will be adjusted 
using Bonferroni’s correction. To compare intergroup changes in agitation score, repeated-measure analysis of variance will be used. When number of observed events was small, the exact binomial distribution was used to compute 95% confidence intervals. Kappa score for agreement will be performed for provider determination of agitation score.  Our power calculations, based a retrospective study evaluating after initial control of agitation with treatment of where 96% of physostigmine and 27 % of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_830208], suggested that 22 subjects (11 in each arm) provides 92% power to detect at least 70% difference assuming an alpha of type 1 erro r rate of 5%.   To account for 
study withdrawal and attrition, study protocol and budget will be prepared for enrollment of 28 during the study time period.   
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
Our study promotes the study of health effects and treatment of a common 
ingestion (antihistamines) and toxidrome (antimuscarinic), and will ultimately improve clinical care and practice of clinical toxicology, specifically in this very common patient population.  It will help expand knowledge of safety and efficacy of physostigmine by [CONTACT_830217], and help define the use of this antidote for clinical toxicologists and other treating physicians.

07/23/[ADDRESS_390584] Parkinson’s Disease Plasma (SPDP)  Study:  Intravenous ly-Administered Plasma From Young Donors for 
Treatment of Moderate Parkinson ’s Diseas e

2. Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that plasma infusions  can be performed  safely  in patients with Parkinson’s 
Disease (PD) .  Secondary outcomes will include behavioral and laboratory data that will support the next study that will inquire 
whether young plasma infusions improve or slow the progression of cognitive, mood and/or motor impairment and rate markers of  
the disease .  
 
3.  Background & Significance  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurode generative disease that affects over 1.6 million people in the [LOCATION_002] and whose 
incidence increases with age, affecting over 1% of people over the age of 65. The neuropathological processes involved in PD are 
widespread throughout the brain, and are  reflected in a constellation of motor, cognitive, mood and other non -motor symptoms. 
Treatments to date have largely focused on dopamine replacement strategies or deep brain stimulation,  both symptomatic 
treatments.  
As neurodegenerative diseases progress, there are major changes throughout the body and brain. These changes are 
transmitted in the body via the circulatory system between organs, tissues and cells. Recent findings from multiple laborator ies have 
shown that infusions of young plasma into aging rodents can have beneficial effects on cognitive functions , as well as on some 
biomarkers of aging . This  suggest s that the circulating components of plasma can improve  cognitive and disease -relevant symptoms 
(Villeda et  al, 2011; Villeda et al, 2014). This has motivated the field to treat multiple disorders with blood products and their 
constituent active components.  
The established safety of blood transfusions allows us to  test whether infusion of young plasma can ease the neurological 
symptoms in human subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. A study that is ongoing at Stanford, in the department of Neurolo gy 
and Neurological Sciences, is testing whether infusions of young plasma can ameliorate the cognitive impairment  in patients with 
Alzheimer ’s disease (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). To date , this has been well -tolerated by [CONTACT_748], without major 
adverse effects.  
We propose to test the  safety and  efficacy of transfusing young plasma in to PD patients , in order  to establish its effects  on 
motor and cognitive functions  in patients in a Phase 1 study. The successful completion of this study will inform the  design of future , 
3 
 
larger and multicenter studies with the goal to determine whether infusions of young plasma can ameliorate the neurodegenerative 
symptoms and underlying pathophysiology in Parkinson’s disease.

5. Design & Procedures  
We will evaluate a dose of one  Plasma unit transfusion twice  per week (obtained from male subjects between the ages of 18-25) for 
four weeks in [ADDRESS_390588]’s Blood Center (SBC) , not an external company.  The Plasma product will be stored in the SBC, 
later transported to Stanford Transfusion Services  before infusions.  Infusions will take place in a Stanford Infusion Center.  The 
primary objective of the study is to assess the s afety and tolerability of twice weekly plasma transfusions . The secondar y objectives 
are to assess the effect of twice weekly plasma transfusions  in subjects with PD on motor function : United Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale (UPDRS) , objective kinematic measure s, cognitive function (detailed neuropsychological battery ), and th e Montreal 
5 
 
Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) as well as assessing plasma biomarker s through blood laboratory work.  
• Donors must be: 
▪ Male- To minimize transfusion risks, only young male plasma will be  
 used since female plasma has been linked to the possibility of  
 Transfusion -Related Acute Lung I njury (TRALI), linked to  
 immune cells carried by [CONTACT_317376]  
o Between the ages of 18-25 
• Targeted availability of plasma within 2 weeks of completion of ABO /Rh typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

• Transfusion  Protocol 
o Perform the transfusion acco rding to the most current “Blood and Blood Componen t Administration” 
guidelines at Stanford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] & Clinic; in brief: 
▪ Check and record pre-transfusion base line vital signs (temperature and blood pressu re) within 1 hour prior to 
transfusion. 
▪ Obtain IV acces s 
▪ Infuse test agen t at 1-2 ml/min for the first [ADDRESS_390592]  closely for any adve rse 
reaction. 
7 
 
▪ Record the vital signs at 15 min. 
▪ If vital signs are normal or unchanged , then increase infusion rate to as fast as tolerated, or approximately 
250-300 ml/hour. 
▪ Continue to monitor the subject  for signs/symptoms of adve rse reaction during the entire infusion. 
▪ For any suspec ted transfusion reaction, report immediately to the Principal Inves tigator, [CONTACT_317382] -Stewart,  or designated on-call study phys ician, Melanie Lising , and follow the detailed “Blood and 
Blood Componen t Administration” guidelines. 
▪ Record vital signs 15 min after completion of the infusion 
▪ The subject  shou ld remain at the infusion facility unde r nursing supe rvision throughou t the entire transfusion 
procedu re until [ADDRESS_390593] and what to do in an emergency , if a delayed transfusion 
reaction is suspec ted. 
• Retain a ~[ADDRESS_390594]’s Clinic , The Michael J. Fox Foundat ion trial finder , listings in Clinicaltrial.gov , from 
previous experiments , and by [CONTACT_317377]. Subjects recruited from previous experiments will have consented 
to be contact[CONTACT_317378]. P otential subjects will need to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. A reimbursement budget of $[ADDRESS_390595] will  receive a thorough description  of the purpose of the study , the design of 
the study , potential risks and discomforts throughout and after the study , as well as the benefits (if any direct benefits) of 
participating of this study . After being informed, the subject will be presented with the consent form delineating  previously 
stated information about the parti cipation of this study . The subject undergoing the trial will be responsible for giving consent.  
 
8. Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent:  
Upon the inability to provide consent, diminished capacity will be assessed by a series of cognitive assessments to provide a  
clear position on whether subject has enough cognitive capacity to participate in this study. Cognitive assessments will be 
admini stered prior to starting the study.  
 
9. Study Interventions:  
[ADDRESS_390596] any implanted devices during prescreening.  
 
10.  Risk/Benefit Assessment:  
Blood products carry risks of virus, hepatitis and HIV infection.  Acute transfusion reactions could include such signs and 
symptoms as  the following, divided into classes to denote the level of severity.  
*Class 1:  
• Urticaria (a type of rash)  
• Hives  
Class 2:  
• Fever  
• Chills  
• Nausea  
Class 3:  
• Low Hematocrit (which refers to the percentage of whole blood that is made up of red blood cells) without  evidence of 
bleeding  
• High bilirubin fever (meaning there is a higher level of waste that hasn’t been filtered out as it usually is when red blood 
cells breakdown).  
Class 4:  
• Oliguria (a reduction in the amount of urine being passed)  
• Bleeding  
• Hemoglobinemia  (an excess of hemoglobin in the blood plasma)  
• Hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin —the oxygen -transporting protein in blood —is at abnormally high levels)  
• Transfusion associated circulatory overload  
• shock  
NOTE: * Class [ADDRESS_390597]  will be observed during each transfusion for signs and symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction (i.e., chills, fever, low 
back pain, flushing, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, red urine, shock, cardiac arrest). The subject  will also be monitored 
9 
 
during th e transfusion to minimize risk for potential infiltration or fluid overload due to rapid infusion of red blood cells (RBCs)  or 
blood components.  
Subjects with severe anemia and congestive heart failure are sensitive to circulatory  
 overload.  
The subject m ay also experience delayed transfusion reactions several hours to several days (delayed hemolytic reaction) 
after the transfusion is completed. Such reactions can include a febrile or pulmonary reaction (up to 6 hours) that may be 
associated with the blood  administration.   
 
Risks may include but not limited to transfusion reactions , bruising and/or soreness of arm in involved area, fatigue, boredom, 
and restlessness. To reduce the potential of any risks, subjects will be routinely asked for feedback on their current state.  
Some risks, such as arm bruising and soreness will be minimized by [CONTACT_317379]. In the event of special precautions to be taken, such as the case of use of vulnerable populations (cognitively 
impaired adults), cognitive assessments before each session will be conducted to ensure the sub jects ability to communicate 
any discomforts throughout the study.  
 
• All adverse reactions  reported after the start of the transfusions  will be documented during trial.  
• Transfusion reaction is an adverse event of a special interest, and any subject who expe riences a transfusion reaction, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_317374]. Bronte -Stewart and [CONTACT_317383] , will not be allowed to receive any further 
infusion.  
• In the event of discontinuation of infusions due to a transfusion reaction or other seriou s adverse event , a safety 
and efficacy follow -up assessments will tak e place [ADDRESS_390598]:  
 
There will be no cost for the subjects; the subject will not be expected to pay for research participation.  
 
12.  Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations:  
 
Endpo ints include  
▪ Primary Outcome Measure:  
10 
 
• Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, and number of subjects who comply 
with the research protocol as a measure of feasibility.  
 
▪ Secondary Outcome Measures:  
 
• Change on the UPDRS III / IV off medication  
• Change in gait speed  
• Change in quantitative kinematics, FOG -Q 
• Change on the Parkinson’s  Disease Quality of Life Scale  (PDQ -39) 
• Change on the Beck Anxiety Inventory  (BAI) 
• Change on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI ) 
• Change in Trail Making Test A& B, Digit Symbol Test, Animal Naming Test, Phonemic Fluency (FAS), Matrix 
Reasoning, Block Design and  Cogstate Maze Learning Test (Cog State)  
• Change in plasma biomarkers  
 
13. Data & Safety Monitoring  
Safety concerns regarding subject data include loss of subject data and disclosure of identification of participants. All 
electronically connected data will be securely stored in Stanford Medicine  Box with Protected Health Information (PH I) & 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protection. Persons with access to this information include the Primary Investigato r, 
research coordinator, and research team collecting data. Frequency of data monitoring will be as needed for data processing . 
 
To ensure the subject’s data and physical safety, continuous safety monitoring will occur throughout the study by [CONTACT_317380]. The Safety Re view Committee will include an on-call Neurologist s, [CONTACT_317384] -Stewart, [CONTACT_317385] , Psychologist Gayle Deutch, Sharon Sha  and Neil Shah .   
 
For any AEs outside of Stanford facility, the subject must call the research assistant at (650)[ADDRESS_390599] Emergency 
Department by [CONTACT_476].  
 
Research assistant will then need to file a SafeReport of the incident & document occurrence . 
 
14. Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality

The Isomark Canary™ is a device designed to measure CO 2 concentration and the breath delta value (BDV) in exhaled 
breath of a patient.  The BDV is the difference  in the ratio of the two primary naturally  occurring isotopic forms of 
carbon dioxide , 13CO 2/ 12CO 2, compared to a standard reference.  The BDV may  alert the health care practitioner of 
changes in the patient’s metabolic process, onset of systemic infection, and possible need for additional diagnostic 
tests.

Name [CONTACT_438942] :  
The Isomark Canary™ is a device designed to measure the breath delta value (BDV) in exhaled breath samples 
obtained from a patient. The BDV is a ratio of the two primary naturally occurring isotopic forms of carbon dioxide, 
13CO 2/12CO 2. Changes in the BDV can indicate the onset of infection due to the phenomenon known as the acute phase 
response, which occurs early in the infection process, even before a patient shows typi[INVESTIGATOR_438860].  
Breath samples are collected in a disposable, single -use bag.  The study is designed to collect data that can 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the BDV as an indicator of infection as compared to current methods, such as vital 
signs.  
 
Hypothesis:  
BDV is an indicator of infection and provid es the earliest possible means for detection of infections.  
 
Specific Aims:  
 To determine the positive and negative predictive value of 13CO 2/12CO 2 BDV determination as an indicator of 
infection in adult critically ill  subjects.  
 To determine baseline variability of exhaled 13CO 2/12CO 2 BDV in a population of adult critically ill  subjects.  
 
General Study Design:  
This is a prospective multi -center study using subject s who are not suspected of infection at the time of admission and 
comparing the Canary’s BDV marker to standard infection monitoring methods.  
 
• Open enrollment of subject s, population defined by [CONTACT_156587]/exclusion criteria  
• Subject  breath sample taken at enrollment and every 4 hours for the length of Intensive  Care Unit (I CU) and/or 
Intermedi ate Care ( IMC) stay until discharge from the ICU/I MC or 28 days (whichever occurs firs t) 
• Subject  records monitored/collected for study duration  
• Daily research blood samples collected for length of ICU and/or IMC stay and stored for subsequent analysis of c-
reactive protein ( CRP) and procalcitonin ( PCT)

This study is designed to determine if Isomark’s Canary infection monitor can provide an early indicator of the onset 
of infection.  
 
Healthcare -associated infections (HAIs) are the most common complication of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], resulting in 1.7 million 
infections and 99,000 deaths each year.  HAIs extend the average length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438862], costing the U.S. 
healthcare system m ore than $35 billion each year (1). Serious HAIs that lead to extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and 
ultimately increased cost and risk of mortality, include blood stream infections, catheter -associated urinary tract 
infections, surgical site infections, and ventilator -associated pneumonia. These fo ur infections account for more than 
80 percent of all HAIs (2). Ventilator associated pneumonia, a common complication in mechanically ventilated 
patients, increases length of stay in t he ICU by [CONTACT_438909], increases treatment costs by $10,000 to $40,000 
per patient (3) and may result in a mortality r ate greater than 30 percent (4).   
 
Critically ill patients are at risk for infectious complications. Early detection of infections may lead to earlier treatment  
and redu ce progression to systemic infectious processes like sepsis.   Earlier diagnosis of sepsis and treatment as part 
of a resuscitation bundle has been shown to decrease sepsis related death rate in the critically ill (2).  Localized 
infections that progress t o sepsis and its more severe forms, severe sepsis and septic shock, have an unpredictable 
onset and progression.  Sepsis is a leading cause of death in ICUs with mortality rates as high as 30% at some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
Annually in the U.S., 1.4 million sepsis cas es involve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 750,000 cases of severe sepsis or septic shock, and 
~260,[ADDRESS_556165] been reported in recent years (1). Therefore, infection detection methods 
aimed at earlier diagnosis may result in earlier initiatio n of treatment and perhaps mitigate progression to sepsis and 
associated sequelae .   However, the early detection of infection is a significant clinical challenge with diagnosis subject 
to clinician’s clinical judgment and interpretation of overt infectiou s symptomology and laboratory profile. The 
healthcare system needs a better way to easily detect infections early and with confidence.  
 
Carbon -[ADDRESS_556166] been demonstrated in proof -of-concept studies to be reliable indicators of the onset of severe 
infection . A change in the ratio of carbon -13 to carbon -12 (i.e. 13CO 2/12CO 2) in exhaled breath is known as the breath 
delta value (BDV). The ratio of 13CO 2/12CO 2 is expected to decrease, and produce a negative BDV  trend , during severe 
stress such as infection. In animal models of sepsis, the BDV preceded other physiologic changes associated with 
infection (5, 6). In these preclinical studies, BDV was shown to be a possible early indicator of the onset of infection 
that prec edes current, less direct indicators, such as changes in vital signs, mental status or white blood cell count.  
 
Isomark, LLC (Madison, WI) has developed an investigational device, the Canary™ infection monitor which is intended 
to determine the BDV in crit ically ill patients. The Canary  will be used in this study to determine the BDV of breath 
samples collected from patients who agree to participate as research subjects.  
 
The objectives of this study are:  
1. To measure variation of BDV with time in adult critically ill ICU patients who agree to participate as research 
subjects;  
2. To determine the magnitude of change of BDV in subjects who are subsequently diagnosed with severe infection 
and/or sepsis;  
3. To define variation of BDV in adult critically il l ICU subjects who do not develop severe infection.  
 
In this multi -center study of 1 00 subjects, breath samples will be collected six times per day and research blood 
samples  will be collected once per day. Analysis results of these research samples will b e compared with data from 
subjects’ medical records.  
 
 
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 9 of 35 1.0 Background and significance  
The response to a wide variety of insults has been termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is 
nonspecific and develops following a severe physiologic stress or insult, such as infection, trauma, s urgery, 
pancreatitis, or burn .  At least two SIRS criteria coupled with a known or suspected infection is termed “sepsis.”  In a 
prospective survey of adult patients admitted to a tertiary care center , 68% of admissions met SIRS criteria , and 26% 
developed sepsis (SIRS due to a n infectio n) (7). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438863] 18% to 28% 
in adults  (8). Sepsis remains the leading  cause of death in adult surgical ICU patients (9).  
 
Clinical data are often unreliable in distinguishing between patien ts with sepsis (defined as SIRS with a known or 
suspected infection)  and those with SIRS secondary to a cause other than infection. Trauma is frequently as sociated 
with SIRS  (10), and, in the US , 5.7%  of patients admitted after vehicular trauma develop an infection  (9). Followed by 
[CONTACT_438910], e arly detection of infec tion after trauma  could decrease  complications and death due to 
sepsis  (11). Overdiagnosis of infection  and associated unnecessary use of antibiotic  drug s is believed  to promote 
antibiotic resistance  and complications related to antibiotic exposur e, such as morbidity associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438864] C. dificile  colitis . 
 
Analyses of some biomarkers is available and some may be useful for  prompt diagnosis of infections, including 
systemic infections like sepsis.  However, they are insufficient for monitoring infection progress to more severe forms 
like sepsis. WBC and absolute neutrophil c ount are inexpensive laboratory tests, but lack adequate sensitivity and 
specificity to detect serious infections (12). C -reactive protein (CRP) is an inexpensive test, but does not detect severe 
infections early (13). Procalcitonin (PCT) may be more speci fic than CRP in response to bacterial infections(14, 15), but 
is an expensive test, not commonly available in US clinical laboratories, and specificity is confounded in postoperative, 
burn, trauma, pancreatitis, vasculitis, and other non -infectious conditi ons that cause SIRS (13).  
 
The 13CO2/12CO2 BDV  has been shown to be a n early indicator  of catabolic infectious states in several  animal models of 
bacterial sepsis  (6). In animal studies, 13CO2/12CO2 begin s to decrease  immediately after administration of 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) , and the change in 13CO2/12CO2 precedes other physiological changes associated with 
infection, such as hypotension , gut hypoperfusion , or alterations in blood pH, pCO 2 or pO 2 (6). No animal studies have 
assessed  13CO2/12CO2 BDV  as an indicator  of infection  in non -infectious systemic inflammatory conditions , such as 
surgery, severe trauma, severe burn  injury , or pancreatitis.  
 
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_438865] s of exhaled breath 
13CO2/12CO2 BDV  as an early diag nostic marker of infection in adult  critically ill adult subject s. If BDV  accurately 
indicates onset of infection in subjects subesquently diagnosed with infections , and discriminates  onset of infection  
and non -infectious causes of deranged vital signs  in subject s, then BDV would be an effective monitor of infection, 
could prompt early diagnosis , early treatment,  and improve outcomes of criticially ill patients .

Human studies   
In a proof -of-principle study at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166] (IRB #2011 -0045),  [ADDRESS_556167] s were  enrolled  (12). Figure 1 shows pediatric 
BDV  at enrollment for SIRS vs no SIRS cohorts (Panel A)  and categories of inflammation risk factor s (Panel B).  Adult 
data are similar (Figure 2).  Clinical data collected to date correlate well with the hypothesized breath delta value

Of the [ADDRESS_556168] s (age 14 and 15 years ) who were not initially

response  -- 36 to 48 hours before a n infection  was diagnosed ( Figure 4).  There were no other cases that exhibited this 
trend.  Data from these two cases  suggest that the BDV may be a leading indicator of  infection  in critically ill patients.  
To confirm and further investigate  these preliminary findings, t his study is proposed to determine if the BDV  is an early 
indicator of infection  in critically ill adult ICU  subject s.

associated pneumonia. Panel A: pediatric case [ADDRESS_556170] ed progression of  infection the following day due to spi[INVESTIGATOR_438866] a low white blood cell count. The infection

Animal studies  
Butz et al published results of two experiments in mice evaluating 13CO2/12CO2 as a biomarker  of lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)  induced acute phase response  (6). In the first experiment , four mice were injected with sterile saline , and five 
mice were injected with LPS ; each injection was given  intraperitoneally. In the second experiment, three mice were 
injected with dexamet hasone (DEX), three mice with LPS, and three mice with sterile saline. Stable isotopes of blood 
amino acids and carbon in exhaled CO 2 were monitored. An increase in the relative isotopic mass of serum alanine, 
proline, and threonine was observed three  hours after LPS injection. BDV  began to decrease  immediately after the 
administration of LPS and became significantly less than BDV of the control  (saline)  animals within 2.[ADDRESS_556172] been replicated in other animal model s (leghorn chickens , rats, and swine ) using live 
bacteria  (13). The authors concluded that acute phase protein synthesis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_438868], caused the 
changes observed in plasma amino acids and in exhaled 13CO2/12CO2 BDV . These results were confirmed in a porcine 
cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis  (14). From these studies, e xhaled 13CO2/12CO2 BDV  may be a n early  
indicator  of the acute phase response due to endotoxemia.  

CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page [ADDRESS_556173] significant decline in 13CO2/12CO2 BDV  occurred. A 
partial recovery period was observed , followed by a sudden  and more profound decrease. The cycle of partial recovery 
and subsequent decrease was then periodically repeated. The authors concluded that the rate of change in 
13CO2/12CO2 BDV , and the repeated spi[INVESTIGATOR_438869] 13CO2/12CO2, may  help differentiate between  viral and bacterial  infection s 
(15).  
 
These studies suggest that exhaled 13CO2/12CO2 BDV may be a potential early indicator  of systemic infection  in humans.

CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 14 of 35 3.0 Stud y design  and rationale  
This is a multi -center prospective study to assess  exhaled 13CO2/12CO2 BDV  as an indicator of infection in critically ill 
adult ICU subjects . Critically ill adult ICU subjects  who are not suspected of having an infection at the time of ICU 
admission will be enrolled as study subject s. Up to 100 Subjects will be enrolled from 8 -10 centers across the United 
States.  
 
This study is needed to  determine the rate of infection detection of the Canary device. Logistic  considerations include 
the definition of an infectio n and  collection of  data needed to diagnose infection s consistent with the Centers for 
Disease Control ( CDC) standards  (16), and determination of onset timing of infectio n by [CONTACT_438912] . 
The BDV, as determined by [CONTACT_438913] ™, will be retrospectively determined from exhaled breath samples, and  will not 
be available or used clinically to establish or confirm the infectio n. 
 
Effectiveness parameters will be estimated to determine the sample size required for the subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. 
Parameters to be estimated include: timing of t he infection onset, the lead time offered by [CONTACT_438914], 
sensitivity of the BDV threshold, specificity of not reaching the BDV threshold, the receiver operating curve  as a 
function of the BDV threshold, and the positive and negative predictive values based on h ypothetical infection 
incidence . Models for infection outcome (Y/N ) will be analyzed for the impact of clinical and on  study covariates. The 
corresponding performance of a conventional best practices control (BPC) will be compar ed to determine if the Canary 
can identify infections earlier in the clinical course than BPC. Several time windows will be tested to determine the 
timing of and criteria for aligning a monitoring test result with BPC or clinical reference standard result.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_438870] I error (“false positive”) associated with multiple times 
when BDV could become positive. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_438871] a 
broa d spectrum of possible infection types.  
 
The BDV will be analyzed to  determine the range of exhaled 13CO2/12CO2 BDV  in adult subjects. The 13CO2/12CO2 BDV 
will be compar ed with  current clinical standard  scores , physiologic measurements  and biomarkers (e.g. vital signs , 
WBC, CRP, PCT), and any interventions  -- such as antibiotic administration  -- will be noted  for the purpose of assisting  
in understanding varia tion of  BDV . With the exception of CRP and PCT  (require study specific blood samples),  these 
data will be obtained  from the medical record s of patients who agree to participate as research subjects . To assess the 
hypothesis that BDV is a leading indicator  of infection , BDV  determined as a sustained decrease of 13CO2/12CO2 BDV of 
approximately 2.0‰ or more over a [ADDRESS_556174] s

this subject population. Results used to determine pregnancy sta tus will be no more than [ADDRESS_556175]’s eligibility, as approved by [CONTACT_1636] (IRB). A ny protected health information used during the screening process of a potential subject will be the 
minimum necessary for the conduct of this study.  
 
If informed consent is not obtained, all identifiable  information will be destroyed at the end of the screening process. 
The criteria that excluded the patient from study participation will be recorded , but no identifiers will be retained . 
 
4.2 Recruitment and consent  
Determining capacity  
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 16 of 35 Subjects who are conscious and appear to possess capacity to consent will view consent information  with a study 
team member . This consent process will include a review of specified questions with the coordinator (e.g., what  is the 
study purpose? What are the study procedures? Does this study involve treatment?). If the subject is unable to 
provide appropriate answers, despi[INVESTIGATOR_438874] , or if the study team member is not certain 
of the subject’s decis ion making abilit y, then the study team  will have a follow up conversation with the clinician 
investigator to confirm capacity.  The communication should be documented in the subject’s records.  
 
Subjects assessed to be  lacking consent capacity will be involved in consent discussions and asked to provide verbal 
‘assent’ to the degree to which they are able. For subjects who are able to be involved in such discussions, they will be 
provided with an oral summary of the stu dy in terms they are likely to understand.  Subjects expressing dissent to 
participation will not be enrolled, regardless of surrogate consent.  
 
If a subject is determined to lack the capacity to consent, a surrogate (e.g., family member) will be approach ed to 
discuss the study  and to review the consent information . Surrogate  priority will be:  
 
Subject with no Research Power of Attorney, no Guardian, and no Healthcare Power of Attorney : If the potential 
subject is found to lack capacity, then the potential  subject’s next of kin may consent on behalf of the potential subject  
as a legally authorized representative (LAR) . Any next of kin representative of the potential subject should be actively 
involved in the care of the subject. LAR order of priority  is:  
a. spouse  
b. adult child  
c. parent  
d. adult sibling  
e. grandparent  
f. adult grandchild  
g. close friend  
 
Recruitment of potential subjects  
A study team  member will approach subjects who are likely to be eligible for study participation, based on review of 
the potential subject’s medical record and current clinical status . No study  specific procedures will be performed prior 
to obtaining informed consent.   
 
Infor med consent process  
A member of the study team will conduct the informed consent discussion with the potential subject or surrogate  in a 
location where a private conversation may be held . The study team  member will explain the study procedures , that 
the purpose of the study is to evaluate a new infection monitor , and that treatment of the potential subject is not the 
purpose of the study. Any study team  member may conduct the informed consent discussion and obtain informed 
consent . A physician investig ator will be available to address consent  related questions. Coercion will be prevented by 
[CONTACT_438917] e, and that the care of the 
potential subject will not be affected by [CONTACT_438918] e. 
 
Enrollment  
A subject will be considered enrolled in the study once they have been consented for participation and the first breath 
sample has been collected. See study definitions in section 6.1.  
 
4.3 Consent of subjects who regain capacity  
Enrolled s ubjects will be assessed for capacity to consent daily until they complete the study . Subjects who regain 
capacity during their stay in the  study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438875]. Study records of d ata and samples  collected from subjects who decline study participation will be 
destroyed , with the exception of any data used for safety analysis.  
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 17 of 35  
Subjects who provide informed consent after regaining capacity can withdraw from the study at a later time  (See 6.12 
Withdrawal of subjects) .  
Subjects who are c ontacted over the phone, will be assessed for capacity and consent ed over the phone if necessary . 
Subjects who do not regain capacity to consent prior to being discharged from the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , but who later regain 
this capacity,  may contact [CONTACT_438919] . If the data or samples have  already been analyzed (including for safety purposes) or de -identified, then the 
data used for study purposes  will not be removed.

relevant medical and surgical history, admission reason to the ICU/critically ill status, concomitant medications, and 
vital sign data will be collected.  
 
5.2 ICU/IMC Days   
This initial period of study day s begins the day a subject is consented thru either discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438876]/step -down unit to a general care status/unit. A study day will equal one calendar  day. Day [ADDRESS_556177] breath collection and end at 23:59 . Day 1 will typi[INVESTIGATOR_438877] 24 hours and fewer than 6 breath

5.[ADDRESS_556180] ICU/IMC Days  
This period of the study will last three days beyond a subject’s discharge from the ICU/IMC.  If a subject is discharged 
home, the subject’s electronic medical record (EMR) will be reviewed for an additional three days beyond discharge * 
for any results, notes, procedures, or readmission information.  
 
 Assess for capacity to consent  (if subject did not provide consent  and is still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])

5.4 Antibiotic Use Follow -up Days ([ADDRESS_556182] dose of antibiotics)  
If the subject is on antibiotics when discharged from the ICU/IMC, they will be followe d for the three Post -ICU/IMC 
days (as detailed in 5.3) and then daily until the last dose of antibiotics  (from the initial prescriptions at time of 
discharge) , followed by [CONTACT_438920]. If the subject is discharged home, the EMR will be reviewe d daily 
until three days beyond the final scheduled dose of antibiotics.  The subject wil l be called on the third day beyond their 
last anticipated dose of antibiotics  to inquire about their infection/readmission status since their original hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438878].

Each sample should b e collected  in four -hour intervals, calculated from the initial sample time, with a window of  ± [ADDRESS_556185] sample is collected and will not be reset 
if a subsequent sample is col lected  late or early. Samples collected outside of the specified time interval will still be 
analy zed. NOTE: Day 1 can start immediately after the baseline data collection is complete, and may occur on the 
same physical day. Therefore, it is likely that Day 1 wo n’t have all 6 breath samples because of the shortened duration 
after the consent process.  
 
Some subjects may be discharged from the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438879].  If subjects are withdraw n (e.g. are 
discharged or died) on or before completing Day [ADDRESS_556186] their data remain as part of the primary analysis. See Table 1 in section 5.12.  
 
Breath sample collection bags will be provided by [CONTACT_438921]. Any unused bags will be re turned to Isomark. Training 
documents about breath sample col lection and storage are detailed in Isomark’s Lab Manual . Collecte d samples will 
be labeled with  site number, subject  number,  subject initials,  date and time of collection. Collected samples will be 
stored in a secure location at the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438880] .   
 
Mechanically  ventilated subjects  
For mechanically ventilated subjects, an appropriately trained and qualified member of the subject's clinical care team 
or study team member will obtain  expi[INVESTIGATOR_438881] a side port adaptor in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_438882]. The gas sample will be obtained in a small gas sample bag. This method of sample collection  allows 
inflation of a sample bag without any interference with operation of the mechani cal ventilator or breathing circuit.  The 
breath sample bag will inflate visibly during approximately 2-4 breath cycles. The bag will appear inflated, but not over 
inflated, after which time the sample bag will be disconnected and sealed.  
 
Sampling from expi[INVESTIGATOR_438883]:  
When sampling from the expi[INVESTIGATOR_438884], the sample bag will be attached to a standard 
diameter, straight adaptor with a side port fitted with a normally closed valve which only opens when a sample bag is 
attached. The standard side port adaptor will be placed by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_438885], or, if a breathing 
circuit  is replaced anytime during the clinical trial for the subject, then a new adaptor will be placed.   
 
Non -mechanically ventilated subjects  
Non -mechanically ventilated subjects will be asked to inflate a breath sample bag by [CONTACT_53731]. Subjects should repeat 
exhalation  until the bag appears visibly inflated, but not over  inflated.  
 
Subjects who are having  difficulty breathing  (Mask Sample Collection)  
If the subject is not ventilated but has difficulty inflating a bag using the bag’s mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], a mask collection option  is 
available . Collect ing a sample using the mask  is performed by [CONTACT_438922] a sample bag to the breathing mask via a 
connector.  The mask is placed over the subject’s nose and mouth during exhalation . The sample bag should  appear 
visibly inflated, but not over inflated. If more than one breath is required to inflate the bag, the mask must be 
remove d during inhalation.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_556187] an existing catheter, research samples may 
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 19 of 35 be obtained via peripheral lines or venipuncture.  Timing of the blood sample  is not critical , but  one sample is to be 
collected during each calendar day  of the ICU/IMC Study Days period . Blood may be obtain ed from an arter y or a vein.   
Collected samples will be affixed with a provided  de-identified label.  
 
To avoid sample collection from subjects who are anemic, if a subject’s known hemoglobin concentration is less than 
6.0 g/dL at any time, then blood collection will stop and will not resume until the subject’s hemoglobin concentration 
has increased to greater than or equal to 6.0 g/dL. If blood sample acquisition is stopped due to hemoglobin 
concentration criterion, then other study ac tivities will continue per protocol.  
 
5.7 Blood s ample processing , storage  and analysis  
Please see Isomark’s Lab Manual for complete instructions. Whole blood samples will be spun down  in a centrifuge . A 
minimum of 1.[ADDRESS_556188]  number  and the date/time of collection written . Remaining red blood cells (RBC) will  
be recapped in the lithium heparin tubes and stored in that tube. The plasma a liquot tubes will be kept frozen at the 
site for a minimum of 24 hours before batch shippi[INVESTIGATOR_438886] ’s reference lab  for later analysis of PCT and C RP. The 
RBC tubes will be kept frozen at the site for a minimum of 24 hours before batch shippi[INVESTIGATOR_438887] . Following assay of these biomarkers, all samples will be exhausted or d estroyed . 
 
Study samples will be kept between ‐ 50° and ‐196° C until the time of analysis. The storage freezer must maintain 
constant temperature (i.e. must not be frost ‐free or defrost automatically). Study team members  will report all 
occurrences  of freezer temperature  deviating outside of this range. Temperature logs from the freezer (s) will not be 
collected.  
 
Clinical care providers for the study subjects and study team members will not have access to the PCT or CRP 
measurements until all study data and sample collection is complete. Subjects will not be informed of their individual 
PCT or CRP measurements.  
 
5.8 Carbon isotope measurement  
Measuring  breath carbon isotope concentration  
Please see Isomark’s Lab Manual for complete instructions.  Collected breath samples will be shipped  to Isomark with in 
[ADDRESS_556189] v ia a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_54609], such as UPS or FedEx, to Isomark’s breath analysis lab. 
If multiple subjects are enrolled, then shipments should be made once per week. Isomark personnel will ana lyze the 
isotope ratio. Some of the gas sample will be withdrawn from the gas  tight bag by [CONTACT_438923].  The 13CO2/12CO2 ratio in 
each sample will be determined  from direct measurement.  BDV will be calculated using Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) as a 
standard  reference:  
 
BDV  = (13CO2/12CO2 sample - 13CO2/12CO2 PDB)  X 1000  
13CO2/12CO2 PDB 
 
where BDV is expressed as parts per mil  (‰).

 Heart rate  
 Systolic blood pressure  
 Conscious level  
 Temperature  
 Hourly urine output (for previous 2 hours)  
 
Antibiotic Use  
It is intended that subjects should not have an infection at the time of enrollment. Additionally, subjects should not be 
on a known course of antibiotic s or antimicrobials within the seven  days prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438891].   
 
Subsequent to enrollment, a s ubject  who is discove red to have received systemic continuous antibiotic  therapy within 
the seven  days prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438892], and will be withdrawn from the 
study . Perio perative antibiotics a dministered as routine standard of care are per mitted.  
 
Source documents  
Source documents are the medical record(s) of a patient who ha s agreed to participate as a study subject. Examples of 
these original documents and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_438893], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medico technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Source data  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents.  
 
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 24 of 35 Infection  
Any known or suspected infection , per the discretion of the investigator or attending physician(s) should be 
documented. If  the subject has a  known or suspected infection prior to consent/enrollment, the subject will not be 
eligible for study participation. If the subject has a known or suspected infection after enrollment,  the p rincipal 
findings leading to an infection diagnosis , clinical sus pi[INVESTIGATOR_438894], shall be documented.  
 
7.0 Data analysis and statistical considerations  
7.1 Sample size determination  
For trauma patients  admitted to an ICU, t he mean overall nosocomial infection rate is 6 to 18% .(9, 19, 20) The 
incidence rate of infection could be greater for all surgical ICU patient s. Data collected to date indicate that a 
sustained decrease  in BDV of 2.0‰ or more  correlates with the onset of infection when the subject  is used as his-her 
control. The average intra  subject  standard deviation (SD) across time points in 32 mechanically ventilated subjects 
previously studied was 1.16‰, regardless of the underlying medical conditions. The inter  subject  SD is expected to be 
1.5‰ at most. Using the  BDV measurements during the breath sample monitoring period ( breath sample assess ment s 
every 4 hours), the expected overall SD of the mean  BDV measurements (across time points) is less than 1.5‰.  
 
Furthermore, during the monitoring period,  the mean difference in the BDV between subjects who are diagnosed with 
a nosocomial infection an d subjects not diagnosed with an infection is expected to be 2.0‰ or more  (primary 
hypothesis). This difference will be considered to be the minimum difference with  clinical import ance .  
 
Assuming that 5% of the subjects will have a confirmed nosocomial infection over the monitoring period and an 
overall standard deviation of 1.5‰, a total sample size of 100 subjects (5 infected and 95 non -infected) is required to 
detect a minimum clinically -important difference of 2.0‰ with at least 80% power at the two -sided 5% significance 
level.  
 
If the actual rate of nosocomial infections is 10%, then the proposed total sample size of 100 subjects will provide 98% 
power to detect a mean difference of 2.0‰. Assuming SD to be 1.5‰ (at most) for the change in BDV before and after 
the diagnosis of an infection is made, a total sample size of 100 subjects and an infection rate of 5%, a mean decrease 
of 2.0‰ prior to  and after the confirmed infection will be  detected with 79% power at the one  sided 5% significance 
level (secondary hypothesis).  
 
If the rate of nosocomial infections is 10%, then the mean decrease of 2.0‰ will be detected with 99% power. The 
proposed sample size of 100 subjects is sufficient to provide accuracy in estimating the spe cificity of the BDV analyzer. 
That is, with a sample size of 100 and assuming that 95% of the subjects will have no confirmed nosocomial infection, 
the specificity will be estimated with a standard error of less than 5% , and the 95% confidence interval of the 
estimated specificity will be no greater  than 20%.  
 
To account for a missing value rate  -- due to study withdrawal  (see 5.12 Withdrawal  of subjects)  or infection failure  of 
up to 10%, the total enrollment target is  110.  
 
The goal sample size of [ADDRESS_556196] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum; 
frequencies and percentages may be displayed for categorical data.  
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page [ADDRESS_556197] will be used to compare the averaged (across time points) BDV between subjects who are diagnos ed 
with an infection , without an infection , with sepsis and without sepsis . A linear mixed effects model with subject  
specific random effects will be used to compare BDV measurements between infected and non -infected and septic 
and non -septic subjects. Thi s model will be also used to estimate the intra - and inter -subject variability of the BDV 
measurements. A paired t -test will be used to compare the BDV measurements prior to  and after a diagnosis of 
infection or sepsis . Fisher’s exact test and the Kappa st atistic will be used to evaluate the relationship between a 
positive indication of infection by [CONTACT_438925] a diagnosis of infection or sepsis in the subsequent 72 hours. 
Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and co rresponding 95% confidence interval 
will be calculated.

9.0 Adverse events and unanticipated problems   
9.1 Definitions  
Definitions are guided by [CONTACT_438927] [21  CFR § 312.32].  
 
Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or study subject who is a dministered a 
pharmaceutical product or medical device that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to this treatment or 
device. An AE could be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or 
disease tempor ally associated with the use of an investigational medical product, whether or not considered related 
to the investigational medical product. This definition includes illnesses or injuries, and exacerbations of pre -existing 
conditions.  
 
Serious adverse eve nt (SAE)  
CANARY01  | Protocol  (version date 15 -AUG -2016 ) page 27 of 35 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 results in death  
 is life threatening (i.e. the subject  was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred)  
 requires or prolongs h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (i.e. the event causes a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or  
 is an important and significant medical event (e.g. allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse) that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
defining SAE.  
 
Unanticipated adverse device event  (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device event  (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life threatening 
problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a medical device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity or degree of inci dence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety or welfare of clinical trial subjects.  
 
9.2 Severity as sessment  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_438895]’s independent medical monitors will determine the severity  of each AE using the 
following terms and definitions:  
 
Mild:  An AE that was transient and required no special treatment, and did not interfere with usual or normal 
activities  
Moderate:  An AE that interfered with usual or normal activities but was ameliorated by [CONTACT_438928] : An AE that was intense or  debilitating, and which interfered with usual or normal activities. Recovery 
was aided by [CONTACT_123768]. Discontinuation of investigational medical product administration or use 
might have been required . 
Life threatening : An AE that may result in i mmediate risk of death from the event as it occurred and requires 
immediate intervention to prevent the outcome of death (This AE will be recorded as a SAE) . 
Death:  An AE that results in death of the subject  (This AE will be recorded as a SAE) . 
 
ICU subjec ts are expected to have SAEs related to their medical condition. Those expected SAEs associated with the 
underlying disease are to be reported in an expedited manner if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator of the study site is unable to 
rule out the involvement of th e Canary . SAEs listed below are expected and will be recorded in the study record, but 
will not be reported in an expedited manner to Iso mark: 
 
urinary tract infection; acute kidney injury; acute renal failure; acute lung injury; adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_239127]; hypotension; metabolic acidosis; hypothermia; coagulation dysfunction; decreased platelet count; 
diffuse intravascular coagulation; thromboembolic event (pulmonary embolus; deep vein thrombosis; cerebral

Isomark, wit h the exception of SAEs that are specifically attributed to underlying disease.  
 
Role of Iso mark 
Isomark will report to the investigators of the study site(s) all SAEs that are unexpected and associated with use of the 
Isomark Canary , or UADEs.  
 
Isomark assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of SAEs to regulatory agencies.  Sites should follow their 
individual reporting guidelines to their local regulatory agencies.  
 
The PI, the study independent medical monitor, and the sponsor will be the prim ary data and safety advisory group for 
the study.  
 
The study will include interim review of actual and projected subject accrual rates, subject demographics, and a 
number and severity of AEs. The PI, the study independent medical monitor, and the sponsor will collaboratively 
determine actions of continuation, modification, or termination of the study.

Plan (DMP) for additional details.  
 
10.1 Endpoint assessment, adjudication  
An endpoint assessment and adjudication committee (EAC) of three clinicians will review study recorded infections 
and sepsis diagnoses to determine accuracy of protocol  specified criteria  and to determine and develop criteria for 
BDV clinical use . None of the EAC will have been directly involved with care of the patient who is a study subject. 
Information t o be reviewed may include clinical laboratory, pathology or imaging data, autopsy reports, physical 
descriptions, and other data deemed relevant. The EAC will be blinded to BDVs, and will not know if BDV changed for a 
particular subject.  EAC members will r eceive de -identified study records, and will not receive study subject PHI.   
 
Each EAC member will independently  review study subjects’ data to determine their infection status. The decision of 
the subject ’s infection status will be recorded in the EAC Infection Status case report form . The EAC’s charter will 
outline their role as an EAC member, guidelines for completing the Infection Status case report form, and definitions 
that should be utilized and followed for the purposes of this study protocol.

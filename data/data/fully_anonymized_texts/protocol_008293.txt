STUDY M18 -918  |  Version 5.[ADDRESS_391370] under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
(MS).  It is a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype that binds 
specifically to the soluble and the membrane -bound forms of repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa).
Neutralization of RGMa is a novel approach that may potentially provide neurorestoration/regeneration 
and functional recovery in a variety of degenerative central nervo us system (CNS) diseases.  Repulsive 
guidance molecule A is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and is recognized as an important factor 
in inhibiting neuronal regeneration and functional recovery following CNS trauma or inflammation.  
Elezanumab binds to human repulsive guidance molecule A (hRGMa), but not to related family members 
RGMb and RGMc.
Elezanumab is being evaluated to determine whether this novel approach of neutralization of RGMa 
could lead to neural restoration and improvement in MS -relate d physical function.  This mechanism of 
action is distinct from those used by [CONTACT_318018], anti -inflammatory drugs that are currently 
approved for the treatment of MS and, if successful, could serve to fulfill an unmet medical need in MS.
Clinical Hypothesis
Elezanumab will improve physical functioning in subjects with relapsing forms of MS ( RMS ) who have 
disability.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The safety and efficacy data from the elezanumab clinical program support development of elezanumab
in Phase 2 in subjects with RMS .
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the elezanumab 
Investigator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_391371] of the study.
Considering the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study have been re-evaluated.  Management of these adverse events (AEs) will be 
made on a case -by-case basis with consideration of benefit/risk.  However, based on the limited 
information to date, the population and disease being studied, and the anticipation that 
COVID -19-related risks are not expected to differ substantially between study subjects and the broader 
population of subjects receiving treatment for MS, no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in 
this study is expected at this time.

3.1 Objective
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in subjects with RMS .
3.2 Primary Endpoint
Primary endpoint:
Mean Overall Response Score (ORS) at Week 52.
ORS is a composite score derived from 4 components: 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW)
9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT -D)
9HPT in the non -dominant hand (9HPT -ND)
The ORS is scored with a range from –4 to +4 at each assessment.  Scores for each component 
are assessed relative to their basel ine value:  –1 if there is clinically significant worsening, 0 if the 
change does not meet the clinically significant threshold criteria, or +1 if there is clinically 
significant improvement.  The scores for all components are summed at each assessment.
The clinically significant change thresholds for T25FW and 9HPT are defined by a 20% change 
from baseline ( ≥ 20% decrease from baseline for improvement and ≥ 20% increase from 
baseline for worsening).  For EDSS , improvement is defined as a 1 -point decrease (baseline EDSS 
range of 1 to 5.5), or 0.5 -point decrease if the baseline EDSS is 6.0 or greater (baseline EDSS 
range of 6.0 to 6.5).  Corresponding increases in the designated ranges is defined as EDSS 
worsening.
3.3 Secondary Endpoints
1.Disability improvement response rate on the Expanded Disability Status Scale Plus (EDSS +) 
(T25FW, [ADDRESS_391372] [9HPT, either hand], EDSS) at Week 52
2.ORS at Weeks 12, 24, and 36
3.4 Safety Endpoints
Safety evaluations include AE monitoring, serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring , adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) monitoring, physical examinations, neurologic examinations, vital sign 
measurements, clinically significant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, electrocardiogram 
(ECG) variables, Columbia -Suicide Seve rity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) assessments, and clinical laboratory

duration.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Samples will be collected for serum elezanumab c oncentrations, elezanumab anti -drug antibody (ADA) 
titers, and elezanumab neutralizing ADAs.  Samples will be obtained at the visits indicated in Figure 1
and Appendix D.  Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all serum elezanumab
concentrations.  Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
3.6 Biomarker Research Endpoints for Target Engagement and Neuro -
restoration
Blood samples including serum and plasma will be collected at specified time poin ts (Appendix D) 
throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related and target engagement 
biomarkers and their response to treatment.  Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  Biomarker endpoints may include ,but arenot restricted to RGMa, 
neurofilament light (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuro -restoration markers 
[e.g., microRNA -338 (miR -338), myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), growth 
associated protein -43 (GAP -43), brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin -10 (IL -10)] that 
may be measured as extravesicular protein and/or nucleic acid cargoes in the plasma.  Other biomarkers 
that may be examined in the blood include matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP -9) and chemokine (C -X-C 
motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), which have been shown to be elevated in MS patients.  DNA and RNA samples 
(transcriptional profiling) will be collected and may be analyzed from all subjects, unless precluded by 
[CONTACT_318019].  This research may be exploratory in nature and the results may not be 
included with the clinical study report.

This study will include an approximate 30 -day Screening period.  The Treatment Period will include 
14visits from Baseline (Week 0) every 4weeks through Week 52.  Doses will be administered via 
Intrav enous (IV) infusion at Week 0 (Baseline) and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48 for a total 
of 13 doses.  The follow -up period includes 6 follow -up telephone calls that will occur at 
Weeks 56through 76.  All visits during the Treatment Period and Fo llow -up Period will be allowed a 
window of ± [ADDRESS_391375] results, ECG, and vital signs will 
be monitored (see Operations Manual [Appendix F]).  Throughout the study and for a period of 
39weeks ( 5half-lives) after the time of last study drug administration, females of childbearing potential 
will undergo monthly pregnancy testing; and for all subjects, AEs will be collected, whether solicited or 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].
Eligible subjects will be randomized at theWeek 0 -Baseline Visit to receive either elezanumab  
 as an IV infusion or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (Section 5.8and Section 7.3).  Blinded doses will 
be administered int ravenously every 4 weeks for 48 weeks.  Subjects should remain on their current MS 
treatment regimen throughout the study.

immunomodulators for > 6 months will be included as will subjects not receiving immunomodulators 
but who are relapse -free (RF) for > 6months.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose levels of  monthly for this study were selected on th e basis of safety and 
biomarker data from two Phase 1 clinical studies.
The safety and tolerability of elezanumab has been demonstrated in ~50 healthy volunteers and 
~[ADDRESS_391377] to the nature or frequency of 
treatment -emergent AEsfollowing IV infusion or subcutaneous (SC) injection of elezanumab compared 
with subjects who received placebo.  Adverse events were, in general, mild, sporadic, and self- limiting.  
No dose -related effect was observed with respect to AEs.  No other safety findings were observed, 
including clinical labs, physical and neurological examination, MRI, and ECGs.
In Study M14 -173, single doses of up to  (  infusions on 2consecutive days) and monthly 
doses of up to  were administered to MS patients for up to [ADDRESS_391378] to the nature or frequency of 
treatment -emergent AEsin subjects who received elezanumab compared with subjects who received 
placebo.  A possible transient, non –dose -related, non -clinically significant elevation in blood pressure 
immediately following IV infusion was observed in a few subjects who received elezanumab.  There 
were no notable changes on physical or neurological exam, and no ECG, MRI, clinical laboratory, or 
other vital sign perturbations.  Adverse events, when reported, were mild, sporadic, and self -limiting 
with the exception of two MS relapses that occurred in 1subject receiving placebo and another 
receiving  elezanumab.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Two prespecified cerebrosp inal fluid (CSF) biomarkers demonstrated a concentration -response 
relationship in the Phase 1 studies.  Interleukin -10has been associated with the promotion of 
remyelination, neuroregeneration ,and neuroprotection as well as being able to mitigate inflamm atory 
demyelination.  In Study M14 -173, a statistically significant increase in CSF IL -10 was observed.  The 
increase was observed only in the high dose of  monthly.  Likewise, in the same study, a 
statistically significant decrease in CSF neurofila ment light (NF -l), a marker of neurodegeneration, was 
observed at the  dose when compared with the  dose group.  These data suggest a 
clinically relevant, dose -related pharmacodynamic effect.  Reductions in CSF soluble RGMa were 
observed in bo th Studies M14 -141 and M14 -173.  The maximum reduction was approximately 50% from 
baseline, and the maximum reduction was seen at single doses equal to and exceeding  in 
healthy volunteers and repeat doses equal to or exceeding  monthly in MS patients.  It is 
noteworthy that the maximum CSF reduction in soluble RGMa was achieved in the  dose group, 
which was characterized by a range of CSF ABT -555 concentrations from .  The 
relationship of sRGMa reduction and clinical ef ficacy is not understood.
The elezanumab doses selected for the current study are  every 28 days (Q28D) and 
are expected to be safe and well tolerated based on previous exposures of these doses in healthy 
volunteers and MS patients.  In addition, to ensure patient safety, intense patient safety monitoring 
procedures have been implemented.  An unblinded inte rnal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) , 
independent from the study team, will review and evaluate safety information including ,but not limited 
to AEs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory assessments.

STUDY M18 -918  |  Version 5.[ADDRESS_391407] Identifier Assignment
An interactive response technology (IRT) system will assign a unique identification number to each 
subject at the Screening Visit.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, site personnel 
must register the subject as a screen failure in the IRT system.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain the subject number assigned to them at Screening Visit throughout 
the study.
Interactive response technology Vendor contact [CONTACT_318028].
Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Eligible subjects will receive either elezanumab  or placebo as an IV infusion at a 
constant rate by [CONTACT_318029] [ADDRESS_391408] minute as well.  Blinded doses will be administered intravenously every 
4weeks for 48 weeks (13 total infusions).
Study Drug Accountability
The in vestigator or his representative will verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in the 
correct amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_41143] a proof of receipt or similar document.  
A current (running) and accurate inventory of stud y drug will be maintained in the IRT system.
Throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit, overall accountability will be performed and 
verified by [CONTACT_318030] (CRA) (Pharmacy CRA).
The unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee will be responsible for maintaining study drug 
preparation records and drug accountability records for study drug as well as the saline IV solution 
dispensed by [CONTACT_779], including product description, manufacturer, and lot numbers. Further details are 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.
Study Blinding
Subjects in the placebo group will be administered 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection/Solution for Infusion 
that is identical in appearance and volume to the elezanumab solution.  An unblinde d pharmacist or 
qualified designee will receive assignments and prepare the blinded doses across the treatment groups.  
The investigator, study site personnel (except the unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee) and the 
subject will remain blinded to th e treatment assignment throughout the course of the study.
Because of the blinding of this study, deliveries of elezanumab and 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection/Solution, if applicable, will be shipped directly to the pharmacy.  The unblinded pharmacist or 
qualified designee will prepare the dosing of elezanumab (in a blinded manner) following the available 
preparation instructions in the Pharmacy Manual and based on the subject's assigned treatment group.  
Page 23 of 103 

STUDY M18 -918  |  Version 5.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].For blinding purposes, identical commercial 0.9% Sodi um Chloride Injection/Solution for Infusion bag or 
bottle will be used in the placebo and elezanumab arms at each site.
For investigational product monitoring, there will be an unblinded [COMPANY_013] CRA (also referred to as a 
Pharmacy CRA) for verification of u nblinded preparation documentation.  The unblinded Pharmacy CRA 
will be a separate individual than the blinded CRA to ensure blinding is maintained.
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception o f [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team, the unblinded CRA and the [COMPANY_013] safety review 
group), the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's 
treatment throughout the study.
The IRT will provide access to unblin ded subject treatment information in the case of a medical 
emergency.
[COMPANY_013] must be notified before breaking the blind, unless identification of the study drug is required for 
a medical emergency, i.e., situation in which the knowledge or the specific blinded treatment will affect 
the immediate management of the subject's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  [COMPANY_013] must then 
be notified within [ADDRESS_391409] be recorded in the s ource documentation and on the eCRF, as applicable.
5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_391410]'s assigned treatment group.  The 
use of the IRT system is described in the Operations Manual Section 3.15 ( Appendix F).
Randomization (Section 7.3) will be stratified between treatment and placebo arms based on t he 
following factors:
Diagnosis of primary -progressive MS (PPMS) vs. SPMS
Presence or absence of background MS immunotherapy
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including thos e that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic ), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

STUDY M18 -918  |  Version 5.[ADDRESS_391411]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of th is investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properl y, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a s atisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event
An AEis defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEson a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEswill be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AEif the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre planned before study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during 
the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associat ed with the study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (CRO) (as appropriate)
as anSAE within 24 hours ofthe site's being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.2 of the 
Operations Manual (Appendix F)for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]):

an emergency room visit or visi t to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Med ical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Add itionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEsreported from the time of study drug administration up to 39 weeks (5 half -lives) from the last 
dose of study drug (Week 48 visit) will be collect ed, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_1560].  In addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEswill be collected from the time the 
subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the IMP in accordance with global and local requirements.  Additional information about S[LOCATION_003]R 
reporting is presented in the Operations Manual (Appendix F)Section 5.2 S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate , or severe.  The investigator will use 
the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Page 26 of 103 
STUDY M18 -918  |  Version 5.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Mild:   The AEis transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate:   The AEcauses the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities .
Severe:   The AEcauses considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be 
incapacitating or life -threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AEto the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Po ssibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting predefined criteria, specific questionnaires will be used to 
standar dize the collection of follow -up information.  The AESI questionnaires will be issued within the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system once applicable.  The investigator will enter the information into 
the EDC system once applicable.
The following AESI will be monitored during the study:
Infusion reactions
Further information about AESIs is provided in the Operations Manual (Appendix F)Section 4.1.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_391413] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, s tillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
statistical analysis plan ( SAP).  The SAP will be finalized before the interim database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North C arolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Sets
The Modified I TT (mITT) Setincludes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Subjects will be grouped according to treatment as randomized. 
Multiple sclerosis expert(s) will confirm which subjects experienced a clinical relapse(s) through 
adjudication of study data, including the MS -relapse questionnaire.  The RFSetincludes all subjects in 
the mITT data set without any MS -related relapse during the Treatment Period (from Week 0 to 
Week 52). Subjects will be grouped according to treatment as randomized.
The Minimal Missed Infusion Analysis (MMIA) Set includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
[ADDRESS_391414]'s fina l dose.  Subjects will be 
grouped according to treatment as randomized.
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  Subjects will be 
grouped according to treatment received regardless of randomization.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
The ORS scores will be summarized descriptively (including n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum) along with the 95% confidence interval at each visit.  The frequency and 
percentage of ORS for –4 to +[ADDRESS_391415] model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment group, visit, treatment -by-visit in teraction, and 
stratification factors as fixed effects, with the baseline values for the ORS components ascovariates.
For other continuous efficacy endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum will be reported for each treatment gr oup.  The treatment comparison will be conducted 
using MMRM model including treatment group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and stratification 
factors as fixed effects and the baseline value associated with the endpoint as a covariate.
For binary e fficacy endpoints, the frequency and percentage will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  The 
treatment comparison will be conducted using a logistic regression model adjusted for the stratification 
factors and baseline score associated with the endpoint.
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on mITT population.  The RF and MMIA Sets will be used for the 
primary and other efficacy analyses as specified in the SAP.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 165 subjects will be equally randomized 1:1:1 (55 subjects in each treatment group , with 
atarget of 20 SPMS subjects and approximately 35 RRMS subjects per treatment group).  There are
limited prior data to estimate the magnitude of effect and variance for a neurorestorative therapy.  The 
sample size was therefore selected based on operational feasibility, variance seen in prior MS trials, and 
the likelihood of predicting success in subsequent phases of development. 
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Analysis of the following safety evaluations will be performed dur ing the study:  Adverse events and 
SAEs ,vital signs, laboratory tests, ECG, physical and neurologic examinations, and C -SSRS assessments.
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis of safety evaluations will be described and fully

Protocol Summary of Changes
The purpose of this version is the removal of on -site assessments performed at Week s64 and 76 so that 
all visits in the Follow -up period can be conducted virtually.   Other administrative revisions were made 
throughout the protocol, including the synopsis, and to the Operations Manual, to ensure consistency 
with the changes below:
1.Protocol Section 4.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, Figure 1. Study Schematic and Protocol 
Appendix D. Activity Schedule: Remove Week s64 and 76 as an on -site visit. 
2.Update to Appendix F, Operations Manual: Section 2.1, Individual Treatment Period Visit 
Activities and Section 2.2, Individual Post -Treatme nt Period Visit Activities (Week 64 and 
Week 76) to remove vital signs, EDSS, T25FW, 9HPT, urine drug and alcohol test, PK and ADA 
sample collections; Section 3.6 Scales and Questionnaires table to remove EDSS T25FW, 9HPT 
from Follow -up at Weeks 64 and 76.
Rationale:
By [CONTACT_36466] 2021, all study subjects had completed 52 weeks of therapy.  A recent, planned efficacy 
analysis revealed that elezanumab therapy provided no beneficial effects.  A lack of efficacy was 
observed on all endpoints.
The study initially had scheduled in person site visits at Week 64 and Week 76.  The purpose of these 
visits was to perform assessment of the primary endpoint to better understand the durability of 
improvement observed at Week 52.  Because there were no beneficial drug effects at Week 52, there is 
no scientific purpose to having the subjects return for in person visits.  The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic 
also provides a strong justification for NOT having subjects perform unneeded in person site visits.
The collection of safety -related information by [CONTACT_122919] 4 weeks through Week 76, including AEs, 
C-SSRS assessments, and pregnancy testing results will continue.

3.4 Adverse Event Assessment
Please refer to Section 4.1.
3.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Investigators and/or trained site staff will review and record all prior and concomitant medications at 
every visit throughout the study as shown in Section 2.  Refer to the protocol Section 5.4, Prior and 
Concomitant Therapy, for additional information. 
Subjects who are currently receiving intravenous (IV) MS immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., ocrelizumab) should 
not receive these agents on the same day as study drug infusion at Week 0.  On subsequent study visits, 
subjects receiving IV immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_318012] (2) hours after 
the completion of investigational p roduct infusion.  Exceptions to the [ADDRESS_391445] two (2) times prior and have no history of infusion 
reaction within the last 12 months in response to the immunotherapy.
Corticosteroids (or corticosteroid precursors such as a drenocorticotropic hormone ) are an allowed class 
of medication if used before or after ocrelizumab or other drug infusion to limit infusion reactions. Pre-
medication for study drug infusion is not allowed without the consent of the [COMPANY_013] study -designated 
physician.
3.6 Scales and Questionnaires
Diagnostic Tools and Rating Scales
Before the start of the study, designated raters will be certified/trained by [CONTACT_318034].  The objective of this certification/training is to establish uniformity acros s sites in the 
administration, interpretation and scoring of these rating instruments.  It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to ensure that the raters at his/her site are appropriately trained and certified in the use of 
selected rating scales.  Ev ery effort must be made by [CONTACT_318035].
Page [ADDRESS_391446] be approved by [CONTACT_318036].
Administration of selected scales will be audio recorded to allow for central review of the data and to 
ensure consistency and reliability.
Assessments will be performed at the times indicated in Section 2.
Subjects will complete the self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments (when 
allowed per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions 
provided with the instruments and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel 
shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the 
tasks.   Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read 
the questionnaire to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified 
visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
The following Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments will be used in this study:
Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS- 29), version 2:  The MSIS -29 version 2 consists of 
29questions; [ADDRESS_391447] describes their situation (1 = 1 not at all; 2 = a little; 3 = moderately; 4 = quite a bit; 
5 =extremely).  It should take [ADDRESS_391448] to complete the scale.
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS- 5):  The MFIS -[ADDRESS_391449] indicates on a 
scale from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always) how their fatigue has affected them over the past 
4weeks.  It should take [ADDRESS_391450] to complete this scale.
The following clinician -measured scales will be used in this study:
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS):  The C -SSRS is a systematically administered 
instrument developed to track suicidality across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed 
toassess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the 
lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include frequency, duration, controllability, 
reason for ideation, and deterrents.  The C -SSRS takes less than [ADDRESS_391451] suicidal ideation with plan within the prior month, either via 
answering "yes" to questions [ADDRESS_391452] at Screening or on Week 0 –Baseline 
will also be excluded from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Multiple Sclerosis Individualized Outcome A ssessment (MSIOA):  The MSIOA is a novel clinician-
reported outcome assessment that has been developed for this study to identify the impact of 
MS and MS treatment on an individual subject's activities of daily living across multiple domains.  
MS affects subjects differently and the importance of certain abilities is different for each 
subject.  This outcome will determine the areas of daily living (based on existing activities of 
daily living [ADLs] within the MSIS) that are most impacted and most importan t to each subject 
and these will be ranked on a standardized, ordinal rating scale and tracked during the course of 
the study.
Expanded Disability Status Scale Plus (EDSS+) is comprised of the following three scales:
EDSS:  The Expanded Disability Status S cale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in 
multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time.  The EDSS scale 
ranges from [ADDRESS_391453] the 
neurological examination and do the scoring.
Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW):  The T25FW quantifies the MS subject's mobility and leg 
function during a timed walk over a designated and clearly marked twenty -five foot course.  
The subject is to walk as quickly and safely as possible over the course to the designated 
twenty -five foot mark.  The walk is measured in seconds from the time the initial 
instructions are provided to the subject reaching the twenty -five foot mark.  The subject is 
then instructed to walk quickly and safely following the course back to the starting point.  
Again the time for the walk is recorded in seconds.  The T25FW will be conducted by a 
trained examiner.  The examiner does not necessarily have to be a nurse or physician.  
Assistive devices (i.e., cane, crutches, walker) may be used.  Scoring is the average of the 
two t rial walks.  Additional instructions will be provided for scoring of individuals unable to 
complete the walk due to severity of impairment.  Total time to administer the T25FW is 1 -
5 minutes.
9-Hole Peg Tests (9HPT):  The 9HPT is a standardized measure o f upper extremity mobility 
and will test both the dominant hand and non -dominant hand twice consecutively.  A 9HPT 
kit will be provided for the site to use in administration of this test while the subject is 
seated at a table.  The kit includes a shallow c ontainer in which [ADDRESS_391454], twice consecutively and then the non -
dominant hand will be tested twice consecutively.  For each hand, scoring is the average of 
the two trials.  The total time to administer the 9HPT is approximately 10 minutes or less.
Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LCVA):  The LCVA uses an eye chart specifically designed to test low 
contrast vision.  Subjects identify the letters on the chart and recite them to the tester.  
Instructions for the clinic setting use and specific lighting requirements will be provided to the 
site during training by [CONTACT_127261].  If possible, this test should be administered in the same room 
and with the same light level at each subject visit.  The rater vendor will also purchase and 
provide all relevant materials in order to support the Low Contrast Visual Acuity Test.  All 
Page [ADDRESS_391455] takes approximately 5 minutes to administer.
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT ) (oral):   Subjects are presented with a page headed by a key 
that pairs the single digits [ADDRESS_391456].
Brief Assessment of Cognition (BAC) App Verbal Memory Test (Immediate Recall):  The subject is 
to read words and is to recall and repea t the words back to the clinician.  It takes approximately 
[ADDRESS_391457].
BAC App Tower of London (BAC App ToL):  The subject is presented a diagram of two images, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] A and pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] B.  Both pi[INVESTIGATOR_318013].  
The subject is asked to identify how many moves it will take to make the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] A look like 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] B.  The test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
The PRO instruments and clinician -measured scales should be completed at the Week 0 –Baseline visit 
before any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings.  The PRO instruments and clinician 
measured scales should be completed at subsequent visits before any discussion of AEs, any review of 
laboratory findings, and before drug administration.
The following scale must be completed before IP infusion:
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The following scales should be completed before IP infusion:
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
Timed 25 -Foot Walk ( T25FW)
9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT -D)
9HPT in the non -dominant hand (9HPT -ND)
The following scales may be completed during IP infusion:
MS Impact Scale (MSIS -29)
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS- 5)
Multiple Sclerosis Individualized Outcome Assessment (MSIOA)
Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LCVA) –to be performed in a windowless room and using light box
The following scales may be completed at any time except during IP infusion:
All cognition scales
Page [ADDRESS_391458]'s responses.  The date and time of 
PRO data collection should be recorded along with who collected the information.  Once the subject is 
able to attend onsite visits, the highest priority for completing miss ed assessments from the previous 
visit is the EDSS, 9HPT, and T25FW and then, if time permits, any of the exploratory outcome measures. 
C-SSRS:  Preferred method is to collect data using direct entry into the iPad provided by [CONTACT_127261]. 
Paper assessment ca n be utilized as a backup plan in event the tablet is not available at the time 
of the assessment.
MSIS -29 and MFIS -5:  Assessments will be collected using paper assessment forms provided by 
[CONTACT_318037].

Collection of Blood Samples for Elezanumab Assay
Blood samples for analysis of elezanumab serum concentrations will be collected before infusion at 
Week 0 -Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, and Early Discontinuation.  PK samples should not be drawn 
from the same arm (or port) in which elezanumab is administered.  Samples will be collected by
[CONTACT_51036], evacuated serum collection tubes.
Collection of Blood Samples for Elezanumab Antidrug Antibody (ADA) Assay and Elezanumab 
Neutralizing Antibody (nAb) Assay
Blood samples for elezanumab ADA assay and elezanumab nAb assay will be collected before infusion at 
Week 0 –Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, and Early Discontinuation.
Additional information on the disposition, handling, and measurement methods can be found in the 
Covance Laboratory Manual.
Serum concentrations of elezanumab and relative titers of elezanumab ADA will be determined using 
validated methods at or under the supervision of the Bioanalysis Department at [COMPANY_013].  Any additional 
analytes may be analyzed using non -validated methods.  Serum samples coll ected for elezanumab and 
elezanumab ADA analysis may be used for future assay development or validation activities.  
Elezanumab nAb samples may be used for the analysis of neutralizing anti -drug antibodies.
3.8 Biomarker Sampling
Whole blood samples will be co llected for biomarker research (protocol Section 3.6, Biomarker 
Sampling).  Please refer to Section 2for the schedule of biomarker research sample collections.  All 
biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific Covance Laboratory 
Manual.
3.9 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Section 2.  The ECG should 
be performed before blood collection.
An appropriately trained physician at the site ("local reader") will evaluate the ECGs.  In a timely manner 
following the performance of the ECG, the local reader will sign and date all ECG tracings and will 
provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following 
categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically si gnificant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significant

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine -generated measurements and interpretation that are 
automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
COVID -[ADDRESS_391462] will wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.  BMI 
calcu lations will be done at the Screening Visit to assess Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_391463] 3 minutes both before infusion and at the end 
of infusion.  Repeat vital sign determinations should be taken from the same extremity as initial 
determination.
Following infusion, if the blood pressure is elevated above 160 mmHg systolic (and 20 mmHg over pre -
infusion value) OR 105 diastolic (and 15 mmHg over pre -infusion value), then the heart rate and blood 
pressure measurement should be repeated.  If the blood pressure remains elevated above these 
thresholds, the investigator should repeat the measurement after one hour.  If the elevation persists, 
the investig ator should further assess and manage the subject according to standard of care.  If the 
subject is symptomatic (e.g., chest pain, headache, neurologic symptoms, visual disturbances, 
perturbations in other vital signs) or has cardiovascular comorbidities o f concern, an ECG, additional 
cardiac monitoring, and treatment with anti -hypertensive agents at the site or emergency care setting 
should be considered.  If a subject leaves the site with a blood pressure exceeding the above thresholds,

A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in 
Section 2.  Height and body weight will be measured at Screening in order to calculate body mass index 
(BMI).  Body weight will also be measured at Week 0 – Baseline and at each treatment visit or upon 
subject discontinuation.  The subject will wear lightweight clothing and not wear shoes when taking 
height and weight at Screening and when taking weight at subsequent visits.  The physical examination 
performed on We ek 0 –Baseline will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study.  
Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as AEs.  All findings, 
whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical his tory, will be captured on the appropriate 
eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].

The neurological examination will assess:
Mental status – assessment of orientation, speech, and memory.
Cranial nerves –assessment of cranial nerves II -XII.
Motor system –assessment of tone and strength, including assessment for tremor.
Sensory system –assessment of light touch, temperature and distal proprioception
Reflexes –assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign)
Coordination –assessment of upper and lower extremities

A wearable sensor will be used (when allowed per local regulatory guideli nes) to enable data capture on 
actigraphy (activity, rest cycles) and daily step count.  If regulatory approval in a participating country 
has not been received by [CONTACT_3455], actigraphy data monitoring will not be done in that country.  
The actigrap hy assessment will use BioStamp nPoint, which is a wireless remote monitoring platform 
intended for use by [CONTACT_318038].  BioStamp nPoint is des igned to capture objective, 
real-world data from study subjects participating in clinical or academic studies and may be used 
wherever collection of relevant data is needed.  BioStamp nPoint centers on body -worn BioStamp 
Sensors that can be worn for up to 24 hours at a time. 
When BioStamp nPoint is used in the home or outside of the clinic ("Remote") setting, study subjects 
interact with the system through a Mobile Phone Application called the "Link App."  The recharging and 
data transmission hub ("Link Hu b") is used to recharge the sensors and synchronize data from the 
Sensors.  The system is also capable of surface electromyography (sEMG) and monitoring limb and body 
movements during daily living and sleep.  Training will be provided to site staff with in structions for 
subject use.  Refer to Section 2for the required administration times. 
COVID -[ADDRESS_391468] Numbers and Use of Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT)
Cont act information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site.
At the Screening visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT 
system.  
IRT has adopted the following numbering convention:
1stdigit -Lead 1
2nd, 3rd, and 4thdigits –3 digit site # 100 –199 (sequence for Canada begins with 200)
5thand 6thdigits –sequential subject number
For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must update the IRT 
system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening visit throughout the 
study.  
Upon receipt of study drug, the site unblinded pharmacist will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.

or require further action to be taken, and therefore, may need to be reported as AEs.  Accordingly, for 
any values outside of the reference range, the investigator will indicate on the r eport if the result is 
clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  If a laboratory abnormality meets criteria for a 
potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory value, as defined in Appendix B,the investigator must 
either report an associated AE or document in source the reason(s) the finding was not considered an 
AE. 
Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at Completion/Early Discontinuation and was judged to be 
CS, will be followed according to accepted medical standards until resolution of the abnormality.
Pregnancy Tests (Serum and Urine)
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participat ion or continuation in this study.
Pregnancy testing should not be performed for postmenopausal females.  Determination of 
postmenopausal status is made during screening based on the subject's history.  
A quantitative serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at the Week 0 –Baseline visit for all female of childbearing potential subjects.
The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the serum 
pregnancy test is positive, the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is 
borderline, it should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_391471] is:
Positive, the subject is considered a screen fai lure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
Borderline > [ADDRESS_391472] can be enrolled into the study (unless prohibited per local requirements) 
inthe absence of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_318015].
Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed at visits indicated in the Activity Schedule.  The 
results of the monthly at home pregnancy tests must be communicated to the site.  More frequent 
pregnancy tests can be performed throughout the study at the investigator's discretion or if required 
per local/country requirements.
If the baseline urine pregnancy test is negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.
If the baseline or post -baseline urine pregnancy test is positive, dosing with study drug must be 
withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required (as stated above).

3.17 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Preparation for the MRI exam before the subject's arrival is critical in order to ensure that all scans can 
be acquired within the allotted time frame and for accommodation of any unforeseen delays.  MRI 
scanner must have a magnetic field strength of 1.[ADDRESS_391474] clinical practice to all subjects.  
The subjects will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_318016] a head coil 
with appropriate foam padding to minimize movement during the scan and to standardize the 
orientation of the head.  The subjects will then be positioned within the MRI scanner for imagi ng.  Scans 
that are of poor quality (e.g., due to head motion during the scan, inadequate coverage of the brain, 
improper positioning of the head, use of incorrect scan or geometry parameters, or noisy image) as 
determined by [CONTACT_46168], reviewin g radiologist or sponsor, will be repeated at earliest time 
possible and within [ADDRESS_391475] any sedation medication on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  The MRI tech nician is 
responsible for performing brain MRI scans at all protocol -required time points. 
During the course of the study, MRI scans will be performed at three time points:  at Screening (Baseline 
MRI), Week 24 and Week 52/Early Discontinuation.  The screening MRI will be evaluated by [CONTACT_318041]'s report reviewed by [CONTACT_318042] [ADDRESS_391476]'s eligibility.  For the subjects enrolled in the study, the Screening MRI will

± 7days.  MRI scans from all protocol -required time points will be evaluated by a local radiologist, and 
the local radiologist's reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_779] i nvestigator for disease activity.  Sites should 
use the same local radiologist to evaluate all the MRI collected through the entire duration of the study 
to the extent possible. 
The MRI scans will include all or a subset of the following parameters:
3D T1 weighted
T2 FLAIR
MTR
PD/T2
T1 post Gadolinium
DTI
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_318017], the MRI scanner, associated equipment and imaging parameters may not be

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Ac ceptable Protocol Modifications
MRI assessments may be collected up to 12 weeks after the projected visit for the missed time points at 
Weeks 24 and 52 with the sponsor's consent due to reasons related to the COVID -[ADDRESS_391477] volume of projected Week 52 MRIs in December 2020, at the 
discretion of the sponsor, sites may schedule Week 52 M RIs up to –[ADDRESS_391478] or qual ified designee will 
dispense the blinded study solution to the clinic staff for IV administration to subjects beginning at the 
Week 0 –Baseline visit after all other Week 0 –Baseline procedures are completed.  
Each site will be responsible for maintaining drug accountability records including product description, 
manufacturer, and lot numbers for all non- investigational products dispensed by [CONTACT_779].  
Further information about study drug is in protocol Section 5.7.
COVID -[ADDRESS_391479] will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best 
clinical judgment.
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at a ny time.  In addition, the investigator may 
discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, 
including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
Severe allergic reactions or other adverse events that require the immediate interruption of elezanumab 
treatment will be taken into consideration by [CONTACT_318043] l therapy and follow -up.
Any treatment -emergent, clinically significant, symptomatic neurological abnormalities and treatment -
emergent MRI findings will be reported to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD and subjects will be considered for 
discontinuation from treatment if c linically indicated.
Subjects at risk of suicide as indicated by [CONTACT_318044] 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS and/or 
determined by [CONTACT_318045], should be promptly referred for appropriate 
follow -up care.  Subjects determined to be at ongoing risk of suicide should be discontinued from study 
participation.
If a subject has a positive drug screen, including for amphetamines, cannabis, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], the subject will be discontinued from study participation unless allowed to be taken in 
accordance with a physician's prescription.   
If for any reason the subject becomes unable to continue treatment with elezanumab (other than 
missed doses due to COVID -19 pandemic modification), undergo protocol required procedures, or 
otherwise continue to participate in the study, discontinuation should be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA 
MD.
In the event that a subject withdraws or undergoes early discontinuation from the study, the primary 
reason for discontinuation and any other rea son(s) for the discontinuation from the study will be 
recorded and the Early Discontinuation assessment will be performed as per Section 2and proto col 
Appendix D, Activity Schedule.  The Early Discontinuation visit should be performed as soon as possible, 
preferably within 2 weeks, after discontinuation from the study.  Additional blood samples for drug 
measurement may be collected at the time of discontinuation from subjects who are discontinued due 
to adverse events; the clock time, time in relation to dose and date the sample was taken will be 
recorded.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved labor atory 
result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow -
up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.

Preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_391480] as quickly as possible, 
preferably within no more than seven (7) days of onset of relapse symptom s.  During each suspected 
relapse, the blinded physician investigator will determine the nature of the relapse and conduct a full 
neurological assessment before reviewing previous neurological assessments.  After completing the 
neurological assessment and the source document, the blinded physician investigator may then discuss 
the new neurological symptoms with the subject.  The study nurse/coordinator may then provide the 
previous neurological examination document to the blinded physician investigator to h elp determine if a 
relapse has occurred and to assess its severity (based on revision of the current and previous 
neurological examinations and discussion with the subject about activities of daily living).
The blinded physician investigator will determine whether a relapse has occurred or not, and whether it 
will count as a qualifying relapse as defined above.

precursor as described above and not initiate maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.  As 
stated above, they must be counseled that approved MS immunomodulators have been 
demonstrated to significantly decrease flare f requency in MS subjects.  They will continue to 
receive elezanumab or placebo.

corticosteroids /corticosteroid precursor according to good neurological practice) but elect not 
to begin maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.  They must be counseled that approved MS 
immunomodulators have been demonstrated to significantly decrease flare frequency in MS 
subjects.  They will continue to receive elezanumab or placebo.

continue in the trial.  If another immunomodulator is prescribed, they will not receive further 
infusions and should be discontinued from the study.
In the event of a clinical MS relapse, a supplemental AEeCRF form should be completed (See 
Appendix C, Relapse Questionnaire). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Infusion Reactions
The investigator or qualified designee will evaluate the infusion site area from Week 0 –Baseline 
through the end of the study.  Any observation of infusion site reaction after the start of infusion must 
be recorded as an adverse event (AE).  
Further information on monitoring of elezanumab infusio n reactions is presented in Appendix D.
Collection of Data Regarding Known Complications of the Disease Under Study
Natural progression of MS (including new or wors ening neurological symptoms and signs) is expected in 
the subjects.  Disease progression will be assessed at pre -determined intervals throughout the 
treatment period by [CONTACT_318047] (such as the EDSS+, MSIS -29 version 2, MFIS, MSIOA) and 
recorded within the electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments (eCOA) for risk/benefit determinations.  
Therefore, "disease progression" or other similar verbatim terms related to disease status SHOULD NOT 
be recorded on the AE case report form (CRF) pages.  Falls wil l not be recorded as AEs unless they lead 
to other injury or represent a change in frequency or character from pre- randomization falls.
Similarly, the slow progression of pre -existing disease -related signs and symptoms clearly associated 
with the disease d uring the treatment period will not be reported as AEs unless these signs and 
symptoms are judged by [CONTACT_318048], or if the 
investigator suspects the deterioration of disease -related signs and symptoms to be potentially related 
to the investigational drug.  If there is any uncertainty about the worsening of an AE being due solely to 
the disease under the treatment protocol, it should be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate.
Discontinuation from this tre atment protocol because of progression or deterioration of the disease 
should be recorded on the Study Completion eCRF page as discontinuation due to "disease progression" 
and NOT as discontinuation due to an AE.
4.2 Reporting Adverse Events and Intercurrent I llnesses
In the event of an SAE, whether associated with study drug or not, the investigator will notify Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the SAE by [CONTACT_17211] (EDC) system.  SAEs that occur before the site having access to the 
RAVE® system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented on the SAE non -CRF forms and 
emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours after the site becomes 
aware of the SAE.

5.1 Sample Retention Requirements
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the biomarker samples and data in a 
secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained 
while research on elezanumab (or drugs of this class) or MS and related conditions continues, but for no 
longer than 20 years after study completion or according to local requirements.
5.2 S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investi gational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines and 
Appendix Aof the Investigator Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI).  The RSI in 
effect at the start of a DSUR reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period.  For follow -
up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be 
used to assess expectedness.

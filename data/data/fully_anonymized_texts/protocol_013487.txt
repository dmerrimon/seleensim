1.1. Background  
Obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma (approximately 250,000 cases per year of asthma 
in the U.S. are related to obesity).[ADDRESS_811244] poorly controlled asth ma (with a nearly 5 -fold 
risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and do not respond as well to conventional controller therapy as lean 
asthmatics.2-6  Obesity particularly affects minority populations:[ADDRESS_811245] 
age-adjusted rates of obesity (47.8%) followed by [CONTACT_183734] (42.5%), non -Hispanic whites (32.6%), and 
non-Hispanic Asians (10.8%).  This is thought to account in part for the disparities of asthma in minority 
populations; there is a pressing public health need to develop interventions specifically for obese asthmatics.  
One medication that might be particularly useful for the treatment of asthma in obesity is ro flumilast, a 
medication currently used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Data in clinical trials support efficacy of this medication in the treatment of asthma,
8 though it has never been 
approved for treating asthma in the general population, likely because of concern about side -effects; 
but these “side -effects” may actually contribute to efficacy in the treatment of asthma in obesity.    
Roflumilast has efficacy in mouse -models of asthma and obesity: roflumilast reduced airway remodeling 
and reactivity in a non -allergic mouse model of obese asthma, and also airway reactivity,  inflammation 
and remodeling in an allergic mouse model of obese asthma.[ADDRESS_811246], and “side -effects” on metabolism and weight loss, make this medication a 
particularly exciting candidate to treat asthma in obese patie nts. 
1.2. Primary objective  
The primary objective of this proposal is to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_611854] -ACRC to determine the 
effectiveness and to lerability of our intervention in obese asthma.       
The current proposal comprises a pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], placebo -controlled trial of roflumilast in obese 
patients with poorly controlled asthma in five  centers of the American Lung Association -Airways Clinic al 
Research Centers (ALA -ACRC).   
The results of this trial will lay the groundwork for a definitive multicenter clinical trial of roflumilast for the treatment of poorly controlled asthma in obese patients.   If ultimately successful roflumilast would represent a new treatment for obese patients with asthma, a patient population refractory to current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_611855].

2.3. Rationale for dose of active drug  
We base the dose of active drug on the dose that is FDA approved for use in COPD in this country, and has also shown efficacy in the treatment of asthma
8 and metabolic disorders:[ADDRESS_811251] two weeks we will treat with 500 µg  every other day to increase tolerability of the 
medication.  
2.4. Rationale for t he seven  centers  
Collaborating sites: Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine , Mount Sinai Icahn School of 
Medicine, Duke  University , University of Arizona, University of Alabama Lung Health Center, University 
of Illinois –  Chicago, and the University of Vermont.  Johns Hopkins University will be the Data 
Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.  
We will perform this study in seven  centers that have a strong record of recruitment and working 
together as part of the ALA -ACRC, and that represent diverse populations within the network.  We will 
need to recruit 5-[ADDRESS_811252] a regular asthma care provider will continue to receive care from that source. If not, they will be referred to an asthma care provider associated with the study site. All participants will be provided with an asthma action plan, but we will not provide routine asthma care.  
2.6. Randomization and drug distribution  
Participants will be randomly assigned with an equal allocation to receive either active treatment or matching placebo for 6 mont hs.  The treatment assignment will be double -masked, neither the 
participant nor the clinical center investigators will be informed of the treatment group.  Randomization will be accomplished with an auditable, documented generation scheme that produces a reproducible 
order of assignment, this schema will be generated by [CONTACT_15791].  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_611872] a center.

2.8. Randomization and blinding   
Treatment assignments will be stratified by [CONTACT_611873] (1:1). Randomization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_611874]; after verification of eligibility, a treatment assignment number corresponding to unique study kit will be assigned. Study kits will be labeled with two -part tear- off labels with un ique identifiers. The tear- off label is affixed to a study form 
when the kit is assigned to a participant and the information is keyed into data system to verify that 
assigned treatment was given to the participant.

• Asthma paper/electronic diary cards  will be completed by [CONTACT_611875][INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF), daily asthma symptom scores, beta- agonist 
use, nocturnal asthma awakenings, and health care use.17,18   Diary data are used to identify 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_611860] (asthma -free days).  
• The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a 4 -week recall questionnaire that measures asthma control.19   
• The Marks Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Marks AQLQ) assesses asthma specific quality 
of life.20  
• The Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI) is a 2 -week utility -weighted asthma symptom 
questionnaire.21   
• GI side effects will be assessed with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Sca le.  This is a 15 -
item instrument with five subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and indigestion) that was originally developed to assess the symptoms associated with the most common GI disorders, and has previously been used to assess  tolerability of medications.  The 
five subscales of the questionnaire produce a mean score ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort).

Confidential, not for attribution or citation.  • The Patient Health Question naire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ9 and GAD7) will be used.  
The Patient Health Questionnaire is a diagnostic tool for mental health disorders used by [CONTACT_611876].  We have used this 
questionn aire in prior ALA -ACRC studies, and so the centers are familiar with its use.  We will 
use sections specific to mood (PHQ -9) and anxiety (GAD -7). The PHQ -9, a tool specific to 
depression, scores each of the 9 DSM -IV criteria based on the mood module from t he original 
PRIME -MD. The GAD -7 was subsequently developed as a brief scale for anxiety and scores seven 
common anxiety symptoms.25,26 
• Anthropometrics will include blood pressure, height and weight, and waist and hip 
circumference per NHANES III.27 Digital scales will be given to participants at visit 2 to take home 
to measure weight.  Participants will be asked to send a photo of the weight shown on the scale 
along with their feet to the coordinator.  
• Adverse effect s will be assessed by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questions at each visit and rated in severity.  
• Interval health history will be recorded at each clinic visit. Records of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355], if 
necessary, deaths are obtained for verification of diagnoses and assessm ent of safety issues.  
• Baseline questionnaires and exam will be administered to ascertain demographics including self-reported ethnicity and race, general health, co -morbid conditions, asthma symptoms, and 
medication use.   
• Assessment of Adherence: adheren ce will be assessed from pi[INVESTIGATOR_611861] n. If only remote visits are permitted, then pi[INVESTIGATOR_611862].  
• Exit que stionnaires will be administered at the last visit to determine global assessments of 
treatment, adequacy of informed consent procedures, satisfaction with study procedures and personnel, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_592422].  
• Blood specimens will be collect ed for fasting blood glucose and analysis of metabolic and 
oxidative markers related to asthma  if a site permits this . Excess blood specimens will be used 
for future asthma research with the patient’s consent. Fasting blood draw may take place within [ADDRESS_811255] of the procedures scheduled for visit 2 or visit 7 .
 
2.10. Rationale for outcome measurements  
Our outcome measures are all well validated clinical outcomes for use in studies of asthma, and validated questionnaires for assessing likely side effects.  We are including a number of feasibility 
outcomes that will inform the decision to proceed with a definitive multi- center clinical trial: these 
include assessment of recruitment and retention, adherence and non -compliance (from pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], 
diary  cards, missed visits) and side -effects (from GSRS, PHQ -9 and GAD -7).  Participants with scores on 
the PHQ -[ADDRESS_811256] of the study off of study drug.  
Baseline medical and asthma control questionnaires will take 20 -30 minutes to complete, will be 
completed at the Medical Office Building, in a private office.  Questionnaires are in paper format, and will be completed by [CONTACT_2299].

Due to the COVID -19 public health emergency, TRIM, will permit remote follow up of enrolled 
participants as of April, 6, 2020.  Participants enrolled after re -opening of  the study should be seen at in -
person visit for V2 (randomization visit) and V7 (24 weeks), other visits can be conducted in -part or fully 
remotely. It is possible that research activities will face restrictions in the future or that a participant will 
prefer to do the V4 -V6 remotely, so we will provide participants with a scale and tape measure to collect 
data for remote visits. All questionnaires can be conducted remotely prior to in -person visits for all 
visits. Participants who are followed up remotely , will complete some questionnaires over the phone 
and mail back the rest of the questionnaires to the site.  Methacholine challenge tests  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_611863].  Women of child -bearing potential and participating in remote follow up will

TRIM protocol Version 1.8                                                                                                               Data analysis| [ADDRESS_811257] between the treatment groups, i.e. the primary outcome. If the data are non -normal, 
then transformations and non -parametric alternatives (e.g. Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test comparing the raw 
differences from baseline to 24 -weeks between treatment groups) will be explored.  If imbalances in 
influential baseline variables are present, then secondary analyses using appropriate stratification or 
adjustments will be done.  Sensitivity analyses using alternate mean and covariance structures will also be performed.  Analyses will be done based upon principles of intention to trea t, i.e. all data from all 
randomized participants will be included in the analysis.  
Secondary analyses will focus on the effects of additional covariates including age, gender, site, BMI >40, 
baseline ACT score, and adherence with treatment.  These models will build on primary analysis 
described above. Potentials risk factors will be added as a main effect to reduce variability and interaction effect to identify potential subgroup effects. Analyses using adherence measures will be performed to explore dose -response relationships.   
3.2. Secondary outcomes  
Secondary outcomes  include ASUI, mAQLQ, and GSRS scores, lung function, weight loss and adverse 
events.  Continuous outcomes, scores and lung function, will be analyzed similarly to the primary 
outcome. Ev ent outcomes will be analyzed in two ways: negative binomial regression to estimate rates 
and Kaplan -Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models for time -to-first event.  
3.3. Sample size  
The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_611864].29 For the definitive trial, the planned sample size is 190 (95 participants 
on active drug, 95 on placebo), to provide 90% power to detect a difference of 2.[ADDRESS_811258] versus placebo, with a type 1 error rate of 5%, and a 
standard deviation (SD) of 5. The SD is based on prior data from studies by [CONTACT_611877], and 
previous publications.30,31 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 28 to 34 participants provides 90% one -sided confidence limit 
to exclude a clin ical important effect in a definitive trial if we see no effect in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and so 
could inform the decision as to whether to proceed to the full definitive trial.  We will inflate this to 38 
participants to allow for possible loss to follow up.

3.4. Data confidentiality  
Data which includes identifiable personal health information (PHI) are collected at each of the clinical 
sites. PHI is stored at each of the clinical sites in accordance with HIPAA regulations and local univ ersity 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13338]. This includes the storage of PHI in locked cabinets or rooms, limited access to 
secure data areas by [CONTACT_611878], password protection for electronic medical records, and explanation of HIPAA regulat ions on the study consent form. Data such as lung function or 
laboratory tests that are collected as part of this study may be transmitted to the participants treating physicians with the consent of the participant. Participants are informed in the consent  that PHI may 
also be disclosed for auditing purposes by [CONTACT_611879].  
Information transmitted to the coordinating center is identified by [CONTACT_611880], and other identifying information such as bi rthdate, visit dates, and study site is removed from limited use 
datasets. Source records that are transmitted to the coordinating center for data quality audits have identifying information redacted.

approved for use in patients with COPD, the label includes warnings about psychiatric events (including 
suicidality), weight loss, and drug interactions. The psychiatric adverse reactions included insomnia, 
anxiety and depression (rate of psychiatric adverse reactions was 2.6% higher in roflumilast group than 
placebo). Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, were observed in 
clinical t rials and in the post -marketing surveillance of the drug, in individuals with and without any prior 
history of depression. Of note, the safety data for roflumilast were based on 4438 patients between the 
ages of 40 -91 years, 73% of whom were male and 92.9%  were Caucasian. Given these limitations (in 
comparison to the planned trial in patients with asthma), the safety risks are taken from a pooled 
analysis of asthma patients receiving the [ADDRESS_811260] to be used in the current trial (n=1567; C hervinsky, P et al Pulmonary Pharmacology  and Therapeutics 2015 (35):S28 -34).  (This asthma 
population was 42.2% male, 80.2% white, and had a mean BMI of 27.47 as well as including 96.7 % of subjects between the ages of 12 -65 years. Treatment duration varied between 4 -24 weeks.)  In these 
studies of patients with asthma, the risks that occurred with more than 5 events per 100 patient years 
follow up in excess of the control group included:

The GSRS will be used primarily to monitor GI side -effects, if a participant scores ≥ 6 on any item

immediately, and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394].  
The potential for drug interactions with roflumilast is mitigated through excluding participants on 
medications known to interact with  roflumilast.  We will exclude participants with uncontrolled anxiety 
and depression, and suicidal ideation, and screen for these at every visit, we will discontinue the patient from drug treatment if they develop these symptoms (threshold as defined in el igibility criteria).  Plans 
for dealing with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety and self -harm are outlined below.  
4.1.2. Venipuncture  
The main risk of this is bruising and minor discomfort.   We may find elevated fasting blood glucose, 
which requires  clinical follow up.  Our plan is as follows:  
< 100: no action  
100-125: notify participant and PCP within 3 months  
126-199: notify participant and PCP within 5 working days  
200-299: notify participant and PCP within 24 hours  
≥ 300: contact [CONTACT_611881], and advise to go to PCP/ ED/ urgent care

This proposed plan will be subject to DSMB review . 
We will ask all patients  if they have a mental health care provider at the begin ning of the study.  
The questionnaires used in this study include questions regarding the participant’s health -  both physical 
and mental.  If a participant is experiencing a mental health crisis, we will provide them with additional 
support and referrals a s needed. Information provided will include the following: - 
• The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, 1 -800-273-TALK (8255) 24 hour hotline  
• Howard Center [ADDRESS_811264]. Burlington, VT 802 -488-6400 local Crisis 24 hour hotline  
• Seneca Center [ADDRESS_811265] Burlington VT 802 -847-3333  
• Northeastern Family Institute [ADDRESS_811266]. South Burlington VT 802 -657-8890  
• UVMMC Psychiatry:  [ADDRESS_811267] or licensed psychologis t to be available to discuss any 
issues related to depression/anxiety with the PI.  
4.2.1. Protocol for participant with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms  
The PHQ -9/ GAD -[ADDRESS_811268] a clinically significant level of psychological distress. It does not necessarily mean that the participant has a clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety but may indicate the need for appropriate care . Study pers onnel will be instructed to tabulate and review the scores for 
these instruments  before the participant is released from the study visit.  
Participants with scores on the PHQ -9 or GAD -7 (including those being screened for the eligibility who 
do not qualify for the study) that reach or exceed the thresholds for exclusion outlined in the study eligibility criteria will be discontinued from stud y drug under the supervision of the site PI (if on study 
drug), and the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_611867].  Participants already randomized into the study will continue to be followed for the rest  of the study off 
of study drug (unless they decide to withdraw). Subsequent score s exceeding the threshold score, or the 
minimally clinically important difference for the questionnaires when compared to Visit 2 (≥ 5) will be 
considered an adverse event, a nd, as such, followed until resolution or a plan for care under the 
supervision of another medical provider is established. This will be considered an adverse event, and, as 
such, followed until resolution or a plan for care under the supervision of anothe r medical provider is 
established. Participants will be informed that the elevated score could be related to the study drug, 
though investigators and subjects will not be unblinded to treatment assignment.

Confidential, not for attribution or citation.  4.2.2. Protocol for participants exhibiting potential for self -harm  
If a participant disclose s that they may do harm to themselves, we will follow up with the participant 
and report to PI.   This will be indicated with a score of greater than 0 on Question 9 on the PHQ -9.  We 
will then administer the Suicidality Severity Screener (SSW form), adapt ed from the Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), by [CONTACT_611882], K., et al, and used in prior ALA -ACRC studies.   
We will proceed as follows  
Suicidal Severity Screener  
You mentioned on some of the questions that you have thought about killing yourself. Tell me about 
those thoughts.  
1. Have you been thinking about how you might kill yourself?  
YES /NO  
2. Have you had these thoughts and had some intention of acting on them?  
YES /NO  
3. Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how to kill yourself?  
YES/ NO  
4. Do you intend to carry out any plans you have?  
YES/ NO  
5. Do you have a current mental health provider?  
If yes - when is your next appointment?  
 
Risk will be determined as outlined below:  
Mild Risk  
If participant answers NO to questions 1, 2, 3, AND 4 of the SSW:  
• Notify PI  
• Provide resource guide, including suicide hotline number, with statement: “ It sounds like 
currently you have some thoughts about suicide but do not plan to go through with it. If you 
notice the thoughts become more frequent, or you want to talk with someone, please call this number. ”  
• If they have a provider, make sure there is an upcoming appointment scheduled to talk about their concerns.  If they do not have a provider, indicate possible providers on resource sheet.  
• Complete an adverse Event Report (UE) form documenting the outcome of this questionnaire and subsequent action taken.  
• Contact [CONTACT_40744] 7 days after visit to co nfirm they are receiving follow up care. 
Update AE form with results of phone call.  
• A letter will be mailed with resources if we are unable to reach them by [CONTACT_648], and this will be discussed  with the study physician

If participant answers  YES to questions 1 or 2 but not to questions 3 or 4 of the SSW:  
• Notify study physician immediately  
• Provide resource guide, including suicide hotline number, with statement: “ It sounds like 
currently you have some thoughts about suicide but do not plan to go through with it. If you 
notice the thoughts become more frequent, or you want to talk with someone, please call this 
number. ”  
• If they have a provider, make sure there is an upcoming appointment scheduled to talk about their concerns. If they do not have a provider, staff should strongly encourage them to contact 
[CONTACT_611883]/or one of the local providers listed to schedule a follow up call or 
appointment.  
• Staff should encourage participants to contact [CONTACT_611884] t before 
concluding the study visit.  
• Complete an Adverse Event Report (AE) form documenting the outcome of the questionnaire 
and subsequent action taken.  
• Contact [CONTACT_40744] 7 days after visit to confirm they are receiving follow up care. Update AE form with results of phone call.  
• A letter will be mailed with resources if we are unable to reach them by [CONTACT_648], and this will be 
discussed  with the study physician  
Immediate Risk  
If participant answers YES to questions 3 or 4 of the SSW : 
• Notify study physician immediately  
• Instruct participant to call PCP, 911, or appropriate crisis number and give participant resource 
guide highlighting 24 -hr help lines.  
- If participant does not call for assistance, let them know you are obligated to report this 
to emergency services; walk participant to ER or call 911  
• If concerned there is an immediate risk, walk the participant to the ER or call 911  
• Complete a Serious Adverse Event Report (SR) form documenting the outcome of this 
questionnaire and subsequent a ction taken.  
• Contact [CONTACT_40744] 7 days after visit to confirm they are receiving follow up care. Update SR form with results of phone call.  
If unsure about the patient’s risk, contact a study physician (preferably the PI) to notify them imm ediately and discuss action to take.  
If patient is contact[CONTACT_611885]/ it is not possible to reach the patient, contact [CONTACT_611886], who will contact [CONTACT_23964]’s psychiatrist  or 
licensed psychologist  to discuss appropriate next steps.  
FOR ALL SUICIDALITY RISK ASSESSMENTS:  
Speak with a study doctor immediately and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394].

possible.  
4.3. Man agement of GI side effects  
If a participant loses ≥ 10% of baseline weight during the course of the trial, this  will be discussed with 
the study physician (preferably the study PI) as soon as possible.  
The GSRS will be used primarily to monitor GI side -effects, if a participant scores ≥ 6 on any item 
(indicative of severe or very severe discomfort), this will be discussed with the study doctor immediately, and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394].  
4.4. Potential benefits of the proposed research to human subjects 
and others  
Patients assigned to either treatment group will benefit from asthma education and attention to their asthma care program. Moreover, some participants in research studies report that they enjoy participation because they have the opportunity to assist in the development of new knowledge that may be helpful to others and that the relationship with the  research staff is rewarding.  If this study 
shows that participants assigned to roflumilast experience improved asthma control, this might lead to a specific therapy to treat asthma in obese patients.  
4.4.1. Importance of the k nowledge to be g ained  
If this study shows that participants assigned to roflumilast experience improved asthma control, this 
might lead to a specific therapy to treat asthma in obese patients.  This patient population currently suffers with poor asthma control, and do not respond as  well to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], so this would be a 
very important finding.  
4.4.2. Financial considerations  
At the University of Vermont, participants will receive a stipend of $50 per visit, for a total of $[ADDRESS_811269] UVM rates  if participants pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049]/drop off study supplies .

Confidential, not for attribution or citation.  5. Data safety monitoring plan  
• Significant changes or amendments to the protocol or consent form will be submitted to the 
DSMB, and included in the DSMB reports.  
• We will follow the ALA ACRC annual reporting requirements for management of conflict of 
interest.  
• There are no plans for interim data analysis for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
• The American Lung Association appoints a DSMB to oversee trials conducted by [CONTACT_611888]. The 
primary responsibility of the DSMB is to protect participants but may also h ave 
recommendations regarding the scientific conduct of the study to optimize the risk -benefit ratio 
for participants. The DSMB is typi[INVESTIGATOR_344494] a pulmonary specialist, an ethicist, a 
statistician, a patient representative, and specific content exp erts, in this case a psychiatrist. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the DSMB would have an initial meeting to review and approve the protocol, and then meet every six months or more frequently to review the progress of the trial. The investigators present the DSMB study perform ance data including screening and enrollment data, and 
measures of data quality and timeliness. Safety data will include reporting of adverse events, protocol deviations, and unexpected or unusual events that may affect the safety or scientific 
validity of the study.  
• [CONTACT_300715] of the DCC at Johns Hopkins serves as the medical monitor for the research group and 
reviews all serious adverse event or unusual event reports to determine whether any immediate local or study -wide actions are indicated. Interim seri ous adverse events or adverse events 
related to study procedures are transmitted to the DSMB by [CONTACT_611889], if appropriate, NIH.  
• At the end of each DSMB meeting, the board will vote whether to contin ue the study as planned 
or whether to recommend changes to the study. The DSMB may recommend that the study be 
stopped early if there is evidence that the risk -benefit ratio does not warrant continuation of the 
trial.

• Roflumilast (Dalire sp®), 500 mcg tablets, will be obtained from a commercial vendor, and 
supplied to Temple University Research Pharmacy.  Temple will also supply matching placebo.  
• Temple will provide bottles  with a 6 week supply of study drug or placebo .  This will be shipped 
to the study sites.  
• Storage  and stability  
• Capsules will be stored at room temperature (20 -25oC), excursions permitted to 15 -30oC, per 
labeling standards for this medication.  
• Administration: oral administration  
6.1. FDA considerations  
This medication is FDA appro ved for the treatment of recurrent exacerbations of COPD.   It has not been 
approved for the treatment of asthma.  This study has been deemed exempt from requiring an IND by

hormonal) for the duration of the study will be excluded.  
Pregnant women will not be enrolled in the trial, as the safety of roflumilast in pregnancy is not known. 
Women of child -bearing potenti al will be required to use adequate contraception, and undergo a 
pregnancy test at every visit in SA1. Any pregnancy that might occur would be followed to term if 
patient consents.  
7.3. Inclusion of minorities  
We anticipate minority enrollment will reflec t prior enrollment in ALA -ACRC studies, with approximately 
50% Caucasian, 40% African American, and 15% Hispanic in the study overall.  We anticipate that minority enrollment at UVM will reflect the demographics of Vermont.  
7.4. Inclusion of children  
We will not include children as the phenotype of asthma in obese children is likely to be different 
that in obese adults.  
7.5. Vulnerable populations  
None

Previous (within five years) evidence of at least a 12% increase in FEV1 after inhaling 2 -4 
puffs of albuterol or a positive methacholine challenge or patient reported history of patient reported 
improvement of asthma exacerbation after a 
course of systemic or 
inhaled corticosteroids  
2.4.  2.4. Rationale for the five centers  
Collaborating sites: Northwestern 
University Feinberg School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, Duk e University, 
University of Arizona, and the University of Vermont. Johns Hopkins University will be the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.  
 
We will perform this study in five centers that have a strong record of recruitment and working together  as part of the ALA -ACRC, 
and that represent diverse 
populations within the network.  
We will need to recruit 7 -8 patients 
per site within an approximate 12 
month period to complete all procedures and study analysis within the time- frame of this 
proposal, and this is a reasonable 
recruitment target for these 
centers.   2.4. Rationale for the seven centers  
Collaborating sites: Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, Duke University, University of Arizona, 
University of Alabama Lung Health 
Center, University of Illinois –  Chicago, 
and the University of Vermont. Johns 
Hopkins University will be the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.  
 
We will perform this study in seven centers that have a strong reco rd of 
recruitment and working together as part of the ALA -ACRC, and that 
represent diverse populations within 
the network.  We will need to recruit 5 -
6 patients per site within an 
approximate 12 month period to complete all procedures and study analysis wi thin the time- frame of this 
proposal, and this is a reasonable recruitment target for these centers.

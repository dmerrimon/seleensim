Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390411] of Suvorexant on Sleep Disturbance in Patients with Chronic Insomnia and Suboptimally Controlled Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized 3-month Clinical Trial Using a Sequential Parallel Comparison Design  I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  Type [ADDRESS_390412] many disease-related etiologies for nocturnal awakenings from, and difficulty returning to, sleep (e.g. nocturia, pain, blood sugar assessments, anxiety, sleep apnea), producing sleep-maintenance insomnia and reduced total sleep duration.   Sleep disturbance may contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes.  A recent meta-analysis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_317292]-reported difficulty initiating sleep (1.57, 95% CI 1.25-1.97) and maintaining sleep (1.84, 95% CI 1.39-2.43)2 for incident Type 2 diabetes.  Our recent analysis3 of 10-year longitudinal data from the Nurses’ Health Study confirmed these previous studies.  After adjustment for lifestyle factors at baseline, compared to women without sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_317293], those having difficulty falling or staying asleep "all of the time" or "most of the time" had a multivariate-adjusted HR for incident type 2 diabetes of 1.22 (95% CI 1.12-1.34) even after adjustment for hypertension, depression, and BMI. In those with established Type 2 diabetes, there is emerging evidence from cross-sectional studies that sleep disturbance affects glycemic control.  This issue is of particular importance, as rates of sleep disturbance and shortened sleep duration are high in this disorder4-10. A meta-analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes showed that self-reported poor sleep quality (assessed by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_2272]) and short sleep duration (<6 h/night) were both associated with increased HbA1c11. In an important examination of the relationship of insomnia and Type 2 diabetes, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study found that both actigraphic-determined sleep fragmentation and a combined measure of insomnia from actigraphy and self-reported sleep disturbance were substantially associated with abnormalities in fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index (an estimate of insulin resistance) in those with established diabetes12.  However, in those without diabetes these associations were not apparent. Finally, in a recent study13 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], a 10% increase in actigraphic-measured sleep efficiency was associated with an 18% lower proportional odds of a higher morning glucose category (hyperglycemia vs. elevated, and elevated vs. normal), even after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. This finding was present in those patients both with and without diabetes. Hyperglycemia defines diabetes, and glycemic control is fundamental to the management of diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial14 showed definitively that improved glycemic control in Type 1 diabetes is associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and neuropathic complications.  The [LOCATION_006] Prospective Diabetes Study ([LOCATION_006]PDS)15,16 confirmed that intensive glycemic control was associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular and neuropathic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Long-term follow-up of the [LOCATION_006]PDS cohorts 
Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390413] investigated by [CONTACT_317306].  To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effects of insomnia treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes18.  In that study, 36 middle-aged patients with suboptimally controlled Type 2 diabetes (mean HbA1c=9.1%) and insomnia were randomized in a crossover design to 3 weeks of either prolonged-release melatonin or placebo. No differences between groups were observed in any measure of glycemic control even though actigraphically-recorded sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset (WASO) and number of awakenings improved with melatonin compared to placebo. In a 5-month open-label extension using chronic prolonged-release melatonin, improvements in HbA1c were observed compared to baseline values (9.13% ± 1.55% at baseline versus 8.47% ±1.67% after 5 months on treatment, p=0.005).  Recently published data from our group19 suggests that hypnotic-related sleep improvement is associated with improvements in glycemic control in insomnia patients without diabetes. In a 2-month randomized placebo-controlled study of eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_317294], significant changes in the treatment vs. placebo groups were not observed (in glycemic control or insomnia). However, we found a strong correlation between improvement in diary-reported total sleep time and improvement in HbA1c in the eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_317295] (r=0.66, p=0.0360). Similarly, changes in PSG-measured WASO were positively correlated with changes in IVGTT-derived glucose effectiveness (r=-0.48, p=0.0391). These data suggest that changes in sleep may modify glycemic control even in those with normal baseline measures when the appropriate measures are investigated. It is our belief that abnormal glucose regulation, as seen in Type [ADDRESS_390414] likely a result of the small sample size as well as the characteristics of the enrolled primary insomniacs who were willing to tolerate the repeated instrumentation (two home sleep studies, MRIs, and IVGTTs) required by [CONTACT_760]. The most popular on-label and off-label agents for insomnia (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-receptor agonists, antidepressants and antipsychotic agents) have not been investigated for treatment of insomnia in the context of Type [ADDRESS_390415] side effects (weight gain, exacerbation of OSA, risk of cognitive dysfunction, and glucose and lipid abnormalities) that are of particular concern in that population20. Suvorexant provides an important therapeutic option to treat insomnia in the context of Type [ADDRESS_390416] particular efficacy on glucose regulatory effects in patients with Type 2 diabetes and insomnia. Administration of suvorexant for 2-4 weeks during the resting phase in diabetic db/db mice was associated with both reduced wake time/increased total sleep time as well as glucose metabolism23. The authors concluded that this effect was mediated through CNS suppression of sympathetic influences on hepatic gluconeogenesis. As hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetics is related to excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis, nocturnal administration of suvorexant may improve glycemic control by [CONTACT_317307].

Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390419] RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT Methods of recruitment and procedures for informed consent: The target enrollment for this study is N = 120 men and women with insomnia and suboptimally controlled Type 2 diabetes. Potential subjects will be informed of the study in one of six ways: 1) through advertisements on the Partners Clinical Trials webpage and flyers in local diabetes clinics, 2) through advertisements on Facebook (targeted at individuals aged 25-75 in the [LOCATION_011] area), Craigslist, and Google, 3) through a research coordinator stationed at local diabetes clinics to recruit subjects, 4) through referral by a providing clinician, 5) through RPDR and the MGH Diabetes Research Center Patient Registry, or 6) through the RSVP for Health. Prospective subjects may be identified via registry searches using the MGH Diabetes Research Center Patient Registry.  Study staff will conduct a preliminary pre-screening for basic inclusion and exclusion criteria using the medical records (via EPIC) of the potential subjects identified in the registry. If these potential subjects have indicated that they can be contact[CONTACT_43417], an opt-out letter from the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_317296]-out procedures if they are not interested. If these potential subjects have not indicated that they can be contact[CONTACT_43417], we will use the two-letter approach, where a treating clinician gives permission to contact [CONTACT_102]. Provider permission will be secured by [CONTACT_57148] a list of potential participants and sending them in a format, with eligibility criteria, where the provider can document yes or no for each patient that may be suitable or unsuitable for the project. After securing provider permission, the potential subject will then be sent a packet including two letters, one non-endorsing, informative letter signed by [CONTACT_317309], and an opt-out letter from the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_317297]-out procedures if they are not interested. After the opt-out period has ended, a member of study staff will contact [CONTACT_317310]. The enrollment requirement for poorly-controlled Type 2 diabetes will be addressed by [CONTACT_317311][INVESTIGATOR_307], Brigham and Women's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Newton-Wellesley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as well as the HMS-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Clinic. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_252009] (one of whom is a consultant to this study), and they have conveyed their interest in recruiting for this study given the high prevalence of insomnia in this population and the recognition that it influences glycemic control.  At Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], study staff will conduct a preliminary pre-screening for basic inclusion and exclusion criteria using the medical records (via EPIC) of the potential subjects. Once potential subjects are identified, the research coordinator will notify treating clinicians, who will ask the patients if they are interested in learning more about the study. If patients express interest in the study, they will meet with the research coordinator, who will obtain informed verbal consent and screen the subjects using the approved screening script. Interested patients may contact [CONTACT_252021]/clinician (in the form of a small handout). During initial phone contact [CONTACT_252022], interest in the study will be re-confirmed and verbal informed consent will be obtained, after which a phone screen will be conducted by a member of the study staff.  The potential risk of coercion for study subjects will be managed by [CONTACT_252023] a study handout to potential study participants. Potentially eligible patients may separately 
Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390420]’s record.  Verbally consented subjects will be re-consented during the Screening Visit. Written consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_252024] a written Informed Consent Form including a summary of HIPAA policies; the signatures on the Informed Consent Form will be obtained electronically (via the REDCap e-consent framework) regardless of whether the visit is in-person or remote. A signed copy will be given to the subject. Once consent is obtained, patients will be assigned a new unique identifier, which will be used to link all questionnaire data with the patient’s record throughout the study. The questionnaire data linked with each unique identifier will be collected and stored on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which is a secure, HIPAA compliant web-based application and database hosted by [CONTACT_252025]. A separate database at the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252010]. If subjects have questions concerning their rights as a research subject, they may call the Human Subjects Committee office at MGH, or speak with study clinicians. All study documents will be stored electronically in REDCap as well as encrypted laboratory computers, and access to this information will only be given to the research personnel.  Study Design and projected enrollment: This is a parallel, two-arm, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled 3-month trial using the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD), investigating the effects of suvorexant 10–[ADDRESS_390421] to consent and evaluate for eligibility up to 120 Type 2 diabetics in order to achieve our projected randomized sample size of 72 patients with Type 2 diabetes. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio to suvorexant 10–20 mg or equivalent placebo for six weeks followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-randomization of placebo non-responders to either suvorexant or placebo in a 1:1 design; this will allow [ADDRESS_390422]-randomization drop-outs.  
Version Date: 2/8/2021   Winkelman, John W. M.D., Ph.D.  
7  Eligible patients will be randomized to 6 weeks of suvorexant or placebo after an initial 2-week screening period and a two-week screening run-in period to ensure the stability of sleep disturbance. Participants will complete 4 study visits (consent/screening visit, randomization visit, a 6-week visit, and a 3-months-on-treatment visit).  In addition, an initial telephone-based screening assessment and 2 interim phone visits (at 1 week and 7 weeks on treatment) will occur. Suvorexant will be started at [ADDRESS_390423] 7 days. If the 10-mg dose is well tolerated but not effective after one week of treatment, as determined by [CONTACT_71346]-week phone visits (at 1 week and 7 weeks of treatment for those originally randomized to suvorexant and placebo, respectively), the dose can be increased to [ADDRESS_390424] the choice of completing any of the visits remotely. However, if a reversion to more restrictions is mandated, all visits will be performed remotely. If such a situation occurs, enrolled participants who had been completing in-person visits will be informed about the switch to mandatory remote visits via phone call.  For the remote visits, research staff will follow the MGB requirements for using the appropriate virtual tools: visits will occur via Zoom. In exceptional cases where subjects are unable to use this program, visits may occur by [CONTACT_756]. These remote visits will include all assessments and questionnaires typi[INVESTIGATOR_317298]-person visits (the study clinician and research coordinator will perform the tasks that they normally perform in-person), with two exceptions: recording vital signs, and the physical exam at the Screening Visit. The study physician will remain on call during all points of these remote visits in case there any emergent medical or psychiatric issues.  After the video or phone call visit, subjects will be required to visit an affiliated site or a satellite clinic to have labs performed; the study physician will order these tests. After the Randomization and 6-Week Visits, study medication will be mailed to study participants; these mailings will follow the same protocol already used for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_317299].   V. OVERVIEW OF STUDY PROCEDURES TELEPHONE SCREEN: An initial screen will be conducted over the phone, consisting of a brief clinical and sleep history for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If preliminary eligibility appears adequate and the individual expresses interest, they will be sent links to complete the following questionnaires on REDCap: 1) the Insomnia Severity Index to assess insomnia severity 2) the QIDS-SR to screen for depression 3) the PSQI to assess sleep quality 4) the STOP-BANG questionnaire to screen for sleep apnea 5) an electronic 14-day sleep diary   
Version Date: 2/8/2021   Winkelman, John W. M.D., Ph.D.  
8  Upon our review of these completed surveys and diaries, those who meet further eligibility criteria, as determined by [CONTACT_252027] (see Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria above), will be scheduled for an in-person Screening Visit.  SCREENING VISIT: Written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_252028]-related procedures (via the IRB-approved Informed Consent Form via the REDCap e-consent framework). Risks and benefits associated with use of suvorexant will be described. At that time, further eligibility will be assessed with a clinical interview conducted by a sleep medicine-trained psychiatrist to diagnose chronic insomnia disorder and to ensure that contraindicated sleep, medical and psychiatric problems and medications are excluded. At in-person visits, vital signs will be obtained, urine screens collected for pregnancy and disallowed substances, and blood will be drawn for HbA1c and C-Reactive Protein. When the Screening Visit is virtual, the subject will have the pregnancy, drug, HbA1c, and C-Reactive Protein tests performed at an affiliated site or a satellite clinic; the study physician will order these tests. The drug screen will only be performed at the Screening Visit. Screening Run-In: They will receive daily email links to an online sleep diary to complete on 14 consecutive days during the screening run-in period.   RANDOMIZATION VISIT AND TREATMENT PERIOD:  At the Randomization Visit, the 2-week sleep diary and laboratory results will be reviewed for definitive eligibility before the participant is randomized to treatment. Baseline subjective sleep measures will be determined from this 2-week period. Baseline questionnaires will be determined at the Randomization Visit; these questionnaires will be determined again at both the 6-week and 12-week visits. HbA1c and C-Reactive Protein tests will only be performed at the Randomization Visit if more than [ADDRESS_390425] elapsed between this visit and the Screening Visit. Baseline pre-treatment symptom measures will be determined at the Randomization Visit. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 6 weeks of placebo or suvorexant. At their 6-week visit, placebo non-responders will be re-randomized to either suvorexant or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The placebo non-responders will be determined by [CONTACT_317312], who will review the 2 weeks of sleep diaries completed before the 6-week visit.   Compensation: Subjects will be compensated for each study visit ($75 for the Screening Visit and Randomization Visit, and $125 for Visit 3) and for the 1-week and 7-week phone calls ($25 each). Subjects will receive a completion bonus when they have completed the study in its entirety ($200 for the Final Visit).   See below for the Study Flowchart and Table of Procedures.

     VI. STUDY MEDICATION AND SUPPLIES Study Treatments: The study medication will consist of 10 mg or 20 mg suvorexant tablets, or matching placebo, prepared in identically appearing capsules by [CONTACT_252031]. The medication will be titrated and distributed according to the following schedule:   Dispensing Schedule: Double-Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] / Placebo Dosing 
Visit (if in-person study course)Visit (if remote study course)RV1RV2PC1RV3PC2RV4
Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390426] 7 days. If the 10-mg dose is well tolerated but not effective after one week of treatment, as determined by [CONTACT_71346]-week phone visit, the dose can be increased to 20 mg. This will be repeated at the 6-week visit for placebo non-responders. Subjects will taper off their study medication by [CONTACT_41680] 10 mg for 3 days after the Final Visit, if 20 mg was taken during the study.   Study Medication Packaging: Medication will be prepared and packaged by [CONTACT_252032]. The medication will be dispensed in bottles containing enough for 14 days of medication after the Randomization visit, then enough for weeks 2-5. After the 6-week visit, a 14-day supply will again be dispensed, following a supply sufficient for weeks 7-12. Bottles will be labeled with the patient name [CONTACT_214457]. Bottles will be clearly labeled as containing either 10 mg or 20 mg matching placebo or suvorexant tablets. Subjects will be dispensed the appropriate number of tablets needed until the next medication dispensing date. Study medication should be stored at room temperature 15-30°C (59-86°F), be protected from moisture, and be maintained in a secure area.  Study Medication Accountability and Compliance: Starting at the Randomization visit, study medication will be dispensed to each subject with instructions to return all unused medication and packaging (including empty bottles) at the next study visit in order to assess compliance. In the case of virtual study visits, participants will be required to show the study team over video how much medication is remaining. Returned study medication bottles may be re-dispensed to the same subject if appropriate. Additional bottles will be dispensed to each subject as needed. All study medication dispensed by [CONTACT_214441]. Information about subject dosing and compliance will be recorded in the subject’s study records. Subjects who are noncompliant with medications (according to pi[INVESTIGATOR_214411]) may be removed from the study at the discretion of the investigators.  
Version Date: 2/8/2021   Winkelman, John W. M.D., Ph.D.  
12  The investigator agrees not to allow access to the study medication to any person except those named as sub-investigator(s) or clinical care staff, and dispense only to qualified subjects participating in the study.   Randomization:  Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. An unblinded research coordinator will be responsible for all re-randomization determinations and communicating with the pharmacy in that regard.   At the Screening Visit, subjects will be assigned a 3-digit subject number, in ascending sequential order beginning with 001. The subject number will be retained by [CONTACT_214442]. The MGH Clinical Trials Pharmacy and unblinded research coordinator will provide and maintain randomization and blinding. Subjects will be randomized to receive either suvorexant or placebo in a 1:2 ratio, and placebo non-responders will be re-randomized to suvorexant or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_390427] and investigator will be blinded to treatment assignment. Subjects will be randomized sequentially as they qualify for the study.  Blinding: The randomization code will be maintained by [CONTACT_317313], investigators or blinded clinical staff until all subjects have completed and the database has been finalized. Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken. The blind should be broken only if specific treatment would be dictated by [CONTACT_169762]. Individual code breaks by [CONTACT_317314]. The date, time and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the study files.   VII. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS Concomitant medications will be assessed and recorded at each contact [CONTACT_140131] (in-person and over the phone).   Rescue medications for the acute treatment or ongoing management of hyperglycemia will be based on the judgment of the participants' health care providers. Modification in the antidiabetic medication will be considered relevant if there is a 2-fold change in dosage for a hypoglycemic drug, a change of more than 10% in the dosage of insulin, or the addition or subtraction of an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. Relevant modifications will be recorded.

13  The following medications are considered exclusionary for this study, in addition to any medications not listed here but decided to be exclusionary by [CONTACT_38234]:  Exclusionary Medications • Strong inhibitors of CYP3A o Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, conivaptan • *Maximum dose of 10 mg will be considered for subjects taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors  o Amprenavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, imatinib, verapamil  Medication Side Effects and Adverse Events: The package insert for suvorexant includes warnings and precautions related to the following side effects or adverse events: sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_202904], not thinking clearly; acting strangely, confused, or upset; “sleep-walking” or doing other activities during sleep, such as eating, talking, having sex, or driving a car;  temporary weakness in your legs or inability to move or talk, cataplexy; and diarrhea, dry mouth, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], headache, next-day drowsiness, dizziness, abnormal dreams, and cough. Subjects will be informed of the risks associated with consuming alcohol while taking suvorexant, both at the time of consent and throughout the study.  Subjects will be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with suvorexant due to additive psychomotor effects. Subjects will be assessed for depression and suicidal ideation at each study visit, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All adverse events that occur between the first study-related procedure and within [ADDRESS_390428] dose of study medication will be reported. Adverse events will be reported to the Partners IRB according to guidelines. Subjects should report any adverse events voluntarily or in response to general, non-directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?). For each adverse event reported by [CONTACT_423], the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete documentation in the subject’s research file. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, must be recorded using medical terminology in the subject’s study documents. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). The investigator must document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_252012]. All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document.  
Version Date: 2/8/[ADDRESS_390429] been identified, and all study data are complete.   The sequential parallel comparison design was developed at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317300]. Experts at MGH in SPCD will be consultants in the statistical analyses of our data.  Overview of analytic plan:   The primary hypothesis for this trial is that suvorexant is superior to placebo in reducing subjective total sleep time at 3 months of treatment in patients with insomnia and suboptimally controlled Type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint is the change in total sleep time as determined by [CONTACT_317315] (sleep diaries) from baseline to the 6-week and 3-month follow-ups, adjusted for subjective total sleep time at baseline, consistent with the SPCD statistical approach. Key secondary endpoints include subjective wake after sleep onset and ISI.  Exploratory analyses will examine the effect of suvorexant relative to placebo on other sleep continuity parameters (sleep efficiency, sleep quality, sleep latency), HbA1c levels, inflammatory markers, mood, and diabetes-related quality of life, as well as the correlation between the change in the subjective total sleep time and each exploratory endpoint.   Study endpoints:  The primary outcome (subjective total sleep time) and all secondary and exploratory measures are continuous variables. Primary analyses will focus on the difference from the baseline total sleep time (in minutes) to the final total sleep time evaluated after 6 weeks and 3 months of treatment, consistent with SPCD statistical analyses. The key secondary variables are the difference from baseline to either the 6-week visit or the 3-month (Final Treatment) visit (based on SPCD analyses) in: 1) subjective wake after sleep onset and ISI.  Exploratory analyses will similarly focus on the differences from the baseline value to the final observed value of each outcome evaluated after either 6 weeks or 3 months of treatment (based on SPCD analyses). As these are exploratory analyses, no p-values will be determined other than as described below in the hierarchical testing. These endpoints include:  1. PSQI 2. Subjective SOL, sleep efficiency and sleep quality  3. Depressive symptoms (BDI Score) and quality of life measures (DQOL, Diabetes distress scale) 4. HbA1c 5. Inflammation markers (e.g., C-Reactive Protein)  STATISTICAL METHODS 
Version Date: 2/8/2021   Winkelman, John W. M.D., Ph.D.  
15  Primary analysis:   The primary analysis will be based on a weighted average of effects of the change in subjective total sleep time as a function of randomization assignment. Diagnostic methods will be used for all variables to assess their distributional assumptions and to examine potential outlying or influential data points. This analytical method will similarly be used to assess secondary outcomes.   The primary outcome analysis will use the intention-to-treat principle and include all participants who received at least one dose of study medication and completed at least two weeks of sleep diaries following randomization.  In addition to the primary and key secondary end points, other secondary end points will be tested in sequential order to control for multiplicity, with an overall type 1 error rate of 5%. Following the primary and key secondary outcomes, the order will be: HbA1c, then CRP. No adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made for additional secondary end points, and thus, statistical probability will not be tested for these variables.  Per-protocol analyses will be repeated on the subgroup of subjects that achieve 85% medication adherence based on the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_317301] 6-week and 3-month visits. Variables related to subjective total sleep time will be determined by [CONTACT_252033]. Those significant contributors will then be input into a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to identify independent determinants of the change in total sleep time. A two-sided P value <0.05 will be considered significant.   Key secondary and exploratory analyses:   Analyses of the key secondary and exploratory endpoints will be conducted using a weighted average of effects from the two 6-week periods, based on randomization assignment. Exploratory correlational analyses will be performed using simple Pearson or Spearman correlations between the change in the subjective total sleep time and secondary and exploratory endpoints.    Power/Sample Size: In total, we expect to randomize 72 participants to treatment with 62 completed subjects (31 per treatment group). Using the SPCD calculator, to achieve 80% power to detect an effect size of .40, at a statistical significance level of 0.05, [ADDRESS_390430] size of .40 for our sample size calculation.

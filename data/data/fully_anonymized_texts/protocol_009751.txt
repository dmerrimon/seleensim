comparison  of  ΔMVD  between  treatment  arms  using  a  two-sample  t-test  with  unequal 
variances.  A Wilcoxon ranksum test may be used if the normality assumption is not satisfied. 
Alternatively, ΔMVD  may be transformed (e.g. log-transformation) to satisfy the normality 
assumption.    Additional  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  will  include  linear  regression 
models with treatm ent effect and other prognostic factors as covariates.

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_682052],  improved  long-term  survival  for  oral 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  (OSCC)  patients  has  remained  modest  (1,  2).    Several  factors 
contribute to this relatively poor outcome.   First, OSCC  is often diagnosed at an advanced 
stage.    Secon d,  as a result  of “field  cancerizatio n”,  the development  of multiple  primary 
tumors has a major impact on survival.  For patients with early stage disease, second  primary 
tumors  are their most common  cause of treatm ent  failure and death  (1, 2).   Therefore,  to 
improve outcomes, a comprehensive treatm ent plan must include effective chemoprevention 
strategies. 
Chemoprevention can be defined as the use of natural or synthetic agents to reverse or halt 
the progression of premalignant lesions.   Chemopreventive  agents are currently being tested 
for their efficacy in preclini cal and clinical settings for many malignancies including OSCC 
(3,  4).    However,  initial  promising  results  for  OSCC  chemoprevention  have  not  been 
consistently reproduced and toxicity has often been significant.   The iss ue of toxicity is 
particularly important in chemoprevention as prolonged therapy in the absence of a known 
diagnosis of OSCC may be required. 
 
Angiogenesis is an essential phenotype in both physiologic and pathologic settings (5). 
Because of its critical role in cancer biology, the inhibition of angiogenesis  is an attractive 
target for therapy.   The induction of the angiogenic phenotype in OSCC is medi ated by [CONTACT_682096] (6). 
Amo ng these, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family is thought to play an 
important role.  The biological effects of the VEGF ligands are medi ated through their binding 
to members of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, 
VEGFR-3).  This interaction  leads  to autophosphorylation of specific  tyrosine residues and 
subsequent downstr eam activ ation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen- 
activ ated protein kinase (MA PK) and pho sphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. 
Importantly, the induction of angiogenesis is one of the first recognizable phenotypic changes 
observed in bo th experimental models as well as in human OSCC (7-10), suggesting that 
inhibitors of angiogenesis may also hold promise in the field of chemoprevention. 
 
The development,  growth and survival of OSCC  are also highly dependent upon the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] (EGFR)  signaling pathway.  EGFR  is a transmembrane 
glycoprotein that is a member of the ErbB/HER receptor tyrosine kinase family.  Upon ligand 
binding, EGFR  signaling is mediated by [CONTACT_682097]3K/Ak t pathways.   Increased 
expression  of EGFR  and its ligand transforming  growth  factor-α  (TGF-α)  are observed  in 
most  OSCC  and premalignant oral lesions, and this expression correlates with poor prognosis 
(11). In addition, members of the EGFR  pathway contribute to the induction of angiogenesis. 
For example, the expression of TGF-α or EGFR  causes increased expression of VEGF (12, 
13).   Because of its importance  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_249397],  there is considerable  interest in 
targeting the EGFR  pathway for chemoprevention. 
 
ZD6474 (vandetanib,  ZACTIMA)  is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
with activity against multiple signal transduction  pathways including VEGFR-2  and EGFR 
(14-16).     In  preclinical   studies,  ZD6474   was  a  potent  inhibitor  of  angiogenesis   and

proliferation  of a number of d ifferent tumor cell types ( 17).   Furthe r, it is currently under 
active  inves tigation in c linical trials for the treatm ent of va rious malignant neoplasm s  (17). 
Using the 4- Nitroq uinoline 1-Oxide (4- NQO) mouse model, we have de mons trated that ABT- 
510 (a global inhibitor of angiogenesis) a nd ZD6474 (a dual tyr osine k inase inhibitor (TK I) 
against EGFR  and VE GFR-2) significantly d ecreased the incidence of dy splasia and OSC C 
(18, 19 ).  These da ta support the hypothesis that agen ts with anti-angiogen ic activity may hol d 
promise as chemopreven tive agen ts for OSCC. 
 
1.1           Background  
 
Using th e 4-NQO  model, we found  that ABT- 510 (a global inhibitor of angiogenesis) a nd 
ZD6474 (a dual TKI agai nst EGFR  and VE GFR-2) sign ificantly d ecreased the incidence o f 
dysplasia  and  OSC C  (18, 19) .   In the ZD6 474  study ,  mice  we re  admini stered  4-NQO  (100 
µg/ ml)  in their drinking water for a period of 8 wee ks, returned to normal  water,  and the n 
randomized  to  observati on  or  daily  oral  gavag e  of  ZD6 474  (25  mg/Kg/day )  for  24  weeks . 
During th e 24-week che mopreven tion reg imen, no significant d ifferences in food and fluid 
consumpti on or activity we re observed be tween the gr oups.   At  the com pletion  of the 32 wee k 
study, 71% of the con trol mice and 12% of the ZD647 4-treated mice harbored OS CC ( p<0.001) 
(Tab le 1).  Simila rly, the p roportion of mice with dysplasi a or OSCC  was sign ificantly different 
between the two groups .   In the control g roup, 96% of the ani mals  dem onstrated dy splasia or 
OSC C, wh ile 28% Z D6474  treatm ent group had dys plasia or OSCC (p<0.001).  In total,  this 
represe nted a 71% d ecrease in OSCC or Dy splasia and an 83% d ecrease in OSC C.   ZD6474 
inhibits tumor cell prol iferation and angiogenesis v ia its dual activity agai nst EGFR  and VE GFR- 
2 (14-16 ).    We performed IHC for Ki 67 and CD31 as surroga te markers for p roliferation and 
microve ssel density (M VD).   Ove rall, the p roliferative i ndex (P I) for ZD6474- treated  animals 
was sign ificantly lower when compared to the control mice (Tab le 2).  The control g roup had a 
PI [CONTACT_4007] 46 + 10, whi le the ZD6 474 treatm ent g roup had a PI [CONTACT_4007] 29 + 10 (p<0.001).  Overa ll, there 
was a sign ificant  decreas e  in MVD  in the ZD6 474-treated  mice compare d  to controls .   The 
control gro up had a MVD  score of 265 + 60, wh ile the ZD6 474 treatm ent g roup had a MVD 
score of 106 + 73 (p<0.001).

Vandetani b  (ZD6 474)  is a p otent inhibitor of t he tyrosine kinase activity of kinas e 
insert domain-containing receptor (KDR ), an e ndothe lial cell receptor for vascular en dothe lial 
growth factor (VEGF),  and a lso possesses activity aga inst epi[INVESTIGATOR_682053] r eceptor 
(EGFR).   VE GF is a humoral mediator of e ndothelial  cell proliferation,  and is one of t he 
primary  growth  factor s  responsib le  for  the  initiation  of  new  blood  vesse l  growth .    This 
process, term ed angiogenesis, is essen tial for t he growt h  and disseminat ion of tumors .  By 
[CONTACT_682098], it is hoped that the gro wth of tumors will be contro lled, 
with relati ve sparing of no rmal tissues. 
 
Vandetanib has shown exce llent inhib ition of t umor cell growth in a broad range o f 
pre-c linical models, including lung cancer xenogra fts (Calu-6 a nd A549).   Regression of 
established tumors (PC-9 lun g cancer and PC-3 prostate  cancer) in animals  was observe d 
following oral ad ministra tion.   Vandetanib was c onsidered to have an accepta ble pre-c linical 
toxicolo gy pro file for the p roposed therapeut ic indicatio n.  Vandetanib a lso inhibits epi[INVESTIGATOR_682054] (E GF) stimulated cell pro liferation, tho ugh at a concentration (the molar 
concentration  of  a  com pound  required  to  produce  50%  inhibition  of  a  biologica l  effec t; 
IC50=170  nM) approx imately 3-fo ld higher than that requ ired fo r the inhibiti on of VEGF- 
stimulated cell proliferation (60 nM). 
 
Vandetanib has dem onstrated inhibition of both vascular e ndothe lial growth f actor 
receptor (VE GFR)  and E GFR  tyrosine kinases in vitro , and pre-c linical models have shown 
activity aga inst non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) xenografts.  AstraZen eca has c onducted 
clinical studies in pa tients with NSCL C.  In the Japanese Phase I study (TVE- 15-11 ), 4 of 9 
patients with NSC LC had con firmed partial re sponses (PRs ).   S ubsequently,  2 rando mized 
Phase II studies (6474IL/0003 a nd 6474IL /0006) were  perfo rmed in pat ients with NSCL C 
refractory to first-line therapy .  Vandetanib dem onstrated an advantage in progre ssion-f ree 
surviva l  (PFS)  compare d  with  gefitinib  in  stud y  6474IL/0003,  and  in  combinati on  with 
docetaxel compared with do cetaxel al one in study 6474IL /0006.  The resul ts of these Phase II 
studies led to the desig ns of 4 Phase III studies .  Two studies inves tigated va ndetanib i n

combination studies, the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel provided a statistically significant 
advantage in PFS compared to docetaxel alone; in the smaller study with pemetrexed, there 
was a positive trend for PFS in favor of the addition of vandetanib.  Study D4200C00057 did 
not meet the goal of demons trating superiority in PFS compared to erlotinib, but the efficacy 
of the 2 drugs was equivalent.  Study D4200C00044 was still ongoing at the time of edition 11 
of  the  Investigator’s   Brochure  (IB).     The  most  common  side  effects  associated  with 
vandetanib are rash and diarrhea.  In addition to the studies of vandetanib in NSCLC, several 
other Phase I and II studies are ongoing in other tumors, and a Phase III study in patients with 
medullary thyroid cancer is also ongoing. a

Summa ry of Adverse Events (AE) in Vandetanib (ZD6474) Phase I and Phase II Studies 
The events below are discussed regardless of causality to vandetanib.   Some of these events 
may reflect symptoms of cancer, effects of chemotherapy or radiation, or concomitant medical 
illness.   Events that are thought likely to be causally related to vandetanib are listed in the 
Emerging Safety Profile section below. 
 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
The events, organized by [CONTACT_6213], that were categorized under this system 
organ class include rash, acne, maculo-papular rash, dry skin, night sweats, pruritus, acneform 
dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, contusion, rash ph otosensitivity, photosensitivity reaction, 
desquamation,   erythema,  erythematous   rash,  macular  rash,  pruritic  rash,  pustular  rash, 
follicular  rash,  skin  eruption,  hyperhidrosis,  nail  discoloration,  skin  ulcer,  urticaria  and 
alopoecia. 
 
Most  of  these  skin  disorders  happened  in  the  first  4  weeks  of  treatm ent   and  were 
CTC/ CTCAE  grade 1-2.  There was a tendency for dose-dependent increase in incidence of 
drug-related  adverse events.   At least [ADDRESS_923586] been described, namely, a macular erythema in some patients and a follicular (acneform) 
rash in others.  Also, photosensitive rash has been reported in some of these patients.  When 
vandetanib was combined with pemetrexed, 10 patients developed skin rash; [ADDRESS_923587] of these adverse events were CTC/CTCAE 
grade 1 or 2 and did not need interruption of study treatment.   Routine anti-diarrheal agents 
are also recommended.   Abdominal pain has been seen in Phase I, but was not common in 
Phase II studies.

Gene ral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 
Fatigue, pyrexia and peripheral  edema were observed, as were asthenia, rigors, chest pain, 
chest  tightness,  mucosal  inflammation,  abnormal  gait,  and lethargy.   Most of the adverse 
events were CTC/CTCAE grade 1-2; grade [ADDRESS_923588] inhibitors, and was a DLT

observed  in a study of vandetanib  combined  with docetaxel  (6474IL/0006.)    It is unclear 
whether deep vein thrombos is and pulmonary hemorrhage may be related to vandetanib or 
reflect the underlying cancer or co-morbid conditions.

Other reported adverse events included pharyngolaryngeal pain, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], dysphonia, hiccups, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_682056], rhinorrhea, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary artery thrombosis. 
 
Other adverse events 
Other commonly reported AEs included nervous system disorders (lethargy, neuropathy 
peripheral,  headache and dysaesthesia),  blood and lymphatic system disorders (neutropenia 
and thrombocytopenia) and metabolism and nutrition disorders (hypokalaemia). 
 
QT/ QTc Prolongationa 
Phase I studies 
Prolongation  of  the  ECG  corrected  QT  interval  was  initially  observed  in  Phase  I and  II 
studies, and no patients experienced  symptoms definitely related to QTc prolongation.   On 
rare  occasions,  patients  with  QTc  prolongation   have  experienced   cardiac  arrhythmias; 
however, all patients had confounding factors that were much more likely to be the cause. 
 
Phase II studies 
Prolongation of the QTc interval, using Baze tt's correction, was seen in Phase II studies.  No 
significant changes in heart rate were observed across any of the doses studied.   No patient 
developed symptomatic  ventricular arrhythmias, although [ADDRESS_923590] a non-sustained run of ventricular tachycardia while in 
a monitored hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (see below).  Using extensive ECG monitoring to assess the QTc 
prolongation  more  closely,  at a dose of 300  mg/day,  QTc  prolongation  resulting  in dose 
reduction  has  been  seen  in  approximately  5%  of  patients,  and  at  a  do se  of  100  mg  in 
combination with chemotherapy in <2% of patients. 
 
Phase III studies 
In the Phase III studies, the incidence of prolongation of the ECG QTc interval was seen in 
1.9% of patients treated with vandetanib 100 mg plus docetaxel and in 0.4% of patients treated 
with  vandetanib  100  mg  plus  pemetrexed.     No  patients  receiv ing  vandetanib  100  mg 
experienced  torsade  de pointes  or other  arrhythmia  attributed  to prolongation  of the QTc

Emerging Safety Profilea 
Vandetanib produces repolarization  abnormalities  in human myocardium that are consistent 
with blockade of the IKR (potassium) channel.  The most consistent electrop hysiologic effects 
are a change in T-wave morphology (flattening, broadening or notching) and prolongation of 
the QT interval, both of which occur more commonly as the dose is increased.   Vandetanib 
can cause rash, diarrhea and hypertension, all of which appear to be dose-related and are likely 
to be related to the pharmacologic activity of vandetanib. 
 
The drug-related AEs seen with vandetanib monotherapy are also expected to occur in 
combination with chemotherapy.   All drug-related AEs expected to occur in association with 
the concomitant chemotherapeutic agent(s) (as defined and listed in the package insert[s]) will 
be expected to occur when used in combination with vandetanib.   The relevant product 
information for the concomitant chemotherapy should be used to determine these expected, 
drug-related AEs. 
 
Reported adverse events that may be related to vandetanib are listed below by [CONTACT_6764]: 
 
Cardiovascular 
Abnormal ECG (with or witho ut QT prolongation; i.e. either T-wave or ST-segment changes 
consistent with repolarization  abnormalities), torsade-de-pointes and ventricular tachycardia 
(both at 300 mg daily dose) and hypertension. 
 
Cardiac failure (300 mg daily dose) (See Appendix C for the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) Cardiac Classifications.) 
 
Central Nervo us System –headache, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy  Syndrome

Skin and Appendages – acneform rash, pruritus, macular or macupapular rash (generalized 
or localized), localiz ed and generalized erythema, photosensitivity reaction, sweating.   On 
occasion (especially when given with chemotherapy) these have progressed to more serious 
conditions to include exfoliative dermatitis, skin desquamation,  erythroderma,  toxicoderma, 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], erythema multiforme 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  – interstitial lung disease (ILD).   A very small number of patients with lung 
cancer   receiving   vandetanib   have   developed   shortness   of   breath   and   cough   due   to 
inflammation  or  scar  tissue  formation  in  the  lungs  (although  this  could  be  due  to  the 
underlying lung cancer) 
 
Renal – proteinuria, hematuria 
 
Vascular – Arterial ischaemic  events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral 
ischaemia) 
 
Psychiatric - Mood disorders (anxiety, depression, insomnia).  It is possible that these events 
are not direct effects of vandetanib, but rather are secon dary to symptoms of cancer or to other 
effects of vandetanib (rash, etc.).

Rationale 
Our data support the hypothesis that agents with anti-angiogenic activity may hold promise in 
chemoprevention.  Therefore, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
phase II trial that will assess the pharmacodynamic  effects of ZD6474 in high-risk patients. 
The primary endpoint will examine the ability of ZD6474 to inhibit angiogenesis, as measured 
by [CONTACT_682100].  Secondary endpoints will include inhibition of proliferation, modulation of EGFR 
and VEGFR2  phosphorylation, tolerability and feasibility of administration, and development 
of OSCC.  We hypothesize that ZD6474 will inhibit angiogenesis in preneoplastic tissues 
compared to placebo.   These results will serve as proof of principle to implement larger 
prospective chemoprevention trials of anti-angiogenic or anti-EGFR  inhibitors in high-risk 
patients. 
 
Study Design: This will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study with a 
primary endpoint of reducing MVD  in preneoplastic lesions at 3 months compared to baseline. 
We will administer ZD6474 or placebo  for 6 months and monitor subjects for up to 3 years. 
Biopsies will be obtained at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months from the same area of known 
dysplasia  and banked in the Biobanking  and Pathology Core.   A placebo  control group is

Vandetanib (ZACTIMA ™; ZD6474 ) 
 
 
 
necessary due to the lack of validated historic controls in this population and ethical because 
standard of care in these patients would be active surveillance. 
 
Proposed study population: Only subjects felt to be at high risk for OSCC  will be enrolled to 
maximize risk/benefit ratio.   Subjects will be required to have an area of dysplasia on prior 
biopsy or a history of OSC C. Using these criteria, subjects would be expected to have a 
significant cumulative lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_682057] ~50%.   Other eligibility criteria 
are will include normal organ function, QTc interval < 450ms, performance status > 70% on 
the Karnofsky scale, and age > 18 years. 
 
Choice  of  primary  endpoint:  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_682058] C, there are no established chemopreventive agents.   Prior Phase III studies 
have  been  negative  due  to  a  lack  of  efficacy,  inadequate  understanding  of  molecular 
mechanisms underlying the intervention, or tolerability of the agent for long periods of time. 
Therefore, with preclini cal and safety data strongly supporting the rationale for administering 
ZD6474 as a chemopreventative agent, this study will assess two critical limitations of prior 
approaches.    The  primary  endpoint  reflects  an  effect  of  ZD6474  on  microvessel  density 
(MVD)  in  preneoplastic  lesions  which  correlated  strongly  with  OSCC  inhibition  in  the 
preclini cal model and serves as a surrogate for the latter.  We will also assess tolerability and 
feasibility of administering ZD6474 for 6 months (see below).  The results of this trial would 
inform the planning of larger studies of this approach in preventing OSCC. 
 
Second ary Endpoints: The trial will examine endpoints related to putative targets of ZD6474, 
safety and tolerability, and OSCC  development.   To assess the biologic effect of EGFR  and 
VEGFR2  inhibition,  tissues  will  be  analyzed  by  [CONTACT_682101],  EGFR,  pVEGFR 2, 
VEGFR2, and Ki-67.   We hypothesize that biopsies from ZD6474 patients will exhibit 
significantly lower expression of pEGFR  and VEGFR2  and proliferation indices. 
 
A critical parameter of successful chemoprevention efforts is adherence and safety. 
Ideally, an agent would be easily administered for a duration that will affect the natural history 
of the disorder and be well tolerated.  ZD6474  is an orally available, well-tolerated drug with 
demonstrated  anti-angiogenic  and  EGFR  inhibitory  properties  that  has  been  administered 
safely  to  patients  for  pro longed  periods.    ZD6474  has  been  studied  in  [ADDRESS_923591]  common 
adverse events being rash, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypertension.  Reversible and dose 
related QT prolongation has been observed with ZD6474.   At 300 mg daily, dose reduction 
has been required in approximately 15% of subjects for QTc prolongation.   Deep venous 
thrombosis has been observed with ZD6474 but these events are rare (1% incidence) and it is 
unclear whether they are causally related to the agent.  Recently a placebo controlled, phase 3, 
2:1 randomized study administering ZD6474 in patients with medullary thyroid cancer was 
reported.  The primary endpoint of progression-free survival significantly favored ZD6474 
(Hazard ratio = 0.46 (0.31–0.69), p<0.0001).  Amo ng the 231 subjects enrolled to receive 
ZD6474, medi an duration of therapy was 90 weeks with only 12% of subjects discontinuing 
therapy due to an adverse event.   The most common  grade 3 or greater adverse events and

large  randomized  trials,  ZD6474  can  be  safely  and  feasibly  administered  for  prolonged 
periods.

difference between groups.

that additional information and assays for biomarkers that are important for the response to

3.6           Guidance on the Management of Toxicity 
 
In all cases where the do se of study treatm ent has been reduced/modified or the patient 
withdrawn due to unusual or unusually severe toxicity considered related to study treatment, 
the investigator must contact [CONTACT_682106]. 
 
All patients  who  experience  any NCI CTCAE  grade 3 or 4, including  QTc  changes  (see 
below), skin, gastrointestinal and other adverse events must be permanently discontinued from 
study treatment and monitored until resolution or return to baseline. 
 
For guidance on the management of QTc prolongation, see Figure 1 below.  Also see 
Appendix A - Medications  Known to Prolong the QT Interval and/or Induce Torsades De 
Pointes (TDP). 
 
For all other toxicities, the dose of study treatm ent will be with held for up to 3 weeks until the 
toxicity has resolved to CTCAE  grade 0 or baseline.  Study treatm ent may then be restarted at 
a reduce d dose (see Table 3 below).  Patients will be withdrawn from the study if toxicity does 
not resolve to  CTCAE  grade [ADDRESS_923608] ECGs performed to monitor QTc interval (using Bazett’s  correction) as 
outlined in the study plan. 
 
QTc prolongation is defined as: 
 Two consecutive  QTc measurements, within 48 hours of one another,  where either of 
the following criteria are met for both QTc values (the second being the mean of 3 
consecutive ECGs): 
 A QTc interval  450 msec  OR 
 An increase of > 60 msec from baseline QTc.

For a sing le QTc value of > 450 msec but < 500 msec, vandetanib may be continued but a 
repeat  ECG  (in  triplicate)  must  be  obtaine d  within  [ADDRESS_923609]  be held .   ECGs and electr olytes  should be followed 3 times a 
week until QTc fa lls below 450 msec or baseline whichever is higher.  Vandetanib treatment 
may be res umed at a lower dose a fter the QTc recove rs to < 450 msec o r baseline whichever is 
highe r. 
 
If the pa tient does not meet the c riteria for QTc prolonga tion  at the rep eat ECG, then th e 
patient should continue tr eatm ent a nd resume the E CG schedu le as ou tlined in the Study Plan. 
 
Patients expe riencing NCI CTCAE  grade 3 or 4 QTc p rolonga tion, i.e. QTc ≥ 501 msec or > 
60 ms change from base line and Torsades de pointes or p olymorphic ventricular tachy cardia 
or  signs/symptom s  of  serious  arrhyth mia  must  discontinu e  treatm ent  AND  admitte d  to 
hosp ital for monitoring until resolu tion or return to baseline. 
 
3.6.2        Manage ment of Sk in Toxicity  
 
It is strongly recommende d  that a ll patients  follow a progra m  of sun protecti ve  measures 
while receiving s tudy therapy and for 3-4 weeks a fter discontinuing study therapy .  The aim is 
to reduce the risk o f development o f skin rash, minimize the seve rity of skin rash, a nd to 
minimize the re quirement  for dose reducti on of study therapy.

If a patient develops a skin rash, the following actions  are recommended to the Investigator 
for the management of this reactio n: 
 
 A variety of agents can be used to manage skin rashes.  These include mild to moderate 
strength steroid creams, topi[INVESTIGATOR_11981], topi[INVESTIGATOR_682064], and occasio nally retinoid creams. 
 
 The rash should be graded/assessed by a physician as soon as possible according to the 
CTCAE  cutaneous toxicity criteria and documented accordingly 
 
 If a rash of CTCAE grade 2 is detected, immediate symptomatic  treatm ent should be 
provided. 
 
 If a rash of CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_923610] be withheld for >3 weeks due 
to cutaneous toxicity, the patient will be discontinued. 
 
3.6.3        Management of Gastrointestinal (GI) Toxicity 
 
Nausea, vomiting, or both may be controlled  with antiemetic  therapy.   In subjects who have 
emesis and are unable to retain vandetanib/ placebo, every attempt should be made to obtain 
control of nausea and vomiting.  The dose of vandetanib/ placebo  may be repeated if emesis 
occurs within [ADDRESS_923611] be admitted and evaluated using telemetry, until clinically 
stable.  Upon  recovery, treatm ent may resume at a permanently reduced dose (refer to section 
3.3.5.)  If vandetanib must be withheld for more than [ADDRESS_923612] permanently discontinue study treatment. 
 
3.6.4        Other Toxicity 
 
If any other CTCAE  grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is not outlined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] to [IP_ADDRESS] 
develops and is attributable to vandetanib, vandetanib should be permanently discontinued. 
 
If study treatm ent must be interrupted for more than 3 weeks to allow for toxicity to resolve, 
the patient’s  vandetanib will be discontinued.

Subjects  will be randomized  to receive  ZD6474  (vandetanib,)  versus  placebo  for up to 6 
months. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Doses and Treatm ent Regimens 
 
ZD6474 [ADDRESS_923614](s)  cannot  swallow  tablets,  see  Appendix  E  for  Instructions   for  Dispersing 
Vandetanib Tablets. 
 
Missed or Forgotten Doses 
If the subject inadvertently does not take the dose in the morning, he or she may take that 
day’s dose any time up to [ADDRESS_923615] take the 
next scheduled dose and the missed dose will not be made up.  The dose of study medication 
may be repeated if vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the study treatment. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]     Labeling 
 
Labeling of the investigational product will be performed in accordance with Good 
Manufacturing Practic es (GMP.)  [COMPANY_008], or a company acting on their behalf, will pack 
tablets into hi gh-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant tamper-evident 
closures.   Each bottle will be labeled with the statement: "Caution: New Drug - Limited  by 
[CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_003])  Law to Investigational Use".  Instructions stating that the tablets are to be 
taken orally “as directed  by [CONTACT_4904]” will be included.   Information  on the label will 
indicate the identity and quantity of tablets and storage conditions.   Additional subject 
information will be identified as dictated by [CONTACT_760]; it may be necessary for information 
to be recorded on the label by [CONTACT_471079].

refer to the investigational product label. 
 
3.9.2  Accountability 
 
All subjects will maint ain a drug diary documenting drug administration and adverse events 
(Appendix B).  At each visit, subjects will return any unused drug and pi[INVESTIGATOR_682068]. 
 
The investigator or designated study personnel are responsible for maintaining accurate 
dispensing records of the study drug.  All study drug must be accounted for, including study 
drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  All discrepancies between amoun ts of study drug 
dispensed and amoun ts returned must be documented.   Under no circumstances will the 
investigator allow the investigational drug to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_682107].   If appropriate, drug storage, drug dispensing, and drug 
accountability may be delegated to the pharmacy section  of the investigative site.

3.9.4        Blinding and Procedures for Unblinding the Study 
 
Methods for ensuring blinding 
A  secure  online  registration  interface  has  been  developed  to  register  patients,  and  it  is 
integrated with the randomization component.   This type of an interface has been used 
successfully in other Head and Neck cancer clinical trials at the University of Chicago (e.g. 
DeCIDE).   At the time of patient registration  an electro nic notification  will be sent to the 
study pharmacist.   To randomize the patient, the pharmacist will securely login into the 
registration system, which will provide the randomized treatment assignment.   Only the 
pharmacist will have access to the treatm ent assignment to maintain the blinding. 
 
Methods for unblinding the study 
In the event of an emerg ency,  [CONTACT_682134]   at the University of Chicago shall be

will ascertain  the treatme nt  assigned  to that patient by [CONTACT_682108] a designated 
website,  and  inform  the  caller  of  the  patient’s  treatm ent.    If  a  patient  is  emerg ently 
unblinded, he/she is considered to be off treatment, but should continue to be followed 
for outcome evaluations. 
 
3.9.[ADDRESS_923618]-Study Treatment(s) 
 
Concomitant use of any therapy during study must be documented and should be approved by 
[CONTACT_682109].  Concomita nt use of the known potent inducers of 
CYP3A4:   rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], barbiturates and St. Jo hn's Wort are not 
allowed within [ADDRESS_923619] on the exposure to vandetanib in humans, and therefore these can be co- 
administered with vandetanib. 
 
A potent CYP3A4 inducer has been shown to reduce the exposure to vandetanib by 40% thus 
the co-administration of such inducers with vandetanib is not allowed.  A potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor has been shown have little effect on the exposure to vandetanib and therefore these 
can be co-administered with vandetanib. 
 
In vitro data has shown vandetanib inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.  Based on the maximum 
steady state total plasma concentrations observed in patients the I/Ki ratio for both these is less 
than 0.10, and a SimCYP simulation for the potential inhibition of CYP2D6 (lower IC50 and 
Ki), concluded there would be little effect on CYP2D6 substrates.  Thus  substrates of both 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C8 may be co-administered with vandetanib. 
 
Patients   who  require  medication   that  may  prolong  the  QT  interval   while  on  study: 
antiarrhythmic drugs (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, 
sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited 
to cloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]), that the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_682063], should be discontinued 
from the study.  Refer to Appendix A for a list of medications  known to induce Torsades de 
Pointes.

The  definitions  of  Adverse  Events  (AEs)  and  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  are  given 
below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff involved in the study be familiar  with the 
content of this section.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_129130]. 
 
Adverse Event 
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medi cal condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not  considered causally related to the product.   An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., 
tachycardia,  enlarged  liver)  or  the  abnormal  results  of  an  investigation  (e.g.,  laboratory 
findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition 
occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatm ent has 
been administered. 
 
Any detrime ntal change in a patient’s condition subsequent to them entering the study and 
during the follow-up period should be considered an AE.  When there is a deterioration in the 
condition for which the study treatment is being used, there may be unce rtainty as to whether 
this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless the reporting physician considers that 
study treatment contributed to the deterioration or local regulations  state to the contrary, the 
deterioration should be considered a lack of efficacy .  Signs and symptoms of disease 
progression are therefore not considered AEs. 
 
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE.  New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after 
inclusion of the patient into the clinical study. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (e.g., run-in, 
treatm ent, washout, follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or 
placebo, that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: 
-  Results in death 
-  Is immediately life-threatening 
-  Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
-  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
-  Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
-  Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medi cal 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Any event or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_682073], as 
determined by [CONTACT_093], must not be reported as an SAE, however should be 
communicated to [COMPANY_008] 
 
The  causality  of  SAEs  (their  relations hip  to  all study  treatment)  will  be  assessed  by [CONTACT_1275](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008].

Serious and Unex pected  Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
 
A serious adverse event is considered to be a suspected adverse reaction if there evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship to the adverse event.  This may include a single occurrence of an 
event strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), one or more 
occurrence of an event otherwise uncommon is the study population, or an aggregate analysis 
of specific events occurring at greater frequency than expected from historical controls, or 
occurs at a greater frequency in the investigational versus the placebo  arm of the study. 
 
Unexpected events are those not listed at the observed specificity or severity in the protocol, 
consent, investigator brochure, FDA-approved package insert, or elsewhere in the current IND 
application.  This includes adverse events listed in the protocol, consent or IND as occurring 
within the class of drugs or otherwise expected from the drug’s pharmacological  properties 
but which have not been previously observed with this investigational agent. 
 
ALL  S[LOCATION_003]RS  occurring on this clinical trial must be reported to the FDA.   Refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting guidelines.  
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit, graded using Common Toxicity Crite ria 
Version 4.0, and assigned an attribution to study drug from 1-5 (not related, unlikely related, 
possibly related, probably related, definite ly related).  Adverse event onset, resolution, action 
taken, and whether it constitutes a serious adverse event will be recorded. 
 
Pregnancy should be excluded before randomization.  Should a pregnancy occur during study 
participation,  it must  be reported  in accordance  with  the procedures  described  in Section  
7.1,  Procedures in Case of Pregnancy.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless 
there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_682074] a contraceptive medication 
 
All non-serious  adverse events will be reported to [COMPANY_008] at the conclusion of the study.

4.              PHARMACO KINETICS  & PHARMACODYN AMICS 
 
4.1            Pharmacodynamics 
 
Biopsy: 
A biopsy will be performed prior to starting therapy (baseline), [ADDRESS_923623] and frozen at -80 C with the other half placed in 10% buffered formalin, 
processed and embedded in paraffin. 
 
Immu nohistochemistry: 
For detection  of CD34, antigen retrieval will be achieved by [CONTACT_682115] K (Cat # 
S3004) treatment for 15 minutes at room temperature.  Endogenous peroxidase activity will be 
quenched with 1% hydrogen/methanol.   The primary antibody for CD34  (Vector, Catalog # 
VP-C345) will be applied at 1: 50 dilution for a one hour incubation at room temperature, 
followed by [CONTACT_14181]-rabbit polymer labeled HRP  bound secondary reagent (DAKO 
Envision+System-HRP). 
 
For detection  of phospho rylated EGFR  (pEGFR)  and phosphorylated VEGFR-2 (pVEGFR-2), 
antigen retrieval will be achieved using Immu no/DNA  retriever with citrate (BioSB, 
SantaBarbara,  CA  Catalog # BSB0021).   Endogenous peroxidase activity will be quenched 
with Mouse/Rabbit ImmunoDetecto r Peroxidase Block Kit.  Sections  will be incubated using 
primary  antibody  to  pVEGFR-2  1:300  (Abcam,  Cam bridge,  MA;  Catalog  #  ab38464)  or 
pEGFR   1:250   (Cell  signaling,   Danvers,   MA  Catalog   #4407)   for  one  hour  at  room 
temperature.   Antibod y binding will be visualized by [CONTACT_682116]/Rabbit ImmunoDetector 
HRP/DAB  Detection  System (BioSBSanta Barbara, CA Catalog # BAB0003).

Vandetanib (ZACTIMA ™; ZD6474 ) 
 
 
 
For detection  of Ki-67, antigen retrieval will be achieved using 10mM TrisBase, 1mM EDTA 
pH 9.0.  Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 1% hydrogen peroxide/Methanol. 
The primary antibody for Ki67 (NeoMarkers,  Fremont, CA; Catalog # RM-1906), sections 
will be incubated at a 1:300 dilution at room temperature for one hour followed by [CONTACT_14181]-rabbit 
polymer labeled HRP  bound secondary reagent (Envision+ system-HRP). 
 
All immunohistochemistry stains will be developed with DAB  chromogen and counterstained 
with hematoxylin.   Corresponding negative control experiments were performed by [CONTACT_682117]. 
 
Scoring of immunohistochemical staining will be performed using the Automated Cellular 
Imaging System (Aperio Image Analysis Workstation).  Stained sections will be scanned and 
acqu ired using an Aperio imaging/microscopy system.   Proliferation will be me asured by 
[CONTACT_682118][INVESTIGATOR_682078]67 for each 
specim en.    For determination  of microvessel  density  (MV D),  the total  number  of CD34- 
stained clusters or single cells, with or witho ut a lumen, was quantified for each specim en. 
For pVEGFR-2 and pEGFR  quantification  was, an index of staining will be calculated and 
expressed as the percentage of staining multiplied by [CONTACT_682119]. 
 
DNA from periphera l blood: 
A 10 ml purple-top (EDTA-containing) vacutainer will be used to draw blood at baseline. The 
site coordinator or designee at each site will separate plasma from buffy coat by [CONTACT_36929] 3500 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. Plasma will be aliquoted into 2 ml cyrovials and stored at - 
80°C for future biomarker studies. The buffy coat of cells will be transferred to a separate 
tube, to which 5 mL of PBS will be added and mixed with the buffy coat. The buffy coat tube 
+ PBS will be centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 RPM, the supernatant will be removed and the 
cell pellet will be stored at -80 for LOH and other biomarker analysis. 
 
Serum: 
Serum samples will be collected prior to therapy on all patients and at [ADDRESS_923624] tubes.   Blood  in the serum collection  tube should be allowed  to clot for 60 
minut es and then centrifuged to separate serum.   Serum should be stored in 2 mL cryovial 
tubes  (Nalge ne  Cat#  5000-0020)  in  410uL  aliquots.     Samples  should  be  labeled  with 
institution, protocol number, patient initials, patient registration number, and the date and time 
of draw.  Serum samples should be stored at -80°C. 
 
Saliva collection, stabilization and processing 
Unstimulated saliva samples will be procured from subjects prior to starting therapy, at [ADDRESS_923625] one hour prior to the collection.  Saliva samples will be centrifuged at 
2,600  x  g  for  15  min  at  4°C.    The  supernatant  will  be  removed  from  the  pellet  and 
imme diately mixed with SUPERase•In (Ambion Inc., TX) or with a cocktail of protease 
inhibitors ([COMPANY_002], [LOCATION_003]).

4.2           Electrocardiogram (ECG) Assessments for Study Plan 
 
•  Baseline QTc (Bazett’ s) will be determined by [CONTACT_682121] (3) 
consecutive ECGs (within 5-10 minutes of one another.) 
 
ECGs will be repeated at weeks 1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25; at discontinuation; and as 
clinically indicated (ECGs to be consistent with the chemotherapy schedule, where 
relevant.)  In addition, upon occurrence of electrolyte disturbances or severe diarrhea, 
close monitoring of ECGs is recommended. 
 
•  If QTc prolongation occurs at one of the usual assessment times, or at any other time, 
the QTc  will  be re-evaluated  with  no  less  than  3 consecutive  ECGs  (within  5-10 
minut es)  of one another,  as per baseline  (R efer  to Section  [IP_ADDRESS],  “QTc

This  is  a randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  with  a primary  endpoint  of 
reducing  microvessel  density  (MVD)  in  preneoplastic  lesions  at  [ADDRESS_923626] of care for these patients  would be active 
surveillance.  Patients eligible to participate in this trial will be at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_682080], but will be free of disease when enrolled on the study.  Thus, commonly used clinical 
trial endpoints such as response rate or progression-free  survival are not applicable to this 
patient population.  Time to disease recurrence could be used as the primary endpoint, but due 
to the incidence of cancer developm ent even among the high-risk patients, this endpoint will 
require too large a sample size to be feasible at this point. 
 
Eligible patients will be randomized to ZD6474 (treatment) or placebo (control) arms for [ADDRESS_923627] of ZD6474  on microvessel  density 
(MVD)  in  preneoplastic  lesions  which  correlated  strongly  with  OSCC  inhibition  in  the 
preclini cal model and serves as a surrogate for the latter.   Secondary endpoints will include 
feasibility, safety and tolerability of ZD6474, development  of OSC C, as well as molecular 
studies of putative targets of ZD6474. 
 
5.3           Description of Analysis Sets 
 
Full  Analysis  Set  (intention-to-treat  population):  The  full  analysis  set  is  the  primary 
analysis population and will consist of all randomized patients. 
 
Safety  Set:  The  safety  set  will  consist  of  all  randomized  patients  who  receiv ed  trial 
medication at least once.  This set will be used for safety analyses. 
 
5.4           Method of Statistical Analysis 
 
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint of this study is the comparison between treatment 
groups  of  the  within-patient  change  in  MVD  score  from  baseline  to  3-months  following 
treatm ent initiation (ΔMVD).  The primary analysis upon which the sample  size calculations 
are based is the comparison of ΔMVD  between treatm ent arms using a two-sample t-test with 
unequal variances.  A Wilcoxon ranksum test may be used if the normality assumption is not

satisfied.  Alternatively, ΔMVD  may be transformed (e.g. log-transformation) to satisfy the 
normality  assumption.    Additional  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  will  include  linear 
regression models with treatm ent effect and other prognostic factors as covariates.  Model 
selection will follow strategies described in Harrell (2001 ). 
 
Secondary Endpoints: ZD6474 has been studied in [ADDRESS_923628] or 
Fisher’s exact test. 
 
Adherence to treatm ent will be monitored by [CONTACT_6270]-administered patient diaries.  Rem aining pi[INVESTIGATOR_682081], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_682082]-reporting.  Adherence rates will be defined as 
the number of doses admin istered divided by [CONTACT_682122], 
and will be summarized for each 3-month period.   Agreeme nt between pi[INVESTIGATOR_68336]- 
reported doses administered will be analyzed using the kappa coefficient and Bland-Altm an 
plots. 
 
Subjects will be moni tored for the development of oral and other cancers.  We expect that 
ZD6474 treated patients will have a lower incidence of OSCC.  Time  to cancer development 
will  be summarized  using  the method  of Kaplan  and  Meier  for  each  treatm ent  arm,  and 
compared between arms using the logrank test.  In addition, yearly incidence rates will be 
reported.  However, the study is clearly unde rpowered to demonstrate a statistically significant 
difference between groups  with respect to time-to-event or incidence rates due to the low 
expected overall number of cancer cases. 
 
To assess the biologic effect of EGFR  and VEGFR2 inhibition, tissues will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_682123], EGFR,  pVEGFR 2, VEGFR 2, and Ki-67.  We hypothesize that biopsies from 
ZD6474 patients will exhibit significantly lower expression of pEGFR  and VEGFR2  and 
proliferation indices.  Expression levels will be measured on a continuo us scale, and within- 
patient changes in expression will be compared between treatm ent arms using a t-test or 
Wilcoxon ranksum test as appropriate. 
 
5.5           Determination of Sample Size 
 
Changes in within-patient MVD  scores from baseline to 3-months of treatm ent (ΔMVD)  will 
be compared between the treatm ent arms using a two-sample  t-test with uneq ual variance.  We 
assume that baseline mean and variance will be similar to what is reported in Li et al (29) who 
examined MVD  in 52 samples with mild, moderate and severe dysplasia.  To calculate sample 
size we make  the following assumptions: 
 
•  baseline average MVD = 30.1 (the weighted average of all dysplastic samples in Li et 
al);

Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_682088]  a 
contraceptive  medicatio n.     However,  the outcome  o f all pregnancies  (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed 
up and document ed even if the subject was discontinued from the study.   Should pregnancy 
occur during a female  subject’s trial participation, the female  subject will imme diately be 
discontinued from the trial and followed-up per protocol. 
 
All reports  of congenital  abnormalities/birth  defects  are SAEs.   Spontaneous  miscarriages 
should  also  be  reported  and  handled  as  SAEs.    Elective  abortions  without  complications 
should not be handled as AEs.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be followed-up, documented 
and reported to [COMPANY_008].  The site will complete and forward  to [COMPANY_008] their site- 
specific  pregnancy form.  The following information must be reported to [COMPANY_008]: 
 
•  DOB,  Occup ation 
•  Relevant medi cal history (pregnancy risk factors, smoking alcohol, etc.) 
•  Relevant family history 
•  Previous pregnancies (overall number, deliveries, spontaneous miscarriage, etc) 
•  Current pregnancy (LMP, expected delivery date, any amniocentesis, chorionic villus 
sampling, in-vitro fertiliz ation) 
•  Concomitant  medi cations  taken  during  pregnancy  (name,  total  daily  dose,  therapy 
duration, indication) 
•  Outcome  of  pregnancy  (i.e.,  full-term,  premature  birth,  spontaneous  miscarriage, 
elective termination.   If premature birth, specify gestational age in weeks.  If elective 
abortion, specify if any medical reason.) 
•  Details   of  birth  (i.e.,  DOB,  weight,   sex,  healthy  baby,  sick  baby,   congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, still birth, multiple births, sickness manifestations, etc.) 
•  Any complications, infections,  illness during pregnancy

MEDICATIONS  KNOWN TO PROLONG THE QT INTER VAL AND/OR 
INDUCE TORSADES  DE POINTES (TDP) 
 
Appendix A updated [ADDRESS_923640] 2011 
 
It has been recognized for a number of years that certain prescription medi cations  can prolong 
the QT/QTc interval and cause a form of acquired Long QT syndrom e, known as drug 
induced LQTS.  The drugs that prolong the QT interval and/or have a risk of inducing 
Torsades de Pointes (TdP) are listed below.  We have divided these into two groups based on 
their known or perceived risk of causing TdP: 
 
Group 1. Drugs that are generally accep ted by [CONTACT_682129] a risk of causing 
Torsades de Pointes 
 
Concomitant use of these drugs is not allowed during the study or within 2 weeks of 
randomization  (at least four weeks for levomethadyl).  These drugs should also be avoided for 
up to 4 weeks following discontinuation of study treatm ent:

[LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA)  Cardiac Clas sification 
 
The NYHA classification system relates symptoms to everyday activities and the patient’s quality of life. 
Class Symptoms 
Class I (Mild) No limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue  
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea (shortness of breath). 
Class II (Mild) Slight limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but ordinary  physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea. 
Class III (Moderate) Marked limitation of physical activity.  Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary  
activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea. 
Class IV (Severe) Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of cardiac 
insufficiency at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Instructions for Dispersing Vandetanib Tablets 
 
Do not crush tablets.  Drop the number of vandetanib tablets required for a single dose into an 
appropriate container (ideally glass to help confirm  removal of all the dispersed material) 
containing approximately 2 ounces (or 50 mL) of water (either drinking water, sterile water 
for injectio n, or purified water) at room temperature.  Stir the liquid occasionally to ensure 
complete break-up of the tablets.  When the tablets  have broken up into a fine dispersion 
(approximately 10 to 15 minut es) it can be administered to the patient.  Administration to the 
patient should occur immediately after dispersion is complete whenever possible. 
 
To ensure delivery of the whole dose, rinse the container with a similar amount of water to 
ensure removal of any mat erial adhering to the walls of the container and administer the 
additional water to the patient. 
 
Glass  Contamination 
As long as the glassware is cleaned thoroughly after use, using standard washing detergent or 
in a dishwasher then the risk of glass contamination is minimal.   As an extra precaution, it 
could be suggested that the patient dedicates one glass for preparation of the oral dispersion, 
which is not used by [CONTACT_682130]. 
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_682094], it should be cleaned up using plenty of water and the area 
washed with water until no residual drug remains.  If the dispersion is spi[INVESTIGATOR_682095], the 
skin should be washed with plenty of clean water.   If there is any contact [CONTACT_124219], they 
should be irrigated with plenty of clean water for at least 10 minutes. 
 
Stability Summary 
Experimentation has shown that vandetanib tablets will break up into a fine dispersion within 
10 to 15 minutes when they are dropped whole into water (either drinking water, sterile water 
for injection, or purified water) at room temperature.   The dispersion should be administered 
to the patient imme diately if possible.  In the event of a delay in administration, the dispersion 
is chemically stable up to 4 hours after preparation. 
 
The  data  confirms  that  aqueous  dispersal  of  vandetanib  (as  described  above)  has  no 
detrimental  effects  on  the  release  of  the  activ e  pharmaceutical  ingredient  (API)  when 
compared to administration of the intact tablet and that a delay of up to [ADDRESS_923643] of pH of the water used for dispersion was evaluated over the range pH 5 – 
8.  Over this range, the pH of the water used for dispersing the tablets has no significant effect 
on the dispersion times.

The temperature range defined in the USP  for controlled room temperature excursions that are 
experienced in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185404] 15 °C to 30 °C.  Over this range, the temperature of the water does 
have an effect on tablet dispersion times with the tablets taking longer to disperse at lower 
temperatures.  All tablets tested dispersed within [ADDRESS_923644]

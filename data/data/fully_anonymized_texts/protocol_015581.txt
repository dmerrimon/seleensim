 3.0.  Clinical Investigation Plan Overview 
The purpose of this extended study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in combination with the 
commercially available Atrium iCAST ™ covered stent in patients with an unsuitable 
distal sealing site for a Zenith® iliac leg component proximal to the common iliac 
bifurcation to maintain internal iliac artery patency during endovascular aneurysm repair.   
 This extended study is designed as a prospective, non-randomized study enrolling up to 60 additional patients to receive the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation 
at up to 30 clinical sites.  This additional enrollment will include a cohort of 40 patients who will be treated with the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in 
combination with the Atrium iCAST ™ covered stent, which is replacing the alternate 
covered stents used in a portion of the additional patients already enrolled in the extended study (18 patients) as well as the initial cohort of 40 patients accrued prior to the extended study.  Patients with anatomy amenable to endovascular repair, who meet other enrollment criteria (see section 8.6), will be included in this extended study , which will 
be complete with respect to enrollment upon accrual of 40 patients treated with the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in combination with the Atrium 
iCAST ™ covered stent .  Patients who do not meet the criteria will be excluded.  A 
patient will be considered enrolled in the study once the delivery system of the study device has been inserted under the skin.  As depi[INVESTIGATOR_673030] 1, all patients will be evaluated clinically and radiographically (when applicable) at pre -procedure, procedure, pre -discharge, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 
60 months.  Additionally, it is recommended that all previously enrolled patients who 
received the ConnectSX ™ undergo CT follow -up to assess stent integrity every six 
months unless the stent has been relined to treat an observed or threatened Type III endoleak.

 4.0.  Objectives of the Clinical Investigation  
The objectives of this extended study are to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation with the Atrium iCAST ™ stent.  
 4.1.  Primary Objectives  
Primary Endpoint: The primary assessment will be based on 6- month freedom from 
patency -related intervention since the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac 
Bifurcation is intended to maintain blood flow to the internal iliac artery and minimize the risk of associated clinical symptoms with the need for reintervention.  
 4.2.  Secondary Objectives  
Secondary Safety Endpoint: The secondary safety endpoint will be based on freedom from 30 -day morbidity (i.e., the morbidity index).

 4.3.  Specific Hypothesis to be Accepted or Rejected by [CONTACT_673037]  
4.3.1.  Primary Hypothesis  
The primary hypothesis will assess the rate of freedom from patency -related intervention 
evaluated at 6 months and will be based on results from the cohort of patients treated with 
the Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in combination with the Atrium 
iCAST ™ covered stent as part of the extended study .  The analysis requires that, using a 
Bayesian beta-binomial model, a specified performance goal described in the following sentences be met.  The Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation (Branch 
Graft) is intended to preserve flow to the internal iliac artery (IIA), providing an alternative treatment option for patients who would otherwise require sacrifice of the IIA through coil embolization and stent-graft coverage of the IIA as part of endovascular aneurysm repair of aortoiliac or iliac aneurysms.  In order to provide the most meaningful labeling for clinical decision making on whether to sacrifice or preserve the IIA, it was determined appropriate to base the performance goal for the Branch Graft on outcomes associated with sacrificing the IIA, which represents the only endovascular treatment option currently available for the intended patient population.  Specifically, unilateral coil embolization and stent -graft coverage of the IIA results in pelvic ischemic 
symptoms/complications in approximately 45% of patients with no good option for alleviating the symptoms through endovascular means.
1-12  Based on this, a performance 
goal of 55% for freedom from patency- related intervention was established.

 The null (H 0) and alternate (H A) hypotheses are expressed as follows:  
 
Null Hypothesis: The 6- month rate of freedom from patency -related intervention in 
patients treated with the Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation does not 
meet the performance goal (55%).  
H0:  π ≤ 55%  
 Alternate Hypothesis: The 6 -month rate of freedom from patency -related intervention in 
patients treated with the Zenith

performance goal (55%). 
HA:  π > 55% 
 
where π  is the proportion of all patients treated with the Branch Graft who have freedom 
from patency -related intervention at 6 months.  The hypothesis will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_17921] 2.5th percentile of the Bayesian posterior distribution of π to the 
performance goal.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if the 2.5th percentile of the 
Bayesian posterior distribution of π is greater than the performance goal. 
 4.3.2.  Secondary Safety Hypothesis  
The secondary safety hypothesis will assess the freedom from 30 -morbidity and will be 
based on results from the cohort of patients treated with the Zenith

7.2.  Methods to Minimize Risks  
As described previously, the device design, extended clinical study design, and the 
instructions for use are intended to minimize the risks associated with endovascular procedures.  It is anticipated that, guided by [CONTACT_405652], continued efforts such as this study will make 
the endovascular treatment of aortoiliac and iliac aneurysms safer and more effective than open surgical repair.  8.0.  Design of the Clinical Investigation 8.1.  Type of Investigation  
The design will be a prospective, non-randomized, extended study enrolling up to 60 additional patients to receive the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation, 
including a cohort of [ADDRESS_909504] ™ 
covered stent.  It will be conducted at up to 30 investigative sites.  The results from the cohort of patients treated with the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation in 
combination with the Atrium iCAST ™ covered stent will be the subject of the hypothesis 
testing described in Section 4.5.   
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation (G070241)    
Clinical I nvestigation Plan   [ADDRESS_909505]  
safety and effectiveness data to support the marketing application for the Zenith® Branch 
Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation and Atrium iCAST ™ stent in conjunction with the 
Zenith Flex® AAA Endovascular Graft.  
 8.3.  Limitations of the Study  
The study is inherently limited by [CONTACT_673042], medical, and anatomical exclusion criteria.  Additional challenges to the study include the anticipated comorbidities likely to be found in patients with aortoiliac, or iliac aneurysms, which may confound data analysis.  Additional confounding elements of the study might include difficulty adjudicating device- related events to a specific 
endovascular graft (i.e., Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation, Atrium 
iCAST ™ stent, Zenith Flex® AAA Endovascular Graft, and iliac leg component) and the 
lower incidence of AAA in women, with the anticipation of fewer women than men being enrolled in the study.  8.4.  Duration of the Investigation  Patient recruitment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_673032] ™ stent; n=40) is 
expected to be completed within 12 months of restarting the extended study.  Follow-up data will continue to be collected for five years after graft deployment for each patient in the extended study, making the study duration approximately 60 months for each patient.  8.5.  Assessing Outcome/Rationale The primary endpoint will be based on 6- month freedom from patency -related 
intervention since the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation is intended to 
maintain blood flow to the internal iliac artery and minimize the risk of associated clinical symptoms with the need for reintervention.  
 The secondary safety endpoint will be based on 30-day morbidity.  The secondary effectiveness endpoint (for descriptive purposes only) will be based on branch vessel patency at 6 months.  For the secondary effectiveness endpoint, the 95% confidence interval will be reported.

 All endpoints and assessments will be based on the results from the cohort of patients 
treated with the Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in combination with 
the Atrium iCAST ™ covered stent.   [The information in this section has been redacted 
due to confidential content.]  8.6.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria All patients eligible for aneurysm repair will be evaluated for enrollment in this study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  All patients eligible for entry into the study will have the potential risks and benefits of the procedures and the overall clinical investigation plan explained to them.  Each patient who wishes to participate in this study will provide written informed consent prior to his or her enrollment into the study.   
All patients must meet the general inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study.  No  
patients may be enrolled if any of the general or medical exclusion criteria are true.  No  
patients may be enrolled in the study if any of the anatomical exclusion criteria are true.  
The general and medical exclusion criteria will be assessed during the initial patient evaluation by [CONTACT_14664] a history and physical examination.  Anatomical exclusion criteria will be assessed using a variety of imaging techniques that are routinely performed during the evaluation of abdominal aortic and/or iliac aneurysms.  
 Assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be based upon data available pre -
operatively.  Data obtained peri- operatively and post -operatively may contradict pre -
operative assessment, and such is anticipated in several cases.  However, such contradiction should not be construed as evidence of inadequate or inaccurate pre-operative assessment with respect to the enrollment criteria or evidence of inappropriate enrollment.  Enrollment is to be based upon the best available pre-operative data.  Therefore, some criteria relate to subjective assessment while other criteria are considered absolute and able to be determined definitively.  Variability in assessment between centers, investigators and observers is expected with several criteria.   [This 
information has been redacted due to confidential content.]  
 General Inclusion Criteria: Patients can be considered for entry into the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac 
Bifurcation extended study if treatment is clinically indicated.  Specifically, the patient 
must have the following:

 1) An aortoiliac or iliac aneurysm  
2) An unsuitable distal sealing site for a Zenith® iliac leg graft within the common 
iliac artery on the intended side of Branch Graft implantation  
 
General Exclusion Criteria:  
Patients are excluded from enrollment into the Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac 
Bifurcation extended study if any of the following are true:  
1) Age < 18 years 
 
2) Pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning on becoming pregnant prior to completion of the study 
3) Unwilling or unable to comply with the follow-up schedule 
4) Unable or unwilling to give informed consent 
5) Simultaneously participating in another investigative device or drug study  
 
 
8.7.  Registration/Point of Enrollment 
Point of enrollment will be based on the intent- to-treat population, and is defined to 
include any patient for which the treatment procedure is initiated.  More specifically, once the delivery system of the study device (Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac 
Bifurcation) has been inserted under the patient’s skin, this patient would be included in the intent -to-treat population.  Primary statistical analyses will be based on this set of 
patients.  
   8.8.  Measurements and Data Collection/Variables Please reference the case report forms for a complete list of data points collected during the extended study. Patients meeting the selection criteria who have provided informed consent will undergo a detailed pre- procedural examination.  Data will be collected and stored in a database.  
Data points include patient demographics, risk assessment (e.g., SVS -ISCV risk score), 
blood tests, a clinical evaluation, and a CT (with angiography if necessary).   To evaluate deployment characteristics and procedural outcome, the following data 
points will be collected intra -operatively: 
1) Assessment of system performance including:  deployment issues (difficulty visualizing, deploying, or removing the devices 
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation (G070241)    
Clinical I nvestigation Plan   23 
 
CIP 05 -625-15 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL   
 2) Complications (if any), will be captured on Event form 
3) Adjunctive maneuvers including: balloon dilation of iliac arteries, additional 
stents/ancillary components required, and additional surgical procedures 
4) Findings of completion assessment: device patency, endoleak, and kinks 
 In addition, the results of the endovascular repair (including internal iliac artery patency) will be assessed by [CONTACT_284747]/or imaging evaluation at the time of graft insertion, within [ADDRESS_909506]-procedure, at 30 days (± 10 days),  6 months (180 ± 30 days),  12 months (365 ± 45 days), 2 years (730 ± 60 days), 3 years (1095 ± 60 days), 4 years (1460 ± 90 days), and 5 years (1825 ± 90 days) according to the post- operative study 
schedule below (Table 8.8 -1).  The ranges listed above are considered guidelines for the 
investigative sites when scheduling visits.  It is recommended that all previously enrolled patients who received the ConnectSX™ 
undergo CT follow- up to assess stent integrity every six months unless the stent has been 
relined to treat an observed or threatened Type III endoleak.

 5)  Closure of the investigation 
6)  Completion of all scheduled clinical and imaging visits, up to [ADDRESS_909508] 
the study hypotheses with sufficient statistical power (in the frequentist context).   
For the power calculation of the primary hypothesis, the true patency rate of the IIA following treatment with the Branch Graft was assumed to be 83% based on the literature.
13-19  With a performance goal of 55% for freedom from patency -related 
intervention (derived as described in section 4.3.1), the simulation study indicates that a maximum sample size of 25 patients will provide a power of approximately 88.5%, at a type I error rate of 2.5%.  
 
For the secondary safety hypothesis, the true rate of freedom from 30- day morbidity was 
assumed to be 72.5%, which was derived from patients with patent internal iliac arteries in the Zenith
® AAA Endovascular Graft Clinical Study who were free from 30 -day 
morbidity (i.e., free from all 31 events in the Zenith® AAA Endovascular Graft Clinical 
Study morbidity index and hip/thigh/buttock claudication).  With a performance goal of 
46% for freedom from 30 -day morbidity (derived as described in section 4.3.2), the 
simulation study indicates that a maximum sample size of 29 patients will provide a power of 85.8%, at a type I error rate of 2.5%.

 Cook intends to enroll 40  patients with the Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac 
Bifurcation and Atrium iCAST ™ covered stent , allowing for those who may withdraw or 
be lost to follow -up, in the study at up to 30 institutions. 
 
8.10.2 General Statistical Analyses   
Statistical analysis will be performed only on the cohort of patients treated with the 
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation in combination with the Atrium 
iCAST ™ covered stent as part of the extended study. SAS® for Windows® (release 9.3 or 
higher) or other widely accepted statistical software will be used to perform the analysis. Continuous variables will be reported as means and standard deviations unless otherwise noted. Categorical variables will be reported as percent. Techniques such as logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, or Cox Proportional Hazards may be used for additional analysis.  
 8.10.[ADDRESS_909509] -available data can be used to assess the endpoint. Previous 
clinical trial experience suggests that some portion of the imaging data may not meet the criteria for accurate review by [CONTACT_89709]; however, it is recognized that the investigator uses this information to provide the best possible care for the patient. Therefore, it is reasonable to substitute any missing core laboratory measurements with the corresponding measurements made by [CONTACT_567429].  Otherwise, missing responses will be imputed from the empi[INVESTIGATOR_673033].   Additional analyses may also be performed to address missing data, including 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  
 8.11.  Methods  
8.11.1.  Medication  
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s standard protocol should be followed with respect to medication pre -
procedure and during the procedure.      8.11.2.  Pre- procedure 
Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation Sizing  
The Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation is sized based on the findings 
from pre -operative radiographic studies, including computerized tomography (CT) and 
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation (G070241)    
Clinical I nvestigation Plan   26 
 
CIP 05 -625-15 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL   
 conventional angiography.  Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation 
component selection should be based on the recommended sizing guidelines in the 
Instructions for Use of this device.  
 
Atrium iCAST ™ Sizing  
The Atrium iCAST ™ stent is sized based on the findings from pre- operative radiographic 
studies, including computerized tomography (CT) and conventional angiography, if 
needed.  Final sizing is based on findings from intra-operative angiography.    Additional Component Sizing  
Since the patient will undergo concomitant AAA endovascular repair with a standard Zenith Flex
® AAA Endovascular Graft (main body and iliac legs), all proximal aortic 
measurements should be assessed and sized according to Zenith Flex® AAA 
Endovascular Graft Instructions for Use (IFU).  
 8.11.3.  Procedure  Standard techniques for placement of arterial access sheaths, guiding catheters, angiographic catheters, and wire guides should be employed during use of the Zenith
® 
Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation, Atrium iCAST ™, and Zenith Flex® AAA 
Endovascular Graft and iliac legs.  All components are compatible with 0.[ADDRESS_909510] surgical technique and establish adequate proximal and distal vascular control of both femoral vessels.  
 Refer to the Instructions for Use for complete details regarding use of the Zenith
® Branch 
Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation, the Zenith Flex® AAA Endovascular Graft, and 
iliac legs.  A commercially available balloon -expandable covered stent (Atrium iCAST ™ 
stent) will be placed to preserve blood flow to the internal iliac artery; likewise, the Manufacturers’ Instructions for Use should be referred to for additional information.  Fluoroscopic guidance and angiography should be used throughout the procedure to verify positioning of the device with respect to the patient’s anatomy.  
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation (G070241)    
Clinical I nvestigation Plan   [ADDRESS_909511] clearly show the source.  Due to the anatomy of the iliac bifurcation area, the presence of a type II endoleak is unlikely; however, should one occur, the patient should be treated at the physician’s discretion.  Type IV endoleaks are generally associated with grafts with a high porosity and are unlikely with this graft.  8.12.  Period of Use for the Device or its Control  
The follow-up period for the clinical investigation should permit the demonstration of performance over a period of time sufficient to represent a realistic test of the performance of the device and allow identification and risk assessment of any associated adverse device effects over that period.  
 8.13.  Safety Monitoring   A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), consisting of independent physicians who are not investigators in the extended study and do not have a perceived conflict of interest with the conduct and administration of the extended study, will be convened on a regular basis to evaluate the extended study progress and review adverse events.  
 An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be established.  Any adjudication of clinical events will be performed according to standard operating procedures to assess whether the events were due to a pre-existing condition, procedure-related, technique-related, and/or device-related.  In addition, a core laboratory will be established to independently review available imaging.  
 Regularly scheduled monitoring, including on-site visits, will be conducted, in part, for identification of adverse events and assurance that they are correctly reported to the DSMB and CEC.  
 9.0.  Emergency Situations Patients will not be treated with the Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation 
in emergency situations where prior consent of the patient (or legally authorized representative) is not possible.  Since the Zenith
 Flex® AAA Endovascular Graft is 
Zenith® Branch Endovascular Graft -Iliac Bifurcation (G070241)    
Clinical I nvestigation Plan   28 
 
CIP 05 -625-15 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL   
 approved for commercial use, the physician may use the Zenith Flex® AAA 
Endovascular Graft to treat a patient in an emergency situation; however, that patient 
would not be enrolled in the current study and no data would be collected under this investigational plan.  The Zenith
® Branch Endovascular Graft- Iliac Bifurcation and 
Atrium iCAST ™ may not be used to treat a patient in an emergency situation. 
 10.0.  Deviations from the Clinical Investigation  Deviations or non-compliances will be recorded together with an explanation.  Deviations shall be reported to the Sponsor, regulatory authorities, and local IRB/ethics committee as required.    When available, the reasons for withdrawal and discontinuation of any patient from the investigation shall be recorded.  If such discontinuation is because of problems with safety or lack of effectiveness, that patient shall still be followed -up in the investigation, 
if possible.  
 If appropriate, corrective and preventive actions will be discussed by [CONTACT_456], investigator, and/or IRB to determine a suitable course of action.  11.0.  Amendments to the Clinical Investigation  If necessary, changes to the clinical investigation plan, which affect the validity of the data; relationship of likely patient risk to benefit; scientific soundness; or rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects, will be approved by [CONTACT_673043]/ethics committee prior to implementation.  
 
 12.0.  Informed Consent  
A written informed consent must be obtained from all study patients (or their legally 
authorized representative), in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, prior to enrollment in the trial.  If new information is obtained after a patient receives treatment with the device, any patient who has not exited the study will be informed about the new information, and will be reconsented at the discretion of the investigator and/or the site’s IRB.

CIP 05 -625-15 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL   
 13.0.  Procedure for Reporting Adverse Events and Adverse Device Effects  
Events known to be related to pre- existing conditions or existing at enrollment are not 
considered adverse events (e.g., new treatment for congestive heart failure diagnosed 
prior to the procedure).  Additionally, common standard of care practices are not considered adverse events (e.g., supplemental oxygen provided for all patients discharged from institutions at high altitudes).   
 Adverse events are reported using the appropriate case report form (Adverse and Other Event form).  Each completed form is to be submitted to the data coordinating center, who will inform the Sponsor accordingly.  In cases of adverse device effects (typi[INVESTIGATOR_673034]) or serious adverse events, completed forms should be submitted to the data coordinating center immediately after the site learns of the event.    The data coordinating center will notify the Sponsor accordingly.  In accordance with applicable requirements, the investigator will notify the local institutional review board/ethics committee, while the Sponsor will notify the regulatory authority.  The DSMB and CEC will also review applicable adverse events.  
  14.0.  Ethical Considerations The investigator is responsible for obtaining approval of this clinical investigation plan by [CONTACT_56335].  The Sponsor must be provided with a copy of this approval before delivery of any study devices.  Furthermore, the investigator will ensure that local regulations concerning data protection are followed.  
 15.0.  Early Termination or Suspension of the Investigation  The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate/suspend the extended study at any point should they believe that important harmful events might result from its continuation.  Study patients may withdraw from the extended study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits.  T he investigator may also decide to withdraw a patient from the extended 
study at any time on the basis of medical judgement.  In any case, the reasons for withdrawal will be documented.

or through defects in the graft material (type III), via collateral vessels (type II), or graft 
fabric porosity (type IV).
 
  Endoleak Type Classification: 
Type I endoleak:   A peri -prosthetic leak occurring at the proximal and/or distal 
attachment zones of the endovascular system.  
Type II endoleak:   A leak caused by [CONTACT_673046].  
(Requires imaging documentation of Type II source).  To classify an endoleak as

Clinical I nvestigation Plan   [ADDRESS_909514]-enhanced and/or selective angiogram clearly 
showing the source is required.   
Type III endoleak:   A leak caused by a defect in the graft fabric, inadequate seal 
(between graft components only), or disconnection of additional or ancillary graft components. 
Type IV endoleak:   A leak caused by [CONTACT_532894], often resulting in a 
generalized blush of contrast within the aneurysm sac. Unknown endoleak:   Continuing blood flow into the aneurysmal sac with 
undefined origin.

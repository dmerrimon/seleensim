Investigational  Agent   
Tumor  infiltrating lymphocytes  (TIL) LN -145 as a single -therapy 
Study  Objectives   
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN -[ADDRESS_1079910]  Cancer  (TNBC)  patients  by [CONTACT_785054] (ORR), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by [CONTACT_785055].  
• To characterize the safety  profile  of tumor  infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TIL) as a 
single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients as 
measured by [CONTACT_3433] e incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs).  
Secondary:  
• To further evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN -[ADDRESS_1079911] Cancer patients using complete response 
duration  of response  (DOR),  disease  control  rate (DCR),  and progression- free 
survival (PFS), using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by [CONTACT_513022], overall survival (OS) and (CR) rate.  
Exploratory:  
• To explore  the persistence of LN-[ADDRESS_1079912] response, outcome, and toxicity variables.  
• To explore efficacy parameters (excluding OS) using the immune -related 
Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (irRECIST), as assessed  by [CONTACT_785056].  
• To explore  the feasibility  of generating TIL (LN-145) from  patient- derived 
TNBC core biopsy tumor  specimens  using Iovance  manufacturing process.

Study  Design   
A prospective,  open -label,  non-randomized, Phase  2 study to evaluate adoptive  cell 
therapy (ACT) with LN -[ADDRESS_1079913] Cancer.  
• Patients  must  have  had at least one and no more  than three  prior  systemic 
anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_437376].  
• All patients  will receive autologous  LN-[ADDRESS_1079914] -145 is comprised of  the following steps:  
1. Tumor  resection  to provide  the autologous  tissue  that serves  as the source  of 
the TIL cellular product;  
2. LN-[ADDRESS_1079915]  production  at a central  Good  Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) facility;  
 
 3. A 7-day nonmyeloablative  lymphodepletion (NMA- LD) preconditioning 
regimen (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785005]);  
4. Infusion of the autologous  LN-[ADDRESS_1079916]  on Day 0 (during  inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]);  
5. Intravenous  (IV) interleukin -2 (IL-2) administrations  for up to six doses 
maximum (during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
The following  general  study  periods  will take place unless  specified  otherwise:  
• Screening  and Tumor  Resection:  Up to 4 weeks  (28 days)  from  signing the 
informed consent form (ICF);  
• Enrollment: Upon tumor  resection  for TIL generation;  
• Manufacturing  of the LN-[ADDRESS_1079917]:  approximately  22 days from  tumor 
resection;  
•  Treatment  Period:  NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  (up to 7 days),  LN-145 
infusion (1 day), IL -2 administration (up to 4 days), continuing to Day 28. 
Patients will need to return for safety assessment visits on Day 14 and Day 28 
(Day 28 corresponds with the End of Treatment [EOT] visit);  
• Assessment Period:  Following the EOT visit, efficacy (eg, tumor response) 
assessments  will be performed  at Week  6 (Day  42) post-LN-145 infusion and 
then occur every 6 weeks until Month 6 (Week 24). Patients will continue to 
be evalu ated for response every 3 months (12 weeks) for up to 3 years from 
Day 0 (LN -145 infusion) or until:  
• Disease  progression 
• Start  of a new anticancer  therapy  
• At that time,  the End of Assessment  (EOA)  visit will be completed.  
•  Overall  Survival  Follow -up Period:  Begins  after completion  of the last study 
assessment (eg, EOA) and will continue for up to [ADDRESS_1079918] -145 
infusion or until discontinuation from  the study;  with telephone  contact  [INVESTIGATOR_135] 
3 months to obtain survival status and subsequent anticancer therapy 
information ( Figure 1). Patients who had tumor resection but did not receive 
LN-[ADDRESS_1079919] -145 Therapy:  
The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving an NMA -LD 
preconditioning  regimen,  consisting  of daily  IV cyclophosphamide  (60 mg/kg;  IV × 2 
doses)  followed  by [CONTACT_785057]  (25 mg/m2; IV × 5 doses).  Infusion of LN-145 is 
given on Day 0 and is followed by [CONTACT_785058] -2 at 600,000 international 
units (IU)/kg BID for up to a maximum of six doses, starting approximately 3– [ADDRESS_1079920] -145 infusion.

Number  of Planned 
Patients   
Ten (10) patients  are planned  to be evaluable  for efficacy  in this study.  If an enrolled 
patient is unable to receive therapy for any reason, she will be replaced by a new patient until 10 patients will be evaluable for efficacy (infused and has received at 
least one dose of IL-2). All patients  who complete  the TIL LN-[ADDRESS_1079921] radiological assessment will also be included in efficacy analysis and categorized as progression.

applicable  
• Grade 3 or greater immune TRAEs involving vital organs (heart, kidneys, 
brain,  liver,  colon,  adrenal  gland,  lungs)  with symptoms  emerging following 
LN-145 infusion  
• Grade  3 or greater  allergic  reactions  including bronchospasm  or generalized 
urticaria that does not resolve after medical management in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_785008]  
• Meeting  criteria  for permanent  discontinuation  of IL-2 treatment.  (must  have 
received at least one dose of IL -2) 
• Administration  of prohibited concomitant  medication/start of new anti- 
cancer therapy  
• Determination  by [CONTACT_785061] t is not 
in the  best interest of the patient 
• Death  
End-of-Study  Criteria   
A patient may reach  end-of-study (EOS)  status  for any  of the  following reasons:  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up after [ADDRESS_1079934]  the 
patient/family/primary care physician  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Study termination  by [CONTACT_2728]  
• 3 years  (Month 36) of  study  participation  after TIL  infusion (Day 0) 
Efficacy  Assessment  The following efficacy parameters for LN -[ADDRESS_1079935]  Cancer  will be investigated: ORR,  DOR,  DCR,  PFS,  OS and 
CR Rate.

Safety  Assessment  AEs will be collected  and reported  according  to the following  temporal intervals:  
• Signed ICF to tumor  resection  (serious  adverse events  [SAEs] only,  if patient 
did not have tumor resected);  
• Tumor  resection  to start of NMA -LD preconditioning regimen  (AEs  and 
SAEs);  
 
 • NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  to Day 0 (AEs  and SAEs);  
• Day 0 to Day 30 (TEAEs  and treatment -emergent  SAEs/adverse  events  of 
special interest [AESI]);  
• Day [ADDRESS_1079936] (Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs; SAEs, AESIs if at 
least re lated to any study drug);  
• Post-Month 6, only SAEs/AESIs  related  to LN-145 will be collected  and 
reported  
The LTFU period begins after the assessment period ends and continues until the 
EOS, where EOS = death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, study 
termination by [CONTACT_785062], or 3 years (Month 36) of follow up after  LN145  
infusion,  whichever  occurs  first. During the LTFU  period,  AEs will not be collected, 
and no visits are required; phone calls will determine survival status (dead or alive) 
and determine all currently -taken anti -cancer medications.  
Statistical 
Considerations  Descrip tive statistics  will be used to summarize safety  and efficacy  parameters.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_785063], and patients meeting RECIST 1.1 for a complete response (CR) or partial response  (PR)  will be classified  as responders.  The ORR,  the incidence of 
Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, CR rates, and the DCRs will be summarized using point - 
estimates and two -sided 90% confidence limits.  
Kaplan -Meier  methods  will be used to summarize  time-to-event  efficacy  endpoints, 
such as DOR, PFS, and OS. DOR analyses will be performed for patients who achieve objective responses.  
For safety, the commonly observed TEAEs will be summarized descriptively in 
comparison to historical data of TIL LN-145. Other  safety  parameters  will include 
TEAEs  by [CONTACT_479],  SAEs,  AEs leading  to discontinuations  of study treatments,  vital 
signs, physical examinations, and toxicity data from clinical laboratory results.  
Sample Size 
Determination  Ten (10) patients are planned for this study. We assume that the ORR for any 
standard of care second line or greater line of chemotherapy is no more than 14%. The alternative  hypothesis  is that treatment  with TIL will result  in ORR > 35%.  If ≥ 
3 of 10 patients achieve response the efficacy null  hypothesis is rejected. This 
design will give a 78% power to detect a difference using a one -sided alpha of  
20%.  
Data  Safety  Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC)  The Yale Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review 
cumulative  safety  data on the first five patients  enrolled  upon  completion  of 6 weeks

In the United  States  (US),  breast  cancer  is the most  common cancer  in women  with an estimated 
234,[ADDRESS_1079955] cancer related deaths in 2018 [ 1]. Breast cancers are 
characterized by [CONTACT_785064]: The Estrogen Receptor (ER), 
Progesterone Receptor  (PR),  and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_45734]  2 (HER2).  Expression 
of these receptors confers prognostic significance with important therapeutic implications. 
Tumors that do not express any of these receptors are called triple negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) and account for 10–15% of diagnosed breast cancer [ 2]. TNBC is associated with a 
shorter time to first recurrence of 25 months vs 67 months in ER+/PR+/HER2- [ 3]. In addition, 
TNBC recurs more frequently in visceral organs including brain, lung and liver compared with hormone receptor  positiv e breast  cancer  [4]. In a review  of the SEER  database between  2010 and 
2012 median overall survival (OS) for metastatic TNBC was [ADDRESS_1079956] ratio of 2.51 [ 5]. 
The management of TNBC with curative intent consists of a multidisciplinary approach 
including medical  oncology, radiation  oncology and surgery. The role of surgery alone is limited 
to T1aN0M0 TNBC, whereas disease > T1a or node positive disease requires multimodality therapy  including chemotherapy. In  general,  chemotherapy  can be used either  in the neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant setting. Upfront surgery followed by [CONTACT_785065]. Whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides an opportunity to assess for response to treatment at the time of surgery. Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients 
with TNBC that do not attain pathologic complete response (CR) following neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy have worse survival compared with  patients with  hormone receptor (HR) positive 
disease and that only a small population of these patients are disease- free at 5 years [ 4, 6]. 
Preferred regimens in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting include dose dense 
doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ddAC) followed by [CONTACT_785066]  2 weeks,  ddAC followed  by 
[CONTACT_192470], and docetaxel and cyclophosphamide [ 7−9]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], many patients will 
develop recurrent or metastatic disease.  
In patients  with residual  disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or with recurrent  or metastatic 
disease effective treatment options become limited. A study by [CONTACT_785067]. randomized 
HER2( -) residual  invasive breast  cancer  following neoadjuvant chemotherapy to receive standard 
post- surgical  treatment vs capecitabine with  improvement of the 5- year overall  survival to 89.2%  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v 8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 22 of 89   
compared  with 83.6% [ 10]. In the metastatic  setting,  single agent  taxanes  or anthracyclines  are 
recommended in the first line setting. Chemotherapy combinations can be used in select 
circumstances with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32660], high tumor burden or visceral crisis [ 11]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], outcomes remain poor with OS of 14.5 months as demonstrated in a multicenter French observational cohort including 2317 patients with TNBC [ 12]. Recent data published in 
the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) by [CONTACT_785068]. investigated the use of atezolizumab plus nab -paclitaxel in the phase III setting compared with nab- paclitaxel and 
placebo. Median OS in the atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel was 21.3 vs 17.6 months. Among 
patients  with programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors (defined  at ≥ 1% of tumor 
infiltrating immune cells) median OS was 25.0 vs 15.5 months [ 13]. Based on this study, 
atezolizumab plus nab -paclitaxel has become a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
therapy for patients with metastatic disease or recurrent disease after treatment with curative 
intent. In patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) including olaparib and talazoparib are approved [ 14, 15]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_785014], many patients will still succumb to this disease and novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039].  
1.2. Adoptive Cell Transfer of Tumor- Infiltrating  Lymphocytes as Cancer 
Immunotherapy  
Adoptive cell transfer of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) represents a potentially effective 
treatment for patients with a variety of solid tumors. The method involves the recovery and ex 
vivo expansion of autologous antitumor  lymphocytes that  have infiltrated  a patient’s  tumor. The 
basic concept of using lymphoid cells for the immunotherapy of cancer arose from animal 
experiments  that demonstrated,  by [CONTACT_622311],  the presence of T-lymphocytes within  the 
microenvironment of most solid tumors and their metastases [ 16−18]. 
Recent findings have clearly shown a predictive relationship between the frequency and 
phenotype of TIL in solid tumors (especially CD8+ T cells) and an increased OS and 
progression- free survival (PFS) in patients with melano ma [19−22], lung cancer [ 23−26], 
ovarian cancer [ 27−29], squamous cell carcinomas [ 56 , 30 ], triple negative breast cancer, 
HER2 -positive breast cancer [ 31], basal -like breast cancer [32 −39], and colorectal cancer 
[40−43]. One study found that an increased Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Treg)/CD8+ ratio and the 
presence of intra-tumoral high Foxp3+ Treg predicted worse outcomes [44]. In addition, gene 
expression studies using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarrays have indirectly correlated 
“immune  signature” genes  and T-cell associated  gene expression (eg, CD3,  CD8,  CD4,  inducible 
costimulator, granzyme B, dendritic cell-lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, and 
chemokine and chemokine receptors) with improved OS and PFS in both primary and metastatic 
tumor settings [ 22, 40, 41, 45− 47]. These findings support the development of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785015] a therapeutic agent against solid 
tumors.  
Adoptive cell therapy  (ACT) with TIL has several  theoretical  and practical  advantages  over other 
immunotherapeutic approaches. First, the isolation of T cells directly from the tumor tissue ensures the recovery of tumor-specific TIL without prior knowledge of their antigens. Second, 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v 8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 23 of 89   
the ex v ivo culture steps involved in TIL manufacturing favor both the expansion of T cells over 
other cell types and the reinvigoration of these T cells through the elimination of immune 
suppressive factors  (eg, Treg  which  are present  in the tumor microenvironment)  and the exposure 
to activating factors [ 48−50]. The result is a polyclonal TIL product mostly comprised of 
effector T cells that recognize a potentially wide array of tumor antigens [ 51−54]. Finally, 
preparation of the patient with lymphodepletion immediately prior to TIL infusion eliminates in vivo suppressive influences (eg, Treg and cytokine sinks) to provide an optimal milieu for the 
activity of the transferred T cells [ 70]. 
The feasibility of TIL preparation was demonstrated in early preclinical studies. Metastatic 
melanoma  (MM)  tumors were  excised  and placed  in tissue  culture conditions under which  tumor 
cells do not survive, but under which TIL contained within the excised tumor tissue can survive 
and proliferate to very large numbers (≥ 1 × 10
8 cells) [ 16, 18, 53, 54]. Expanded TIL were 
shown to be effective at killing tumor cells in vitro and promoting durable antitumor effects in 
vivo when infused back into the original donor [ 16, 18, 53, 54]. Further preclinical studies 
established that the efficacy of TIL infusions is enhanced by [CONTACT_785069] (ie, to induce a transient drop in endogenous lymphocytes in the host) and by [CONTACT_447]-dose interleukin- 2 (IL -2) administration [ 16].These findings set the stage for t he National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) initiating clinical trials using TIL to treat MM patients; whereby, a nonmyeloablative preconditioning regimen  consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was 
combined with post-doses of IL-2. These studies have consistently demonstrated high objective 
response rates (ORRs), from 49% to 72%, with long-term, durable, and potentially curative CR 
rates of ≤ 25% [ 55, 71]. As a result, Iovance uses this core TIL regimen in its current clinical 
studies, while working in colla boration with the NCI to continually refine original treatment 
protocol.  
Iovance Biotherapeutics has been able to successfully culture TILs from a variety of tumors 
including Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) [72]. The average yield of TILs from pre- REP 
of 13 TNBC  tumors was 429 x 10
6. Phenotypic characterization  of TILs  from  TNBC  were >80% 
CD4+ T -cells. Further characterization of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs demonstrated effector memory 
phenotypic cells that were also CD27+ and CD28+. The success in growth of TIL from TNBC allows for the application of Iovance’s Gen [ADDRESS_1079957]  immune  infiltrate  in the range of 
40–60%, followed by [CONTACT_94970]2+  with 16% and ER+ subtypes with the least immune  infiltrates  [56]. 
High numbers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with pCR to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in patients with TNBC [ 57−60]. Studies have shown that the presence of TIL in 
treatment -naïve TNBC is an independent prognostic factor for disease- free survival (DFS) and 
OS [61, 62]. Specifically, TIL counts correlate with DFS, and for every 10% increase in TIL 
there is an 18% reduction in distant metastases [ 63, 64].  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v 8.[ADDRESS_1079958] in a phase II study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Recently, Lee et al. have demonstrated consistency in the 
ability to expand TIL from primary breast tumors with a success rate of 70%. These TIL were 
able to recognize autologous tumor cells and to induce tumor regression in a xenograft tumor mouse model [ 65]. Z acharakis et al. reported the successful  treatment of a patient with  hormone 
receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that was treated with TIL reactive against mutant versions of four proteins, SLC3A2, KIAA0368, CADPS2, and CTSB in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] [ 66]. 
The 40- year-old female patient was treated with a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen of 
cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg and fludarabine 25 mg/m
2 followed by a single infusion of 82 x 109 
TIL containing tumor antigen- reactive T cells and pembr olizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 7 
doses. At 6 weeks the target tumor burden had decreased by 51%, and at > [ADDRESS_1079959] cancer. Hormone receptor positive disease (which this patient had) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_785016]. Additionally, TIL selection does not insure 
antitumor activity of the final product as demonstrated in several studies, including the one 
mentioned above. In this study, as well as another TIL trial conducted in cervical cancer, at least a fraction of the TIL involved in the antitumor res ponse were not specific for the selected 
antigens [ 66, 67]. Earlier work also showed that selecting TIL for tumor reactivity did not 
provide any benefit in terms of clinical response relative to non- selected TIL [ 68]. Thus, we 
might expect that patients with TNBC treated with LN -[ADDRESS_1079960]-144/LN-[ADDRESS_1079961]-145 are TIL expansion products that are differentiated only by [CONTACT_785070]: 
LN-[ADDRESS_1079962]-145 is used in all other solid tumor indications . As 
both products share the same manufacturing process and infusion regimen (nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion [NMA-LD] preconditioning and then IL-[ADDRESS_1079963] TIL infusion), safety data is pooled. Overall, toxicities and adverse events (AEs) observed during the TIL LN -144/LN-[ADDRESS_1079964] been 
documented following the TIL infusion itself , with Grade ≥ 3 events rarely observed [ 34]. 
The TIL LN-144/LN-[ADDRESS_1079965] contains: TIL; medium, human serum  albumin  (HSA);  human 
recombinant IL -2; and small amounts of gentamicin and streptomycin, aminoglycoside ABX.

which  consists of the cryoprotectants  dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  and dextran -40, among other 
substances.  
Hypersensitivity  events,  including severe allergic  reactions  or anaphylaxis, have occurred  during 
infusion with LN-144 (melanoma- specific TIL) and LN -145; this may be anticipated because 
hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with at least one of the aforementioned 
formulation components. Patients who have a known history of hypersensitivity to any component or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_785017]. Pre-medication and supportive therapy instructions can be found in Section 8.2.

2. STUDY DESIGN 
 
2.1. Overview  
This is a prospective, open- label,  non-randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_1079966]-145 
as a single therapy.  
The following indication  will be investigated:  
• LN-[ADDRESS_1079967] cancer.  
• All patients  will receive autologous cryopreserved  TIL LN-[ADDRESS_1079968],  unless specified  otherwise:  
• Screening  and Tumor Resection:  Up to 4 weeks  (28 days) from  signing the informed 
consent form (ICF); 
• Enrollment: Upon tumor resection  for TIL  generation;  
• Manufacturing of the TIL  LN-[ADDRESS_1079969]: approximately  22 days from  tumor resection;  
• Treatment  Period: NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  (up to 7 days), LN-145 infusion (1 
day), IL -2 administration (up to 4 days), continuing to Day 28. Patients will need to 
return for safety assessment visits on Day 14 and Day 28 (Day 28 corresponds with the End of Treatment  [EOT] visit); At the discretion  of the Investigator, and if deemed  in the 
patient’s best interest, the D28 visit can be conducted as a telehealth visit. Results of tests performed outside investigator’s office within the positive window period of assessment may accept to enter in the eCRF as appreciate.  
• Assessment Period:  Following the EOT visit, efficacy (eg, tumor response) assessments 
will be performed at Week 6 (Day 42) post- LN-145 infusion and then occur every 6 
weeks until Month 6 (Week  24). Patients  will continue to be evaluated  for response every

3 months (12 weeks) for up  to 3 years from  Day 0 (LN -145 infusion) or until:  
• Disease progression  
• Start  of a new anticancer  therapy  
• At that time, the End of Assessment (EOA) visit will be completed. At the discretion of the 
Investigator, and if deemed in the patient’s best interest,  a visit can be conducted as a 
telehealth visit if patient is unable to return to the study site. Results  of tests performed 
outside investigator’s office  within  the positive window period of assessment  timepoints 
may accept to enter in the eCRF as appreciate.  
• Overall  Survival Follow-up Period : Begins after completion of the last study assessment 
(eg, EOA) and will continue for up to [ADDRESS_1079970]-145 infusion or until 
discontinuation from  the study; with telephone contact  [INVESTIGATOR_135]  3 months to obtain  survival 
status  and subsequent anticancer  therapy  information  (Figure 1).  Patients  who had tumor 
resectio n but did not receive LN-[ADDRESS_1079971] -145 is comprised of the following steps:  
1. Tumor resection  to provide the autologous tissue  that serves  as the source of the TIL 
cellular product;  
2. LN-[ADDRESS_1079972] production at a central  Good Manufacturing  Practice 
(GMP) facility; 
3. A 7-day NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785018]);  
4. Infusion of the autologous TIL LN-[ADDRESS_1079973] on Day 0 (during inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]);  
5. IV IL-2 administrations for  up to six  doses  maximum (during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])

All medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prescription, and nonprescription, including herbal supplements) 
taken by [CONTACT_231779] 28 days prior to screening will be collected and recorded in the 
database  (including the stop dates  for medications  prohibited in the study) at the time of consent. 
All medications  and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785025],  or changes  thereof,  at any time  during 
the study, must also be recorded. Concomitant medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or interventions will be collected at each visit until completion of the assessment period. The assessment period begins after LN -145 infusion on Day 0 and ends at disease progression, the s tart of a new anticancer 
therapy, or 3 years (Month 36), whichever occurs first. 
6.9. Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group  Performance Status  
The patient’s  ECOG performance  status  will be assessed  at the time points specified  in Appendix 
14.1. 
6.10. Blood and Urine Tests  
The following safety  blood and urine tests will be collected  at the time points specified  in 
Appendix 14.1: 
• Serum  chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, total CO 2 (bicarbonate),  serum creatinine, 
glucose, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, total creatine kinase, uric acid, amylase, and lipase;

6.11. Human  Leukocyte Antigen  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_785026]  (HLA)  Class  I typi[INVESTIGATOR_785027].  
6.12. Estimated  Creatinine Clearance  
Creatinine  clearance will be calculated  by [CONTACT_785085]- Gault  formula  at 
Screening and Day 84 (Week 12). 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080016] 
Serum ß -HCG pregnancy tests will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the 
timepoints  indicated  in the schedule of assessments ( Appendix 14.1) and as clinically  indicated.  
If pregnancy  is discovered  at any point  in time  during  the study,  it should be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor Investigator. 
6.14. Infection  Testing  
Blood samples  will be collected  and tested  for the following viral infections at Screening  and 
thereafter as clinically indicated (as per local standard):  
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology (CMV  immunoglobulin G [IgG]  and CMV 
immunoglobulin M [IgM]); 
• Syphilis assay  (as per local  standard; eg, rapid  plasma  reagin  [RPR],  venereal  disease 
research laboratory [VDRL], or other);  
• HIV1  and HIV2  antibody titer; 
• HBsAg  and anti-HBc;  
• Anti-HCV;  
• Herpes  simplex  virus (HSV)  serology determination  (HSV -1 IgG and HSV -2 IgG);  
• Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) Panel (VCA -IgG, and/or Epstein- Barr nuclear antigen IgG [or 
tests conducted as per local  standard  to confirm  absence of acute or active  EBV  infection] 
(may have been done within 3 months prior to tumor resection). 
Infection  testing must be repeated if  > [ADDRESS_1080017] tests results.  
6.15. PD-L1 Status  
A sample  of tumor resected  for TIL generation  will be analyzed  locally  for PD -L1 status  by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC). See Section 6.22. 
6.16. Cardiac Evaluations  
All cardiac evaluations  (NYHA,  echocardiogram  [ECHO],  electrocardiogram  [ECG],  cardiac 
stress test) will be performed during screening, and ECG will be performed at screening and 
baseline. Cardiac stress test will only be performed if clinically indicated. If an ECG was performed within [ADDRESS_1080018] 3 minutes. If an ECG has been performed within 2 weeks prior to Screening, an ECG 
does not need to be repeated. 
 
6.16.2. Echocardiograms or Multigated  Acquisition  Scans  
During screening,  an ECHO or multigated  acquisition  scan (MUGA)  will be performed  to assess 
ventricular function for all patients.  
6.17. Pulmonary  Function Tests  
Prior evaluations completed  within  [ADDRESS_1080019] to evaluate pulmonary function [ 69]. 
These patients  must walk  a distance of at  least 80% predicted  for age and  sex as well as maintain 
oxygen saturation > 90% throughout. 
6.18. Radiographic Assessments 
Computed tomography (CT) scans which have been performed within [ADDRESS_1080020] scans are 
performed  throughout the study as outlined in  the Schedule of Assessment  (Appendix 14.1) until 
disease progression as measured by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 is noted (or if the patient withdraws full 
consent). Radiographic assessments of additional anatomical locations will be conducted at the 
referenced visits (see Appendix 14.1 for specific timepoints) if c linically indicated per disease 
history and clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission 
tomography (PET) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in lieu of CT scans may be allowed 
for patients are intolerant to contrast media. The same method of assessment (CT or MRI) and the same technique for acquisition of data should be used consistently throughout the study to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at Baseline (Day -21 to Day -9). At the 
Investigator’s discretion, the baseline brain  MRI  and CT scans  may be performed  as early  as Day 
-21. The baseline Brain  MRI  may  not be repeated if  negative at screening.  
Patients will be evaluated for response at Weeks 6, 12, 18, 24; and then every 3 months 
thereafter  until disease progression, initiation  of a new  anticancer  therapy, or patient  withdrawal 
from  the study. Tumor assessments are to be performed  within  the positive window period only, 
for the timepoints mentioned above. The same imaging parameters should be utili zed for all 
scans throughout the study. Response assessments should be evaluated and documented by a 
qualified Investigator participating in the study.

6.19. Tumor Resection  / Harvest  
Preferably, the targeted tumor will not have been previously irradiated. Prior irradiation of the 
resected  tumor is allowed  if at least [ADDRESS_1080021]-145 infusion on Day 0 and 
is dependent on the rate of TIL cell growth at the CMO. 
It is imperative that only the patient’s own (autologous) study treatment (LN -145) be 
administered to the same individual patient. For these reasons, the patient specimen must be 
procured and handled per institutional practice to ensure optimal quality of the specimen and 
minimum transport time to the CMO,  as well as to ensure the appropriate identification  of the 
study product at all times including infusion back into the patient. 
Refer  to the Tumor Procurement  and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_785028].  
 
6.20. Optional Sub Study  − TIL Growth  from  Core Biopsies  
If available and if patient consent to the substudy is provided, additional core biopsies from 
primary  and/or metastatic  tumor will be collected  during tumor harvest.  Core  biopsies should be 
from  an area of the tumor lesion  that will be different  from  that prepared  for TIL manufacturing. 
Ideally, 10 or more cores (14G) of 20 mm will be collected and sent to Iovance per the Tumor Procurement and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_149376] (for Research Specimens to Iovance Tampa). The core biopsies will be used to determine the feasibility of generating TIL using the Iovance LN-[ADDRESS_1080022]-145 generation. 
6.21. Additional  Resected  Tumor Tissue  for Molecular Analyses  
If there is an excess  of tumor tissue  available after resection  for TIL manufacturing, it will be 
utilized for exploratory biomarker analysis. 
If no excess  tumor tissue  is available,  a single 2 mm punch biopsy from  the center  of the resected 
tumor can be collected. If excess viable tumor tissue and punch biopsy are not available, excess 
viable tumor tissue can be resected from additional (non-target) lesion (if feasible). Depending on the size of excess viable tumor tissue collected, tissue will be divided  into approximately 
three 0.5 cm diameter portions in the following order of priority: 
(1) 0.5 cm tissue  prepared  as formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)  block  (sent  to local 
laboratory)  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 44 of 89  
(2) 0.5 cm tissue can be placed  in hypothermosol (send to Iovance Tampa)  
(3) 0.5 cm tissue  placed in  ribonucleic acid (RNA) later (send  to local laboratory)  
(4) Any remaining  tissue  will be sent fresh  to [CONTACT_785126],  Yale Cancer  Center  laboratory 
Any additional available tissue can be further prepared in the following order:  
FFPE  -> Hypothermosol - > RNA  later -> fresh applications  
Tumor tissue  sent to the Yale Cancer  Center  laboratory and Iovance laboratory may be used as 
follows:  
 
(1) For IHC to identify different immune cell populations and PD-L1 status; and for isolation of 
DNA,  which  will be used for sequencing of common oncogenic mutations,  tumor- associated 
gene and/or T cell receptors and for whole exome sequencing and tumor mutation analyses 
(subject to patient consent) 
(2) For tumor- reactivity  assays  
(3) For gene expression analyses;  and 
(4) For the production of Research  TIL, the generation  of patient -derived  xenografts into 
immunocompromised mice, and the establishment of primary breast tumor lines 
Provision of adequate amount of tumor tissue  for TIL manufacturing  sent to the CMO  is priority 
over the collection of additional tumor tissue that is sent for exploratory purposes. Every effort 
should be made to obtain adequate tumor tissue for both TIL manufacturing and additional 
analysis.  
Refer  to the Tumor Procurement  and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_785029].  
6.22. Optional Post -TIL Treatment  Biopsy 
If available and if patient consent is provided, on-study post- treatment (post LN -145 infusion) 
biopsy will be collected at Week 6 (Day 42) following the first post-baseline tumor response 
assessment scans; Core biopsies (1 -6 cores) from lesions not being assessed by [CONTACT_785086].  FFPE  blocks need  to be prepared  from  first core and second  core and  can be placed  in 
RNA later solution. If more than two core biopsies are available, they should be utilized in the following order: 
 
FFPE  -> RNA later  -> FFPE  -> RNA later  
The Week  6 (Day  42) core biopsies may be used to ascertain  molecu lar and immunological 
changes in the tumor following treatment as described below: 
• FFP E  block sent to Yale Cancer  Center  laboratory may be used for IHC  including PD-L1 
staining and DNA sequencing; and 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 45 of 89  
• Sample  in RNA later (sent  to Yale Cancer  Center)  may be used for gene expression 
analyses  
 
6.23. Biological and  Immune Monitoring  
In addition to  tumor tissue  samples,  samples  of the TIL  product as  well  as blood samples 
collected  at different  time points before  and after TIL infusion will be studied to identify 
biomarkers of TIL antitumor activity.  
TIL from the infusion product will be stored for research. The samples used in these research 
studies will be used to gain further information about the disease and the characteristics of the 
TIL before and after infusion (TIL  phenotype, TIL function, TIL reactivity,  and TIL diversity). 
Lab experiments will include flow cytometry analyses, cell-based assays, gene expression 
analyses, and T- cell receptor (TCR) sequencing.  
Mandatory peripheral  blood will be collected  at the timepoints  of surgery/tumor resection  and 
day 1 for immune monitoring by [CONTACT_785087]:  
• The detection  of circulating  immune  molecules,  such  as cytokines;  
• The monitoring of immune cell  numbers;  
• The identification,  characterization,  and functional assessment  of circulating  TIL;  and 
• The identification  of circulating  tumor DNA  
Blood for immune monitoring will be collected at the following timepoints: Week 6 (Day 
42), Week  12 (Day  84), Month 6, and Month [ADDRESS_1080023] (or other means of communication) made every 3 months with the 
patient  (or designee)  to collect  subsequent anticancer  therapy  and survival status.  Patients  are to 
be followed for OS for at least [ADDRESS_1080024]-145 infusion (Day 0). 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080025] one dose of IL-2. 
7.2. Study  Completion  
The study is expected  to be completed:  at approximately [ADDRESS_1080026]-145 infusion; at the 
time point when all patients have exited the study for any reason; or at the Sponsor PI’s/ Regulatory Agency/Iovance’s discretion, whichever  occurs first. The intent is that all patients 
will be followed post- treatment (LN -145) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1080027] tumor harvested, but do not receive any of the study treatment (NMA- LD, 
LN-145, and/or IL-2) will perform an EOA visit and transition directly into the LTFU for OS 
period, if study if consent remains in place. Patients who discontinue from the study for any 
reasons are to complete the EOA visit. An EOA visit is not required if the same procedures are 
done within 2 weeks from the previous visit (see Appendix 14.1) . End-of-study (EOS) occurs 
when  the patient  has completed  study participation  (eg, death  or lost to follow -up). Appropriate 
reasons for the discontinuation must be documented in the patient’s source documentation and eCRF page.  
Criteria  for discontinuation from  the study are as follows:  
• Withdrawal  of consent from  further participation  in the study  
• Sponsor Investigators’ decision  
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up after [ADDRESS_1080028]  the patient  
• Study terminated  by [CONTACT_785088] -LD, LN-145, and/or IL-2 administration  are as 
follows:  
• Grade  3 or greater  immune  TRAEs  that involves vital organs (heart,  kidneys, brain, liver, 
colon, adrenal gland, lungs) with symptoms emerging following LN-145 infusion 
• G
rade 3 or greater  allergic  reaction  including bronchospasm or generalized  urticaria  that 
does not resolve after medical management in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_785006] 
• Grade  3 or greater  toxicity  due to NMA- LD that does not decrease to Grade  2 or less 
within 96 hours of management  
• Determination  by [CONTACT_785089]  v8.[ADDRESS_1080029] of the patient  
 
• Withdrawal of consent from further study treatment. The patient is, at any time, free to 
discontinue treatment,  without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient  who discontinues 
treatment is normally expected to continue to participate in the study unless they 
specifically withdraw their consent to further participation in any study procedures and 
assessments  
• Pregnancy  
• Patient  becomes  ineligible  for study after tumor harvest and prior to LN-145 or IL-2 
administration  
• Administration  of prohibited concomitant medication  
• Patient  meets  any of the criteria for  early discontinuation from  study  
In the event of a patient’s full withdrawal of consent from post- treatment follow -up, the 
Sponsor Investigator will make every  effort  to complete  the EOA visit as appropriate. All 
AEs attributable to the investigational product may be followed until resolution or permanent sequelae.  The final outcome of unrelated AEs ongoing at the time of the EOA 
visit will be captured as “Not Recovered/Not Resolved.” 
7.4. Overall  Survival Follow- up 
Approximately every 3 months following the EOA visit, patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (eg, via 
telepho ne contact, or other means) to assess survival status, receipt, and ongoing status of 
subsequent anticancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Quarterly  follow-up will continue until death, full withdrawal  of 
consent by [CONTACT_4676], lost to follow-up, or study terminated by [CONTACT_785090]’s/ Regulatory Agency/Iovance. Patients are to be followed for [ADDRESS_1080030]-145 infusion (Day 
0). 
Every  effort  must be made to locate any patient  who is lost to follow-up. Patients  can only be 
considered as lost to follow-up after [ADDRESS_1080031] the patient, with no 
response.  
7.5. Early  Termination of Study  
The study may be terminated  at any time  by [CONTACT_785090]’s/  Regulatory Agency/Iovance.  
8. EXPECTED  TOXICITIES  AND MANAGEMENT  GUIDELINES  
 
Expected toxicities due to the chemotherapy preparative regimen, cytokines or support 
medication  administration  (as listed  in the protocol or in the package inserts  for commercial 
agents) will not result in discontinuing therapy (please refer to Sections 8 .1 and 8.3).  
8.1. Nonmyeloablative Lymphodepletion Regimen  Toxicity Management  
The use of the NMA-LD regimen (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) prior to cell 
administration  is expected  to lead to myelosuppression in all patients.  Therefore,  a high index of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_785030]. 
Refer  to cyclophosphamide and fludarabine current  PI/SmPC  for additional information.  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 48 of 89  
Expected  toxicities  with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine administration  are listed  in the 
PI/SmPC. Also included in the package inserts is information on supportive care and 
management of toxicities. Treatment will be given as per Investigator discretion and per institutional standard of care. 
8.2. Infection  Prophylaxis  
 
8.2.1. Pneumocystis  Jiroveci  Pneumonia  
All patients should receive appropriate Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis per 
institutional standards for patients  undergoing chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. This 
may include any of the following and should begin on or after their first dose of chemotherapy (Day -7), or as the Investigator deems appropriate, and continue until the ALC is > 1000 
cells/mm
3 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_785031] 6 months) or as per institutional standard of care.  
 
• Trimethoprim (TMP) and  sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as double strength (DS) tab (DS 
tabs = TMP  160 mg/tab,  and SMX  800 mg/tab)  by [CONTACT_785091], three  times  a 
week on nonconsecutive days, beginning on the first Monday, Wednesday, or Friday 
on or after the first dose of chemotherapy. 
• Pentamidine or alternative as per standard of care at the treating institution may be 
substituted  for TMP/SMX  DS in patients  with sulfa  allergies  and may be administered 
either IV or aerosolized monthly using standard doses indicated for PJP prophylaxis. 
Note:  Other  appropriate PJP  prophylactic agents  may be substituted  at the discretion  of the 
treating Investigator.  
 
8.2.2. Herpes  Virus Prophylaxis  
Patients  with positive HSV serology should receive appropriate re-activation  prophylaxis with 
either valacyclovir or acyclovir.  
Herpes  prophylaxis should begin on Day7  or as theInvestigator deems  appropriate and continue 
until the absolute lymphocyte count is > 1000/mm3 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_785031] 6 months) or as per 
standard institutional guidelines. 
Note:  Other  appropriate viral  prophylactic agents  may  be substituted  at the discretion  of the 
treating Investigator.  
 
8.2.3. Fungal Prophylaxis (Fluconazole)  
Patients will start fluconazole 400 mg (by [CONTACT_1966]) from Day 1, or when patient becomes 
neutropenic and continue until ANC  > 1000/mm3, or another suitable  fungal prophylaxis 
regimen as per standard of care at the treating institution. 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080032] fever  > 38.3°C 
(or 38.0°C or above at least 1 hour apart) at any point following lymphodepletion (from Day [ADDRESS_1080033]), patients  will be started  on empi[INVESTIGATOR_785032]- spectrum  ABX with adequate Pseudomonas 
coverage (as per local institutional antibiogram) regardless of neutrophil count. 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_785033] > 500 cells/mm3, even if no 
bloodstream infectious agent is identified. If a bloodstream agent is identified, broad- spectrum 
ABX may be tailored  to treat the infectio n as per institutional standard  of care.  Infectious disease 
consultation will be obtained for all patients with unexplained fever, any infectious 
complications, or as per standard of care at the treating institution. 
8.5. Filgrastim  
Patients  will receive filgrastim 5 µg/kg/day (recommended  maximum dose of 300 µg/day or 
higher as per institutional standard) subcutaneously starting from Day 1 until ANC is > 1000/mm
[ADDRESS_1080034]  Support  
Using  daily  CBCs  as a guide, the patient  will receive platelets  and packed  red blood cells as 
clinically indicated. As a general guideline, patients may be transfused to maintain: 
• Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL 
• Platelets  ≥ 10,000/mm3 
Note: Patients may be transfused for different parameters as clinically indicated, eg, increased 
risk for bleeding such as undergoing an invasive procedure or presence  of metastatic  lesion  likely 
to bleed (such as in the brain), high- grade fever, or sepsis . 
All blood products will be irradiated.  Leukocyte filters  will be utilized  for all blood and platelet 
transfusions to decrease sensitization to transfused white blood cells and decrease the risk of CMV infection. 
 
8.7. LN-[ADDRESS_1080035] formulations contain 0.5% HSA, 300 IU/mL of IL- 2, and potentially low 
residual  amounts of gentamycin  and streptomycin,  which  belong to the aminoglycoside group of 
ABX. The cryopreserved TIL product formulation includes the cryopreservation medium 
CryoStor® CS10, which contains the cryoprotectants DMSO and dextran-40. 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including severe allergic reactions and life-threatening anaphylaxis, 
have occurred  during infusion with the LN-[ADDRESS_1080036]-145 infusion: 
• Within  [ADDRESS_1080037]-145 infusion, premedicate the patient  with 
acetaminophen (650 mg) and diphenhydramine (25 to 50 mg IV), or another H1 
histamine antagonist.  
o Avoid prophylactic use of systemic  corticosteroids,  as it may interfere  with the activity 
of LN -145. Corticosteroids should only be used to treat life-threatening conditions. 
In addition, emergency  anaphylaxis medications  must be available at bedside (epi[INVESTIGATOR_785034]; corticosteroids should only be given in a life- threatening situation).  
Additional supportive medications  may include the following:  
• Indomethacin  (50 to 75 mg q6h);  
• Ranitidine  (150 mg q12h);  
• Meperidine (25 to 50 mg), or other medication  per institutional standards may be given 
IV if severe chills/rigors develop. 
The initial infusion rate should not exceed  1 mL/min  for the first 5 minutes.  The rate of infusion 
may be increased thereafter to 5 –10 mL/min as tolerated. Continuous supervision of the patient 
by [CONTACT_785092], to monitor 
for potential signs and symptoms  (eg, of a severe hypersensitivity reaction  such  as anaphylaxis) 
that may require immediate medical attention and treatment. For additional information, please 
refer to the study-specific Pharmacy & Investigational Product Administration Manual. 
Hypersensitivity events may present with symptoms such as rash, low blood pressure, shortness 
of breath, swelling of the face or throat, cough, chest tightness, and/or wheezing. More severe reactions,  including anaphylaxis, have occurred  and require immediate  treatment  with emergency 
medications. During infusion of the LN-[ADDRESS_1080038], appropriate emergency medications (eg, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids) should be available at bedside during 
administration and institutional guidelines should be followed for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Corticosteroids should only be used in life-threatening conditions.  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080039] occur before the expi[INVESTIGATOR_242102] (usually within 24 hours of 
manufacture).  Please refer to the Pharmacy  & Investigational Product Administration  Manual  for 
specific LN -[ADDRESS_1080040] entirely been associated with either the NMA -LD regimen or the IL -2 therapy given after 
TIL infusion [ 61]. The following AEs have been observed in published studies that treated 
patient s with TIL products prepared by a process like that being used to prepare LN-145: 
• Short- term,  transient/reversible  effects  of TIL infusion include fever,  chills,  shortness of 
breath, increased heart rate, hypotension (prolonged hypotension necessitating pr essor 
treatment has been reported) [ 61] following TIL infusion 
• Lung congestion, which could be mild (shortness of breath) to severe (difficulty 
breathing – possibly needing a breathing tube and breathing machine for a few days) 
• Autoimmune reaction  such as loss of skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517] (known as vitiligo)  or inflammation  of 
the eye (uveitis , refer to 8.7.2), which may require the use of steroid eye drops 
 
8.7.[ADDRESS_1080041]  normal melanocytes  in uveal  tissue  or skin melanocytes, 
leading to uveitis or vitiligo. 
• Uveitis may present with mild to moderate in intensity, associated with symptoms such as 
blurred  vision, dull, aching, eye pain, nyctalopia, photopsia, retinal  hemorrhage, and/or vitreous 
floaters, and often improved with corticosteroid therapy. Uveitis may be caused by a number of different etiologies; therefore, diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease are imperative not only to treat the disease but also to preserve vision and potentially uncover underlying systemic  diseases.  If untreated  or not appropriately  treated,  acute inflammation  can develop into 
chronic, sight-threatening inflammation. Thus, when a patient presents with clinical signs and symptoms that may be associated with uveitis, the Investigator should complete a thorough examination to determine an appropriate etiology for the diagnosis. The examination should include an evaluation of location (anterior vs intermediate vs posterior), duration (acute vs chronic), pathology (granulomatous vs non-granulomatous), and laterality (unilateral vs bilateral). Once an etiology has been established, appropriate treatment should be commenced 
and customized to each participant as  suboptimal treatment may lead to complications and loss 
of vision. 
• Vitiligo may present in these patients with mild to moderate in intensity. For patients who 
develop vitiligo, a thorough history should be taken including the site and type of vitiligo 
(segmental, nonsegmental), disease extent (affected body surface area),  disease stability, and 
speed of onset. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (medium or high potency) are recommended for 
localized vitiligo (<10% of body surface area) and may be used at I nvestigator discretion. 
Specialized  dermatology consultation is recommended  for appropriate management  in all cases 
unless vitiligo is self -limited, localized, and non-progressive. 
Patients  may experience severe  allergic  reaction  (anaphylaxis) due to DMSO contained  in LN- 
145. Thus, appropriate emergency  medications  (eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_785035]) should be

8.8. Interleukin -2 Toxicity Management  
IL-2 (Proleukin, aldesleukin) can affect nearly every organ system, but essentially every 
abnormality will most often normalize following d iscontinuation of IL-[ADDRESS_1080043] 
of the commonly seen toxicities.  Appendix 14.4 has further details  for suggested  management  as 
well as decision for holding (skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dose) and discontinuing IL-2 therapy. 
 
8.8.1. Rigors  
IL-2 associated rigors can routinely be treated with meperidine/pethidine. An initial dose of [ADDRESS_1080044] institutional guidelines (after testing for infectious etiologies 
such as Clostridium difficile , if present).  
8.8.3. Neurologic Toxicity  
Decreased  mental  status  may occur  and can range from  somnolence to obtundation. IL-2 should 
be discontinued for any significant mental status changes or hallucinations. Agitation may be 
observed due to mild hallucinations. Appropriate psychiatry  consultation would be warranted  for 
guidance in management.  
 
8.8.4. Renal  Toxicity  
Renal toxicity defined by [CONTACT_785093]/plasma creatinine levels or clinical symptoms is a 
risk that is commonly observed (creatinine 1.[ADDRESS_1080045] for marked  elevation).  If patients  exhibit signs or symptoms of renal  toxicity,  manage 
as per institutional standard of care (and may include low-dose dopamine to improve perfusion 
or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).  Hemodialysis  should be reserved  for life-threatening 
renal failure such as prolonged anuria, hyperkalemia, and profound uremia. 
 
8.8.5. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_785036]-[ADDRESS_1080046]-145 can remain  in the pulmonary circulation  for 24 to 48 hours following infusion and may 
cause transient shortness of breath. In addition, pulmonary edema is commonly observed with 
IL-2 dosing. Supplemental oxygen may be administered as needed. Subsequent IL-2 dosing 
should be delayed until supplemental oxygen has been weaned or is minimal (< 2 L/min per nasal cannula). If hypoxia persists or is significant, IL-2 should be discontinued. 
 
8.8.8. Sepsis/Febrile  Neutropenia  During  IL-[ADDRESS_1080047]-spectrum ABX should be initiated. 
 
8.8.9. Heparin -Induced Thrombocytopenia  
Heparin -induced  thrombocytopenia has been  observed with IL-2 administration.  To minimize 
this risk, heparin flushes should be avoided or minimized, if possible during IL-2 dosing. 
Refer  to interleukin -2/aldesleukin (Proleukin®) current  package insert  for additional information.  
 
8.9. Other Concomitant Medications  to Control Side Effects  
 
8.9.1. Nausea/Vomiting 
Nausea  and vomiting  should be controlled with ondansetron or similar  medication.  Other  second - 
and third-line medications (eg, prochlorperazine, promethazine, lorazepam, scopolamine, and 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) can be used per local standard institutional guidelines. Steroids, such as 
dexamethasone may be used as an antiemetic only during cyclophosphamide administration but should be avoided and only used with intractable nausea and vomiting. Steroids must be 
discontinued a minimum of [ADDRESS_1080048]-145 administration (Day -1) and continue throughout IL- 2 treatment.  
Medications  may include indomethacin 50 mg every  8 hours and/or acetaminophen  every  [ADDRESS_1080049]  1.1 response 
criteria definitions [ 1]. 
9.2. Baseline  Documentation of “Target” and “Nontarget” Lesions  
Baseline documentation of all lesions will occur on Day -[ADDRESS_1080050] one measurable lesion of ≥ [ADDRESS_1080051] scan. 
When > 1 measurable lesion is present at Baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions 
total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ system)  should be identified  as target  lesions and 
will be recorded and measured at Baseline. Target lesions should be selected based on their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) and should be representative of all involved organs. 
Pathological lymph nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target 
lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_1080052] scan. Only the short axis of 
these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short 
axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm)  should be considered  nontarget lesions. Nodes that  have a short axis 
< 10 mm are considered  nonpathological and should not be recorded  or followed.  
A sum of diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated  and reported  as the Baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is to be added into the sum. The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
All other lesions (or sites of disease)  including pathological lymph nodes should be identified  as 
nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at B aseline. Measurements are not required, and 
these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression.”  
9.3. Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section  provides the definition  of the criteria  used to determine  objective tumor response for 
target lesions.  
Table 3:  Definition  of Objective Tumor Response  
Response  Criteria  
Complete  Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  (whether 
target or nontarget) must have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm).  
Partial Response  (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter  of target  lesions  taking  as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Response  Criteria  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 55 of 89   
Progressive  Disease  (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable  Disease  (SD)  Neither  sufficient shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
9.4. Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
This section  provides the definitions of the criteria  used to determine  the tumor  response for the 
group of nontarget lesions. While some nontarget lesions may be measurable, they need not be 
measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points of radiographic assessments.  
Table 4:  Definition  of Nontarget Lesions  Response  
Response  Criteria  
Complete  Response (CR)  Disappearance of all nontarget  lesions.  All lymph nodes  must  be nonpathological 
in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-complete  Response  / 
Non-Progressive Disease  Persistence of 1 or more  nontarget  lesion(s).  
Progressive  Disease  (PD)  Unequivocal  progression of existing  non-target  lesions.  (Note:  the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
 
9.5. Evaluation of New Lesions  
New  measurable lesions may be identified  if the new lesions meet  criteria  as defined  for Baseline 
target lesion selection and meet the same minimum RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1080053]  lesions selected  as 
new measured lesions.  
All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non- measurable 
lesions and are followed qualitatively.  Only  unequivocal progression of n ew non- measurable 
lesions leads to an overall assessment of PD for the time point.  
The finding of a new lesion  should be unequivocal, ie, not attributable  to differences  in scanning 
technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than 
tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing 
lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s Baseline lesions show PR or CR. 
For example,  necrosis of a liver lesion  may be reported  on a CT scan report  as a ‘new’ cystic 
lesion, which it is not. 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080054] response recorded from the start of 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence, the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, 
death, or [ADDRESS_1080055] (taking reference for PD 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation criteria (see 
Section 9.2). The assignment of response for an individual patient, based on both target and 
nontarget lesions, at each assessment time  point is shown in Table [ADDRESS_1080056] overall response 
for each patient is determined as shown in Table 6 .

9.7. Confirmation of Tumor Assessments  
 
9.7.1. Confirmation of Response  (PR or CR) 
Confirmation  of response (either  PR or CR) is required. Changes in tumor measurements  must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_54672] ≥ [ADDRESS_1080058] met. If the confounding factor/tumor flare is considered at subsequent 
assessment points, as the previous assessment was SD or PR, then the response should be SD or PR, until proven otherwise. The response assessment should be updated, if needed, based on the 
consecutive observation. ‘Not Evaluable (NE)’ should only be selected if the response was truly 
not evaluable (eg, scan was not done). 
 
9.7.2. Confirmation of Progressive Disease  
If PD is assessed, then this must be confirmed by [CONTACT_785094].  
For patients with a minimum increase of over 20% in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study or for nontarget or new non- measurable lesions, a 
confirmation scan is required at least [ADDRESS_1080059] PD assessment.  
 
10. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
Toxicities will be recorded as AEs, AESIand  serious adverse events (SAEs) in the patient’s 
source documents and on the AEs eCRF  and must be graded  using the CTEP  Version  5.0 of 
the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  
10.1. Adverse Event  
An AE as defined by [CONTACT_135313] (ICH)- Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal/investigational product and which  does not necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to the medicinal/investigational product or not. 
Events  meeting  the definition  of an AE include:  
• AEs tempor ally associated  with the use of any of the investigational products or TIL 
treatment whether or not considered related to the use of any of the investigational products or TIL treatment 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 58 of 89  • Any abnormal laboratory  test results  (eg, hematology, clinical  chemistry,  or urinalysis) or 
other assessments (eg, ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements) that are 
abnormal and  are considered clinically significant (eg, led to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25386], required change in study tre atment, required initiation of 
concomitant therapy or intervention) 
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing  condition including either  an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New  conditions detected  or diagnosed after  inve stigational product administration  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  interaction  with investigational 
product  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication  
 
• Events  that do not meet  the definition  of an AE include:  
• Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated  with the underlying disease,  unless judged by [CONTACT_113544]’s condition 
• Any laboratory abnormal value that  has not clinical significance and does not require 
treatment  
• Medical  or surgical  procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads  to 
the procedure is an AE. Planned elective procedures are not AEs 
• Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section  10.9) 
• Situations  where an untoward medical  occurrence  did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
• Anticipated  day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing  disease(s)  or condition(s) present  or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
10.2. Serious  Adverse Event  
An AE is considered  serious if, in the view  of the Sponsor Investigator or Iovance,  it results  in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Is life  threatening  
• In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• A persistent  or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical  events:  such events  may not directly  result  in death,  be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based on Sponsor Investigator 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080060]  
The Sponsor Investigator is responsible for assessing  the relationship  to study  treatment using clinical 
judgement and the following considerations: 
• Definite : There is a known causal  relationship  between  the investigational product and 
the AE/SAE. The event responds to withdrawal of study treatment (dechallenge) and 
recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasible.  
• Probable : There  is reasonable causal  relationship  between  the investigational product 
and the AE/SAE. The event responds to dechallenge. 
• Possible : There is reasonable causal  relationship between  the investigational product and 
the AE/ SAE. Dechallenge info rmation is lacking or unclear. 
• Not likely : There is temporal relationship to the investigational product administration, 
but there is not a reasonable causal  relationship  between  the study drug and the AE/SAE.  
 
• Not related : There is not a temporal relationship to investigational product 
administration  (too early,  or late, or investigational product not administered),  or there  is 
known causal  relationship between  the AE/SAE  and another drug, concurrent  disease,  or 
other circumstance.  
 
10.4. Severity  
The severity  of an event  describes  the degree  of impact  and/or the need  for medical  care 
necessary to treat an event.  
AE grading will be defined  by [CONTACT_12397]  v 5.0. In  the event  the CTCAE  v 5.0 does not apply, 
the severity descriptions below will be used. 
• Mild : Asymptomatic; clinical or  diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
• Moderate: Minimal,  local,  or noninvasive intervention  indicated;  limiting  age 
appropriate activities of daily life.  
• Severe: Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785037]; disabling; limiting  activities  of daily  life. 
• Life-threatening : Urgent  intervention is required.  
• Death : When  death  is the outcome of the AE. 
10.5. Reporting  Procedures  for Adverse Events  
All AEs/SAEs  occurring after the patient  has signed the ICF  will be collected  and recorded  in the 
eCRFs and graded as per CTCAE v5.0. Disease progression is not considered an AE for the 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 60 of 89  purposes of this study. 
AEs will be collected  and reported according to  the following temporal intervals:  
• Signed ICF to tumor resection  (SAEs  only)  
• Tumor resection  to start  of NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  (AEs  and SAEs)  
• NMA- LD preconditioning regimen  to Day  0 (AEs  and SAEs)  
• Day 0 to Day  30 (TEAEs  and treatment -emergent  SAEs)  
• Day [ADDRESS_1080061] (Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs; SAEs, if at least related to any study 
drug)  
• After  this period, only SAEs  related  to LN-[ADDRESS_1080062]-145 by [CONTACT_785095]. 
If a patient dies while on the study, the Sponsor Investigator will report to Iovance and the 
Data Safety  Monitoring Committee  (DSMC) within  24 hours and report  the cause of death  as 
an SAE. The clinical event leading to death should be recorded in detail on the SAE Report 
Form. Diseas e progression itself  is not an AE, but the clinical  signs or symptoms leading  to 
death  should be reported as an SAE with an outcome of death. On the SAE Report Form, the 
cause of death should be recorded as follows: 
• If due to an AE, it should be specified  from  which  AE 
o Disease progression is  not considered  an AE 
• If due to sequelae of disease under study, the specific reason  should be identified  (eg, 
clinical deterioration, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], liver failure, etc.)  
• If due to “other” causes, the specific cause should be  identified  
• Fo r  patients  who expi[INVESTIGATOR_785038]-up and medical  records  were  unavailable,  the 
cause of death should be marked as “unknown” 
The investigator will be responsible for reporting SAEs to the IRB of record. It will be left to 
the Sponsor Investigator’s clinical judgment if an AE is of sufficient severity to require the 
patient’s removal  from the study treatment. A patient may also voluntarily discontinue 
treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE. This should be captured in the 
eCRF. If the patient was permanently removed from the study or LN-[ADDRESS_1080063] be included in the initial or follow-up SAE  Report Form  and in the eCRF. 
10.6. Reporting  Procedures  for Serious  Adverse Events  
All SAEs  of any  attribution  will be collected  from  the time  the patient  signs the ICF  through Day  
30. In patients  who fail the initial Screening  process,  any SAEs  occurring after signing ICF until 
study discontinuation (ie, the day of screen failure) will be collected. 
Only Grade [ADDRESS_1080064] been  caused  by [CONTACT_104841],  then the SAE 
should be promptly reported to the DSMC and Iovance/designee. 
The Sponsor Investigator will report  to Iovance  and the FDA  as applicable,  any SAE that  occurs  
during the study. The initial  notification  should be as complete  as possible with the information 
available and include the Investigator’s assessment of study drug relationship. 
Iovance shall  have the opportunity to review  and comment  on the Investigator’s determination  as 
to causality and Severity for each AE and shall have the opportunity to submit comments for 
consideration by [CONTACT_785096]. All AEs, regardless of their severity, will be captured in the 
eCRF.  
SAE  terminology and  severity  grading will be based  on the NCI’s  CTCAE  v5.00 guidelines.  
 
10.7. Investigator Communications with  Iovance Biotherapeutics  
 The Sponsor Investigator, or designee, will report to Iovance in accordance with the contractual 
agreement  between  Yale Cancer  Center  and Iovance Biotherapeutics.  Reports  will be sent to 
Iovance Biotherapeutics’ designated mailboxes: 
 
 
10.8. Special  Situations  Reporting  
 
10.8.1. Definitions  of Special  Situations  
Special situation reports include reports of medication error, overdose, AEs associated with 
product complaints,  occupational exposure, and pregnancy reports  regardless  of an associated 
AE. The special situation reports will be reported as an SAE but not considered an AE/SAE 
unless associated with an AE/SAE.  
Medication  error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration  of a 
medicinal/investigational product while in the control of the health care provider, patient, or 
consumer.  
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of a 
medicinal/investigational product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended  dose as per protocol or in the product labeling  (as it applies  to the daily 
dose of the patient in question). 
Product c
omplaint is defined  as complaints  arising  from  potential deviations in the manufacture, 
packaging, or distribution of the medicinal/investigational product.  
Occupational  exposure is defined  as the exposure to a medicinal  product as a result  of one’s 
professional or nonprofessional occupation. 
Special  situation  reports  must be reported  to Iovance Biotherapeutics’  designated  mailboxes [EMAIL_14992]  and [EMAIL_14993]  
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 62 of 89  using the SAE Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the situation to: 
 
 
10.8.2. Procedures  for Special  Situations  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  Reporting  
Any pregnancy that occurs while on the study through [ADDRESS_1080065] be reported  using 
the Pregnancy  Report form  within  24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy.  The pregnancy 
itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced abortion to terminate a pregnancy without 
medical reasons. Any premature termination of pregnancy (eg, a spontaneous abortion, an 
induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) must be reported within 24 hours as an AE or SAE. The underlying medical reason for this procedure should be 
recorded  as the AE or SAE  term. A spontaneous abortion is always  considered to be an SAE  and 
will be reported as described in Section 10.7. 
The patient  should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy 
to determine the outcome and status of the patient and child. The outcome should be reported to 
the to Iovance Biotherapeutics’ designated mailboxes using the Pregnancy Outcome form. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the Sponsor Investigator’s attention 
after the patient has completed the study treatment and post -treatment follow -up visits, must be 
promptly reported to Iovance or their representative. 
The pregnancy must be followed up until discharge following delivery or premature termination 
to determine outcome and status of mother and child. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations  for medical  reasons  must be reported  as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must 
be reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the Sponsor Investigator’s attention after the patient has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_785097], must be promptly reported to Iovance or their representative.  
Pregnancies  of female partners  of male  study participants  exposed to study treatment  must also 
be reported and relevant information should be submitted using the Pregnancy and Pregnancy 
Outcome forms within 24 hours. Monitoring of the female partners should continue until the 
conclusion of the pregnancy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Uveitis  Special  Interest  Reporting  
AEs of uveitis is considered as AESI, must be recorded in the eCRFs and reported to the 
sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the study personnel’s discovery of the event, even if they are considered  nonserious according  to the usual regulatory criteria.  The investigator must 
follow any patient experiencing uveitis until resolution or stabilization of the event, an alternative explanation other than study intervention is provided for the event, or the patient is lost to follow -up. The Sponsor investigator should submit any further details obtained from 
follow-up to the sponsor within 24 hours of it becoming availa ble.

10.9. Study  Halting  Rules  
The study may be stopped following review  of the safety  data by [CONTACT_785098]. 
10.10. Regulatory Reporting  Requirements  
AEs classified  as “serious” and “unexpected” that are possibly, probably, or definitely  attributed 
to drug administration (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), or SAEs 
whose frequency exceeds expectations, require expeditious handling and reporting. 
Within  [ADDRESS_1080066]-145, the 
Sponsor Investigator will promptly investigate all safety information related to the adverse event 
and will promptly discuss the event details with Iovance Biotherapeutics for comments. The 
Sponsor Investigator will review Iovance’ s comments and shall provide such comments  to the 
IRB of record.  Any updated  information  shall  be submitted  by [CONTACT_785099] a 
follow-up SAE report. 
The Sponsor Investigator is the Sponsor of this study  and is responsible for expedited reporting 
to regulatory agencies.  
If the results of the Sponsor Investigator’s investigation show an adverse drug experience not 
initially determined to be reportable (bas ed on whether the event is serious, unexpected, and 
associated  with drug administration)  is so reportable,  the Sponsor Investigator will report such 
experience.  Follow-up information  to a safety  report  shall  be submitted  as soon as the relevant 
information is available.  
Final  assessment  of expectedness  for SAEs  will be determined  by [CONTACT_785100], comments from Iovance and relevant 
prescribing information, as applicable. 
There are two  types of expedited safety  reports to  the FDA:  
1. 7-Calendar -Day FDA Telephone or Fax Report: The Sponsor Investigator will directly  
notify the FDA,  within  7 calendar  days  after  his initial receipt  of the information, of any 
adverse event that is ALL of the following: 
Death  or immediately  life-threatening  
Unexpected  
 
Associated  with the use of study drug 
Notification to the FDA will be made directly to the new drug review division in the 
Center  for Drug  Evaluation and Research  or in the product review  division for the Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and Research, whichever was responsible for the review of the investigational new drug (IND) application. [21CFR312.32(c)] A written report of the 
event is to follow within 15 calendar days. 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 64 of 89  2. 15-Calendar -Day FDA Written Report: The Sponsor investigator will directly notify the 
FDA  within  15 calendar  days of any adverse event  that is ALL  of the following: 
Serious (due to  non- fatal and non- life-threatening  criteria  
Unexpected  
Associated  with the use of study drug 
Note:  SAEs  which  do not meet  the criteria  for expedited  reporting will be reported  to the FDA  in 
the IND Annual Report. 
In addition, the Sponsor investigator must submit expedited reports of potential serious risks 
from clinical studies or any other source based on relevant local legislation or regulations, 
including the applicable US FDA Code of Federal Regulations and relevant updates. The 
Sponsor investigator should notify the IRB of record of S[LOCATION_003]R reports as soon as is 
practical  where  required  by [CONTACT_785101].  
10.11. Safety  Review  and Data  Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  
The safety parameters will be reviewed on an on -going basis including Grades [ADDRESS_1080067] five patients enrolled upon completion of 6 weeks (Day 42) of assessment post- LN -145 
infusion. 
Enrollment will continue while  study data are under DSMC  review.  
 
10.12  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  
 
The Yale Cancer Center (YCC) Data and Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  will provide 
the primary  oversight of data and safety  monitoring. The Yale DSMC  will review  and monitor 
compliance, toxicity  and deviations from this study. The committee is composed of clinical 
specialists with experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information  that raises  any questions about participant  safety  will be addressed  with the 
Sponsor Investigator. 
The DSMC will review this protocol bi-annually, at a minimum. Information to be provided to 
the committee includes: a study narrative by [CONTACT_978], a summary DSMC report produced by

completing the review, the DSMC will approve whether the study should continue as planned, 
require  modification/ amendment,  or be placed  on administrative  hold with accrual  temporarily 
suspended.  
Trials  being monitored by [CONTACT_785102] a 
DSMC review has occurred that includes the research activity of the last subject who 
completed the intervention, or until the DSMC feels there are no patient safety concerns that 
require further monitoring. The DSMC will determine the length of continued D SMC review.  
The DSMC  has authority to intervene in the conduct of these studies as necessary  to ensure the 
safety of the participants and to maintain the highest quality in the clinical research performed 
at YCC. The DSMC has the authority to require additional monitoring and/ or more frequent 
reporting on study progress and serious adverse events. 
 
11. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1. Introduction  
The statistical analysis will be based on the use of descriptive methods unless mentioned 
otherwise.  Continuous data wi ll be summarized  as the number of patients  with  non- missing  data 
(n), mean,  standard  deviation, median,  minimum,  and maximum values.  Categorical  data will be 
summarized as counts and their related percentages, where applicable. Estimation of confidence limits will use two -sided, 90% criteria. Missing data will not be imputed unless mentioned 
otherwise.  
All laboratory results will be summarized using descript ive statistics. SAEs will also be 
summarized. A separate safety summary will be provided for patients in the tumor harvested (TH) population starting  from  the tumor resection  for 30 days (TH non- treated  population) and 
until date of first dose of the study treatment (safety population). 
11.2. Study  Analysis Sets 
The TH Set is defined  as all tumor- resected  patients  for production of LN-145. The TH 
population is further divided into the efficacy and safety sets for analyses. 
 
11.2.1. Safety  Analysis Set 
The Safety  Analysis Set  consists of patients  who  received  LN-145 infusion.  
 
11.2.2. Efficacy  Analysis Set 
The Efficacy Analysis Set consists of patients in the Safety Analysis set with Baseline 
assessments (Day -21 or Day -9) and at least one post- Baseline radiological asses sments. 
Patients  who progressed or expi[INVESTIGATOR_785039]-responders. 
11.3. Sample  Size Justification  
The planned sample  size consists of 10 patients  in the efficacy  evaluable set. The null hypothesis 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 66 of 89  for this trial is 14% based on the ORR rates for standard of care second line chemotherapy in 
metastatic triple negative breast. A sample size of 10 patients yields over 78% power to test the 
alternative hypothesis of an ORR rate of 35% at one- tailed alpha level of 20%. The sample size 
is based on the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set, consisting of patients who have 
received LN -[ADDRESS_1080068] radiological assessment will be included and considered  as non-responders. The  planned analysis  will be conducted when  the 10th patient  has 
had the opportunity to be followed for a minimum of 3 months. This will allow s ufficient time 
for disease -controlled patients (SD or better) to demonstrate extended durability. If the number 
of responding patients is three or greater (out of 10) the lower bound of an 80% one-sided confidence interval will exclude the null ORR rate of 14%. 
 
11.4. Baseline  Demographic and Clinical Characteristics  
Baseline demographic and clinical  (disease)  characteristics  will be summarized  descriptively  for 
the treated and untreated populations. Age will be derived as a function of the date of informed consent. Patients among the resected, untreated population will be summarized by [CONTACT_785103]. 
11.5. Study  Endpoints  and Planned Analyses  
 
11.5.1. Primary  Endpoints  
The ORR  is defined  as the proportion of patients  who  achieve either  a confirmed  PR or CR as 
best response as assessed by [CONTACT_604282] 1.1 among the Efficacy Analysis Set. 
Objective  response will be evaluated  per each disease assessment  and the ORR will be calculated  
with the corresponding 90% two-sided confidence interval. 
The primary safety analysis will be descriptive and based on the summarization of TEAEs, including SAEs,  AEs leading  to discontinuation from  the study treatment  and efficacy  follow-up. 
The treatment -emergent period is defined from LN-145 infusion until 30 days thereafter. AE 
summaries will be based on patient incidence counts and percentages per the Safety Analysis 
Set. In addition to the overall summary of AEs, breakdown summaries will be made by [CONTACT_785104], and relationship to the study treatment 
 
11.5.2. Secondary  Endpoints  
Additional Measures  of Efficacy:  
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints are defined  as follows:  
• DOR  is measured  from  the first-time response (PR/CR)  criteria  are met until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, or receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy or the patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054] (whichever is first recorded). Patients not 
experiencing PD or who have not died prior to the time of data cut or the final database 
lock will have their event times censored on the last date that an adequate assessment of tumor status is made  
• DCR  is derived  as the sum of the number of patients  who achieved  confirmed  PR/CR  or 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.0  
Confidential and Proprietary                                                Page 67 of 89  sustained SD (at least 6 weeks) divided by [CONTACT_785105] x 100% 
• PFS is defined  as the time (in months) from  the time of lymphodepletion to PD, or death 
due to any cause, whichever event is earlier. Patients not experiencing PD or not having 
died at the time of the data cut or the final database lock will have their event times 
censored on the last date that an adequate assessment of tumor status is made 
• OS is defined as the time (in months) from the time of lymphodepletion to death due to 
any cause.  Patients  not having died by [CONTACT_785106] 
• CR rate is based on responders who achieved confirme d CR as assessed by [CONTACT_21422]. The CR rate will be summarized  using a point estimate  and its two-sided 
90% confidence interval (CI)  
• DOR,  DCR,  PFS,  and OS will be subjected  to right censoring. Kaplan -Meier  methods 
will apply  
 
11.5.3. Exploratory Endpoints  
• Correlations of immune  factors  with efficacy  and safety  will be explored. The results  will 
be reported in a separate document 
• Details  of exploratory tissue  biomarkers analyses  will be provided in a separate report  
• Feasibility of generating TIL (LN -145) from patient derived TNBC core biopsy tumor 
specimens  using Iovance  manufacturing process.  analyses  will be provided in a separate 
report  
 
12. ADMINISTRATIVE  PROCEDURES  AND  STUDY MANAGEMENT  
 
12.1. Good Clinical Practice

study. The Sponsor Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full compliance with 
the principles of the “Declaration  of Helsinki”  (as amended  in Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and 
South Africa),  ICH  guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the 
research is conducted. The Sponsor Investigator will conduct all aspects of the study in 
accordance with applicable country, national, state and local laws of the pertinent regulatory 
authority. All Investigators will ensure adherence to ICH guidelines for GCP and Clinical 
Safety Data Management.  
By [CONTACT_785107] 1572, “Statement of Investigator,” the Investigator commits to 
adhere to applicable sections  of the US Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR)  parts  50 “Protection 
of Human Patients,” 54 “Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230],” 56 "Institutional 
Review Boards,” and 312 subpart D “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators.” 
12.2. I nstitutional  Review  Board  (IRB) Approval  
The Investigator shall  assure that  the IRB of record  provides initial and continuing review  of the 
study according  to local  policy. Prior to  screening  and enrollment of study patients,  documented 
Yale  Cancer  Center  Protocol  v8.[ADDRESS_1080069] be obtained. 
12.3. Protocol Modifications  
Protocol amendments  should not be implemented  without prior regulatory submission and IRB 
approval, except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in 
monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]). 
12.4. Record  Retention  
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the Sponsor Investigator will be responsible  for 
all information  in the eCRF  and will maintain  the source documents that support the data 
collected from each patient, and all study documents as specified in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s). 
The Sponsor Investigator will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential  documents must be retained  until at least [ADDRESS_1080070]. These 
documents will be retained for a longer period  if required by [CONTACT_785108]. It is the responsibility of Iovance to inform the 
Sponsor Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If 
the Sponsor investigator  retires, relocates,  or for other reasons withdraws  from  the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must 
be transferred  to a person who will accept  the responsibility.  Iovance must be notified  in writing 
of the name [CONTACT_1640].

visit. Tests performed outside the Sponsor Investigator's office may be used, provided that the tests are done within the window dictated by [CONTACT_760]. 
All eCRF corrections are to be made by [CONTACT_785110]. The Sponsor Investigator must authorize changes  to the recorded  safety  and efficacy 
data and changes must reflect in source documents.  
 
12.7. Study  Monitoring  
In accordance with [ADDRESS_1080072] eCRF, study 
documents, research facilities, and clinical laboratory facilities associated with this study at mutually convenient times during and after completion of the study. As required by 21 CFR Part 312, Subpart D: Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators, the monitoring visits provide the 
Principal Investigator [CONTACT_7089] o pportunity to evaluate the progress of the study; verify the 
accuracy and completeness of eCRF against source documentation; ensure that all protocol 
requirements, applicable to FDA regulations, and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled; 
and resolve any inconsistencies in the study records. This includes inspection of all documents 
and records related to the study that are required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and investigational pharmacy 
records for the patients participating in this study. The names and identities of all research 
patients will be kept in strict confidence and will not appear on eCRF or other records provided to or retained by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator. Regulations also require the Investigator to allow 
authorized representatives of Yale Cancer Center , Iovance, the FDA or Regulatory Authorities to 
inspect and make copi[INVESTIGATOR_314195]. The Investigator should immediately notify the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_785040] a regulatory agency 
concerning an upcoming inspection. 
12.8. Institutional  Review  Board/Independent  Ethics  Committee  (HIC)  
Before  enrollment of patients  into the study, as required  by [CONTACT_785111] (21 CFR  56) and

other locally  required  documents) according to local  requirements  after the nature of the study 
has been  fully  explained. The  consent form  must be  signed prior to  performance of any  study- 
related  activity.  The consent form  that is used  must  be approved both by [CONTACT_785116]. The informed consent should be in accordance with the current revision of the 
Declaration  of Helsinki,  current  ICH  and GCP  guidelines, Directive  2001/20/EC (and when  in 
force EU Regulation 536/2014), and Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), as interpreted by [CONTACT_785117]. 
At the discretion  of the Investigator, and if deemed  in the patient’s  best interest  and approved by 
[CONTACT_268631],  the consent  form  can be sent to the patient  by [CONTACT_718567].  The consent 
discussions with the study participant or study participant’s legally authorized representative may be conducted  by [CONTACT_785118].  After  the consent  discussion, the 
patient or the study participant's legally authorized representative will sign and date the consent 
form and provide a copy of the document to the study staff by [CONTACT_6972], scanning the consent 
form and returning a copy through a secure e-mail account, or by [CONTACT_2319]. An original signed 
consent document must be provided to the study staff at a subsequent study visit or via mail. 
The Investigator must explain to potential patients or their legal representatives the purpose, 
methods, reasonably  anticipated  benefits and potential hazards  of the study, its duration, and any 
discomfort it may entail. Patients will be informed in their native language, comprehensive, concise, clear, relevant and understandable to a layperson, that their participation is voluntary and that they are free not to participate in the study and that they may withdraw consent to 
participate at any time. They will be told which alternative treatments are available if they refuse 
to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally, they will be told  
that their records may be examined by [CONTACT_785119]. Patients 
must be given the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded by [CONTACT_106201]'s or his/her legal 
representative's  dated  signature. If a patient  and his/her legal  representative are unable to read,  an 
impartial witness  must be present  during the entire  informed  consent discussion. The signature [CONTACT_785124]'s consent. The patient and their legally designated representative must r eceive a signed and dated copy of the informed consent. The informed 
consent process should be documented in the patient’s medical record. Adequate time shall be 
given for the patient  or his or her  legally  designated representative to  consider his or her  decision 
to participate in the study. 
In acco
rdance with the Health  Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA),  the written 
ICF must include a patient authorization to release medical information to the Sponsor - 
Investigator or their  representative and/or allow  the Sponsor -Investigator or  their  representative, 
Iovance, a regulatory authority, or IRB access to patient’s medical information that includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785041], including a patient’s  medical  history and other data that may 
identify him/her.

n. A sample of tumor  resected  for TIL generation  will be analyzed  locally  for PD-L1 status  by [CONTACT_4658] 
o. At Screening  and Baseline,  ECG (12-lead)  to be performed  after patient has been  supi[INVESTIGATOR_221865] [ADDRESS_1080084] an ECHO or a MUGA at Screening. For patients ≥ [ADDRESS_1080085] pain, or clinically 
significant  atrial  and/or  ventricular  arrhythmias,  a cardiac stress tests must  be performed  showing LVEF  ≥ 45%;  and if any wall movement  abnormalities  are present,  they 
must be reversible.  
q. Pulmonary  evaluation  using spi[INVESTIGATOR_785045].  Patients  who are unable  to conduct  reliable  pulmonary  function test measurements  due to 
abnormal anatomy may undergo a [ADDRESS_1080086] to evaluate pulmonary  function.  
r. C T scans are required at Screening and Baseline (Day - 21 to Day - 9). MRI or PET scans will be allowed in lieu of CT scans for patients who have an intolerability to 
contrast media. If scans have been performed within [ADDRESS_1080087] or MRI scans  (for patients  with intolerance  to contrast  media)  should  be per disease history  and clinical  symptoms  (repeat  the same CT and MRI  series  for all post-treatment  tumor 
assessments [scheduled and unscheduled] as completed at Baseline [Day -21 to Day -9]). Include a neck scan if there is prior or suspected neck disease. The imaging modality  and anatomic regions  assessed  must  be kept the same for all assessments  while  on study.  At the Investigator’s  discretion,  the Baseline MRI and CT scans  may be 
performed as early as Day - 21. Brain MRI should not be repeated at baseline if negative at  screening.

x. Initiate  IL-[ADDRESS_1080089]-145 infusion  to allow  for proper  management  of IL-2 toxicity,  if necessary.  y. Pulse  oximetry  is 
to be conducted during IL -2 administration.  
z. P
atients  will receive filgrastim  5 µg/kg/day (recommended  maximum  dose of 300 µg/day)  subcutaneously daily  starting  from Day 1 until the ANC  is > 1000/mm3 for [ADDRESS_1080090] of care for patients undergoing chemothera py-induced immunosuppression. Such 
prophylaxis  may include  any of the following (below)  and should begin  on or after their first day of chemotherapy,  or as the Investigator  deems  appropriate,  and continue 
until the ALC is > 1000 cells/mm3 (approximately 3 –6 months), or as per institutional standard of care. One acceptable regimen includes trimethoprim (TMP) and 
sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as double strength (DS) tab (DS tabs = TMP 160 mg/tab, and SMX 800 mg/tab) (PO) twice daily three time s a we ek on non-consecutive days, 
beginning on the first Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Pentamidine may be substituted for TMP/SMX DS in patients with sulfa all ergies and may be administered either

Protocol  Version  8.[ADDRESS_1080091]  doses  indicated  for PJP prophylaxis.  Other  appropriate  PJP prophylactic  agents  may be substituted  at the discretion  of the 
treating Investigator.  
bb. Patients will start fluconazole 400 mg (PO) from Day 1, or when patients become neutropenic, and continue until the  ANC is > 1000/mm3. Another suitable fungal 
prophylaxis  regimen  as per standard  of care at the treating  institution  may also be used for the duration  of Grade  3 neutropenia.  In patients,  positive  for HSV,  herpes 
prophylaxis should begin by [CONTACT_2006] 7, or as the Investigator deems appropriate and continue until the ALC is > 1000/mm3 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_785031] 6 months).  
cc. Patients with positive HSV serology should begin herpes reactivation prophylaxis (typi[INVESTIGATOR_785046]) by [CONTACT_2006] 14, or as the Inves tigator deems 
appropriate,  and continue  until the ALC  is > 1000/mm3 (approximately  3-6 months),  or as per institutional  standard  of care.  Other  appropriate  viral prophylactic  agents 
may be substituted at the discretion of the treating Investigator.  
dd. Mandatory peripheral  blood will be collected  at timepoints  of Surgery/Tumor  resection,  Day 1 for immune monitoring (biomarker  analysis).  Collection  timepoints: 
Week  6 (Day  42), Week  12 (Day  84), Month [ADDRESS_1080092] ops at the EOS, where EOS = death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, study termination by 
[CONTACT_2728] -Investigator, or Month 36, whichever occurs first. Patients will be called every 3 Months (± 3 weeks) after the assessment pe riod until they reach an  EOS 
designation.

14.3. Calculation of BMI,  BSA,  Practical  Weight,  and Ideal  Body  Weight  
Unless otherwise specified in this protocol, actual body weight is used for dose calculations of 
treatment  agents.  In patients  who  are determined  to be obese (BMI  > 35.0 kg/m2), the practical 
weight will be used. 
BMI  
 
 
 
BSA  BMI  = weight (kg)/[height  (m)]2 
 
 
BSA  = 0.007184 x height (cm)0.725 x weight (kg)0.425 
 
Practical  Weight  
Practical  body weight (average of the actual  weight  and ideal  body weight) is to be used when 
dosing cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in patients who have a BMI > 35.0 kg/m2. 
Note:  Practical  weight will NOT  be used  in the calculation  of dose for IL-2. 
Ideal  Body Weight  
Female  = 45.5 kg + 2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches)  
Example:  ideal  body weight of 5’3’’female 45.5 + 2.3 x (3) = 57 kg

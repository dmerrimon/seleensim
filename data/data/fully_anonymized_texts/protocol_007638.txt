 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Chemotherapy for Mesothelioma  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an uncommon tumor afflicting up to 3,[ADDRESS_340560] to 
response rates (41 vs. 17%), time to progression (6 vs. 4 months), and overall survival (12 vs. 9 
months) (1). T he combination of pemetrexed and carboplatin is a reasonable alternative for 
patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin based on results from large phase II trials and the expanded 
access experience showing comparable response rates and survival times (2 -4).  
1.[ADDRESS_340561] argued that if a patient’s cancer is 
controlled and the toxicities of the treatment are manageable, then discontinuation of the therapy will only result in earlier tumor regrowth. On the other hand, solid tumors ultimately reach a 
response plateau at which time additional chemotherapy does not result in further tumor 
shrinkage. Furthermore, continuation of chemotherapy for prolonged periods results in 
cumulative toxicities.  
The experience in non- small cell lung cancer highlights this issue with several clinical trials 
designed to address the optimal duration of chemotherapy. In one study, pa tients with advanced 
NSCLC were randomized to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin for four cycles, or to continue 
that treatment until disease progression (5). No difference in survival, response rate, or quality 
of life was observed between the two study arms, yet patients on the continuation arm developed more peripheral neuropathy. Indeed, a meta -analysis presented at the ASCO [ADDRESS_340562] on overall survival (HR 
0.94, p=0.10) (6). Current treatment guidelines for advanced NSCLC recommend four to six cycles of first -line platinum based chemotherapy and then monitoring for progression.  
Another app roach involves the use of a non- cross resistant regimen after completion of first -line 
therapy. The question becomes an issue of timing —does immediate treatment with a second -
line regimen improve outcomes, or should patients be allowed to recover from the first regimen 
and restart chemotherapy at the time of progression? One trial also presented at the ASCO [ADDRESS_340563] stable disease after completion of four cycles of platinum -based chemotherapy were 
randomized to receive pemetrexed or placebo (7). Treatment with pemetrexed not only improved PFS from 2 to 4 months, but also improved median overall survival from 10 to 13 
months. These results may be confounded by [CONTACT_70020], however, since only 12% of patients on the placebo arm ultimately received pemetrexed as second -line therapy. For 
comparison, another phase III study randomized NSCLC patients to treatment with delayed vs. immediate second -line therapy with docetaxel (8). While PFS was markedly improved with 
immediate docetaxel from 2.8 to 6.5 months (p<0.0001), only a trend toward improved survival was observed (9.1 to 11.9 months, p=0.07).  Nonetheless, when the data from the pemetrexed 
maintenance trial were added to the meta -analysis described above, the favorable effect of 
maintenance chemotherapy on overall survival became significant with a HR of 0.92 and p=0.03 
(6).

 1.3 Rationale for Study Design 
This study aims to determine if continuing pemetre xed as “maintenance” therapy after treatment 
with a pemetrexed/platinum regimen will improve outcomes for patients with malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. This concept is based on several points: 1) Pemetrexed/cisplatin is a standard 
first-line regimen in MPM; 2) Maintenance pemetrexed improved PFS and OS in NSCLC with 
a relatively low rate of cumulative toxicity in that study; 3) A phase III trial in advanced MPM 
confirmed that treatment with pemetrexed as a second -line regimen resulted in improved 
progression free survival over best supportive care (although that trial was conducted in patients who had not received pemetrexed as part of their first -line therapy) (9); 4) A Dutch single arm 
study conducted in patients with mesothelioma who had at least stable d isease after 6 cycles of 
pemetrexed -based chemotherapy demonstrated that maintenance therapy with pemetrexed in 
patients with mesothelioma was well tolerated, resulted in some radiologic responses, and hinted 
at improved TTP and OS (10).  
In this proposed study, patients with MPM who have a response or stable disease after four to 
six cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin will be randomized to continued treatment with pemetrexed alone or to observation. At the time of progression, the choice of chemotherapy 
will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Many patients in the observation arm are likely to receive pemetrexed again which will help address the question regarding immediate vs. 
delayed therapy.  
1.4 Correlative Studies: Background  
1.4.1 Serum Markers  
The levels of soluble mesothelin related peptide (SMRP) and osteopontin were found to be 
elevated in patients with mesothelioma and may have a role as tumor markers (11,12).  In 
prior reports, the levels of these markers were compared with those in control patients including those with asbestos related non- malignant pulmonary disease. Data that is 
available regarding whether these markers can be used as an adjunct to monitoring the disease status (such as response to chemotherapy) or estimating prognosis (such as overall survival) in patients with MPM is limited (13 ). 
1.4.2 Tumor Thymidylate Synthase Expression and Analysis of Genetic Variants  
Pemetrexed exerts its activity through inhibition of folic acid metabolism. One of the 
enzymes critical in this metabolism is thymidylate synthase. It has been hypothesized that 
tumors over -expressing thymidylate synthase may not respond to pemetrexed as well as 
tumors having low expression of this enzyme (14). 
Expression of thymidylate synthase will be determined by [CONTACT_279059]. In addition, DNA will be extracted from whole blood 
collected for the analysis of genetic variants in the TYMS, DPYD, and MTHFR genes. These variants have been shown to affect the efficacy of therapeutics targeting thymidylate synthase (15).

 1.4.3 N ovel Radiologic Techniques to Monitor Response  
Tumor measurement in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma has been notoriously 
challenging. Rather than a rounded tumor mass that can be measured in one or two dimensions (as in lung tumors), mesotheli oma spreads as a sheet along the pleura. This has 
led investigators to measure the pleural thickness as a surrogate. A “modified RECIST” 
system has been “qualified/validated” in which pleural thickness is measured at reproducible 
levels and the sum of the thickness measurements is used to assess response to therapy (16).  
This process remains suboptimal, especially in terms of reproducibility and assessment of tumor burden. 
Pass et al. have demonstrated that preoperative tumor volume is representative of T status 
in MPM and predictive of overall and progression- free survival as well as po stoperative 
stage. Large volumes are associated with nodal spread and post resection residual tumor burden may predict outcome (17). However, lack of automated/semi -automated tools to the 
identification and measurement of tumor volumes prevents further validation of such critical 
clinical findings as well as clinical use of the volumetric technique in the diagnosis of 
mesothelioma and assessment of therapeutic response.  
[CONTACT_279078] and [CONTACT_279079], radiologists at Memorial Sloan -Kettering 
Cancer Center, have developed a three- dimensional (3D) computer method to assist in 
separation of tumor volume of MPM from its surrounding normal organs/tissues on CT images. By [CONTACT_18120] a priori knowledge and modeling relevant normal anatomical 
structures, they have developed a novel segmentation strategy to sequentially dissect MPM from its surrounding organs/tissues including chest wall, liver, spleen and lung parenchyma. 
A mathematical modeling method is used to obtain the thoracic volume by [CONTACT_2359] a 
parabolic curve model to interpolate disconnected chest ribs on the coronal images and an 
arc interpolation algorithm to interpolate disconnected chest ribs on the axial images. An 
optimal combination of the two thoracic volumes enclosed with the connected chest ribs on 
the two view images will create a final thoracic volume (18). Internal organs such as the liver and spleen are automatically detected and segmented using a Gradient Vector Flow  
(GVF) snake technique that was developed for segmen tation of the liver volume in a liver 
CAD project (19). In the thorax and the abdomen where relevant organs are segmented and removed, MPM can be separated using a thresholding method .  
To correlate with clinical outcomes, this algorithm was retrospectivel y applied to two 
mesothelioma clinical trials in which the patients were treated with induction chemotherapy 
followed by [CONTACT_279060]. The clinical characteristics and outcome from [ADDRESS_340564] in calculating tumor volumes on baseline and 2 follow -up scans (cycles 2 and 4 of 
chemotherapy). Overall survival was measured using a landmark time at three months post treatment start date such that all patients had already received 2 and 4 cycles of 
chemotherapy. The percent change of tumor volume from baseline to 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy was significantly associated with overall survival (Hazard Ratio: 1.90 (95% 
CI: 1.02 – 3.55), p=0.04).

5.2.4 Registration to Companion Studies  
Ther 
e are two substudies within CALGB [ZIP_CODE]. All patients will be registered to the 
imaging study (CALGB 580903) at the time of registration to the treatment trial, however, 
only randomized patients will participate in the imaging study. The correlative sc ience study 
(CALGB 150912) must be offered to all patients registered to CALGB [ZIP_CODE] (although 
patients may opt to not participate). However, submission of samples is required only for 
those patients who are randomized.  
These substudies do not require sep arate IRB approval. The substudies included within 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] are: • CALGB 150912 - Correlative studies in pts on CALGB [ZIP_CODE] ( Section 6.2.1
) 
• CALGB 580903 - Imaging study in pts on CALGB [ZIP_CODE] ( Section 6.3) 
The instructions for submitting specimens for the correlative science companion substudy 
are in Section 6.2 ; the imaging study is in Section 6.3 . 
If a patient answers “yes” to “My specimen(s) may be used for the genetic research 
described above,” question #1 and/or “I agree that my specimen(s) may be used for the research studies described above,” question #[ADDRESS_340576] consente d 
to participate in the correlative substudy described in Section 15

Patients assigned  to the treatment arm will receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV over 10 minutes (or 
per institutional guidelines) every three weeks. Patients will continue treatment until disease 
progression or excess toxicity. At the time of disease progression, the choice of  therapy is left to the 
physician’s discretion. 
Pemetrexed Premedications:  
Folic Acid:  Oral folic acid (0.35 - 1 mg/day) starting at least [ADDRESS_340591] dose of pemetrexed. 
Vitamin B 12: Vitamin B [ADDRESS_340592] dose of pemetrexed.

9.0 D OSE MODIFICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY 
The starting dose of pemetrexed is 500mg/m2, even if the patient required a pemetrexed dose 
reduction during platinum doublet therapy.  
If multiple toxicities are evident and more than one of the dose modifications applies, use the most 
stringent dose reduction (i.e., the greatest dose reduction). Dose may not be re -escalated once it has 
been reduced.  
9.1 Dose Levels for Pemetrexed  
Treatment should be discontinued in patients requiring a dose level reduction beyond level -2. 
Dose levels for pemetrexed are below.

9.2 Pemetrexed Guidelines for Dose Modification and Management of Toxicity  
9.2.1 GI Toxicity  
Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_279047] a cycle:  Delay pemetrexed until diarrhea resolves to 
≤ grade 2. Resume pemetrexed when diarrhea resolves to ≤ grade 2 at one dose level lower 
than the previous dose for all subsequent cycles. If diarrhea has not improved to ≤ grade 2 
within 3 weeks, discontinue pe metrexed.  
Grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis despi[INVESTIGATOR_279048] a cycle:  Delay pemetrexed and resume when mucositis resolves to ≤ grade 2 at one 
dose level lower than the previous dose for all subsequent cycles. If oral mucositis has not 
improved to ≤ grade 2 within 3 weeks, discontinue pemetrexed therapy. 
9.2.2 Hematologic Toxicity  
For ANC <1,500 or platelets <100,000 on day 1, delay treatment with pemetrexed until 
ANC ≥1,500 and platelets ≥100,000, then resume pemetrexed at one dose level lower for 
all subsequent doses. If treatment is delayed for ≥ 3 weeks, discontinue all protocol 
treatment.  
For febrile neutropenia  occurring at any time during a cycle, decrease pemetrexed by [CONTACT_279069].  
9.2.3 Calculated CrCl < 45 ml/min 
If creatinine clearance is < 45 ml/min, delay pemetrexed until CrCl ≥45 ml/min. When CrCl 
improves to ≥ 45 ml/min, resume pemetrexed at the previous doses. If CrCl remains < 45 
ml/min at 3 weeks, discontinue pemetrexed the rapy. 
9.2.4 Clinically Significant Effusions 
For patients who develop clinically significant pleural or pericardial effusions (on the basis 
of symptoms of physical examination) during therapy, consideration should be given to 
draining the effusion prior to the next dose of pemetrexed. However, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_70053], if the effusion represents progression of disease, the patient should 
discontinue protocol therapy.  
9.2.5 Skin Toxicity  
Grade 3 or 4:  For grade 4 skin toxicity, discontinue pemetrexed. For Grade 3, hold 
pemetrexed until toxicity improves to ≤ grade 1, then resume pemetrexed at the previous dose level. For recurrent grade 3 skin toxicity, hold pemetrexed until toxicity improves to ≤ 
grade 1, then resume pemetrexed with one dose level reduction. If pemetrexed is held for 
skin toxicity for 3 weeks, discontinue pemetrexed.

 9.2.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions 
For grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions or anaphylaxis thought to be due to pemetrexed, 
discontinue pemetrexed.  
9.2.7 Other Non -Hematologic Grade 3 Toxicity  
Excluding fatigue and anorexia:  Hold pemetrexed until toxicity improves to       ≤ grade 
2, then resume pemetrexed with one dose level reduction. If pemetrexed is held for 3 weeks, discontinue therapy with pemetrexed. 
For recurrent other non -hematologic grade 3 toxicity:  Discontinue all protocol therapy.

Discontinue pemetrexed therapy.  
9.[ADDRESS_340594] of treatment of obese patients when dosing is 
performed according to actual body weight. Therefore, all dosing is to be determined solely 
by (1) the patient’s BSA as calculated from actual weight or (2) actual weight without any 
modification unless  explicitly described in the protocol. This will minimize the risk of 
calculation error and the possible introduction of variability in dose administration. Failure to 
use actual body weight in the calculation of drug dosages will be considered a major 
protocol deviation. Physicians who are uncomfortable with administering chemotherapy dose 
based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients on Alliance  protocols.  
10.0 D
RUG FORMULATION , AVAILABILITY , AND PREPARATION  
• Qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
themselves and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal 
of chemotherapeutic agents in a self -contained, protective environment. 
• Discard unused portions of injectable chemotherapeutic agents that do not contain a bacteriostatic agent or are prepared with unpreserved diluents (i.e., Sterile Water for Injection 
USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection USP) within eight hours of vial entry to minimize 
the risk of  bacterial contamination.  
• The total administered dose of chemotherapy may be rounded up or down within a range of 5% 
of the actual calculated dose. 
• It is not necessary to change the doses of any of the agents used in this trial unless the calculated 
dose changes by ≥ 10%. 
10.1 Pemetrexed (Alimta®)  
Please refer to the FDA approved package insert for additional information  
Availability  
Pemetrexed is available commercially as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single- use 
vials containing [ADDRESS_340595] vials of pemetrexed should be stored at room temperature. The reconstituted and further diluted solutions for infusions are stable for up to 24 hours when refrigerated or stored at room 
temperature.  
Preparation 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
25 
 
NCI Version Date 12/03/18         Update #06  
 Each 500 mg of pemetrexed is reconstituted with 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, 
resulting in a concentration of 25 mg/mL. The desired dose should be withdrawn and further 
diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, for IV infusion. 
Administration 
Pemetrexed will be administered as a [ADDRESS_340596] common toxicities reported with pemetrexed to date include myelosuppression, GI 
toxicities, rash and fatigue. Neutropenia is more common than thrombocytopenia, and it is 
minimized with vitamin supplementation. Specifically, folic acid and Vitamin B12 starting 
before pemetrexed and continuing throughout pemetrexed therapy are recommended. It is thought that severe pemetrexed toxicity is due to a subclini cal folate deficiency, as may be 
documented by [CONTACT_279070]. Similarly, diarrhea and mucositis are also minimized with the use of folic acid and B12. Single agent pemetrexed was associated with 
nausea and vomiting in approximately 30% of  patients. In the majority of patients, nausea and 
vomiting were ≤ grade 2 severity. The incidence and severity of pemetrexed -induced rash 
appears to be decreased with the administration of dexamethasone, beginning the day before pemetrexed. Fatigue, grade 1- 3 severity, is also common.  
Drug Interactions  
As is the case with methotrexate, the potential exists for various drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, probenecid, salicylates, sulfonamides) to delay pemetrexed renal clearance and increase toxicity.

12.0 C RITERIA FOR RESPONSE, PROGRESSION  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every six weeks (2 cycles) for 6 months, 
then every 9 weeks (3 cycles) for 6 months and then every 12 weeks (4 cycles) until disease progression for a maximum of [ADDRESS_340597] four weeks following initial documentation of 
objective response.  
12.1 Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). 
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension as ≥ [ADDRESS_340598] be ≥  [ADDRESS_340599] be 
recorded in millimeters. A sum of the diameters (long diameter (LD) for all non nodal target 
lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. 
The baseline sum of all diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective 
tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
In patients with pleural mesothelioma the typi[INVESTIGATOR_279049] “rind” should be measured on [ADDRESS_340600] wall on a given cut. Each 
level should be measured in two different places (please see fig 1). The three rind thicknesses 
should be recorded for a given level and compared on subsequent scans. Clear anatomic 
landmarks should be recorded carefully to ensure consistency from scan to scan. At least one 
level should have a measurement ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_340601] been previously validated in patients with mesothelioma

12.1.4 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters since the treatment

be listed with stable disease.  
12.2 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not included in the “target disease” definition should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not 
required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent.” 
12.2.1 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

more non -target lesion and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the upper limits 
of normal.

TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Background and Rationale for Update #4  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] was activated on 4/15/2010. In the original protocol design ([ZIP_CODE]-01, [ZIP_CODE]-
02 and [ZIP_CODE]-03), we assumed that arm A  (observation) w ould produce a median PFS of 3 
months during the maintenance phase. Arm B  (experimental) w ould have a 67% improvement 
in median PFS to [ADDRESS_340612] ratio λ A/λB= 
1.67. With 90 eligible patients (45 per arm) randomized to Arm A and Arm B with  a 1:[ADDRESS_340613] patient, the study had approximately 86% to reject 
the null hypothesis λ A/λB = 1 when the true λ A/λB= 1.[ADDRESS_340614] at a 1 -sided

 significance level of 0.10. With an allowance of 5% ineligibility/cancellation rate, a m aximum 
of 96 (90 eligible) patients, or 48 (45 eligible) per arm, were  to be accrued.  
As of November 18, 2014, [ADDRESS_340615] 
ratio λ A/λB = 2. We believe that a [ADDRESS_340616] been observed. As a result, a maximum of 63 
patients (60 eligible) after achieving stable disease from the first line chemotherapy will be randomized. The valuable data  collected from this randomize d phase II trial will help us to 
decide if a randomized phase III trial is worthy to pursue in the future. 
14.[ADDRESS_340617] -line regimen (cisplatin vs. carboplatin) and histologic subtype 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_279042]. other) and randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B with 1:1 allocation using a permutated block scheme (20). Arm A will be  monitored for progression. Arm B will continue 
on chemotherapy with pemetrexed until disease progression. All patients will be followed for a maximum of [ADDRESS_340618]. An interim analysis is planned when accrual reaches 28 events 
(or 50% of information). Secondary objectives include (1) to determine if maintenanc e therapy 
with pemetrexed improves overall survival; (2) to evaluate frequency of responses to 
maintenance therapy with pemetrexed; (3) to assess toxicity of maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed; (4) to assess whether biomarkers correlate with disease statu s; and (5) to determine 
the association between volumetric measurement of tumor response and usual methods of 
modified RECIST criteria.  
CT scans will be performed in both arms every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 
months and then every 12 we eks until disease progression for a maximum of 3 years from the 
date of randomization. The choice of chemotherapy regimen at the time of progression is at the 
discretion of the physician. Specifically, patients in Arm A would be allowed to receive 
treatment with pemetrexed at that time.  
14.3 Sample Size Determination  
In a recent phase III trial, treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a median progression free survival (PFS) of 6 months and median overall survival (OS) of 12 months (1).  For the purpos e 
of sample size determination, we assume that (i) arm A will produce a median PFS of [ADDRESS_340619] a 67% improvement in median PFS to 5 months. Under constant hazards, this corresponds to a 3 month PFS of 50% for A rm A and 66% for the 
experimental arm (Arm B) and a hazard ratio λ
A/λB= 1.67; (ii) 90 eligible patients (45 per arm)

 will be randomized to Arm A and Arm B with 1:1 allocation; (iii) an accrual rate of [ADDRESS_340620] 
patient; (iv) a planned look at 50% information. Using a log rank test at a 1- sided significance 
level of 0.10, the study has approximately 86% power to reject the null hypothesis λ A/λB = 1 and 
accept the alternative hypothesis λ A/λB > 1 when the true λ A/λB = 1.67. We will closely monitor 
the first 12 randomized patients on Arm B for treatment related adverse events. If 4 or more out of the 12 patients develop grade 3 or higher drug related adverse events, the study team will 
either recommend a reduction in the starting dose or permanently terminate the study.  
14.3.1 Amended Sample Size Determination (Effective 01/15/15) 
In a recent phase III trial, treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a median progression 
free survival (PFS) of 6 months and median overall survival (OS) of 12 months (1).  For the 
purpose of sample size determination, we assume that (i) arm A will produce a median PFS 
of [ADDRESS_340621] a 100% improvement in median 
PFS to 6 months. Under constant ha zards, this corresponds to a 3 month PFS of 50% for 
Arm A and 70.7% for the experimental arm (Arm B) and a hazard ratio λ
A/λB= 2; (ii) 60 
eligible patients (30 per arm) will be randomized to Arm A and Arm B with 1:1 allocation; (iii) an registration rate o f [ADDRESS_340622] patient; (iv) a planned look at 50% information. Using a log rank test at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.10, the study has approximately 91% power to

true λA/λB = 2.

and to randomize 96 patients. Once 96 patients (90 eligible) have been accrued, a notice suspending accrual will be issued to the Group via an e- mail broadcast announcing terminat ion 
of accrual effective within [ADDRESS_340624] recent mesothelioma trials (CALGB [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]) accrued 5- [ADDRESS_340625] target accrual will be met after approximately 3 years.

approximately an additional 20 months after Update #[ADDRESS_340629] 2 8 cumulative events (50% 
information) on both arms. As of November 18, a total of [ADDRESS_340630] been observed. Since

then trial will be terminated early at the interim analysis for futility (i.e., the experimental arm 
will be considered ineffective in this disease population) and the results will be reported. If the 
observed hazard ratio of the experimental arm relative to the standard arm is less than 1.0, then the trial will continue to the full target accrual. Early stopp ing for futility using this rule is found 
to result in minimal loss of power (less than 2%) for the primary hypothesis test (21 ). 
The primary analysis will include all randomized patients but exclude ineligible patients or 
patients who are canceled from th e study before receiving any protocol treatment. 
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to disease progression or death of any cause, whichever comes first. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from 
registration to  death of any cause. The primary analysis of comparing the patients continued on 
chemotherapy with pemetrexed (Arm B) relative to the patients discontinued from chemotherapy (Arm A) will be conducted using one -sided stratified log rank test with a 
significance level of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_340632] limit estimator developed by [CONTACT_279072] (22). From these product limit estimates, median PFS, median OS, 3- month PFS, 
12-month OS rate and their 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for patients randomized 
to each arm. Cox proportional hazards model (23) will be used to estimate the hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the experimental regimen relative to the control group with 
and without adjusting for baseline prognostic factors. As an exploratory analysis, survival 
endpoints of the two arms will be compared using log rank test (24). The frequency of best response (CR+PR) to each arm will be tabulated and its 95% exact binomial confidence intervals 
will be computed. Response rates (including complete and partial response) will be tested using 
Fisher’s exact test (25).  Gender, race and ethnicity will be analyzed as covariates and  these 
results will be reported. Frequencies of toxicities will be tabulated for patients on maintenance therapy with pemetrexed.  
14.6 Statistical Consideration for Correlative Sciences  
The correlation of PFS and OS with serum biomarkers, soluble mesothelin related peptide 
(SMRP) and osteopontin, and their changes with treatment will be examined using a log rank test for categorical variables and using Cox’s proportional hazard model for continuous variables 
after adjusting for other prognostic factors. The optimal threshold for these biomarkers will be 
determined univariately using maximally selected log rank test with adjusted p -values. The 
correlation of PFS, OS, RR with thymidylate synthase expression will be examined similarly. The Mann -Whitney U test or Fisher’s exact test will be applied as appropriate to assess 
differences or proportions of genetic data for TYMS, DPYD and MTHFR genes. Tumor 
response classification using volumetric measurement will be compared to usual methods of 
modified RECI ST criteria and the level of agreement will be obtained using the kappa statistic.

commercially available ELISA kits (R and D Systems; Mesomark). These will be carried out in 
the laboratory of  (University of Minnesota) as his laboratory has 
previously carried out on the serum of lung cancer patients.   
15.2 Tumor Tissue Expression of Thymidylate Synthase (TS)  
TS expression in tumor tissue will be assessed by [CONTACT_279073] (IHC) 
using commercially available monoclonal antibodies ( TS (2D8.D11) from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc.)  and automated IHC instrumentation. Determination of TS overexpression 
will be performed on unstained tumor tissue sections that have been placed onto glass slides. The Alliance Bioreposit ory at Ohio State  will provide five slides containing unstained sections 
for each case, which will be evaluated for TS expression and IHC control reactions.  
Paraffin embedded tissue sections are cut at 4 microns, deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated 
through graded alcohols and then rinsed in distilled water. The BiogGenex Antigen Retrieval 
procedure is carried out in a steamer under pressure.  The tissues are rinsed with distilled water 
and are subsequently rinsed with PBS after each step. They are treated with Peroxide block, 
Power block, Aviden, Biotin and are incubated with the primary antibody specific for the antigen to be demonstrated for 30- 60 minutes. Sections are then incubated with MultiLink antibody (a 
biotinylated anti- immunoglobulin in PBS )  and followed by [CONTACT_279074] 
(Perioxidase- conjungated streptavidin ). The antibody complex is then made visible by [CONTACT_279075] a chromogen substrate until adequate color development is seen. Slides are washed in water to stop the reaction, counterstained, dehydrated, cleared and mounted with an aqueous mountant. This procedure is performed using an automated staining protocol on the BioGenex  I6000 
autostainer with Biogenex reagents.

tumor volume (18). Mesothelioma tumor volumes have been associated with outcomes in one 
surgical study (17). In order to facilitate these studies, contrast enhanced CT scans at baseline, 
and subsequent 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_340636] will be used as the overall response in this

• Grade 3/4 myelosuppression and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279054]-
AERS, but should be submitted as part of study results. 
• Grade 3/4 diarrhea or mucositis and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279055]-AERS, but should be submitted as part of study results. 
• Reporting of cases of secondary AML/MDS is to be done using the NCI/CTEP Secondary 
AML/MDS Report Form. New primary malignancies should be reported using study form 
C-1001. 
• CTEP-AERS reports are to be submitted electronically using CTEP-AERS 
http://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov /ctepaers/ .  
• The reporting of adverse events described above is in addition to and does not supplant the 
reporting of adverse events as part of the report of the results of the clinical trial, e.g., st udy 
summary forms or cooperative group data reporting forms. 
• All adverse events reported via CTEP-AERS (i.e., serious adverse events) should also be 
forwarded to your local IRB. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression” in 
the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiologic al changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.

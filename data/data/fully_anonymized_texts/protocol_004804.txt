Title of Study : A Phase 1 Study of HDAC Inhibitor Panobinostat  (LBH 589)  Administered in Combination with 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79202]: Advanced Melanoma  
 
Estimated Number of Study Centers and Countries/Regions: 1 site in the [LOCATION_002] – Moffitt Cancer 
Center  
 Study Phase: 1 
 
Research Hypothesis: 
We hypothesize that addition of a pan -HDAC inhibitor Panobinostat  will be well 
tolerated and augment the clinical efficacy of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].   
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, and immunoregulatory 
(pharmacodynamic; PD) activity of  Panobinostat  administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti- CTLA4 
antibody) to subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.  
 Primary Objective:  
• To define the safety, tolerability, dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Panobinostat administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79203]:  
• To describe the preliminary anti -tumor activity of panobinostat  administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79204]  
• To monitor trough concentrations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79205]  
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of the combination dose regimen on biomarkers in 
peripheral blood samples and tumor biopsy specimens  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To explore potential relationships between panobinostat  exposure, biomarker measures, anti - tumor 
activity and adverse event, for the combination dose regimen  
 
Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation cohort study. The study will consist of a dose 
escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of  panobinostat  administered concurrently in combination 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79206]. Treatment will be divided into induction and maintenance 
phases.  
 It is anticipated that this clinical study will enable selection of the RP2D and dose schedule of this combination 
for further clinical testing. The trial will include an assessment of the PD activity of panobinostat  administered in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. A study schematic is presented below:  
 Each treatment cycle will be 42 days (6 weeks) dur ing the induction phase, and 84 days (12 weeks) during the 
maintenance phase. Panobinostat  will be administered orally thrice weekly (TIW)  on Days 1- 42 of each 42 -day 
treatment cycle. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79207] (IV) over [ADDRESS_86561] for 2 treatment cycles. During the maintenance phase, panobinostat 
will be administered orally thrice weekly on Days 1 -84 of each 84 day treatment cycle. Subjects will continue 
maintenance treatment with their panobinostat  dose regimen until progression of disease, discontinuation due to 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent or any other reason as specified in Section 3. 4. 
 
Dose escalation: This is a modification of the traditional 3+3 design.  Subjects will be enrolled in successive 
cohorts of 6. An initial cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled at the given dose level of panobinostat , and 
additional subjects will be added to the same dose level (eg, increase the total number of enrolled subjects f rom 3 
to 6, 9 or 12) based on a modified version of a toxicity probability interval (TPI) design. The modified TPI 
(mTPI) design uses Bayes rule in a decision theoretic framework to determine the MTD based on a pre- specified 
 2 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
target toxicity (eg, dose limiting toxicity; DLT) probability p T. A fixed total number of subjects will be used 
during the dose escalation portion for each arm. As the dose escalation proceeds under this design, the number of 
subjects enrolled at a given dose level depends on the number  of the toxicities observed at that dose such that 
multiples of [ADDRESS_86562] to the pre- specified target toxicity probability P
T. In this study, a tight 
18% target toxicity (P T) is used. 
 Dose escalation will evaluate panobinostat  at doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg thrice weekly administered in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_150] 3 mg/kg. The first cohort will receive panobinosta t orally at a dose of 5 
mg thrice weekly; ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79208] a dose of 3 mg/kg. Enrollment will proceed with administration of escalating doses of panobinostat  in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79209] 1 
below:

  Additional dose levels of panobinostat beyond [ADDRESS_86563] ed that all subsequent dose levels of panobinostat will be no more than 
33% higher than the preceding dose. If cohort [ADDRESS_86564] dose escalation . Decisions regarding dose escalation 
between individual dose levels will be guided by [CONTACT_79322] -related dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
occurring within 84 days (12 weeks; through Day 42 of induction cycle 2) of initiation of study therapy. This 
observation interval is based upon inclusion of the known median times to onset of common immune -related 
adverse events attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]
) and allows for a substantial amount of time for 
unexpected  toxicities with the combined administration of panobinostat  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79211]. Subjects who 
do not complete the DLT observation period for reasons other than drug -related toxicity will be replaced.  
 One of the following five decisions will be made at the end of the DLT period for each cohort of 3- 6 or more 
subjects if required based on the number of DLTs observed:  
 S: stay at the same dose and enroll a cohort of 3 more subjects at that dose E: escalate to the next higher dose by [CONTACT_79323] 3 more sub jects D: de- escalate to the lower dose, and enroll  3 more subjects at that dose, DU:  
declare the current dose as unacceptable and unsafe, de- escalate to the lower dose, and enroll 3 more subjects at 
the lower dose, or C: Study completed and dose is declar ed to be the MTD  
 Note that decisions S or E are allowed by [CONTACT_79324]. Decisions D or DU are based on evidence of exceeding predetermined toxicity.  
With a target toxicity r ate of 18%, allowing any dose with estimated P
T in the (17%, 19%) interval to be selected 
as the MTD in this study, and with a maximum fixed total of 12 subjects at the dose escalation phase in each arm, the algorithm for dose escalation decisions based on possible total number of subjects at each dose cohort is 
described in Table 3.2. 
 Based on the above design, escalation to the next higher dose level can occur if DLTs are observed in 0 of 3 or  1of 6 subjects, in up to 2 of 12 subjects, and so on. If DLTs are observed in a greater number of subjects and 
escalation is not yet permitted, additional subjects in cohorts of 3 will be enrolled at the same dose in order to better estimate the true DLT rate at that dose until either the dose is deemed safe and an escalation is allowed, the 
dose is deemed unacceptable and should not be used, or de- escalation is recommended, based on decision rules 
outlined in Table 3.2. At the end of the dose escalation phase, the MTD will be estimated by [CONTACT_79325] -based approach (eg logistic regression) using observed toxicities at all studied doses. 
 3 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86565] to the target toxicity,  PT, will be declared as 
the MTD.  
 
The dose escalation plan (see table above) uses a modified Ji design, with dose escalation decisions made 
every three patients.  The trial will enroll [ADDRESS_86566] 3 toxicities.  
 
De-escalation.  The dose escalation plan (Table 1 ) follows a simple order restriction, that is, each dose 
cohort is as hig h or higher in both doses compared to all lower cohorts.  While cohort -1 is below cohort 1, 
its relative unacceptable toxicity rate is  unclear.  If de- escalation from cohort 1 is needed, it will go to 
cohort -1.  As long as the decisions are to “stay” at the same dose, cohort -1 will be grown to match that of 
cohort 1, and then they will be alternated.  If for the same number of patients treated, the toxicity 
differential between them reaches 2, the other cohort will be dropped from further study.  It is possible that both cohorts could be considered “the MTD”.  In such an event, other features such as patient response would be used to determine which would be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).  If the MTD is a unique cohort, that will also be called the RP2D. 
 This phase I study design has tended to be applied to a fixed sample size of 30.  Due to the increased complexity of this combination -dose trial, we have chosen a sample size of 36.  
 
All available clinical and laboratory data, and the nature, time of onset and time to resolution of DLTs observed 
during dose escalation will be reviewed to determine whether an alternate dose schedule should be examined 
after consultation between the Investigators and [COMPANY_001] if needed. If agreed upon, the alternate s chedule will be 
identified by a protocol amendment and the MTD determined for the revised dose schedule.  
 In addition to the Investigator’s review of study data, the existing Moffitt Protocol Monitoring Committee ( PMC) 
will be utilized to advise on aggregate safety data from this study and more specifically to review all Grade 3 or greater immune -related adverse events (irAEs).  
 Dose Limiting Toxicity: For the purpose of guiding dose escalation decision making, hematologic and non-
hematologic (hepatic versus non -hepatic) DLT will be defined separately and will be determined based on the 
incidence, severity, and duration of study drug -related AEs occurring within 84 days (12 weeks; through Day 42 
of induction cycle 2) of initiation of study therapy. For the purposes of subject management, DLTs will lead to 
dose modification regardless of the cycle in which a DLT occurs (see Section 4.3. 6 for specific guidelines).  
 
Duration of Study : It is expected that approximately [ADDRESS_86567]’s end -of-treatment visit. The last visit is either 
[ADDRESS_86568] patient.  
 
Number of Subjects : A total of up to 36 subjects are expected to be treated on the study.  
 Study Population: Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age with a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of 
unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma and who meet the eligibility criteria (see Sections 3. 2.1 and 3.2.2) 
will participate in the study.  
 
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Panobinostat  is available as 5, 10 , 15, and 20 mg capsules and will be administered orally. 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79212] 5 mg/mL and will be administered intravenously (IV) as an 
infusion over 90 minutes. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79213]. Panobinostat  
will be administered at 5, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg thrice weekly in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79214] a dose of 3 mg/kg according to the dose schedule in Table 1. Panobinostat  doses beyond 20 mg PO TIW may be 
considered if appropriate as outlined under study design.  
. Study Assessments and Primary Endpoints : Subjects will be required to visit the investigator’s office or clinic 
for physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECOG performance status evaluation, adverse event 
 4 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
assessment, laboratory testing, pharmacodynamic (PD) sample collection, and administration of study drug as 
per the study schedule.  
• Safety Outcome Measures : All subjects who receive study drug therapy will be evaluated for safety. 
Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Triplicate 12 -lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 of induction cycle 1. Single 12- lead ECGs will be collected at 
screening, prior to dosing on Day 1 of all treatment cycles (with the exception  of induction cycle 1 as above)  and 
at the end of treatment .  
 Adverse events will be categorized using the most current version of MedDRA and adverse events and laboratory tests will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Hepatic adverse events (AST, ALT, T Bili)  will also be recorded relative to ULN. 
Immune-related adverse experiences (irAEs) among treated subjects will be specifically assessed as well.  
• Efficacy Measures: Tumor response will be determined for all subjects by [CONTACT_393] 1.1  (see Appendix 3) 
as well as by [CONTACT_44859] -related response criteria (irRC; see Appendix 4). RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_86569] management may be based on the irRC 
criteria, but for the purposes of reporting efficacy RECIT 1.1  criteria will be used . Assessments of tumor status 
will be made during screening, then at 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and subsequently every 12 weeks. Tumor assessments at the end -of-treatment (EOT) or [ADDRESS_86570]’s best overall response (BOR) will be assessed, and progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1  response criteria. Other endpoints are Objective response 
(OR) defined  as BOR outcome of CR or PR for  RECIST 1.1 , disease control (DC) defined as BOR outcome of 
CR, PR, or Stable Disease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 . Duration of response and duration of disease control will also be 
calculated.

Statistical Methods : 
Sample Size Determination:  
Dose Escalation: This is a Phase I dose escalation trial and the sample size at each dose depends on the observed 
toxicity. A total of 36 subjects at the dose -escalation phase allows sufficient number of subjects if needed, e.g. 
more than 6 subjects if dose -limiting toxicities are observed among 2 of 6 subjects, to bett er estimate the toxicity 
rates per dose, and more accurately determine the MTD. Cohorts of 3 subjects with possible expansions to 6, 9, or 12 subjects will be treated at each suggested dose level until MTD is defined.  
 
Statistical Analysis: Safety Analyses : All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_70244], preferred term, and dose and coded according to the most current version of MedDRA. The incidence of 
adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance. Vital signs and 
clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_2715]. Any significant physical examination findings and results of clinical laboratory tests will be listed. ECG listings will be evaluated by [CONTACT_79326], if present, will be listed. A separate listing and summary of all immune- related adverse events 
(irAE) and inflammatory events regardless of causality (IERC) will be provided. In addition, the irAE rate will be estimated and a 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the irAE and the grade 3 -4 GI irAE rate in 
each arm, based on the Clopper -Pearson method. The relationship between panobinostat  exposure/dose and 
adverse event may be explored graphically and appropriate mod el may be fit.  
 
Efficacy Analyses: Listings of tumor measurements will be provided by [CONTACT_79327]. Each 
individual subject’s best overall response (BOR) and progression free survival (PFS) will be listed based on 
RECIST 1.1  (all subjects during dose escalation and cohort expansion portions of the study).  
To describe the anti -tumor activity of panobiostat  administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) will be tabulated and estimated by 90% confidence interval s based on Clopper -Pearson 
method. Disease Control Rate (DCR) will be similarly summarized. Duration of response and duration of disease 
control will also be calculated for the subjects with such outcome, based on both efficacy criteria.  
 For all patients,  duration of response, and duration of disease control will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier method 
and with 95% confidence intervals based on both response criteria. Kaplan Meier plots will be provided for all time-to-event variables at the MTD of each arm, based on both response criteria.  We will also fit the survival 
function using a parametric survival approach, as this approach provides a more accurate estimate of the median PFS.  The above analyses will include subjects from the dose expansion as well as  subjects from the dose 
escalation portion who were treated at the MTD. Additional assessments eg, sensitivity analyses may be provided to assess clinical activity. The relationship between panobinostat  exposure/dose and clinical efficacy (e.g. tumor 
response based on both RECIST 1.1  criteria) may be explored graphically and appropriate model may be fit.

MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86581] Population Selection for the Study 
Since 1950, the global incidence of malignant melanoma has risen 690% while mortality rate 
increased by 165%. Even with the recent decline in the incidence of several cancers, the incidence of malignant melanoma is continuing to rise.
1 While overall survival has improved 
for early stage tumors because of early detection and improved surgical treatment, recurrent and/or metastatic malignant melanoma remains largely a fatal disease. High -dose interferon 
alfa-2b (IFN) is currently approved by [CONTACT_79328] (FDA) for use as 
adjuvant therapy in patients with high risk of relapse. Treatment with high-dose IFN is, however, associated with only 10% improvement in recurrence-free survival, 0-10% 
improvement in overall survival and very significant toxicities that limit compliance with its 
use
.2,3,4 Dacarbazine, an FDA and EU approved chemotherapeutic agent for metastatic 
melanoma, provides an objective tumor response in only 5% to 20% of patients. These responses are short-lived (median duration of response = 6 months), and there is no associated increase in survival.
5 High-dose IL-2 therapy is also approved for use in the 
metastatic setting. However, significant toxicity limits its clinical utility. Fotemustine, with an 
overall response rate of 15%, [ADDRESS_86582] 30 years many chemotherapeutic drugs, including the aggressive Dartmouth combination regimen (dacarbazine, cisplatin, carmustine, and tamoxifen)
[ADDRESS_86583] demonstrated that tumors in 40 to 
60% of subjects harbor activating mutations in BRAF. The V600E mutation is most common and accounts for greater that 80% of all mutations seen in BRAF.
11-13 Suppression of 
activating BRAF mutations in human melanoma cells results in inhibition of the MAPK/ERK cascade causing growth arrest and promoting apoptosis.
14,[ADDRESS_86584] provided a strong scientific rationale for RAF as an important target in melanoma. Several selective RAF and MEK small molecule inhibitors are being tested at present in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Among these, R05185426 (PLX4032, Vemurafenib), a selective inhibitor of V600E mutant B-RAF kinase, has already demonstrated significant antitumor 
activity and high response rates in B-RAF V600E mutation positive melanoma subjects in 
Phase [ADDRESS_86585] established B-RAF inhibition as a

chance to benefit from a B -RAF inhibitor.  
As is outlined in Section 1.4.1 below, panobinostat is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
histone deacetylase (HDAC)19-24. Pre-clinical data from  laboratory 
at Moffitt indicate that HDAC inhibitors including LHB589 have unexpected activity as 
immunomodulatory agents, with impact on the in vitro activity of antigen presenting cells, 
decreased immune-inhibiting cytokines from tumor cell lines, and decreased immune 
inhibition of effector T cells. Additional work in his laboratory has shown that in in vivo animal models of the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma, addition of panobinostat can augment the clinical benefit of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Data from other laboratories, including  
 showed that the addition of a pan-HDAC inhibitor (LAQ824) 
augmented the anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred cytolytic T cells that were melanoma antigen -specific

of melanoma, and in some (<1%) immunocompetent patients the primary melanoma lesions

[ADDRESS_86588] and tumor, suggesting that the ability of the tumor to evade the immune response can be an important determinant of the clinical course 
of the disease.
20 Immunologic interventions to treat cancer can potentially be achieved 
through the induction of an immune response (active immunotherapy), administration of 
antibodies (passive immunotherapy), and/or stimulation of effector cells with cytokines or antibodies (immunostimulation). These approaches have resulted in the therapeutic use of immune- modulating agents such as IFN-α and IL-[ADDRESS_86589], IFN- α has also been demonstrated to stimulate natural 
killer (NK) cell activity and to regulate the expression of histocompatibility antigens or tumor- associated antigens.
27 Similarly, IL -2 modulates the immune sy stem by [CONTACT_79329] T lymphocytes, human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)- restricted or - 
non-restricted cytotoxic T cells and induces the production of many cytokines, such as tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF), IFN-γ and IL-1.28  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], an antibody that abrogates the 
regulatory activity of cytotoxic -T lymphocyte antigen -4 (CTLA-4) on T cells and augments T 
cell proliferation, lytic activity and secretion of IL-2, has been shown to have anti-tumor 
activity in melanoma, renal cell cancer an d other histologies 29-32.

with a peptide vaccine compared with vaccine alone have been described, showing that

MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79218] p rolongs survival in previously treated patients with advanced 
melanoma compared to the control arm.35 The median OS for patients receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79219] a peptide vaccine was 10.1 and 10.0 months, respectively, compared with 6.4 
months for the v accine-alone control arm  (P = .003 and P < .001, and hazard ratios of 0.66 
and 0.68, compared with vaccine alone). In that trial, the rate of grades 3-4 dose limiting side 
effects was 8.1%, with the majority of events being immune related adverse events (i rAEs) 
related to the immune mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Predominant events were skin related, colitis, hypophysitis and hepatitis. Virtually all dose limiting and other toxicities 
were reversible with the use of systemic steroids or in rare cases t he TNF blocking antibody 
Infliximab.  Recently, the results of a large placebo- controlled phase III study in [ADDRESS_86590]-line DTIC with or without ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (10 mg/kg) were presented and 
published
10. In that trial, survival was prolonged in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+DTIC containing arm 
compared to chemotherapy alone with p=0.[ADDRESS_86591] ratio of 0.72 favoring 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+DTIC. Median survivals in that trial were 11.[ADDRESS_86592] -line 
trial confirmed that incidence of irAEs was indeed dose related but also determined by [CONTACT_79331][INVESTIGATOR_79220], since in that trial grades 3 -4 colitis was uncommon, at less than 6 %, 
grades 3-4 hypophysitis was not seen, but elevated ALT/AST was  quite common, observed 
in 18-21% of patients in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+DTIC cohort. Of note is that grades 3-4 elevation of ALT/AST has been seen at a rate of 2% or less in trials of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 or 10 mg/kg alone. Nonetheless, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 mg/kg was felt to be well tolerated with DTIC, and when 
tested alone, dose limiting irAEs were observed in approximately 20% of patients
33-34. As in 
the second line trial at 3 mg/kg described above, at a dose of 10 mg/kg, virtually all 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79221]-blocking antibody infliximab.  No treatment related deaths were observed in the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + DTIC group. Two additional trials provide further support of the likelihood that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg will be well tolerated with another immune modulator In a trial of high dose interleukin 2 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the drugs were given at a dose of 720,000 IU/kg and 
3 mg/kg respectively repetitively
36. The overall irAE rate of 14% was similar to that for 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79217] 3 mg/kg, and no treatment related deaths were reported, but a 22% ORR 
was described. Tarhini et al described follow -up data of from 36 patients in a trial conducted 
with the other CTLA -4 antibody from [COMPANY_007], tremelimumab at 15 mg/kg, administered 
concurrently with high dose interferon alpha 2b37. In that trial, grade 3-4 dose limiting colitis 
was seen in 14% of patients, and grade 3-[ADDRESS_86593] in 11%, not different than that seen 
with tremelimumab alone at that dose. These data suggest that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_150] 3 
mg/kg will be well tolerated, and that given the collective expertise of the principal and co -
investigators of this trial with the drug, the risk of significant and dose limiting side effects with the combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79222]589 will be minimized.  
  Considered together, the observations summarized above suggest that a therapeutic regimen combining a HDAC inhibiting agent capable of immune modulation with an immune-
stimulating agent design ed to potentiate the host antitumor response would be a rational, 
novel and well tolerated approach for the treatment of melanoma. It is likely that a HDAC 
inhibitor such as panobinostat could potentiate the antitumor immune response induced by 
[CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_79223], decreasing levels 
of immune suppressive cytokines, increasing APC’s function and enhancingT-cell responses by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_79224] (ie, EOMES). A careful phase I dose 
escalating trial is planned to evaluate biologic endpoints as well as the toxicity of the 
combination regimen.

1.2 Research Hypothesis 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, and immunoregulatory 
(pharmacodynamic; PD ) activity of panobinostat administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti-CTLA4 antibody) to subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. We will test the hypothesis that panobinostat administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79225] l tolerated and that the addition of panobinostat will augment the 
clinical efficacy of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
1.3 Objectives  
Primary Objective:  
• To define the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of panobinostat administered in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79226]:  
• To describe the preliminary anti -tumor activity of panobinostat administered in combination 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79204] • To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of the combinatio n regimen on biomarkers in 
peripheral blood samples and tumor biopsy specimens 
 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To explore potential relationships between panobinostat exposure, biomarker measures, 
anti-tumor activity, and adverse event, for each combination dos e regimen  
 
1.4 Background  
 
1.4.1 Summary of Results from Panobinostat Investigational Program  
 
Panobinostat (LBH589) belongs to a structurally novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds and is a pan-inhibitor of Class I, II and IV histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are involved in the deacetylation of histone and non-histone cellular proteins, targeting lysine groups on chromatin and transcription factors and various non-histone 
proteins such as p53, tubulin, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and retinoblastoma protein (Rb). In addition to modulation of the acetylation state and function of histones, treatment of tumor cells with Panobinostat also resulted in increased acetylation of cytoplasmic proteins, 
including Hsp90, a target of HDAC6 and a major chaperone protein required for the stabilization of many key proteins implicated in cancer development and growth onco-
proteins. Panobinostat-induced acetylation of Hsp90 inhibited the protein-stabilizing function 
of Hsp90 and led to the destabilization and resulting degradation of anti- tumor targets, such 
as break point cluster region-abelson (BCR-abl, HER2/neu, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and anti - apoptotic proteins such as phospho-AKT, JAK-2 
V617F, pJAK-2. 
Consequently, cells which exhibited high in vitro sensitivity to Panobinostat include those 
cultured from tumors known to be driven by [CONTACT_79332]-proteins. Panobinostat treatment of the HER+-driven BT474 breast cancer cell line resulted in increased acetylation 
 13 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86594] crisis resulted in the degradation of wild type 
and mutant BCR-abl, including the T3151 BCR-abl mutant resistant to inhibition by [CONTACT_79333] (TKIs) currently approved for the treatment of CML. Consistent with its pan -HDAC inhibition in HL  (Hodgkin’s lymphoma) cell lines, Panobinostat 
treatment resulted in effects  on levels of JAK/STAT signaling proteins in all tested HL cell 
lines. HL is a disease model characterized by [CONTACT_79334], 
including constitutive activation of several components of the JAK/STAT pathway. 
Panobinostat treatment increased the expression of STAT1 and decreased the expression of both total STAT6 and activated phospho-STAT6; both effects are known to be interrelated and to correlate with tumor cell death. These results indicated that Panobinostat modulated the JAK/S TAT pathway in a manner that was consistent with reversing effects associated 
with HL cell survival leading to apoptosis . Panobinostat has shown antitumor activity in 
preclinical models and cancer patients and has been formulated as an oral capsule and a solution for intravenous (i.v.) injection. Both the oral and i.v. formulations are currently being investigated in Phase IB/II studies in advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Two Phase III studies with oral Panobinostat are ongoing in relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma (MM) and in post-transplant Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) patients in 
complete remission who are at high risk for relapse. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical pharmacology  
The drug was  devised through iterative design and combinatorial approaches, and has shown 
inhibitory activity on purified total cellular HDAC and on most HDAC isoforms in 
nanomolar concentrations. It induced expression of cell-cycle control genes including CDKNIA (p21) and inhibited proliferation of a variety of tumor cell lines at low nanomolar 
concentrations. panobinostatt has demonstrated differential toxicity for tumor cells versus 
normal cells and has shown anti- tumor activity in cultured tumor cells which was associated 
with persistent HDAC inhibition, including melanoma cell lines.  The drug exhibited 
differential antiproliferative activity against a broad range of solid tumors cell lines and high sensitivity in lymphomas and hematologic malignancies cell lines, including acu te myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and MM, and induced consistent tumor growth control in various tumor-bearing xenografted mice and increased histone-H3 and -H4 acetylation in excised tumors. Panobinostat has shown synergistic or additive anti-tumor effects in combination with other anti-cancer agents such as trastuzumab, docetaxel, bortezomib or standard cytotoxic agents 
e.g., doxorubicin, fludarabine, Ara-C in murine xenograft and human in vitro models. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Animal pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism  
The absolute or al bioavailability of panobinostat is  ~50% in dogs, ~6 to 22% in rat, and 
2.4% in rabbits. It has moderate plasma protein binding that is independent of plasma 
concentrations. Its in vivo metabolism in dogs, rabbits and rats involves biotransformation 
reactions including reduction, oxidation, hydrolysis, with glucuronidation found only in rats. Panobinostat is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro , but weak inhibitor in vivo (clinical 
increase of dextromethorphan AUC of 1.6-fold).  It shows a weak time-dependent inhibition 
of CYP3A in vitro . Based upon drug-interaction modeling, Panobiostat is not expected to 
clinically interact with sensitive CYP3A substrates  
 CYP3A4 appears to be the main enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of 
 14 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
panobinostat, (70-98% in human liver microsomes). Clinically, metabolism by [CONTACT_097]3A 
contributes to only ~40% of total panobinostat clearance as determined from the magnitude 
of drug interaction elicited with ketoconazole. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-clinical safety and toxicology 
Panobinostat has  shown genotoxic potential in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. It h as a 
preclinical signal for QT prolongation based on in vitro electrophysiological 
investigations and in vivo studies using telemeterized dogs. In the oral repeated doses 
toxicology studies, the primary target organs were identified as the erythropoietic, 
myelopoietic, and lymphatic system. Other secondary target organs included the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, reproductive system, thyroid and bone. Evidence of reversibility 
was observed for all white blood cells. 
 Oral administration of panobinostat to rats and rabbits is associated with embryo-fetal 
toxicity (increased resorptions/decreased live litters). Although no major malformations were 
observed, the incidence of fetal skeletal variations  and anomalies was increased. Based upon 
the results of preclinical studies, hematology parameters, thyroid function and cardiac 
function assessments have been included in clinical trials.  Panobinostat poses a reproductive 
risk to men and women of child bearing potential; therefore use of adequate birth control methods is required while a patient is on drug and for  [ADDRESS_86595] dose.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Human pharmacokinetics and Safety  
In humans, panobinostat exhibits a linear PK  profile following i.v. administration. 
panobinostat exposure is nearly dose- proportional at doses below 60 mg following oral 
administration; inter -patient variability in exposure (AUC) is 60% with oral and 40% with 
i.v. panobinostat (coefficient of variability [ CV]).  The drug has a rapid oral absorption Tmax 
= 1 hour. Absolute bioavailability is 30% and elimination t1/2 is approximately 15 hours. 
 
The clinical development of panobinostat has been conducted with both an i.v. and oral 
formulation 
19-24 The major dose-limiting -toxicity (DLT) for both formulations administered 
as a single agent is reversible thrombocytopenia. For the i.v. formulation, a weekly i.v. 
dosing scheme (Day 1, Day 8 every 21 days) is currently used in clinical studies with thrombocytopenia being managed by [CONTACT_79335]. For the oral formulation, a pooled analysis of data from phase I/II studies indicates that thrombocytopenia is the most 
common lab abnormality of any grade and of Grade 3-4 in patients treated with the three-
times-a-week (TIW), every week (QW) and every-other-week (QOW) schedules. The median 
time to Grade 3 thrombocytopenia appears to be shorter with the QW dosing as compared with the QOW dosing. The magnitude of platelet count decline is dose-dependent and related to the baseline platelet count. The median time to recovery from severe thrombocytopenia, 
Grade 3-4 to Grade 2 or below, is approximately 8 days for doses up to 40 mg in solid tumors 
and lymphomas. The median time to recovery from severe throm bocytopenia is much longer 
(up to approximately 74 days) for doses up to [ADDRESS_86596] of HDAC inhibitors, appears to be formulation, 
dose and schedule dependent. For the i.v. formulation, QTcF prolongation of clinical relevance (Grade ≥3 with absolute increase >500 msec) was seen in 4/15 patients (26.7%) 
 15 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
treated with panobinostat daily x 7, in 2/29 patients (6.8%) treated with the daily x 3 schedule 
(1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 4 torsade de pointes) and in 2/56 (3.6%) patient s treated with the 
weekly dosing schemes. With the “intermittent” oral dosing (TIW QW and TIW QOW) used 
in clinical trials, QTcF >500 msec is uncommon (6/635 patients, 0.9%) and noted only with 
the oral QW schedule. The mean QTc changes from baseline acros s all oral doses and 
schedules have been limited to <[ADDRESS_86597] week of cycle 1 treatment. These changes did not coincide with the maximum concentration/time profile of the drug in plasma. No torsade de pointes has been reported in clinical trials with intermittent 
i.v. or oral dosing regimens 
 Asymptomatic T -wave abnormalities including inverted T -waves, flat T-waves, and 
biphasic T-waves are the most common ECG abnormalities reported to date with panobinostat . Asymptomatic sinus  tachycardia has also been noted in approximately 40% of 
patients who received i.v. or oral panobinostat 
 Other common toxicities included fatigue (dose-related, but Grade 3-4 limited with 
both oral schedules), nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (more common wi th oral, and mostly 
Grade 1-2, regardless of the schedule; manageable with loperamide). Based on these 
preclinical and clinical observations, the safety and efficacy of panobinostat as a single agent and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents is being explored in multiple Phase 
IB, II and III studies in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.  
 
1.4.2 Summary of Results from Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79227]-specific adaptive cellular 
responses by T cells continues to be a major goal for cancer immumotherapy. Full activation 
of naive T cells requires not only stimulation of antigen receptor by [CONTACT_79336]/major histocompatibility complexes, but also by [CONTACT_79337].
 29 These signals are provided 
by [CONTACT_79338]28, which is constitutively expressed on T- cell surface, with CD80 and CD86 molecules which are present on antigen presenting cells (APC). CD28-B7 
costimulatory signals are critical for the induction of T-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, 
and effector functions which ultimately translate into clinical effects.
30 CTLA-4 is an 
activation -induced T- cell surface molecule that binds CD80 and CD86with greater avidity 
than CD28. CTLA-4 ligation down regulates T-cell responses, which results in an abrogation of the clinical effects provided by T-cell activation.
32 Blockade of CTLA-4/B7 interactions 
results in an increase in T- cell activation .

Subsequently, a transfectoma (Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO] cell) has been generated that is capable of producing more ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79230] a per cell 
basis than the hybridoma. Material from the transfectoma will be utilized in this and future

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety  
Safety data are available for more than 2900 subjects treated in 25 completed clinical trials in 
multiple tumor types at a range of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79232] 0.3 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg 31-34. 
Most experience with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79233] 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose levels. Subjects 
who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg were treated in clinical trials conducted early in the development program and received either a single or multiple injections. Intra-subject dose escalation indicated that subjects with no response at 3 mg/kg dose level may respond to 9 mg/kg. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79234] 10 mg/kg are currently being investigated for the treatment 
of melanoma and other tumor types. Nonetheless, in March 2011, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg for 
4 induction doses was approved by [CONTACT_79339]. Drug-related adverse events (AE) were reported in studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79235], cytokines or chemotherapy. The AE profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79236]. Among subjects who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 mg/kg (N = 
658) treatment-related AEs were reported in 85.3% (561/658) of subjects. AEs of grade 3 or 
higher were reported in 31.2% (205/658) of subjects. Most frequently reported treatment-related AEs of any grade (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 
mg/kg) included diarrhea, fatigue, rash, pruritus, nausea, pyrexia, vomiting, and colitis. Treatment -related AEs associated with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79237]-
mediated effects. These AEs, termed im mune-related adverse events (irAEs) presumably 
represent the impact of CTLA-4 inhibition and immune modulation on normal tissue function. Drug-related Grade 3 or 4 SAEs in subjects who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79238]: 
rash/desquamation, pruritus, uveitis, speech impairment, abdominal pain, diarrhea/colitis, 
nausea/vomiting, transaminase elevation, adrenal insufficiency, panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_79239]. Some of these events, such as rash/desquamation, pruritus, uveitis, diarrhea/colitis, transaminase elevation, adrenal insufficiency and panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], may represent drug induced irAEs. Please refer to the Package Insert (PI) for the latest update on 
SAEs.
29 
 
As of 30 Jun 2009, study-drug related deaths based on investigator’s assessment were reported in approximately 1% (35/3800) of subjects treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Eleven of [ADDRESS_86599] received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 
10 mg/kg multiple doses; [ADDRESS_86600] of these cases. 
 
Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs) 
An immune -related adverse event (irAE) is defined as any adverse event associated with drug 
exposure and consistent with an immune-mediated event. Disease progression, infections and other etiologic causes are ruled out or deemed unlikely as contributing to the event. Supportive data, such as autoimmune serology tests or biopsies, are helpful but not necessary to deem an event an irAE. Events of unclear etiology which were plausibly 
“immune mediated” have been conservatively categorized as irAEs even if serologic or 
histopathology data ar e absent. These irAEs likely reflect a loss of tolerance to some self 
antigens or an unchecked immune response to gut or skin flora. Some breakthrough of immunity may be inseparably linked to the clinical antitumor activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 17 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
Among the 658 subjects who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 mg/kg, 73.4% (483/658) developed 
any grade irAEs which predominately involved the GI tract, endocrine glands, liver, or skin. GI irAEs of any grade were reported for 40.0% (263/658) of subjects, and grade 3-4 GI irAEs 
were reported for 12.6% (83/658) of subjects. Inflammatory hepatotoxicity of any grade was 
reported for 9.0% (59/658) of subjects, and grade 3-4 inflammatory hepatotoxicity was 
reported for 6.4% (42/658) of subjects. Endocrinopathy of any grade was reported for 7.6% (50/658) of subjects, and grade 3-4 endocrinopathy was reported for 2.4% (16/658) of subjects. With few exceptions these irAEs were clinically manageable and reversible with 
supportive care or corticosteroids. In responding subjects, addition of corticosteroids does not 
appear to have a temporal relationship to change in objective tumor response. Immune-related AEs associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79240]. In the dose-ranging study, CA184022, overall incidence of irAEs increased with increasing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79241] 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. Comparison of the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose groups also showed an increased 
overall frequency of grade 3-4 irAEs for the higher dose group (the difference was 18.4%).

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy  
Treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79243], prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. The most extensively studied tumor type has been malignant melanoma. Early 
results show that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79244]. The 
objective responses with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79245] a spectrum of doses and schedules. Based on a preliminary analysis for study MDX010-15 involving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg multiple doses, approximately 34% of subjects (N = 23) were progression-free  at 6 
months and about 17% were progression-free at  1 year. In comparison, for study MDX010-
08 involving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg multiple doses, about 11% subjects (N = 37) had progression-free at 6 months and about 6% at 1 year.   The results of a phase III randomized trial of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79217] 3 mg/kg or with a peptide vaccine compared with vaccine alone have been described, showing that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79246].
35 The median OS for patients receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79247] a peptide vaccine was 10.1 and 10.0 months, respectively, compared with 6.4 months for the vaccine-alone control arm  (P = .003 and P < .001, and hazard ratios of 0.66 and 0.68, 
compared with vaccine alone). In that trial, the rate of grade s 3-4 dose limiting side effects 
was 8.1%, with the majority of events being immune related adverse events (irAEs) related to 
the immune mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Predominant events were skin related, 
colitis, hypophysitis and hepatitis. Virtually all dose limiting and other toxicities were reversible with the use of systemic steroids or in rare cases the TNF blocking antibody Infliximab.  Recently, the results of a large placebo-controlled phase III study in [ADDRESS_86601]-line D TIC with or without ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (10 mg/kg) were presented and 
published
10. In that trial, survival was prolonged in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+DTIC containing arm 
compared to chemotherapy alone with p=0.[ADDRESS_86602] ratio of 0.72 favoring ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+DTIC. Median survivals in that trial were 11.1 months for the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79248] 9.1 months for the control chemotherapy cohort. The results of these two trials led to the approval of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79249], 2011.  
 
 18 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86603] 1.1, novel patterns of clinical activity, 
which are related to the immunological mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], were reported. 
These patterns were characterized by [CONTACT_79340]/or after an initial tumor burden increase.  
1.4.[ADDRESS_86604] demonstrated adequate safety and tolerability. In this study, PANOBINOSTAT  will be administered as a formulated capsule that has been used in 
the clinic. The major toxicities of PANOBINOSTAT , being thrombocytopenia and cardiac in 
nature, do not overlap with the major known side effects of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Both 3 and 10 mg/kg doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79250]-tumor activity in melanoma subjects. 
Based on the potential for better tolerability, the lower, 3 mg/kg, dose has been selected as 
the starting dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79251].  
1.4.4 Rationale for Dose Escalation Phase I Design  
The 3+3 design that is commonly used in Phase I oncology trials, though widely accepted 
and used mainly due to ease of implementation, has known limitations. These include a lack of statistical basis for dose escalation decisions and for determination of the MTD, i.e. the MTD is not based on a target toxicity probability, it typi[INVESTIGATOR_79252], and may allow patients to be treated at suboptimal doses. Prior information on the adverse 
event profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79253] 10mg/kg based on 658 treated 
subjects reported a 31.2% toxicity rate for drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or above.
26 
In addition previous data on panobinostat indicate a less than 5% toxicity rate for drug-
related adverse events  of grade [ADDRESS_86605] 
that synergistic/additive antitumor activity from combining ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79254], potential benefit versus risks with this combination have not been evaluated in humans. In this first clinical study with the combination, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the maximum acceptable ≥ Grade 3 toxicity rate at the MTD of the 
combination should not exceed the Grade 3 toxicity rate for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (combination partner with a higher Grade 3 toxicity rate when administered as monotherapy). The target toxicity and the toxicity interval at the MTD will be 18% and 17-19%, respectively, and will be consistent with keepi[INVESTIGATOR_79255] 3 mg/kg for thi s dose escalation trial. These 
proposed target toxicity rates, with the tight interval is also consistent with the general 
principles of the widely used 3+[ADDRESS_86606], the modified TPI (mTPI) design
40 which uses Bayes rule under decision theoretic 
framework, was selected as an appropriate design for this study. The design provides more confidence in estima ting the toxicity rate at each dose, selects the MTD based on a target 
toxicity probability, and it correctly identifies the true MTD more often than the 3+3 design, based on simulation results. The mTPI [INVESTIGATOR_79256] I oncology designs including Bayesian designs such as CRM, due to additional advantages of simplicity of 
 19 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
implementation and treating fewer subjects at suboptimal or at toxic doses. 
 
1.4.5 Rationale for use of Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) to Guide Clinical 
Care and Assessm ent of Clinical Activity 
In prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79257], particularly those in metastatic melanoma, clinical 
efficacy appears to be characterized by [CONTACT_42754] (CR and PR), durable stable disease (commonly lasting 6 or more months in subjects receiving 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 
and stable disease evolving to objective response after more than a year of follow -up in the 
absence of alternative anti -cancer therapy. In addition, melanoma subjects receiving 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79258] -up tumor assessment and 
who are therefore scored as progressors by [CONTACT_79341][INVESTIGATOR_79259]. 
Subjects with such “mixed responses” have been reported to go on to continued reduction in 
tumor burden in the absence of alternative anti-cancer therapy and objective tumor response by [CONTACT_79342].  
The irRC were developed to provide a guide for clinical care of subjects on immunotherapy. Subjects with stable (irSD) or significantly decreasing (irPR) tumor burden despi[INVESTIGATOR_79260]. Subjects with 
increasing tumor burden (irPD) are declared progressors and taken off study drug. To account for the various spectra of patterns of new lesions, measurable new lesions are added to the calculation of tumor burden (e.g. added to the SPD of the index lesions). Thus, subjects with many large new lesions will be scored as irPD even if the index lesions are stable or 
decreasing.  
 
1.4.6 Rationale for use of Blood and Tumor Tissue Biomarkers 
Previous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79261] a variety of potential 
biomarkers in melanoma patients. Results from studies CA184004 and CA184007 suggested 
the possible biomarkers listed below for further research: • An increase in peripheral-blood Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) was associated with 
benefit (Best Overall Response of Complete Response, Partial Response, or prolonged Stable Disease (SD), i.e. SD lasting at least [ADDRESS_86607] dose) and occurred in a dose-
dependent fashion favoring 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In addition to change in ALC over time, ALC value just prior to a third dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79262].  
We will also evaluate FOXP3 and IDO tumor tissue expression at baseline as predictive of 
clinical benefit, as well as flow cytometry of CD4 and CD8 T cells for Ki67, EOMES and 
ICOS, predictive markers that have been found to be associated with benefit using 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].   Serum cytokine assays with a multiplex analysis for IL-6, IL-10 and gamma 
interferon will be conducted, as well as T cell intracellular staining for those cytokines and 
assessment of allo MLR reactivity as a marker of T cell integrity.  
 
A mean increase in the percentage of activated (HLA -DR+), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and 
central memory (CD45-RO and CCR9+) T- cells and a mean decrease in percent of naive 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in Week [ADDRESS_86608]-ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79263]. Based on these results, a biomarker plan is included in this 
trial which allows sample collection for biomarker analyses to determine the effects of PANOBINOSTAT  on the immune -regulatory effects of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777]. Subjects will 
 20 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
be asked to give blood samples, serum and/or tumor tissue samples for predictive, 
pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarker research.    
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Pan-HDIs have been shown to have antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. In 
addition to inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells, these compounds are also endowed with immunoregulatory properties. For instance, the pan-HDI TSA has been shown 
to up-regulate MHC and costimulatory molecules on melanoma c ells, making th em more 
susceptible to  attack by [CONTACT_20129] -γ secreting T-cells. In addition, Vo et al. have demonstrated that 
in vivo treatment of melanoma bearing mice with the hydroxamic acid analogue pan-HDI 
LAQ824, significantly augment the anti -melanoma activity of adoptiv ely transferred antigen-
specific T- cells
25. Furthermore, studies in our lab have shown that LAQ824 inhibits the 
production of IL -10 in APCs rendering these cells more inflammatory and capable of 
effectively prime naïve antigen -specific CD4+ T-cells and abl e of restoring the 
responsiveness of toleran t T-cells (Wang et al. J Immunol.  186(7): 3986-96, 2011  
 Panobinostat (LBH589) which is a potent cinnamic hydroxamic acid analog 
deacetylase i nhibitor, induces apoptosis in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro at nanomolar 
concentrations. Panobinostat belongs to the same family of hydroxamic acid derivatives than 
LAQ824, but has the following advantages: (i) It is an oral agent, (ii) Clinical studies in 
humans have shown that panobinostat has a better safety profile than LAQ824 (which was 
removed from further clinical development due to cardiac toxicity) and, (iii) LBH displays 
more potent HDAC inhibition than LAQ824 both in vitro and in vivo.  Indeed, recent studies 
in our lab have confirmed that LBH589 is more potent than LAQ824 in inhibiting the 
proliferation of B16 melanoma cells in vitro (Fig. 1A).  Of note, panobinostat- treated B16 
cells are rendered immunogenic due to their enhanced expression of MHC class I and II molecules and the costimulatory molecule CD40 ( Fig. 1B). In addition to its effect upon 
melanoma cells, panobinostat also influences the inflammatory status of APCs since 
treatment of these cells resulted in a dose -dependent inhibition of IL -10 that is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_79343]-inflammatory cytokine IL -12 (Fig. 1C ). These 
inflammatory APCs are in turn, better activators of naïve antigen-specific CD4
+ T-cells in 
vitro (Fig. 1D).  
 
 
    
 
 21 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86609], in vitro treatment of several human melanoma cells, including BRAF WT (SKMEL21), 
BRAF mutants (WM983A, WM35 and WM164) or melanoma cells with constitutively 
activated STAT3 (WM793), with nanomolar doses of LBH589 resulted in a dose dependent 
inhibition in cell growth (Fig. 2A).  Cell lines WM983, SKMEL21 and WM793 were the 
most sensitive to LBH589. Of note, normal melanocytes (HEMn- LP) were not affected by 
[CONTACT_79344]589 at all the doses evaluated. Second, exposure of human melanoma cells to LBH589 resulted in cell cycle arrest in G1 (Fig. 2B) and induction of apoptosis (Fig. 2C) as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_79345]589-treated WM793 and WM983A cells. Third, treatment with LBH589 resulted in increased expression of MHC class I and the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40  in WM983A human melanoma cells 
(Fig.2D).

The immunomodulatory effects of panobinostat upon melanoma cells, APCs and T cells 
together with the demonstration by [CONTACT_79346]3, a transcriptional 
activator of IL -10, and induces changes in CCL22 that allow for Th1 polarization points to 
this HDI as a novel immune adjuvant with the potential to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of 
immune stimulating agents like anti-CTLA4 antibodies for the treatment of melanoma. Indeed, we recently treated B16 melanoma bearing mice with anti -CTLA4 antibodies alone, 
LBH589 alone or a combination thereof. The therapeutic regimen combining panobinostat 
and CTLA4 blockade significantly delayed melanoma growth in vivo as compared to either 
agent alone shown in Fig 1E.  
 Currently available treatment options for advanced melanoma including Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79264], as well as high -dose interleukin-2, produce a spectrum of significant toxi cities 
while providing meaningful clinical benefit. Demonstration of significant clinical responses 
and prolonged overall survival in subjects with advanced melanoma with the mutant selective inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) has provided clinical validation for mutated B-RAF as a therapeutic target in this tumor type. Duration of response with this agent as monotherapy, 
however, appears to be limited. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a potent immunomodulatory agent that has 
already demonstrated durable clinical benefit and benefit in overall survival in subjects with advanced melanoma. When considered together with the data on observed additive/synergistic anti-tumor activity and promotion of its immune effects in nonclinical studies and their distinct mechanisms of action, administration of panobinostat in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79265] a novel treatment regimen that could have the 
potential to provide significant sustained clinical benefit in this subject population. Potential benefits from this combination, therefore, outweigh the potential risks for toxicity. Assessment of safety and tolerability of panobinostat has been addressed in a monotherapy

symptoms including fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, skin rash and decreased appetite. These events are easily monitored by [CONTACT_79349] (scheduled physical examinations, repeated vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory 
assessments) and/or can be managed by [CONTACT_79350]-
specified dose modifications. No eye disorders associated with changes in the retina or the optic nerve have been reported in the clinic to date, as was observed among individual animals at high doses in the nonclinical studies. Given the superficial nature of these lesions, this finding is not considered prohibitive to continued evaluation of panobinostat in the clinic. 
The most common adverse events with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79267], presumably 
related to the immune -based mechanism of action, correlated with clinical activity and nearly 
always reversible with medical management. The most frequently reported drug-related 
adverse events include diarrhea, colitis, endocrinopathies, hepatitis, and rash. There is potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_79268]. Appropriate monitoring plan and 
guidance on early intervention and management of these events, as well as dose modification 
guidelines have been included in the protocol. In order to minimize the overall risks to participating subjects, this protocol has inclusion-exclusion criteria appropriate to the population and proposed dosing reg imens, exclusionary screening tests, and specific follow-
up safety assessments. Based on the potential adverse event profile, appropriate clinical, 
laboratory, and management algorithms have been incorporated into the protocol. The 
adverse events (AEs) and  serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed on an ongoing 
basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_79269]. Since both PANOBINOSTAT  
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79270], it is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or 
unanticipated reactions can occur during the study.

tolerability of oral panobinostat administered concurrently in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
Treatment will be divided into induction with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79271] a 
maintenance phase with panobinostat alone consistent with the general principles of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224]. It is anticipated that this evaluation will enable selection of the RP2D of this combination for further clinical testing. A study schematic is presented below: 
 
Each treatment cycle will be 4 2 days (6 weeks) during the induction phase, and 84 days (12 
weeks) during the maintenance phase. Panobinostat will be administered orally TIW on Days 1-42 of each 42 day treatment cycle. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79207] (IV) once every [ADDRESS_86614] 
for up to 2 treatment cycles. During the maintenance phase, panobinostat will be administered orally TIW on Days 1 -84 of each 84 day treatment cycle. Subjects will continue 
maintenan ce panobinostat treatment with their designated combination dose regimen until 
progression of disease, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent or any other reason as specified in Section 3.4.

Dose escalation: Subjects will be enrolled in  successive cohorts of 3. An initial cohort of 3 
subjects will be enrolled at the given dose level, and additional cohorts of 3 subjects may be 
added to the same dose level (e.g. increasing the total number of enrolled subjects from 3 to 6, 9 or 12) based on a modified version of a toxicity probability interval (TPI) design introduced by [CONTACT_79351].
40 The modified TPI (mTPI) design uses Bayes rule in a decision 
theoretic framework to determine the MTD based on a target toxicity (eg, dose limiting 
toxicity; DLT) probability p T. A fixed number of subjects, 36, will be used during this dose 
escalation study. As the dose escalation proceeds under this design, the number of subjects 
enrolled at a given dose level depends on the number of the toxicities observed a t that dose 
such that multiple cohorts of [ADDRESS_86615] to the pre-specified target toxicity probability P
T. In this study, an 18% 
target toxicity (P T) is used. Background rationale as basis for selection of this target toxicity 
has been previously outlined in Section 1.4.6.  Dose escalation will evaluate panobinostat at 
doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg TIW administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 3 mg/kg. The first cohort will receive panobinostat orally at a dose of 5 mg PO TIW; 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79208] a dose of 3 mg/kg. Enrollment of successive cohorts of 
subjects will proce ed with administration of escalating doses of panobinostat in combination 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Additional dose levels of panobinostat beyond the 20 mg PO TIW dose cohort may be added if appropriate based on the safety and tolerability profile of the combination, and after consultation and agreement between Investigators and [COMPANY_001]. It is 
expected that all subsequent dose levels of panobinostat will be no more than 33% higher 
than the preceding dose. If the first dose cohort is demonstrated to have unacceptabl e 
toxicity, dose level -1 will be instituted with 5 mg PO TIW of panobinostat and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79272] 1 mg/kg.  
 
There will be no intra -subject dose escalation. Decisions regarding dose escalation 
between cohorts will be guided by [CONTACT_79322]-related d ose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) occurring within 84 days (12 weeks; through Day 42 of induction cycle 2) of 
initiation of study therapy. If three patients complete their [ADDRESS_86616] e xceed 9 weeks without MTD being reached 
to be able to dose escalate. This DLT observation interval is based upon inclusion of the known median times to onset of common immune-related adverse events attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and allows for a substantial amount of time for unexpected toxicities with the combined administration of panobinostat and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79211]. 
Subjects who do not complete the DLT observation period for reasons other than drug-related 
toxicity will be replaced. One  of the following five decisions will be made at the end of the 
DLT period for each cohort of 3 subjects based on the number of DLT’s observed: 
 
 26 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
S: stay at the same dose and enroll a cohort of 3 more subjects at that dose 
E: escalate to the next higher dos e by [CONTACT_79323] 3 more subjects 
D: de-escalate to the lower dose, and enroll 3 more subjects at the lower dose, or 
DU: declare the current dose as unacceptable and unsafe, de- escalate to the lower dose, and 
enroll 3 more subjects at the lower dose 
C: Study completed and dose is declared to be the MTD  
Decisions S or E are allowed by [CONTACT_79352]. Decisions D or U are based on evidence of exceeding predetermined toxicity. With a tar get toxicity rate of 18%, allowing any dose with estimated 
P
T in the (17%, 19%) interval to be selected as the MTD in this study, and with a maximum 
fixed total of 36 subjects at the dose escalation phase in each arm, the algorithm for dose 
escalation  decisions based on possible total number of subjects at each dose cohort is 
described in Table 3.2 below. 
 Table 3.2 Dose Escalation Algorithm for each arm: modified TPI [INVESTIGATOR_79273]: This is a Phase I dose escalation trial and the sample size at each dose depends 
on the observed toxicity , and a total of 36 subjects at the dose- escalation phase allows sufficient 
number of subjects if needed, e.g. more than 6 subjects if dose- limiting toxicities are observed 
among 2 of 6 subjects, to better estimate the toxicity rates per dose, and more accurately determine the MTD. Cohorts of 3 subjects with possible expansions to 6, 9, or 12  subjects will be 
treated at each suggested dose level until MTD is defined.  
 
In this protocol, we will be using a new phase I trial approach  (Table 3.2 ), modified from a design 
from Ji et al
43.  This approach provides a broader phase I experience than the traditional 3+[ADDRESS_86617] choice of an MTD.  While setting the target toxicity rate 
at 18%, thi s design allows further examination of a dose when 2 DLTs occur among 6 patients, 
while still keepi[INVESTIGATOR_79274] (it is below 26% for sample 
sizes ≥ 9).  Moreover the MTD will exploit the isotonic nature of dose escalatio n in determination 
of the MTD.

**for MTD target toxicity pT=18%, and allowing any dose with pT in (17%, 19%) to be selected  
The modifications involve escalating the dose whenever the observed toxicity rate is below 17% 
and using the N-1st patient to define the change when the toxicity rat e exceeds 19% and N ≥ [ADDRESS_86618] that the design is being used in cohorts of 3 rather than continuously as 
 27 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
designed by [CONTACT_79351]43. 
 
Based on the above design, escalation to the next higher dose level can occur if DLT’s are 
observed in 0 of 3 or 6 subjects, in up to 1 of 6 subjects, in up to 2 of 12 subjects, and so on. If DLTs are observed in a greater number of subjects and escalation is not yet permitted, additional subjects in cohorts of 3 will be enrolled at the same dose in order to bett er estimate 
the true DLT rate at that dose until either escalation is allowed, the dose is deemed unacceptable and should not be used, or de-escalation is recommended, based on Table 3.2.  All available clinical and laboratory data, and the nature, time of onset and time to resolution of DLTs observed during dose escalation will be reviewed to determine whether an alternate dose schedule should be examined after consultation between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79275] (DMC) if needed. If agreed upon, the alternate schedule will 
be identified by a protocol amendment and the MTD determined for the revised dose schedule.  This phase I study design has tended to be applied to a fixed sample size of 30.  Due to the 
increased complexity of  this combination -dose trial, we have chosen a sample size of 36.

involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). 
If a subject was withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page. 
 
[ADDRESS_86633](s) is/are: Panobinostat 5 mg,  10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg capsules and 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS-734016) 
Study drug is to be administered and prepared according to the package insert as described 
below.  
Preparation of Solution 
• Allow the vials to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes prior to preparation of infusion. 
• Withdraw the required volume of YERVOY and transfer into an intravenous bag. 
• Dilute with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. Mix diluted solution by [CONTACT_5237]. 
• Store the diluted solution for no more than 24 hours under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C, 36°F to 46°F) or at room temperature (20°C to 25°C, 68°F to 77°F). 
• Discard partially used vials or empty vials of YERVOY.  
 
Administration Instructions 
 32 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
• Do not mix YERVOY with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal 
products. 
• Flush the intravenous line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP after each dose. 
• Administer diluted solution over 90 minutes through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding in-line filter.  
 
Dose, Volume and Rate Calculations  
Total dose should be calculated as follows: Subject body weight in kg x 3 mg = total dose, mg 
Total infusion volume should be calculated as follows: Total dose in mg divided by 5 mg/mL 
= infusion volume, mL  Rate of infusion should be calculated as follows: Infusion volume in mL divided by 90 minutes = rate of infusion, mL/min 
 
For example, a subject weighing 114 kg (250 lb) and designated to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 3 mg/kg would be administered 342 mg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (114 kg x 3 mg/kg = 342 mg) with an infusion volume of 70 mL (342 mg divided by 5 mg/mL = 70 mL) at a rate of approximately 0.77 mL/min (70 mL divided by 90 minutes) in 90 minutes. 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS-734016) Injection (5 mg/ml), must be stored refrigerated (2 - 8°C) with protection from light. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79281] (5 mg/ml) in DEHP free IV infusion bags for up to 24 hours at room temperature or refrigerated (2°C - 8°C). This would include any time in transit and the total time for infusion. Drug must be completely delivered to the 
subject within 24 hours of preparation.

As described under Study Design (Section 3.1), panobinostat will be administered orally 
concurrently in combination with intravenous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. For each arm, treatment will be divided into induction and maintenance phases. 
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_86638] cohort will receive panobinostat 
orally at a dose of 5 mg PO TIW; ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79208] 3 mg/kg. Subsequent dose levels of panobinostat and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79282] d according to the 
schedule in Table 4.1.

 Additional dose levels of panobinostat beyond the 20 mg PO TIW dose cohort may be added as appropriate, although it is expected that all subsequent doses will be no more than 33% 
 34 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
higher than the preceding dose (eg, from 20 mg PO TIW to 25 mg PO TIW). Start of 
induction cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_86639] 1 day. During the DLT observation (within 84 days of initiation of study therapy), subjects, who for reasons 
other than study-drug related toxicity, either miss 1 or more of their scheduled doses of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], or miss more than 10% of their scheduled Q12 hour doses of panobinostat, or do not complete the first induction cycle, will not be conside red evaluable for safety for the 
purposes of dose escalation and will be replaced.  
4.3.2 Administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79283] a 1.2 μ m in-line filter (see current 
version of Investigator’s Brochure), using a volumetric pump, at the 3 mg/kg dose, and at an 
appropriate rate to complete the infusion in 90 minutes with a 10 cc normal saline flush at the end. Additional details on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79284] [IP_ADDRESS]. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding management of infusion reactions. 
 
4.3.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity 
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation decision making, hematologic and non- 
hematologic (hepatic versus non-hepatic) DLT will be defined separately and will be determined based on the incidence, severity, and duration of study drug -related AEs 
occurring within 84 days (12 weeks; through Day 42 of induction cycle 2) of initiation of study therapy. Using these features, the severity of AEs will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. For the purposes 
of subject management, DLTs will lead to dose modification regardless of the cycle in which a DLT occurs (see Section 4.3.8 for specific guidelines). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of non hematologic dose- limiting toxicity 
Non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as follows: 
A: Hepatic Non-Hematologic DLT 
Any one of the following events will be considered a hepatic DLT (irrespective of whether it 
is considered to be an irAE): Isolated Grade [ADDRESS_86640]/ALT 
Isolated Grade [ADDRESS_86641]/ALT that fails to return to Grade 1 or less within 5 days  
Isolated Total Bilirubin ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_86642] or  
ALT > [ADDRESS_86643] and concurrent total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_86644] 
B: Non-Hepatic Non-Hematologic DLT 
Any Grade 3 or greater non-hepatic non-hematologic toxicity will be considered as a dose-
limiting toxicity with the following specific exceptions : 
• Grade [ADDRESS_86645]  less than 48 hours and either resolve spontaneously or respond to 
conventional medical intervention. • Grade 3 nausea or vomiting that lasts less than 48 hours, and either resolves spontaneously 
or responds to conventional medical intervention. • Isolated Grade 3 elevation of amylase or lipase not associated with clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis.  
• Isolated Grade 3 fever that lasts ≤ 3 days and is not associated with hemodynamic 
compromise (ie hypotension, clinical or laboratory evidence of impaired end -organ 
 35 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
perfusion). 
 
Criteria for Non -Hematologic DLT in Context of Immune-Related AEs and Infusion 
Reactions: 
A constellation of immune-related adverse events  (irAEs) have been observed in patients 
treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285]. Simila rly, as has been seen with a broad range of 
therapeutic antibodies, infusion reactions have been observed among patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Based on broad clinical experience with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a unique set of criteria 
have been developed to define and manage dose- limiting toxicities in the context of irAEs 
and/or infusion reactions and are outlined below. 
 
C: Immune -related Adverse Experiences (irAEs) and DLT  
Definition of DLT in the context of irAEs will consider the incidence, severity, time of onset, 
duration and time to resolution for the specific irAE in the context of existing experience 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. All Grade [ADDRESS_86646] clustered among skin, gastrointestinal, 
endocrine and liver-related events as follows: 
Skin: alopecia, dry skin, hyperhidrosis, night sweats, pruritus, rash/desquamation, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], urticaria, and vitiligo. Gastrointestinal: abdominal discomfort or pain, anal ulcer, colitis (including ulcerative, haemorrhagic, ischaemic, and megacolon), constipat ion, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diarrhea (including 
haemorrhagic), diverticulitis/diverticulum, duodenitis, dyspepsia, dysphagia, enteritis, esophagitis, gastritis (including erosive), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (including rectal), hematochezia, ileitis, ileus, intestina l obstruction, intestinal perforation (including small and 
large intestines), melena, nausea, pancreatitis, peritonitis, stomatitis (including aphthous), vomiting, vasculitis gastrointestinal.  
Endocrine: adrenal insufficiency (including Addison’s disease), glucose tolerance impaired, hyperthyroidism hypogonadism, hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (autoimmune), hypothyroidism, pi[INVESTIGATOR_79286], thyroiditis (autoimmune). Liver: hepatitis, jaundice  
 
Dose-limiting immune -related AEs will be defined as the follows:  
• Any Grade 2 or greater eye pain or reduction in visual acuity that does not respond to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_20308] 1 severity within 2 weeks of the initiation of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_79287] 2 or greater eye pain or reduction in vis ual acuity that requires 
systemic treatment.  
• Any other Grade 3 or greater irAE: 
 
D: Infusion Reaction and DLT  
Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion reactions will also be considered as dose-limiting events.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of hematologic DLT 
Hematologic DLT will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days in duration 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or any Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically-
significant bleeding  
 36 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
• Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia  
• Grade ≥ 3 hemolysis 
 
4.3.4 Duration of Treatment 
Subjects may remain on study therapy until progressive disease as determined by [CONTACT_44859]-
related response criteria (irRC), withdrawal due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_86647] not experienced a dose-limiting toxicity may continue on therapy if, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], they are experiencing clinical benefit (i.e. stable disease or 
objective response as determined by [CONTACT_19104]). For patients who experience a dose-limiting hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity, therapy should be held/deferred pending resolution 
of the toxicity. 
 
Panobinostat/Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79288]-hematologic and 
Hematologic Events Other Than Infusion Reactions : 
• Patients who experience hepatic non -hematologic DLT irrespective of irAE or any 
Grade 3 or greater irAE will be removed from study with no further dose reduction. 
• For patients who experience a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_43180]-hepatic non-hematologic DLT or a 
first epi[INVESTIGATOR_79289], therapy m ay be reinitiated at the next lowest 
panobinostat /ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79290] 4.3 if the event has resolved 
to less than or equal to Grade 1 in severity at the time the next cycle is due. • For patients who experience a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_79291]-hepatic 
non-hematologic DLT, a second dose reduction may be performed as specified below for the successive cycle if the second dose-limiting event is distinct in nature from the first event and the event has resolved to less than or equal to Grade 1 in severity at the time the next cycle is 
due. 
• In the event of a DLT, successive cycles of therapy may be delayed up to 14 days 
pending resolution of the toxicity to grade 1 or less in severity. Patients on dose level #1 will 
not be dose reduced in the event of DLT. Patients on dose level #2 will be allowed a 
maximum of 1 dose reduction, with the second occurrence of DLT necessitating removal from study. • Any patient who develops significant irreversible (i.e. more than [ADDRESS_86648] 
dose of study drug) organ dysfunction (i.e., Grade IV non-hepatic non- hematologic toxicity) or anaphylaxis considered to be related to study drug will also be removed from study with no further dose reduction. 
• All cardiac events should be treated as per the local standard of care and referred to 
a specialist if clinically indicated.  The readings of ECGs  will use the Fridericia 
correction: QTcF.  Any final decisions concerning dose modifications or permanently 
discontinuing the patient from study drug due to QTcF prolongation will be based on the 
 37 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86649] dose, patient should be discontinued from study.

guidelines are provided below. Supportive care guidelines may be modified based on clinical 
judgment, local treatment standards and guidelines, and/or specific symptoms, as appropriate: For Grade 1 symptoms: Mild reactions (localized cutaneous reactions including mild pruritus, flushing, rash), • Decrease the rate of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79295]. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
• Diphenhydramine 50 mg, may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at the original infusion rate 
• Institute additional treatment as clinically indicated.  
If a subject has a Grade [ADDRESS_86659] 30 minutes prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288];  
• diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or • acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg 
For Grade 2 symptoms: Moderate reactions [ie, any symptom not listed above (mild symptoms) or below (severe symptoms) such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg], require infusion interruption but 
respond promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non- steroidal anti 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, i.v. fluids]; prophylactic preinfusion medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours. • Discontinue the study drug infusion.  
• Begin an i.v. infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 
mg i.v. (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg. • Remain at bedside and 
monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. • Corticosteroid therapy may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician. • When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate; if no 
further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. • Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, immediately discontinue the infusion; no 
further study drug will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_86660] 
30 minutes prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288];  
• diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or 
 41 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
• acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg 
• If considered necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may 
be used. 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction [eg, bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
systolic blood pressure ≤ 80 mm Hg, or angioedema], Grade 3: prolonged [ie, requiring 6 or 
more hours to respond to symptomatic medication and/or discontinuation of infusion]; 
recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38195] [eg, renal impairment, pu lmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: life-threatening; 
pressor or ventilatory support indicated). 
•        Immediately discontinue the study drug infusion. No further study drug will be given  
•        Begin an i.v. infusion of normal saline, and treat as follows: bronchodilators, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1.0 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for i.v. administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 
mg i.v. with methylprednisolone 100 mg i.v. (or equivalent), as needed.  
• Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. Subject should 
be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  
• The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the case report form (CRF). 
• In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized 
or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given 
(eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids). In addition, Investigators should also follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Management of Gastrointestinal AEs and 
 
Endocrinopathies  
Immune-related adverse events are well described with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. All subjects 
who receive treatment on this study should be closely monitored for any signs related to 
gastrointestinal or endocrine systems and aggressively managed at the first onset of clinical symptoms. A high index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_79296]- mediated colitis should be maintained in 
subjects who present with diarrhea or other abdominal symptoms. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, including early administration of steroids should be instituted as 
consistent with the guidelines on management of diarrhea within the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79297] 
(see Appendices 5-8). Specific algorithms for the management of immune-related AEs, diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and endocrinopathies have been developed within the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79298] 5-8. 
 
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding  
This is an open label study. Blinding will not be utilized. 
 
4.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug  
 
4.5.1 Destruction of Study Drug  
If study drug panobinostat sourced by [CONTACT_79357], 
it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for the 
disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records documented.

At the investigator’s discretion, laboratory tests may be repeated if clinically significant. 
If the units of a test result differ from those printed on the CRF, the recorded laboratory values must specify the correct units. Any abnormal laboratory test result considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_79359] (see Section 6.[ADDRESS_86667] Abnormalities). 
 
5.4 Efficacy Assessments  
In this study, immune-related Response Criteria (irRC; see Appendix 4) will be used to 
assess subject response to study treatment and guide clinical care. However, response- based 
assessments in this study will be captured using both modified irRC and RECIST 1.1. The investigator will determine the irRC response at each tumor assessment. The RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_86668] 1.1 criteria will be used to determine 
subjects’ best overall response (BOR), and for statistical analysis of efficacy in this study. Assessments of tumor status will be made during screening and then at 6 and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.  The irRC represent modifications of the modified WHO criteria reflecting the clinical experience with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79301]/or ongoing 
clinical studies in which objective and durable responses (as per mWHO) were observed in 
subjects following progression and without intervening alternative anti- cancer therapy. As 
such, the irRC are designed to capture clinical act ivity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79302] 1.1 criteria  and will only be used for patient 
management decisions, not formal efficacy reporting.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of 
a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product. Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during 
open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In orde r to prevent 
reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) 
 
6.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE below) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•        is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate 
medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, pathogenic or non-pathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE. Although pregnancy, overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs for data transmission purposes (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies). 
 
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]: 
− a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening) 
− elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
− admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
−       routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status   
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
− medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was 
 48 

MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
−       admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, care-giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstanc es, administrative).  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_86669]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified procedures. SAEs (except those events considered secondary or related to 
disease progression) should be followed to resolution or stabilization. Follow-up is also 
required for SAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or those that are 
present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. The investigator should collect any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness. If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to 
study drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of 
previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 days (death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (all 
other SAEs) after the inv estigator’s or institutions  initial receipt of the information. SAEs 
may be reportable to the FDA for both FDA-approved (post-market) drugs as well as 
investigational agents.   
For an event to be reportable to the FDA, it must meet both of the following requirements as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_7966]: 
1. The event is possibly, probably or definitely related to the agent  
2. The event is unexpected (i.e., not listed in the protocol, investigational brochure, 
or informed consent) 
SAEs may be reportable to the FDA for both FDA-approved (post-market) drugs as well as 
investigational agents.

To report an event for an INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT under investigational  new 
drug applications:  
Send a narrative of the event with circumstances, IND number, and why it is related and 
unexpected to the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Regulatory A ffairs IND Office..  A 
MedWatch report for the event would suffice. These events should not be reported or sent 
directly to the FDA by [CONTACT_9137]. The Regulatory Affairs IND O ffice at Moffitt 
Cancer Center will submit the reportable event as an IND safety report to the FDA on behalf 
of the principal investigator.  
If the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_79304] -market agent and the investigational agent , then the following 
should be done:  
• Submit the MedWatch report to the appropriate post-market addre ss at the FDA as 
written above.   
• Send the MedWatch report to regulatory affairs. The office will submit and IND 
safety report on the behalf of the principal investigator.   
 
Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_001] 
In addition to the reporting guidelines above, all SAEs, regardless of causality , should be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. SAEs may be 
submitted in any format, using the fax cover sheets in Appendix 8. 
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within [ADDRESS_86670] the 
EOT visit any ongoing AE’s should be followed to resolution or stabilization, through the 
 50 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
day 90 follow-up, or reported as SAE’s if they become serious (see Sections 6.1.1). 
Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. Follow-
up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of s tudy 
drug, or those that are present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. Completion of 
supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_86671] Abnorm alities 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured as appropriate: 
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted 
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy. 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term would be 
used by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
 
6.[ADDRESS_86672] will be permanently discontinued for the female study participant in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety). Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x-ray studies). Other 
appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported. Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to the IRB.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_86673] be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details). 
 
6.6 Other Safety Consid erations 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x-rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious 
AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
Dose Escalation: This is a Phase I dose escalation trial and the sample size at each dose 
depends on the observed toxicity; however a total of 36 subjects for the dose-escalation study 
allows sufficient number of subjects if needed, e.g. more than 6 subjects if dose-limiting 
toxicities are observed among 2 of 6 subjects, to better estimate the toxicity rates per dose, and more accurately determine the MTD. Cohorts of 3 subjects with expansions to 6, or possibly even 9 or 12 subjects will be treated at each suggested dose level until MTD is 
determined.  
 
In this protocol, we will be using a new phase I trial approach (Table 8.1 ), modified from a 
design from Ji et al
43.  This approach provides a broader phase I experience than the 
traditional 3+[ADDRESS_86675] choice of an MTD.  While setting the 
target toxicity rate at 18%, this design allows further examination of a dose when 2 DLTs 
occur among 6 patients, while still ke epi[INVESTIGATOR_79274] 
(it is below 26% for sample sizes ≥ 9).  The trials will enroll up to [ADDRESS_86676] been accrued at  the current dose and the dose is acceptable (E, S or C).  Otherwise, if the current 
dose has ≤1 of 3, or ≤2 of 6 DLTs, then three more patients will be accrued at that dose – i f at 
most [ADDRESS_86677] DLTs, that dose is the MTD.

C: Study completed and dose is declared to be the MTD 
**for MTD target toxicity pT=18%, and allowing any dose with pT in (17%, 19%) to be selected  
The modifications involve escalating the dose whenever the observed toxicity rate is below 17% and using the N -1
st patient to define the change when the toxicity rate exceeds 19% and 
N ≥ [ADDRESS_86678] that the design is being used in cohorts of 3 rather than continuously as designed by [CONTACT_79351]
43. 
 
8.2 Endpoint Definitions  
8.2.1 Safety Endpoints  
All subjects who receive study any drug therapy will be evaluated for safety. Safety 
assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected prior to dosing on Day [ADDRESS_86679] current version of MedDRA and adv erse 
events and laboratory tests will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Immune-related adverse 
experiences (irAEs) among treated subjects will be specifically assessed as well.  
 
8.2.2 Efficacy Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_86680] overall response (BOR), computed for all treated subjects, is defined as the best 
response designation over the study as a whole, recorded between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to subsequent therapy.  
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the total number of subjects whose best response outcome is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by [CONTACT_79360]. 
Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the total number of subjects whose best response outcome is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease divided by [CONTACT_79361]. Prolonged Disease Control Rate (PDC R) is defined as the total number of subjects whose 
best response outcome is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease lasting at least 12 weeks, divided by [CONTACT_79361]. Progression Free Survival (PFS):  is defined for each subject as the time from first dosing to 
the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a subject has not progressed or died at the time of analysis, PFS will be censored on the date of the last disease 
assessment. Subjects who do not have any tumor assessment on treatment will be censored 
on the day of the first dose. 
Duration of Overall Response: will be computed for all subjects whose best response is either a PR or CR and is calculated from the time the measurement criteria are met for PR or CR, whichever is recorded first, until the date of documented progressive disease or death. 
 53 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
Duration of Disease Control: will be computed for the subjects who had BOR outcome of 
CR, PR, or Stable Disease and is calculated from the beginning of treatment until the time of documented disease progression. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints based on Immune Related Criteria (irCR) 
Immune Related Best Overall Response (irBOR) is the best irRC designation over the 
study as a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior 
to subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subject in th e study. irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR 
assessment must be confirmed by a second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and performed no less than [ADDRESS_86681] met. 
Immune-related Response Rate (irRR) is defined as the proportion of response evaluable 
subjects whose irBOR outcome is irPR, irCR. 
Immune-related Disease Control Rate (irDCR) is defined as the proportion of the response 
evaluable subjects whose irBOR outcome is irPR, irCR, or irSD. Immune-related Prolonged Disease Control Rate (irPDCR) is defined as the proportion of 
the response evaluable subjects whose irBOR outcome is irPR, irCR, or irSD, with stable disease lasting at least 12 weeks.  
Immune-related Progression -Free Survival (irPFS) is defined as the time between the first 
dosing date and the date of irPD or death, whichever occurs first. For subjects with no recorded post-baseline tumor assessment, irPFS will be censored at the day of first dose. A 
subject who dies without reported irPD will be considered to have progressed on the date of 
death. For those who remain alive and have no irPD, irPFS will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Subjects who do not have any tumor assessment on treatment w ill be censored on the day of the first dose. 
Duration of Immune Related Overall Response: will be computed for all subjects whose

8.3 Analyses 
8.3.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Frequency distributions of gender and race will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2715]. Summary statistics for 
age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2715]. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_86682]’s best overall response (BOR) and progression free survival (PFS) will be 
listed based on RECIST 1.1 (dose escalation and cohort expansion). To descri be the anti -
tumor activity of panobinostat administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) as well as prolonged disease control rate by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (PDCR) will 
be similarly summarized. Objective Response (OR) is defined as BOR outcome of CR or PR by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. Disease Control (DC) defined as BOR outcome of CR, PR, or Stable 
Disease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. Prolonged disease control is defined as disease control with stable 
disease of at least 12months. Duration of response and duration of disease control will also be calculated for the subjects with such outcome, based on both efficacy criteria. Median PFS, Duration of Response, and Duration of Disease Control will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier method and with 95% confidence intervals, at the MTD based on both response criteria. 
Kaplan Meier plots will be provided for all time- to-event variables at the MTD, based on 
both response criteria. We will also fit the survival function using a parametric survival 
approach, as this approach provides a more accurate estimate of the median PFS  Additional 
assessments, e.g. sensitivity analyses may be performed to characterize clinical activity. The relationship between panobinostat exposure/dose and clinical efficacy (e.g. tumor response 
based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) may be explored graphically and appropriate model may be 
fit. 
  
8.3.[ADDRESS_86683] results will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_13691]. Any significant physical examination findings and results of clinical laboratory 
tests will be listed. ECG listings will be evaluated by [CONTACT_79362], if present, will be listed. A separate listing and summary of all immune -related adverse events 
(irAE) and inflammatory events regardless of causality (IERC) will be provided. In addition, the irAE rate will be estimated and a 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the 
irAE and the grade 3-4 GI irAE rate in each arm, based on the Clopper-Pearson method. The 
relationship between panobinostat exposure/dose and adverse event may be explored graphically and appropriate model may be fit. 
 
8.3.4 Biomarker Analyses 
 
 55 

MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
Pharmacodynamic analyses will examine the patterns of change in ALC over time, and how 
these patterns might differ between treatment arms. Predictive analyses will examine potential relationships between ALC and measures of response such as PFS or irPFS. The 
mean rate of change in ALC over time and corresponding two-sided 95% CIs will be 
estimated using an extended linear model, fit by [CONTACT_79363] (REML). The model will have fixed effects of treatment and time since first dose. Predictive analyses will assess the relationship between PFS / irPFS and rate of change in ALC over time (ALC slope). Summary statistics for peripheral blood biomarkers of immunoregulatory activity 
such as, but not limited to T-cell subpopulation counts, serum cytokines, and their 
corresponding changes (or percent changes) from baseline will be tabulated by [CONTACT_79364], to assess pharmacodynamic effects. In addition, the time course of biomarker measures will be investigated graphically; if there is indication of meaningful pattern across time, further analysis (eg, by [CONTACT_79365]) may be performed to 
characterize the relationship. Possible associations between changes in biomarker measures 
of interest and panobinostat exposure will be explored graphically. Summary statistics for measures and changes from baseline of tumor-based markers including T-cell (CD4, CD8, CD45, FoxP3) and apoptosis markers (IDO and granzyme B) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_79366]. Results from mRNA expression profiles pre- and on- treatment, in pe ripheral 
blood and fresh tumor biopsies and from T cell phenotype analysis on baseline samples will be tabulated, and possible associations with clinical outcome (e.g. tumor response) will be explored based on data availability. Associations between biomarkers and efficacy measures will be analyzed in all response-evaluable subjects. Methods such as, but not limited to, logistic regression will be used to explore possible associations between biomarker measures 
from peripheral blood or tumor markers and clinical outcome, e.g. tumor response, based on 
both RECIST 1.1 and irRC criteria.

APPENDIX 3  – RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_86689] 1.1  CRITERIA  
• Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols 
where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. 
− Measurable disease: the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology. − Measurable lesions: lesions that can be accurately measured in [ADDRESS_86690] one diameter ≥ 20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥ [ADDRESS_86691] scan using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. 
− Non-measurable lesions: all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 20 
mm with conventional techniques or < [ADDRESS_86692] scan), i.e., bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericard ial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218]. • All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers. All lesion measurements must be recorded in millimetres (or decimal fractions of 
centimetres).  
• All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than approximately 30 days before the beginning of the treatment. • The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Methods of measurement  
• CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
index lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_86693], abdomen and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. 
• The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not 
yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated 
equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be r estricted 
to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can be useful in 
confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. • Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. • Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases 
(e.g., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors). 
Baseline documentation of “index” and “non-index” lesions 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as index lesions and recorded 
 64 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
and measured at baseline.  
• Index lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter and perpendicular diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). • A sum of the longest diameters for all index lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum. The baseline sum will be used as reference by [CONTACT_79372].  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-index lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Evaluation of best overall response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient’s best response assignment will depend of the achievement of both measurements and confirmation criteria.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. • In some circumstances it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete respo nse status.  
Confirmation 
• The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the 
response rate observed. In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be 
made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. 
• To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_86694] met. Longer intervals as determined by [CONTACT_79373]. • In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6 -8 weeks) that is defined in 
the study protocol.

APPENDIX 4  – IMMUNE RELATED RESPONSE CRITERIA 
 
Immune Related Response Criteria  
4.1 Tumor Assessments  
The immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) is a further refinement of the mWHO criteria 
to better capture tumor responses in subjects on immunotherapy. The irRC was developed/implemented to address the difference in the natural history of the clinical responses observed in subjects treated with immunotherapy agents which differs from those 
seen in subjects on other classes of anti-cancer agents.  
 Differences of response patterns between cytotoxic and immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79317]
[ADDRESS_86695] hoc analysis of the 
radiological responses that were observed during the Phase 2 studies performed in melanoma: • The appearance of me asurable antitumor activity may take longer for immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79318]; 
• Responses to immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79319]; •
 Discontinuation of immune therapy may not be appropriate in some cases, unless PD 
is confirmed (as is usually done for response); • Allowance for “clinically insignificant” PD (eg, small new lesions in the presence of 
other responsive lesions) is recommended; 
• Durable SD may represent antitumor activity. 
These observations lead to the development or immune -related Response Criteria extensively 
described by [CONTACT_79374]
3, used to define efficacy endpoints in more recent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79320]. 
4.[ADDRESS_86696]/MRI 
CT/MRI imaging of the chest and abdomen is required at Screening and at each tumor 
assessment (TA), regardless of the location of known metastases. In addition, CT/MRI scans 
must be obtained of anatomic regions not covered by [CONTACT_79375][INVESTIGATOR_79321] (eg, lesions in the thigh). Such additional CT/MRIs will be required at Screening only when deep soft tissue disease is known/suspected and must be consistently repeated at all TAs if a deep soft tissue lesion is 
identified during Screening. T he same imaging modality must be used at all TAs.  
Brain scans are required at Screening to rule out CNS metastases. Brain scans to be repeated 
as clinically indicated. Contrast enhanced CTs are preferred, MRIs are a second choice.  
Similar methods of TA and similar techniques must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at Screening and all subsequent tumor assessments. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to clinical examination. Helical (spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]) CT scans of the chest and 
abdomen are preferred. If not available, conventional (non helical, non- spi[INVESTIGATOR_15143]) should be used; however, a measurable lesion must not have the longest diameter smaller than [ADDRESS_86697] scans; if IV contrast is contraindicated, oral contrast maybe used, or MRI should be used at the Screening exam and at all TA time points. 
Subjects who develop contrast allergy after study enrollment must be followed by [CONTACT_79376].  
 66 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, [ADDRESS_86698] be based on institutional standards (e.g, from 5 to 8 mm, 10 mm cuts are 
not recommended). Chest x-rays and ultrasound are not acceptable methods to measure 
disease. 
4.2.2 Bone Scans 
Assessment of irPD is never based only on a new lesion(s) found on bone scans. However, if 
bone lesions are identified at any time during the study, additional imaging studies of the 
lesion(s) must be performed to confirm the malignant nature of the new findings on the bone scan. If an abnormal bone scan was observed at any time point throughout the study, a new bone scan must be performed prior to the confirmation of a complete response (eg, the remaining metastastic lesions must have resolved). In case of new lesions such as pleural 
effusion, cytology must be performed to identify and confirm malignancy. Skin and soft 
tissue lesions will be captured as non-measurable lesions through physical examination only.  
4.3 Definition of Measurable / Non -Measurable Lesions 
• Measurable lesions are lesions that can be accurately measured in [ADDRESS_86699] one diameter ≥ 20 mm and the other dimension ≥ 10 mm ([ADDRESS_86700] with cuts of 5 mm). The area will be defined as the product of the largest diameter with its perpendicular.  
• Non-measurable (evaluable) lesions are all other lesions, including unidimensional 
measurable disease and small lesions (lesions without at least one diameter ≥ 20 mm), and 
any of the following: lesions occurring in a previously irradiated area (unless they are documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation therapy), bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or p ericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, 
abdominal masses that are not pathologically/cytologically confirmed and followed by 
[CONTACT_79377].  
4.4 Definition of Index / Non -Index Lesions  
Measurable lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and ten lesions in total, must be identified as index lesions to be measured and recorded on the CRF at Screening. 
The index lesions should be representative of all involved organs. In addition, index lesions 
must be selected based on their size (eg, lesions with the longest diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218], and how representative they are of the 
subject’s tumor burden. At Screening, a Sum of the Products of Diameters 
 (SPD) for all index lesions will be calculated and considered the baseline SPD. The baseline 
sum will be used as the reference point to determine the objective tumor response of the index lesions at TA.  
Measurable lesions, other than index lesions, and all sites of non-measu rable disease, will be 
identified as non-index lesions. Non-index lesions will be recorded on the CRF and will be 
evaluated at the same assessment time points as the index lesions. In subsequent assessments, 
non-index lesions will be recorded as complete r esponse, stable or progression. 
All measurable and non- measurable lesions should be assessed at Screening and at the 
defined TA time points. Extra assessments may be performed, as clinically indicated, if there 
is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519]. The Investigator will base response to treatment using the irRC. 
4.5 Definition of New Lesions 
New lesions (both measurable and non-measurable) will be recorded on the appropriate CRF 
 67 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
for any tumor assessment. The appearance of up to 10 new lesions should be recorded. Once 
a new lesion has been identified ir should be reassessed at each subsequent TA time point using the same imaging modality. If meaurable, the dimensions of the new lesions should be 
recorded on the CRF, as they will be used to calculate the irSPD. 
4.6 Tumor Res ponse Using Immune -Related Response Criteria 
(irRC) 
4.6.[ADDRESS_86701] who develops an objective tumor response (irCR or irPR) is recommended to 
undergo confirmatory scans no less than [ADDRESS_86702] that develops ir -progressive disease (irPD) also 
undergo confirmatory scans no less than [ADDRESS_86703] of Diameters (SPD) for irRC (irSPD) 
SPD is an estimation of tumor burden. The two greatest perpendicular diameters are used to 
estimate the size of each tumor lesion. The SPD is calculated as t he sum of the product of the 
diameters for index tumor lesions. Several variations of the SPD are identified for the 
purpose of classification of tumor responses. SPD at Baseline : The sum of the product of the diameters for all index lesions identified at 
baseline prior to treatment on Day 1. Immune-related SPD (irSPD) at baseline is the same as 
SPD. 
SPD at TA: For every on-study TA collected, per protocol Section 5.[ADDRESS_86704] emerged after baseline will contribute to SPD at TA. Therefore, the SPD at TA using the irRC for progressive disease incorporates the 
contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net percentage change in tumor burden per 
assessment using irRC accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
SPD at Nadir: For tumors that are assessed more than one time after baseline, the lowest value of the SPD (SPD Baseline or SPD at TA) is used to classify progression at subsequent TAs for each subject. 
4.6.[ADDRESS_86705] Overall Response using irRC (irBOR) will be based on the following criteria: 
• Immune-related Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions 
(index and non-index together with no new measurable/unmeasurable lesions) for at least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of irCR. • Immune-related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as the SPD baseline. At each subsequent TA, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of new measurable lesions are added together to provide the Immune Response Sum of the Product of the Diameters (irSPD). A decrease, relative to baseline of 
 68 
MCC [ZIP_CODE] – versio n 6-  December 21, 2015 
the irSPD of 50% or greater is considered an irPR. This must be confirmed no less than [ADDRESS_86706] irPR. • Immune-related Stable Disease (irSD): irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
immune complete response or immune partial response, in the absence of progressive disease. 
• Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): It is recommended in difficult cases to 
confirm PD at the following TA. Any of the following will constitute progressive disease: 
− At least a 25% increase in the SPD of all index lesions and new measurable lesions (irSPD) 
over the nadir SPD calculated for the index lesions.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterize d by [CONTACT_498674]. Right -sided heart failure ensues with severe limitation of exercise and 
eventual progression to death.  
 
The role of female sex in PAH has long been recognized.  Certain types of PAH are  more 
common in women  and some have implicated hormone therapy in causing or worsening 
PAH.  A genetic study has shown that variation in estrogen metabolism is a risk factor for 
PAH. These data strongly suggest estrogen as a potential therapeutic target in the 
treatment  of PAH .  
 
Fulvestrant is an FDA- approved estrogen receptor (ER)  antagonist , used to treat 
postmenopausal women who are diagnosed with hormone receptor -positive metastatic 
breast cancer. Fulve strant binds to ER  in a competitive manner and downregulates the 
ER prot ein. We aim to determine if fulvestrant will decrease circulating pro -angiogenic 
hematopoietic progenitors in the plasma and plasma estradiol levels as well as lower right ventricular systolic pressure in patients diagnosed with PAH.

 12 Chapter 1. Backgro und and Significance  
 
1.1 Definition and characterization of PAH  
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension  (PAH) is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure 
> 25 mm Hg, a pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 WU , and a normal pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_171438] . Endothel ial thickening, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and in situ 
thrombosis are present in small pulmonary arteri es, however the disease mechanism is 
unknown. The three year survival is only 60 %. 
 1.[ADDRESS_641486] 
increased pro -angiogenic hematopoietic progenitor  cells (HPCs) in the bone marrow  and 
circulating in blood .
1 Estradiol stimulates HPC mobilization via the estrogen receptor α 
(ERα), and ER  α blockade reduces HPC colony formation and endothelial growth. 
Estradiol is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) enzymes to metabolites which have both pro -angiogenic (16α -OHE1, signaling via ERα) and anti- angiogenic (2 -OHE, 2 -
methoxyestradiol [2ME] ) effects. The rs1800440 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
in CYP1B1 (enzyme that metabolizes estrone)  produces a higher urinary 16α -OHE1/2 -
OHE ratio, and both the SNP and urinar y ratio are risk factors for heritable PAH.
2  
Androstenedione and testosterone are converted by [CONTACT_498675] (E2) which signal via ER  α and β . Female sex and estrogen are traditionally thought to 
have beneficial effects on the lung vasculature. Estrogen attenuates pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular changes in hypoxic and monocrotaline animal models 
of pulmonary hypertension.
3-[ADDRESS_641487], female sex increases the risk of idiopathic and heritable PAH and 
portopulmonary hypertension.6 Austin et al. showed that subjects with certain 
genotypes of CYP1B1 had lower 2 -hydroxyestrone:16a -hydroxyestrone ratio and had a 
higher r isk of PAH.[ADDRESS_641488] (affected in part by [CONTACT_498676]1800440 SNP (A>G, Asn453Ser) in CYP1B1) determines the ratio of these E2 
metabolites. The rs180044 0 CYP1B1 SNP is associated with a higher 16α- OHE
1/2-OHE 
urinary ratio (the “readout” of CYP1B1) and with a higher risk for cancer, a finding 
attributed to enhanced angiogenesis. Accordingly, in the monocrotaline model of pulmonary hypertension, administration of 2- ME reduced vascular remodeling by > 50% 
and improved survival.
[ADDRESS_641489] , may therefore be effective in PAH .

 17 Chapter 4. Treatment  
 
4.1 Fulvestrant  
 
Fulvestrant is given intramuscularly (IM). Steady state concentrations are reached within the first month and plasma levels are mainta ined for at least one month. It is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_498677]. Metabolites 
are less active or have similar activity to parent compound.  
 The majority of clinical studies have been conducted in patients with estrogen- positive 
breast cancer such as the Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer (CONFIRM) trial, a randomized, double -blind, phase III trial that enrolled 746 
women. Patients were randomly assigned to fulves trant at two doses: [ADDRESS_641491] ed that fulvestrant 500  mg is superior to fulvestrant 250  mg. 
The researchers found that there was a 19% reduction in risk of death and a 4.1 month difference in overall survival in subjects who were randomized to 500  mg fulvestrant 
dosage compare d with fulvestrant 250  mg. The higher dose was well tolerated with no 
new safety  concerns. Patients with Child -Pugh  Class  B liver disease could be safely given 
doses of fulvestrant 250  mg. 
 
This study will utilize  fulvestrant 500 mg administered intramuscu larly into the buttocks 
slowly (1 -2 minutes per injection) as two 5  mL injections, one in each buttock, on days 0, 
14, 28 and 56. Fulvestrant 250 mg (one 5 mL injection) will  be used in patients with 
Child -Pugh Class B liver disease.   
 
4.2 Management of ot her medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_498660] ’ pre -study medical regimen will be continued after enrollment in the study.  
There will be no constraints on the management of the subjects ’ PAH  medication during 
the study period.

if she meets most of the inclusion/exclusio n criteria, the subject will be approached by a 
research team member during a scheduled PH clinic visit. The study will be explained to the subject. A fter all questions are answered and  if the subject agrees to participate, she 
will be scheduled for a scre ening visit.  
 The following procedures will be performed during the screening process:  
 • Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Sign and date the informed consent and HIPAA release  (must be done before any  
study procedures)   
• Review medical history  
• Review current medications  
• Labs/Phlebotomy: complete blood count, hepatic function panel, platelet count,  
 coagulation studies, and FSH (if needed)  
• Provide instructions on recording of new concomitant medications and dose  
changes  
• Instruct subj ects to bring a list of routine medications to baseline visit, do not eat  
or drink (except water) [ADDRESS_641493] meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria fo r the study, the subject will be 
scheduled for a baseline study visit within [ADDRESS_641494]- menopausal (i.e., (1) > [ADDRESS_641495] not menstruated during 
the preceding 12 months or (2) have undergone bilateral oophorectomy ). Review of 
medical history, medications, and informed consent must be obtained prior to the 
combined visit.   
 
5.1.2 Study Day – Visit 1  (Baseline ), Day 0  (− 2 days ) 
The research coordinator will call the subject 1 -2 days before the visit as a reminder to 
not eat or drink (except water) and to avoid heavy exercise for [ADDRESS_641496] of the  current  
medications and to take all medications before the visit other than any oral PAH medication(s). The subject should bring her  oral PAH medication(s) with her  to be taken 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.[ADDRESS_641497] ration. If a combined Screening Visit and 
Baseline Visit is performed, all labs (other than FSH for female subjects who are known 
to be post -menopausal  per inclusion criteria) must be confirmed and all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria must be met prior to stud y drug administration.  
 
The subject will arrive at the study site outpatient clinic. The following procedures will be performed:

 24  5.3 Subjects ’ retention and drug compliance  
 
We will enforce subject retention in several ways. We will record extensive contact 
[CONTACT_498684]. This will include home, 
work, and cellular telephone numbers. The research coordinator  will call before each 
study visit to remind the subject  to attend. The resea rch coordinator  and physician will 
explain the importance of compliance with the study protocol  at each subject  contact . If 
a subject fails to comply with a study visit, the coordinator  will contact [CONTACT_498685]. If this fails, the coordinator  will sen d two letters by [CONTACT_204020] , one week apart, to 
request follow -up. 
 If a subject  wishes to drop- out from the treatment phase of the study or ha s a serious 
adverse event  (whether related to study drug s or not) , we will continue to follow -up 
with the subject for st udy assessments to assist with safety monitoring and to avoid the 
problems introduced by [CONTACT_11368].   5.[ADDRESS_641512] will be reimbursed 
$100 for completing the screening vi sit. Each subsequent visit completed  (visits 1 -5) will 
be reimbursed $250  for a total reimbursement of $1350.  
 
The study drug will be provided free of charge.

and RV s troke volume index  
• Six-minute walk distance  
• Plasma NT-proBNP level  
• Safety and side effects associ ated with short -term fulvestrant 
administration in subjects with PAH  
 6.1.1 Plasma Estradiol (E2) Levels  
Plasma E2 levels will be measured using a d ouble antibody radioimmunoassay . 
 6.1.2. H ematopoietic Progenitor Cells (H PCs)  
Plasma H PC levels will be measured using flow cytometry.  
 6.1.[ADDRESS_641513]  will be evaluated  with a per -protocol analysis. Subjects who are not 
compliant or stop the treatment portion of the study will be replaced (although their 
data will als o be considered in secondary analyses). Outcomes include estradiol levels, 
TAPSE  and other echocardiographic measures , 6MWD, plasma  NT-proBNP level , and 
other variables as well as  safety and side effects.  
 
These measures will be assessed both at baseline a nd nine weeks. Summary statistics 
will be produced with both the repeated measures as well as the calculated differences 
from the baseline. We will summarize demographics and other predictors of clinical status. Continuous variables will be summarized by t he mean, median, standard 
deviation, and range, as appropriate. We will use contingency tables for discrete and 
dichotomous variables.  
 
Hypothesis testi ng will use two -sided α= 0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed 
using SAS and R.

 9.6 Safety and Adverse events  
 9.6.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problem (UP ): Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 2) related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
 
3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previous ly known 
or recognized.    
 Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable po ssibility that 
the AE , experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592].  
 Adverse event  (AE) :  Any symptom, sign, i llness or expe rience that develops or worsens 
in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AE s if 
the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious AE  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_371511] (SAE):  Adverse reactions are classified as serious or non -serious.  
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 32 • requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outc omes noted above.  For 
example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5108].  
 All AEs that do not meet any of t he criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious AEs.  
 9.6.2. Classifying AEs  
Severity  
 The intensity of clinical AEs is graded on a three -point scale –  mild, moderate, severe –  
and is reported on specific AE pages of the CRF.  
 If the intensity o f an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst 
intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
 
The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  
• Mild - The event  may be noticeable to the subject . It does not influence daily 
activities, and usually does not require intervention.  
 
• Moderate - The event may make the subject uncomfortable. Performance of 
daily activities may be influenced, and intervention may be neede d. 
 
• Severe - The event may cause noticeable discomfort, and usually interferes with 
daily activities.  The subject may not be able to continue in the study, and 
treatment or intervention is usually needed.  
 Expectedness  
 AEs must be assessed as to whether t hey were expected to occur or were unexpected, 
meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
 Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study . 
 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 33 OHRP defines an unexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects 
participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not 
consistent with either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the proced ures involved in the 
research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -
approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources o f information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 Rela tedness  
 1) Definite:  the AE is clearly related to the intervention  
 2) Probably: the AE is likely related to the intervention  
 3) Possible: the AE may be related to the intervention  
 4) Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the intervention  
 5) Unrela ted: the AE is clearly not related to the intervention  
 For each identified AE, an AE form will be completed. Reporting procedures should be started immediately upon learning of a SAE.  
 
9.6.[ADDRESS_641520] be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up 
at week 12 .   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an AE  if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an AE  must also be recorded and documented as an AE .  
 
Post -study AE 
All unresolved AE s should be fol lowed by [CONTACT_1374], 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be 
related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.[ADDRESS_641521] that has participated  in this study.  
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE  if any one of the 
following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5109] a serious AE  unless specifically instructed otherwise in this 
protocol.  Any condition responsible for surge ry should be documented as an AE if the 
condition meets the criteria for an AE .  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an AE  in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498665] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an 
outcome of an AE  if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the 
outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498666].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498667].  
 9.6.4 Reporting procedures for AE s 
The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those 
events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased ris k of harm.  The Penn IRB  require s researchers to submit 
reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator 
becomes aware of the event:  
• Any non-fatal, non -life threatening AE (regardless of whether the event is serious 
or non -serious, on -site or off -site) that occurs any time during or after the 
research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]:

Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research 
procedures” if in th e opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event 
was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Non -fatal, non -life threatening unexpected suspected serious adverse reactions will be 
reported to the NHLBI within [ADDRESS_641522] be reported within 30 days to OHRP by [CONTACT_941] P enn IRB.  
 Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to th e Penn  IRB using the institution required form or as a written report of the 
event (including a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or 
other study documentation).  
The Primary  Investigator is expected to provide as much of the following information as 
is available:  
• Protocol name [CONTACT_114040]  
• Subject identifiers  
• Demographic data  
• Nature of the event  
• Severity of the event  
• Probable relationship (ca usality) of AE to study procedure  
• Date and time of AE onset  
• Date and time of AE resolution, if available  
• Concomitant medications that the participant was taking for an 
underlying medical condition or disease and the therapeutic 
agents used for the treatment of the adverse event 
• Clinical assessment of participant conducted at time of SAE/AE  
• Results of any laboratory and/or diagnostic procedures, and 
treatment  
• Follow -up plan  
• Outcome  
• Autopsy findings (if appropriate)

 36 The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_498668]. If additional information cannot be obtained for whatever 
reason, this will be documented.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_498669].  
 
The Principal  Investigator/designee should keep originals or photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_498670], including facsimile confirmations and email exchanges,  and file them in 
the participant's file.  
The Principal Investigator /designee should file copi[INVESTIGATOR_498671].  
Other Reportable events:  
The following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
• Any adverse experience that, even without detaile d analysis, represents an  
unexpected SAE that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any AE that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_498687].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the 
research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response 
to treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
researc h study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_341871], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.[ADDRESS_641523] ’s best interest.  
 
A subject should be withdrawn from the study if the re is:  
 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_498688] , even if the subject is withdrawn from the 
treatment portion of the protocol  (either due to subject, physician, or investigator 
decision) , we will  continue with the scheduled follow -up assessments both for the 
safety of the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of compliance with 
study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial.  If the both treatment is permanently 
withdrawn, the subject will return to the center  for safety assessment (history, physical 
examination, and clinical laboratories, if necessary).  In the event of clinical worsening, 
subjects  will be continued on their assigned study medication. If a subject  develops an 
indication for fulvestrant  therapy (such as breast cancer), the subject will be withdrawn 
from receiving  study drug in this clinical trial but  will cont inue to be  assessed per 
protocol.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_641524] of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those re gulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject 
of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected  prior to the revocation 
of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Several mechanisms will be in place to maintain confidentiality. Patient names will not 
be abstracted and all of the data will be reported in aggregate. Each subject in all phases 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.[ADDRESS_641525]’s  privacy in the future, a global unique ID (GUID)  number will be 
generated  for use in this study . The subject’s name , birth date,  and other “identifying” 
information from the subject’s  medical information  will be removed  before providing 
data  to researchers. This information is “de -identified” beca use it has had a ll personal 
identifiers removed. The subject’s  information will be labeled with the GUID and stored 
on secured computers and servers and protected with encryption and passwords. Only authorized people will have access to the key to the code  and will be able to identify the 
subject  if needed.  
 9.[ADDRESS_641526] common side effects  for fulvestrant  (greater than 10%) reported are injection 
site pain, back pain, nausea, and increased liver enzymes.  Less common side effects 
(less th an 10%) were headaches, fatigue, weakness, pain in arms or legs (extremities), 
hot flashes, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, bone, joint and muscle pain, cough, 
and shortness of breath.  Very uncommon side effects (less than 1%) were rapid swelling  
of the under the skin (angioedema), skin rash, inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), liver failure, hypersensitivity, leukopenia, osteoporosis, blood clots, elevation of bilirubin levels, elevation of gamma GT , and vaginal bleeding.  Because the drug is processed and 
broken down mostly in the liver, subjects with moderate liver disease will receive a 
lower dose of the medication (250 mg instead of 500mg).  
 Women  of child -bearing potential or breast- feeding mothers will not be enrolled in this 
study there fore there  are no risks to unborn children or children who are being breast -
fed.  
 We will obtain several blood samples from each subject. There is a risk of bruising, 
hematoma, and infection after phlebotomy, which are possible but not considered 
serious AEs. Fainting although unlikely, may occur.   
 The probe used during the echocardiogram may lead to mild soreness in the area for about a day.  
 The 6MWT  may cause light -headedness, chest pain, or musculoskeletal discomfort;  
however the risks of this study to  subjects  are minimal. In addition, subjects  with PAH 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0

increase risk above usual clinical care.  
 
As subjects  will be allowed to continue their other therapy, there are no alt ernative

 9.9 Potential benefits  
 
The results from the study could be applied in the future to subjects  (including those in 
the study) who stand to benefit from the information. There may be cl inical benefits to 
the use  of fulvestrant  in subjects  with PAH . As the study involves the risks of 
administration of fulvestrant,  phlebotomy, exercise testing, and loss of confidentiality, 
and there is a potential for future benefit for both subjects in the study and for future 
subjects , the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.

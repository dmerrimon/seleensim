Title of Protocol: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Placebo- Controlled, Randomized, Double-B lind, 12-Week Study With a 
40-Week, Active-Controlled, Double-B lind Extension to Evaluate the E fficacy and Safety of K-877 in 
Adult Patients With Fasting Triglyceride Levels ≥500 mg/dL and <2000 mg/dL and Normal Renal 
Function 
Protocol Number: K-877-301 Phase: 3 Indication:  
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_293741]: Study K-877-301 is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomi zed, double-blind study to confirm the efficacy and 
safety of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily  compared to matching placebo (in the 12-week Efficacy Period) and 
an active comparator, fenofibrate (i n the 40-week Extension Period), in  patients with fasting triglyceride 
(TG) levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) and normal renal function. 
Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lifestyl e stabilization period (4-week stabilization for patients 
not requiring washout and 6-week washout and stabilization for patients on lipid-altering therapy other 
than statins, ezetimibe, or propro tein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors). The 
stabilization period will be followed by a 2-week TG qualifying period (Visits 2 [Week -2] and 
3 [Week -1]), and patient eligibility will be assessed based on the mean TG value from these 2 visits. If the patient’s mean TG level during the TG qualifying period is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and 
<500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be taken 1 week later at Visit 3.1. The mean of all 3 TG measurements will be used to determine eligibility for the study. After confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values, eligib le patients will enter a 12-week, randomized, double-blind Efficacy 
Period. At Visit 4 (Day 1), patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to K-877 0.2 mg twice daily 
or identical matching placebo tablets twice daily. During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients will return to the site at Visit 5 (Week 4) , Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) for efficacy and safety 
evaluations. Patients who successfully complete th e 12-week Efficacy Period are eligib le to continue in a 40-week, 
double-blind, active-controlled Extension Period af ter completing the Visit 7 (Week 12) procedures. 
Patients randomized to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy Period will continue to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily, as well as placebo  matching fenofibrate 145 mg once daily, in the 
40-week Extension Period. Patients randomized to r eceive placebo matching K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in 
the 12-week Efficacy Period will receive fenofi brate 145 mg once daily and placebo matching 
K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 40-week Extension Period. From Visit 7 (Week 12), patients not on statins, ezetim ibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may initiate therapy, and 
patients receiving statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibito rs may alter their dose, as indicated by [CONTACT_293764]. After Visit 8 (Week 16), patients are to return to th e site every [ADDRESS_641645] visit (Visit 11 
[Week 52]). 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrat e the efficacy of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily compared 
to placebo from baseline to Week 12 in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with fasting TG levels 
≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L).

13 Sep 2016 v1.0  v11  Secondary Objectives: 
The secondary objectives of the study are the following: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of K- 877 0.2 mg twice daily from ba seline to Week 52 in lowering 
fasting TG levels in patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L);  
• To evaluate the efficacy of K-877 0.2 mg twice da ily from baseline to Week 12 and Week 52 in 
altering lipid parameters in patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L);  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in patients with fasting 
TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L); and 
• To determine the plasma concentrations of K-877 for the purpose of use in population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis. 
Exploratory Objective: 
 
 
Patient Population: 
The study population will consist of male and female patients ≥18 years of age with  fasting TG levels

Statistical Analysis: 
Efficacy: 
In order to control the family-wise Type I error at a 0.[ADDRESS_641646], followed by 
[CONTACT_293767], tested in the following hierarchical manner: percent change from baseline to 
Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) re mnant cholesterol ( calculated as TC − LDL-C − HDL-C), 
(2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, and (4) non-HDL-C. Each test is planned to be performed at a 0.05 significance 
level. Inferential conclusions about these efficacy endpoints will require statis tical significance of the 
previous one. For other efficacy endpoints, nominal p-values and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented, but 
should not be considered as confirmatory. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on H odges-Lehmann estimator with  pattern-mixture model 
imputation based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The pattern-mixture model will be used as the primary 
imputation method as part of the primary analysis for the percent change in fasting TGs from baseline to Week 12. This imputation model will include factors such as patient demographics, disease status, and 
baseline TG, as well as adherence to therapy. Th e imputation model will impute missing Week 12 TG 
values as follows: 
• For patients who do not adhere to therapy and who do not have a Week [ADDRESS_641647] a Week 12 measurement; and  
• If there are no patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to therapy and have a Week 12 measurement, missing Week 12 TG values will be imputed as follows: 
o For the K-[ADDRESS_641648] is considered wa shed out and baseline TG values 
will be used to impute the Week 12 TG values; and  
o For the placebo arm, missing Week [ADDRESS_641649] error will be combined to 
produce treatment difference estimate and 95% CI and p-value. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the Per-Protocol Set.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0  xi 11  Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 
25th percentile, and 75th percentile) at baseline, each scheduled visit, and change and percent change in 
fasting TG from baseline to each scheduled visit will be provided. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint s included in the hierarchical step-d own testing procedure include percent 
change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequen ce of (1) remnant cholesterol, (2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, 
and (4) non-HDL-C. The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints du ring the 12-week Efficacy Period will be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with the same imputation method used for the primary analysis. The ANCOVA model will include country, current statin th erapy use (not on statin therapy versus currently 
receiving statin therapy), and treat ment as factors; baseline value as a covariate. If the normality 
assumption is not met, the Hodges-Lehmann estimator  with the same imputation method used for the 
primary analysis will be used. The secondary efficacy endp oint of percent change in fasting TG  from baseline to Week 52 will be 
summarized descriptively.  
 Other efficacy end points during the 40-week 
Extension Period will be summarized descriptively. No hypothesis testing will be performed. 
 
 
 
Safety: 
The safety endpoint data will be su mmarized for the Safety  Analysis Set for the 12-week Efficacy Period, 
40-week Extension Period, and overall. 
The AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A 
general summary of the AEs and serious AEs (SAEs)  will be summarized by [CONTACT_293768], 
severity, and relationship to study drug per treatment group. The number of AEs leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to death will also be summarized. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_498771]. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. 
The safety laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_293769], along with changes from 
the baseline. The values that are below the lower limit or above the upper limit of  the reference range will 
be flagged. Those values or changes in values that are identified as being clinically significant will be flagged. Laboratory abnormalities of special interest, such as liver function tests and pancreatitis events, 
will be summarized. 
Vital signs and 12-lead ECGs will also be summarized  by [CONTACT_105289], along with the 
changes from baseline. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Population PK and PK/PD data will be analyzed and reported separately.

1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
K-877 is a potent and selective peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor (PPAR) 
modulator, which is several thousand times more selective for the PPAR α receptor than 
the PPAR γ or PPAR δ receptor.

lead to elevated levels of the atheroge nic lipoproteins (VLDL, remnant particles, 
LDL, etc.) or reduced levels of the anti-atherogenic high-density lipoprotein, any or all of 
which can confer increased risk of coronary ar tery disease. Of great er concern, elevated 
levels of TG, in particular TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), c onfer an increased risk 
of acute pancreatitis.2,3 Acute pancreatitis caused by [CONTACT_293770] (HTG) is 
associated with increased severity and rates of complications compared to pancreatitis with causes other than HTG.

[LOCATION_002] for the treatment of severe HTG (SHTG). In the [LOCATION_002], fenofibrate, 
fenofibric acid, and gemfibrozil are available. Fi brates available in Europe are bezafibrate, 
ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil. In Japan, bezafibrate, clinofibrate, clofibrate, 
and fenofibrate are available.  
The [LOCATION_002] Adult Treatment Panel III  National Cholesterol Education Program 
(NCEP) guidelines7 recommend reduction of TG through lifestyle, diet, and 
pharmacologic methods as the first priority of therapy when serum TG are ≥500 mg/dL. 
Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oils, has been shown to 
effectively decrease TG levels up to 30%; however, for individuals  with SHTG (serum 
TG ≥500 mg/dL), increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake does not adequately manage 
TG levels.8 
The European Society for Cardiology and Eu ropean Atherosclerosis Society consensus 
guidelines note that patients can develop pa ncreatitis with TG concentrations between 
5 and 10 mmol/L (440 and 880 mg/dL).[ADDRESS_641655] therapeutic range 
with fewer restrictions in patients with rena l dysfunction or with concomitant drugs than 
existing PPAR α agonists.  
Fenofibrate (145 mg once daily) was chosen as the active comparator for the 40-week Extension Period of this study based on current  guidelines for the management of SHTG. 
The present study is a Phase 3 multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study with a 40-week, active-controlled, double-blind extension 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily  in patients with 
fasting TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL and <2000 mg/dL and normal renal function. The results 
of this study will provide  a better understanding of the efficacy and safety of 
K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in  patients with SHTG.

 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to confirm the efficacy 
and safety of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily compared to matching plac ebo (in the 12-week 
Efficacy Period) and an active comparator, fenofibrate (in the 40-week Extension Period), 
in patients with fasting TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL 
(22.60 mmol/L) and normal renal function. 
Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lifestyle stabilization period (4-week 
stabilization for patients not requiring was hout and 6-week washout  and stabilization for 
patients on lipid-alterin g therapy other than statins, eze timibe, or proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors). The stabilization period will be followed by a 2-week TG qualifying period (V isits 2 [Week -2] and 3 [Week -1]), and patient eligibility 
will be assessed based on the mean TG value fr om these 2 visits. If the patient’s mean TG 
level during the TG qualifying period is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL 
(5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be taken 1 week later at Visit 3.1. The mean of all 3 TG measurements will be used to determine eligibility for the study. After 
confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values, eligible patients will enter a 12-week, 
randomized, double-blind Efficacy Period. At Vis it 4 (Day 1), patients will be randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to K-877 0.2 mg twice daily or identical matching placebo tablets twice daily. During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients will return to the site at Visit 5 
(Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) for efficacy and safety evaluations. 
Patients who successfully complete the 12-week  Efficacy Period are eligible to continue 
in a 40-week, double-blind, active-controlled Extension Period after completing the 
Visit 7 (Week 12) procedures. Patients random ized to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily 
in the 12-week Efficacy Period will continue to  receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily, as well 
as placebo matching fenofibrate 145 mg on ce daily, in the 40-week Extension Period. 
Patients randomized to receive placebo matching K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy Period will receive fenofibrate 145 mg once daily and placebo matching K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 40-week Extension Period.  
From Visit 7 (Week 12), patients not on sta tins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may 
initiate therapy, and patients receiving statins,  ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may alter 
their dose, as indicated by [CONTACT_293772]. 
After Visit 8 (Week 16), patients are to retu rn to the site every [ADDRESS_641656] 
visit (Visit 11 [Week 52]). Table 2 presents the clinical evaluation  schedule performed during the study.

1. Triglyceride levels are based on the mean of the Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visit 3 (Week -1) values. In cases in which a patient’s mean TG level from Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visi t 3 (Week -1) falls outs ide the required range 
for entry into the study but is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be collected 1 week (±3 days) later (Vis it 3.1). If Visit 3.1 is required, the TG qualifying 
period will be extended, and Visit 4 will occur 1 week (±3 days) after Visit 3.1. If a third sample is collected, entry into th e 12-week Efficacy Period is based on the mean of  the values from Visit 2 (Week -2), Visit 3 
(Week -1), and Visit 3.1. 
2. Visit 1 for patients who require a washout is at Week -8. Visit 1 for patients who do not require a washout is at Week -6. 
3. Height is measured at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6) only.

4.3 STUDY DRUG DISCONTINUATION CRITE
RIA 
It will be necessary to make a distinction between patients who prematurely discontinue 
study drug treatment and those who wit hdraw from the study for any reason.  
If the patient discontinues study drug, the re ason should be captured and could include 
the following: 
1. The patient requests discon tinuation of the study drug; 
2. The patient begins to take any medica tion(s) that is co ntraindicated by [CONTACT_12695];

compromise the patient’s safety to continue the study drug; 
4. The patient meets any of the crite ria specified in Section 4.6;  
5. A female patient becomes pregnant during the study; 
6. In the Investigator’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best interests; or 
7. The patient is unblinded. 
During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients who discontinue study drug prematurely 
will remain in the study until Visit 7 (Week 12). However, patients who discontinue 
study drug during the 40-week Extension Period  will be required to withdraw from the 
study and requested to complete the full pane l of assessments scheduled for the Early 
Termination (ET) Visit (see Section 4.4). If a patient w ho has discontinued study drug 
fails to attend any follow-up appointments, r easonable efforts (telephone calls to family 
members or friends, e-mail contacts, etc.) will be made in order to encourage the patient to complete the study visits. 
Although a patient is not obligated to give  his/her reason for discontinuing study drug, 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effo rt to obtain the reason while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. The reason for disconti nuation of study drug must be documented in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF). The Clinical Study Report (C SR) will include the 
reason(s) for discontinuation of study drug. Patients will not be allowed to restart the study drug in the event of discontinuation; 
however, study drug may be restarted in ca ses of study drug in terruption due to 
temporary use of prohibited medication(s). 
4.[ADDRESS_641657] the remaining study visits as outlined in the protocol through Visit 7 
(Week 12). At a minimum, measurements of  lipid parameters at key time points, 
particularly Visit 7 (Week 12), should be ta ken for all study patients, regardless of 
adherence to therapy or study pr otocol. If a patient fails to actively maintain contact [CONTACT_293774], reason able efforts (telephone calls to family members or friends, e-mail 
contacts, etc.) will be made in order to enc ourage the patient to complete the study visits.

Patients who choose to withdraw consent wi ll be asked to document withdrawal of 
consent in writing. 
Although a patient is not obligated to give his/her reason for withdrawing prematurely, 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effo rt to obtain the reason while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. The reason for withdrawal  from the study must be documented in the 
eCRF. The CSR will include the reason(s) withdrawal from the study. 
If a patient withdraws prematurely from th e study, study staff will make every effort to 
complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the ET Visit.  
If a patient withdraws from the study due to an  AE, the patient will be asked to return to 
the site for, at a minimum, the evaluations scheduled for the ET Visit. If the AE has still 
not resolved, additional follow-up will be performed, as appropriate, and documented in the patient’s medical records. As a mi nimum requirement, ongoing AEs are to be 
followed for 30 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. If patients are lost to

4.5 RE-SCREENING OF SCREEN FAILURES 
Patients who are screen failures for a modifiable condition (such as elevated HbA 1c or 
uncontrolled hypertension), other than failing the TG criteria, can be re-screened once 
and enrolled in the study at a future date if  they are then deemed eligible for study 
participation based on protocol entry criteri a after having medications adjusted and 
stabilized. Before each patient is re-screene d, the Investigator should discuss the case 
with the Medical Monitor.

Investigators should be vi gilant for potential cases of panc reatitis. If a patient experiences 
abdominal pain or unexplained gastrointes tinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhea), they should return to  the site for an unscheduled visit as soon as possible. A 
history including symptoms, concomitant medication and dietary and alcohol intake, a 
physical examination, and laboratory evaluation of TG, amylase and lipase, as well as any other evaluations deemed necessary by [CONTACT_293777]. Patients who are diagnosed with  pancreatitis; who 
have elevations of amylase or lipase, with  or without symptoms; or who have severe 
abdominal pain, or sustained (>7 days), unexplained abdominal pain, even without 
elevations of amylase or lipase should have their cases submitted for adjudication of pancreatitis.

investigative sites so that sites may conduct urine pregnanc y tests at Visit 4 (Day 1), 
Visit 7 (Week 12), Visit 9 (Week 28), and Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. 
 Liver Function Test Elevations 
With any of the following liver function test elevations, patients should undergo repeat laboratory measurements as soon as possible, preferably within 72 hours (unless otherwise specified), and no later than 1 week. Local laboratory measurements may be 
used to facilitate follow-up: 
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN; 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and bilirubin >2 × ULN or INR >1.5 × ULN; 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appear ance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever,  rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%); and 
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN, regardless of symptoms should be followed up within 
[ADDRESS_641662], ALT, prothrombin time/INR, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransfer ase, creatinine, CK, and complete viral 
hepatitis screen. The patient should be que stioned regarding symptoms, as well as 
potential causative factors. This informati on, including results an d normal ranges of any 
laboratory parameters collected at a local laboratory, should be collected on the 
appropriate eCRF. Hepatobiliar y ultrasonography and/or consu ltation with a hepatologist 
should be considered if  clinically indicated. 
Abnormal laboratory parameters should be follo wed at least weekly (more frequently as 
clinically indicated) until they have returned to baseline or have stabilized. 
 Creatine Kinase Elevations 
In the event of a CK elevation >5 × ULN, the patient should return to the site within 1 week for evaluation.  
For a CK elevation >10 × ULN, study drug should be interrupted immediately while 
awaiting evaluation.  Evaluation should include the patient being qu estioned about symptoms (e.g., muscle or 
tendinous pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or weakness) and potential causes for the CK elevation 
(e.g., medications, exercise, or trauma). The following laboratory measurements should be obtained: CK, CK-MB, CK-MM, troponin, creatinine, myoglobin (serum and urine), transaminases, total bilirubin, and urinal ysis including urine sediment. A physical 
examination should be performed, documenting findings such as muscle tenderness, weakness, or rash. An ECG should be collected as well. This information should be collected on the appropriate eCRF. For abnormalities to be reported as AEs, see 
Appendix D for a list of muscle AE definitions. 
Abnormalities should be followed until they have returned to baseline, or the Investigator 
considers them clinically stable. 
 Triglyceride Elevations 
For alerts due to fasting TG levels > 2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L), the patient should 
return to the site wi thin 1 week for clini cal and laboratory assessments. Patients should be 
assessed for potential signs or symptoms of  pancreatitis (including measurements of 
serum amylase and lipase), and a repeat assess ment of fasting TG will be obtained. For 
patients with asymptomatic elevations of TG, compliance with study drug and lifestyle 
recommendations should be assessed and reinforced. Patients should be closely followed 
for the emergence of signs and symptoms  of pancreatitis until TG levels are 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L). If 2 consecutive alerts for a patient are sent due to 
elevated TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmo l/L), the Investigator may contact [CONTACT_293779]. 
To maintain the integrity of the blind, TG  values from post-randomization blood samples 
obtained prior to Visit 8 (Week 16), run by [CONTACT_2237], will not be communicated to the sites (see Section 6.6).

For eGFR <30 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_641663] weekly (more frequently as clinically indi cated) until they have returned to baseline 
or have stabilized. 
 Electrocardiogram and Vital Signs 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be performed at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6), Visit 4 (Day 1), 
Visit 7 (Week 12), and Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. Site personnel will make 
every attempt to perform a patient’s ECG using the same equipment at each visit. 
Vital signs (heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure) will be assessed at all study 
visits. All blood pressure measurements will be obtained after a 5-minute rest in the 
sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_103645] a standard  mercury sphygmomanometer or an automated 
oscillometric blood pressure monitor. Heart ra te measurements will be made by [CONTACT_293780] (heartbeats) for a period of 30 sec onds and multiplying this value by 2 to obtain 
the rate per minute. Whenever possible, the same person will do all of the assessments for 
a given patient throughout the study. 
 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6), Visit 4 (Day 1), Visit 7 (Week 12), and Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. The physical examination will consist of an examination of the following body systems: general appearance; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; head  and neck; chest and lungs; cardiovascular; 
abdomen; musculoskeletal; lymphatic; dermat ological; neurological; mental status; and 
extremities. 
 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics and brief, relevant medical/socia l and surgical history, as well as alcohol 
consumption, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes history, and family history of heart disease will be taken at Visit 1 (Week -8  or Week -6) and recorded in the eCRF.  
 Body Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, and Waist Circumference 
Body weight, height, and waist circumference will be measured at Visit 1 (Week -8 or 
Week -6). Body weight and height will be us ed to calculate the BMI. Body weight and 
waist circumference will also be measured at Visit 4 (Day 1), Visit 7 (Week 12), and 
Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure. Starting at the top of the hip bone then bringing the tape measure all the way 
around, level with the navel. The tape m easure should be snug around the waist, but 
without compressing the skin, and parallel w ith the floor. Patients should not hold their 
breath while measuring waist circumference.

6.1 STUDY BLINDING A ND RANDOMIZATION 
This is a multi-center, placebo-controlled,  randomized, double-blind 12-week study with 
a 40-week, active-controlled, double-blind exte nsion. Patients will be randomly assigned 
in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with either K-877 0.2 mg twice daily or a matching placebo 
twice daily. An Interactive Response Technol ogy (IRT) system will be used to perform 
the randomization. At Visit 7 (Week 12), patients who were randomized to receive 
K-[ADDRESS_641665] of an 8-digit number and will be assigned based on the pre-printed 
value on the selected central laboratory re quisition binder. Patient numbers will be 
composed of a 5-digit site  identification (ID) plus a 3-digit patient ID, assigned 
sequentially starting at [ADDRESS_641666] patient at each site. 
The patient number will be used to iden tify the patient throughout  the study and will be 
entered on all documentation. A patient number will not be assigned to more than 1 patient. If a patient is not eligible to 
receive treatment, or should a patient disc ontinue from the study, the patient number 
cannot be reassigned to another patient. 
At Visit 4 (Day 1), qualified patients who m eet all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria will receive the randomly assigned treatment. The Investigator or 
designee must contact [CONTACT_293782]. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_293783] (not on statin th erapy versus currently 
receiving statin therapy). 
Investigators will be blinded to key results fr om lipid parameters, such as TG and LDL-C, 
obtained prior to Visit 8 (W eek 16), in order to maintain the blind of the treatment 
assignments. Investigators are encouraged not to check lipid panels locally, especially 
during the 12-week Efficacy Period to avoid becoming unblinded. Beginning at Week 16, 
Investigators will receive unblinded lipid data . Investigators will receive an alert for 
TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) at any time during the study. To ensure study blinding can be maintained, Investigators may receive a sham alert for TG elevation 
during the 12-week Efficacy Period (see Section 6.6).

Sites will receive an alert for any reported TG leve l >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) during 
the study. In order to maintain the study blind during the placebo-controlled 12-week 
Efficacy Period, sites may receive a sham aler t. A sham alert is an alert which will be 
sent to a site for randomly selected patients who do not actually meet the alert criteria for 
TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L). These alerts will be programmed to occur in 
patients assigned to K-877, at the expected (l ow) frequency that they would occur in the 
placebo population, and will be indistinguisha ble from “true” alerts. Investigators are 
expected to respond to every alert (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

access limited to the Investigator and the site  staff. The permitted excursion temperature 
range is 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
7.5 DISPENSING AND ADMINISTRATION OF TREATMENT 
Study drugs will be dispensed to eligible pati ents beginning at Visit 4 (Day 1) after 
randomization via the IRT system and at Visit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7 (Week 12), Visit 8 (Week 16), Visit 9 (Week 28), and Visit 10 (Week 40). From Visit 4 (Day 1) to Visit 6 (Week 8), an approximately 1-month supply of blinded study drug will be dispensed to patients at each visit. Each patient will receive [ADDRESS_641670] of 
K-877 0.2  mg or matching placebo. At Visit 7 (Week 12), an approximately 1-month supply of blinded study drug will  be dispensed. Each patient will receive [ADDRESS_641671] of fenofibrate 145 mg or matching 
placebo. From Visit 8 (Week 16) to Visit 10 (Week 40), an approximately 3-month 
supply of blinded study drug will  be dispensed at each visit.  Each patient will receive 
3 blister cards of K-877 0.2 mg or matching placebo, and 3 blister cards of fenofibrate 
145 mg or matching placebo. 
 Drug Administration 
Patients will receive an oral dose of K- 877 0.2 mg or matching placebo twice daily 
starting at Visit 4 (Day 1) unt il Visit 7 (Week 12). Starting at  Visit 7 (Week 12), patients 
will receive an oral dose of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily and placebo matching fenofibrate 
once daily, or fenofibrate 145 mg once dail y and placebo matching K-877 twice daily. 
Patients may take study drug in a fed or fasted state (before or after meals); however, 
patients should be instructed that fed/fasted state and dosing time should remain consistent for all doses throughout the study.  Study drug will be dispensed at Visit 4 
(Day 1) through Visit 10 (Week 40). Patients will be instru cted by [CONTACT_498774], Inc.  
K-877-301, Study Protocol K-[ADDRESS_641672] any signifi cant departure from the dosing instructions 
(e.g., misuse or overdose) as a protocol deviation. A record of the number of 
tablets/capsules dispensed, taken, and return ed for each patient must be documented on 
the Drug Accountability Log and eCRF. Comp liance will be assessed from information 
recorded in the eCRF, including study drug c ount and the start and end date of therapy. 
Patients will be considered compliant if th ey have taken between 80% and 120% of the 
intended regimen. 
During the treatment period, if compliance is  not between 80% and 120%, inclusive, the 
patient will be counseled about the importance of compliance with the regimen. See 
Section 7.5.1 for study drug administration. 
7.7 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
Sites will be instructed to maintain drug accoun tability and retain al l used, partially used, 
and unused study drug materials until the end of the study. 
7.8 PROCEDURE FOR UNBLINDING 
As needed, the randomization code may be broken by [CONTACT_293790]. If possible, the Medica l Monitor will be contact[CONTACT_293791]. 
For each patient, the treatment group can be unblinded using the IRT system and the 
site’s Emergency Unblinding IRT Code, provided with the site’s study start-up materials. 
Using the Emergency Unblinding IRT Code, the Investigator or designee will be able to 
unblind a patient by [CONTACT_498775], the study’s Medical Monitor,  the Clinical Trial 
Manager, and designated KRI personnel will be notified that the unblinding has taken 
place. 
If it becomes necessary to unbl ind treatment information during the study, the reason for 
unblinding must be documented in the eCRF. The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_498776] 
(e.g., unblinding due to a serious AE [SAE]) . Patients whose treatment assignment is 
unblinded are no longer eligib le to receive treatment. Patients unblinded during the 
12-week Efficacy Period should complete the 12-week Efficacy Period. Patients who are 
unblinded in the 40-week Extension Period mu st be discontinued from the study after ET 
assessments are completed (see Section 6.3).

 Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes 
The Investigator or designee will provide TLC instructions based on the NCEP 
recommendations (see Appendix E) with implementation beginning at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6). From Visit 4 (Day 1), the Investigator or designee will instruct patients to stably maintain these lifestyle changes. Goals and recommendations on diet,
[ADDRESS_641676]. A ny worsening of the patient’s disease under 
study or other medical conditions will also be considered to be an AE, unless it is within 
the normal range of disease fluctuation for that patient. 
Clinically meaningful (for a given patient) changes in physical ex amination findings and 
abnormal objective test findings (e.g., clinical laboratory tests, ECGs) will also be 
recorded as AEs. The criteria for determini ng whether an abnormal objective test finding 
will be reported as an AE are as follows: 
1. Test result is associated with  accompanying symptoms, and/or; 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/sur gical intervention, 
and/or; 
3. Test result leads to a change in stud y drug dosing or discontinuation from the 
study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or; 
4. Test result leads to any of  the outcomes included in th e definition of an SAE.  
Merely repeating a test, in the absence of  any of the above conditions, does not meet 
condition number [ADDRESS_641677] result that is determined to  be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins af ter the start of study 
drug or an event that begins before the start of the study drug and worsens in intensity 
after starting treatment with the study drug. 
9.[ADDRESS_641678] related to any dose will be considered adverse drug reactions. The phras e “responses to a medicinal product” means 
that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and the AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility (see Section 9.3). 
9.[ADDRESS_641679] occurred, they will be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF and in the

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 44 of 77 patient’s medical record. If known, the diagnos is should be recorded, in preference to the 
listing of individual signs and symptoms. 
Adverse event assessment and reporting begins w ith the signing of informed consent, and 
occurs at every scheduled study visit thr ough Visit 11 (Week 52), unless an unresolved 
AE is still being followed (see Section 9.4). The severity (intensity) of AEs will be classified as follows: 
• Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102], causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with  everyday activities;  
• Moderate: An AE that causes enough di scomfort to inte rfere with normal 
everyday activities and may require intervention; and 
• Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities;  
o Note: Treatment or interventi on will usually be required.  
The Investigator will make a judgment regard ing whether or not the AE was related to 
the study drug. The following factors should be considered: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration- 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event s hould be evaluated in the clinical 
context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
o Each report should be evaluated in th e context of the natural history and 
course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient may 
have. 
• Concomitant drugs- 
o The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whet her any of them might be recognized 
to cause the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may i ndicate whether a par ticular response is 
likely to be a class effect. 
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the patient and 
provide a logical and better explanation for the event. 
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 45 of 77 The relationship of an AE to the admini stration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
• Definite: An AE which is consistent w ith the suspected ty pe of reaction known 
for the drug, in line with the reasonable temporal order after treatment, and is 
alleviated or disappears upon di scontinuation of the study drug; 
• Probable: An AE which is consistent w ith the suspected ty pe of reaction known 
for the drug, in line with the reasonable tem poral order after trea tment, alleviates 
or disappears upon discontinuation of the st udy drug, but could also be caused by 
[CONTACT_293795];  
• Possible: An AE which is consistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with the reasona ble temporal order after treatment, and 
could also be caused by [CONTACT_46685] c onditions of the study patient or other 
factors;  
• Improbable: An AE which is inconsistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with the reas onable temporal order after treatment, 
and could also be caused by [CONTACT_293796]; and 
• Not related: An AE which is inconsistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with th e reasonable temporal order from 
administration of the study drug, or that can  be easily explained by [CONTACT_1604], 
such as underlying diseases, complication, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatment.  
If the causality assessment for an individual ev ent is “Definite,” “Pr obable,” or “Possible,” 
the event will be considered a suspected adverse drug reaction.  
The Investigator will evaluate any changes in laboratory values, make a determination as 
to whether or not the change is clinically important, and whether or not the changes were 
related to the study drug. Howeve r, even if the Investigator feels there is no relationship 
to the study drug, the AE or laboratory abnormality MUST be recorded in the eCRF. 
The Investigator will record the action taken to treat the AE, if any, the action taken with 
study treatment, and the outcome for each AE in the eCRF according to the following: 
Action taken to treat the AE 
• None, 
• Treatment required,

Outcome 
• Resolved: The event has recovered;

• Resolved with sequelae: The study pati ent has recovered as much as may be 
expected but is left with sequelae of th e event that are not expected to recover 
further;  
o Note: If the sequelae are severe enough to represent a significant disability 
or incapacity then the event s hould be reported as an SAE. 
• Resolving: Can be used in cases wher e study patient is known to be clearly 
recovering from the event at the end of a study, although the event is not yet 
resolved, and the Investigator and Medical Monitor agree that further follow-up is 
not necessary; 
• Death: The study patient died as a result of the AE;  
o Note: Death is considered an outcome of an AE rather than an AE in its own 
right, and the cause of death should be  recorded as the AE. There may be 
rare circumstances where the cause of  death is unknown and the death may 
have to be recorded as  the event (e.g., “sudden cardiac death”). Adverse 
events resulting in death are SAEs. 
• Not resolved: The patient has an AE that has not improved or recuperated at the time of the report; or 
o Note: The decision not to continue follow-up should be discussed between the Investigator and Medical Monitor and recorded in the source documents. 
• Unknown: The outcome of the event is ge nuinely unknown in spi[INVESTIGATOR_293746].

appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in d eath or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_293747].  
10.1 LIFE-THREATENING ADVERSE EVENT 
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at  the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as  an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,  or congenital anomaly), the Investigator 
will follow the procedures for reporting an SAE (see Section 10.6). 
10.4 PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 
If a patient experiences an AE that leads to  discontinuation of study drug treatment and/or 
withdrawal from the study, th e eCRF will identify the AE as the reason for study drug 
discontinuation or withdrawal. 10.5 SERIOUS UNEXPECTED SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS 
According to FDA CFR 312.32(a), FDA Guid ance “Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Bioava ilability/Bioequivalence (BA/BE) Studies” 
finalized December 2012, European Directives 2001/20/EC and CT-[ADDRESS_641683] caused the AE. The phrase “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the AE and the medicinal product 
(see Section 9.3). 
The following are examples of types of eviden ce that would suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angi oedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome); or 
• One or more occurrences of an event that  is not commonly asso ciated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in  the population exposed to the drug 
(e.g., tendon rupture).  
A suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Reference Safety Information in Section 6 of  the K-877 Investigator’s Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that ha s been described in th e K-877 Investigator’s 
Brochure or the approved package insert of fe nofibrate. Study sites will be provided with 
the current version of the fenofibrate package insert. The Sponsor will report suspected unexpected  serious adverse reac tions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to 
Investigators, Competent Authorities, and IRB/ECs in an expedited manner according to 
national requirements. Fatal and life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported within 
[ADDRESS_641684] be repor ted to  within 
24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the 
aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to study drug occurring after the [ADDRESS_641685] be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form el ectronically in the el ectronic data capture 
(EDC) system for the study. When the form is completed,  will 
be notified electronically and wi ll retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC syst em, send an email to  
 or call  
 and fax the completed paper SAE form to  
) within [ADDRESS_641686] Information:  
 
 
 
 
 Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until 
the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the patient dies. 
Within [ADDRESS_641687] update the

 STATISTICAL METHOD S AND DATA ANALYSIS 
11.1 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION 
Approximately 630 patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) will be randomized in  a 2:1 ratio into one of the following 
treatment groups: K-[ADDRESS_641689] of male and female patients ≥18 years of age with 
fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) after 
washout from background lipid-altering therapy other than statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors and with normal renal function. The active-controlled study population will 
consist of patients who complete the 12-week portion of the efficacy study and who continue the study. 
 Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who take at least 
[ADDRESS_641690] 1 PK sample.  
11.3 DEMOGRAPHIC/BASELINE INFORMATION 
Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_293799] (e.g., age, 
gender, race, and ethnicity).  
Baseline for TG, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LD L-C, and remnant cholesterol will be 
defined as the mean of Visit 4 (Day 1) and the preceding TG qualifying visit (either 
Visit 3 [Week -1] or Visit 3.1, if required) measurements. Baseline for all other efficacy 
and safety variables will be defined as Visit 4 (Day 1). If the measurement at this visit is 
missing, the last measurement prior to the first dose of randomized study drug will be 
used. 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_641691] dose of study drug plus 1. 
Patient compliance with the study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_293800]. 
Prior/concomitant medications will be coded with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) class and preferred term (defined by [CONTACT_293801]) and summarize d by [CONTACT_293802]. 
 

CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-301, Study Protocol K-[ADDRESS_641692], followed by [CONTACT_293767], tested in  the following hierarchical 
manner: percent change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) remnant 
cholesterol (calculated as TC −  LDL-C − HDL-C), (2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, and 
(4) non-HDL-C. Each test is planned to be  performed at a 0.05 significance level. 
Inferential conclusions about these efficacy endpoints will requi re statistical significance 
of the previous one. 
For other efficacy endpoints, nominal p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will 
be presented, but should not be  considered as confirmatory. 
 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Parameters 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on Hodges-Lehmann estimator with 
pattern-mixture model imputation based on the FAS. The pattern-mixture model will be used as the primary imputation method as part of the primary analysis for the percent change in fasting TGs from baseline to Week 12. This imputation model will include 
factors such as patient demographics, disease status, and baseline TG, as well as adherence to therapy. The imputation model will impute missing Week 12 TG values as follows: 
• For patients who do not adhere to th erapy and who do not have a Week [ADDRESS_641693] a Week 12 measurement; 
and 
• If there are no patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to therapy 
and have a Week 12 measurement, missi ng Week 12 TG values will be imputed 
as follows: 
o For the K-[ADDRESS_641694] is considered washed out and 
baseline TG values will be used to impute the Week 12 TG values; and 
o For the placebo arm, missing Week [ADDRESS_641695] error will be combined to produce treatment difference estimate and 95% CI and 
p-value. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-301, Study Protocol K-[ADDRESS_641696]
atistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile) at baseline, each scheduled visit, and 
change and percent change in fasting TG from baseline to each scheduled visit will be 
provided. 
 Analysis of Secondary and Expl oratory Efficacy Parameters 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included in the hierarchical step-down testing procedure 
include percent change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) remnant 
cholesterol, (2) HDL-C, (3 ) Apo A1, and (4) non-HDL-C. 
The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints during the 12-week Efficacy Period will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model w ith the same imputation method used for 
the primary analysis. The ANCOVA model will include country, current statin therapy use (not on statin th erapy versus currently receiving statin therapy), and treatment as 
factors; baseline value as a covariate. If  the normality assumption is not met, the 
Hodges-Lehmann estimator with the same imputation method used for the primary analysis will be used. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint of percent change in fasting TG from baseline to 
Week [ADDRESS_641697], such as liver function tests and pancreatitis events, will be summarized. 
Vital signs and 12-lead ECGs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_105289], 
along with the changes from baseline.

*Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary sy ndromes, history of MI, stable or unstabl e angina, coronary or other arterial 
revascularization, stroke, TIA, or peripheral arterial  disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. 
†Contraindications, warnings, and precautions are defined for each statin according to the manufacturer’s prescribing informati on. 
‡Individuals with secondary causes of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_293759]. A TG level ≥500 mg/dL was an 
exclusion criterion for almost all RCTs. Ther efore, ruling out secondary causes is necessary to avoid inappropriate statin ther apy.  
§No RCTs included only individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. However, many trials did include individuals with 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, and all of these trials consistently demonstrated  a reduction in ASCVD events. In addition, the Cholesterol 
Treatment Trialists meta-analyses have shown that each 39-mg /dL reduction in LDL-C with statin therapy reduced ASCVD 
events by 22%, and the relative reductions in  ASCVD events were consistent across the range of LDL-C levels. Therefore, 
individuals with primary LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL should be treated with stain therapy. 
ǁEstimated 10-year or “hard” ASCVD risk includes first occurrence of nonfatal MI, coronary heart disease death, and nonfatal and  
fatal stroke as used by [CONTACT_293809][INVESTIGATOR_293760].

Safety  
1. To maximize the safety of statins, selection of the appropriate statin 
and dose in men and nonpregnant/ nonnursing women should be based 
on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD* risk, and potential for adverse effects. Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used in 
individuals in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be 
recommended when characteristics predisposing them to statin-
associated adverse effects are present. Characteristics predisposing individuals to statin adverse effects 
include but are not limited to: 
• Multiple or serious comorbidities, including impaired renal or hepatic function; 
• History of previous statin into lerance or muscle disorders; 
• Unexplained ALT elevations ≥[ADDRESS_641712]; 
• Patient characteristics or concomitant  use of drugs affecting statin 
metabolism; 
• Age >75 years; and 
• Additional characteristics that could modify the decision to use higher statin intensities might include but are not limited to: 
o History of hemorrhagic stroke, and  
o Asian ancestry. A (Strong) I B

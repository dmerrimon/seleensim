2.0 Objectives  
Aim 1 (Phase 1) . Refine a treatment protocol for preoperative education and training and 
postoperative application of VR -BF in children and adolescents undergoing surgery. We 
will collect qualitative feedback (regarding content, usability, perceived benefits) via 
questionnaires and a semi -structured interview and sensitivity to change of key physiological 
parameters (heartrate variability, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) from 12 -32 patients ( 12-18 years) undergoing 
surgery anticipated to cause moderate to severe pain. Purposive sampling will be used to obtain a 
representative sample of a broad patient population. Treatment protocol refinement using iterative 
methodology will allow us to define the trial protocol, including frequency and duration of ( 1a) 
preoperative education and training and ( 1b) postoperative administration of VR -BF.

V8 – 08/18/22  Page 3 of 25  HRP -503  v.12.10.18  Aim 2 (Phase 2) . Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347392] -BF in children and adolescents undergoing 
surgery.  Seventy children and adolescents ( 12-18 years) scheduled for surgeries anticipated to 
cause moderate to severe pain will be randomized to receive VR -BF or active control 
(commercially available Manage My Pain application). Manage My Pain is engaging but lacks 
specific instruct ion in behavior change techniques, a key feature of VR- BF. It is included as the 
control arm to confirm appropriateness for use in the future efficacy trial. Specifically, ( 2a)  
Feasibility  w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_347434], enrollment and ran domization, 
retention, and adherence. Target goals will be set at 80% for each assessment. (2b ) Acceptability  
will be assessed by [CONTACT_3148]/study burden, satisfaction, treatment credibility, and tolerability. It is essential that both treatment arms are feasible and acceptable for use in an efficacy trial.  
 
Our central hypothesis i
 s that preoperative education and training combined with independent, 
self-directed, repeated postoperative use of VR- BF will be feasible and acceptable in this 
population. This proposal addresses key components necessary for the design of a large- scale, 
clinical efficacy trial.

Children and adolescents are at risk of persistent pain5,60,62,63 and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]65 after surgery. 
Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is defined as pain extending beyond that expected from 
surgery. A recent study identified an approximate 20% incidence of CPSP in children.5 While 
80% of these patients recover without issue, about 20% maintain a reduced quality of life due to persistent pain.

pain management.64 A study of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-naïve patients (13-21 years) who underwent one of 13 
surgeries found persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_83223] 4.8% of adolescents compared to 0.1% in a matched, 
nonsurgical cohort.58 In a study assessing patients with chronic pain using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], more than 
25% of patients transitioned to chronic use after receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_347396].[ADDRESS_431749] of persistent pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d use . 
 Mind -body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], like biofeedback (BF), provide sustained pain reduction,
8-18,22,66-[ADDRESS_431750] the potential to reduce pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_347395], but there are barriers to their routine use in pos toperative
72,73 and inpatient settings.74 BF reduces pain8,75 by [CONTACT_347435]’s 
perception of that pain, resulting in improved physical, mental, and emotional health.19,20 By 
[CONTACT_347436], patients increase their heartrate variability (HRV),[ADDRESS_431751] to the 
availability of trained providers in inpatient and acute settings.8,9,77 Further, application of BF 
uses various computerized instruments to provide instantaneous data to patients to teach and reinforce physiological self -regulation. Because BF is so resource- intensive, widespread 
application has not been possible.
78 As such, BF is not available to help manage pain in children

temporarily reduce pain in multiple clinical situations .25-28,32-34,36,46,[ADDRESS_431752] coupled with daily, 10- minute home practice 
sessions.20 In studies of adult and pediatric migraine patients, home practice between formal 
sessions enhanced BF efficacy.95,96 For postsurgical pain, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732] ( CCHMC IRB #2018-

literature does not provide a model for VR-BF dosing. Aim 1b will help determine the 
appropriate frequency and duration of VR-BF to help identify the appropriate “dose” of therapy 
following surgery . 
 
This proposed study seeks to establish measurable milestones that have not been addressed 
in prior studies.  Aim [ADDRESS_431754] the VR -BF intervention105 and,

P
ILOT DATA (CCHMC IRB #2018 -2892) 
Recruitment data.  I n FY2020, a total of 25,122 surgeries were performed at Cincinnati 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Of those, 952 patients were followed by [CONTACT_347440]. Between November 2018 and March 
2020, we conducted two pi[INVESTIGATOR_347398]-D and biofeedback- based VR (VR -BF). We 
screened 550 patients. Based on eligibility criteria, 95 (17%) were ineligible. We approached 235 patients after surgery. Of those approached, 82% were interested in the study and 43% w ere 
successfully recruited and 
completed the study. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_347399], many e ligible 
patients declined enrollment due to feeling tired, being in too

(b) anxiety sensitivity (Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index, CASI).108,109 Children played one of three 
games (all provided a similar distraction -based experience) for ten minutes. Patients were asked 
to rate their pain  intensity, pain unpleasantness, and anxiety using the numerical rating scale 
(NRS)110,111 immediately and 15 and 30 minutes after the VR session. Pain intensity decreased by 
[CONTACT_2902] 1 point immediately following the session ( p<0.0001), and this change remained significant 
at 15 minutes (0.4 points, p=0.02) but not at 30 minutes. Pain unpleasantness decreased 
significantly (1.5 points, p<0.0001) immediately following the VR -D session and this change 
remained significant at 15 (0.8 points, p=0.0008) and 30 minutes (0.33 points, p =0.0001) 
following session completion. We found only minimal associations of VR- D with anxiety. 
Anxiety decreased from baseline by [CONTACT_2902] 1 point immediately following the session ( p<0.0001) 
and remained lower at 15 minutes (0.4 points, p=0.0014) but was no longer significant at 30 
minutes. Levels of pain catastrophizing and anxiety sensitivity were not associated with changes 
in pain and anxiety. No patients experienced adverse effects related to VR- D. Small, transient 
changes in pain and anxiety were associated with a single, 10-minute postoperative VR-D  
session . These results informed our decision to explore integration of a mind-body therapy with 
VR using a commercially available VR application. 
 
Reduction of pain and anxiety with VR- BF. In a follow -up study, patients (n=51) were 
recruited from the Acute Pain Service over 8 months (Table 1) using the same eligibility criteria  
used in the VR-D pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The same approach was used as described above but instead of receiving a single, 10- minute VR -D 
session, patients underwent a single, 10-minute session using Mindful Aurora , an application t hat engages patients in guided 
relaxation and slow breathing. Moderate changes in pain intensity 
and pain unpleasantness and small changes in anxiety were found to 
be associated with the VR -BF session (Figure 2). Pain intensity 
decreased by [CONTACT_2902] 1 point immediately ( p=0.002) and 30 minutes 
(p= 0.028) following VR-BF but was not significant at 15 minutes. Pain unpleasantness decreased by [CONTACT_2902] 1.5 points immediately 
(p=0.001), 1.1 points at 15 ( p=0.025), and 2 points at 30 minutes 
(p=0.001) following VR -BF. Anxiety decreased by [CONTACT_2902] 0.9 points 
immediately following VR -BF (p=0.008); changes were not 
significant at 15 or 30 minutes. Anxiety sensitivity was associated 
with greater reductions in pain intensity (Beta (SE) = -0.06 (0.03), 
p=0.0426) and pain unpleasantness (Beta (SE) = - 0.09 (0.04), 
p=0.0111). Pain catastrophizing was not associated with changes in outcomes. No patients experienced adverse effects related to VR -BF. 
Small, transient changes in pain and anxiety were associated with a 
single postoperative VR -BF session . These results highlighted the 
need for preoperative education and training and multiple sessions 
after surgery to likely produce greater and more sustained 
reductions in pain.20,78,112 
 
Patient and  family satisfaction.  Qualitative data from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_347402]. Survey data showed 94% of patients in the VR -D pi[INVESTIGATOR_17371] 96% of patients in the VR-BF pi[INVESTIGATOR_347403] “ recommend friends or 
family to try VR during their visits.” Although the survey data clearly expressed the overwhelming positive attitude that patients had toward VR, it was unable to capture the 
magnitude of patient engagement and satisfaction best told through patient experiences. An Figure 2. Changes in

his family purchased a VR headset for use during his rehabilitation. Acceptance and appreciation 
of VR treatment by [CONTACT_347442]. According to survey data of parents of 
enrolled patients, 95% of parents from the VR- D and 100% of parents from the VR -BF pi[INVESTIGATOR_347404]. Pare nts consistently exhibited tangible changes in 
emotion and disposition when watching their child use VR. Fatigue and stress were suddenly replaced by [CONTACT_347443]. In addition to enthusiastic patient and family feedback, 
surgeons have also been highly engaged, with one expressing that “ this innovative therapy will 
help transform how we deliver postoperative care at our institution .” Another, while initially 
skeptical, received so much positive feedback from his patients enrolled in our studies that he has engaged us to apply VR to patients in one of his NIH- funded trials. These anecdotal reports of 
improvements in pain, mood, and positive reports from patients, families, and providers show 
high acceptance of VR therapy . This level of engagement will  be crucial for integration of VR- BF 
into postoperative pain management . 
 
4.0 Study Endpoints  
Primary endpoint: Successful accrual  of patients  and completion of study  
 Secondary endpoints: Refinement of VR- BF platform; protocol for preoperative education 
training in and postoperative delivery of VR- BF; feasibility and acceptability data for clinical 
efficacy trial design;  preliminary assessment of efficacy trial outcomes. 
 
Safety endpoints: NA 
 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
Description: The VR headsets  (Oculus /Meta  Quest) used in this study are minimal risk 
devices, and because they are considered a relaxation device by [CONTACT_1622], they are not regulated. The Ocul us/Meta  Quest have been used in prior studies without any reported 
adverse events ( CCHMC IRBs #2019-1090, 2020-0258, 2020-0612 ). FOREVR VR is a 
device developed by [CONTACT_347444]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. It is a noninvasive device that 
measures respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (via chest movement) and heart rate using an ear clip. This 
device also bears minimal risk.
 It has also now been approved for clinical use at CCHMC 
by [CONTACT_347445].  
 
Back -Up Intervention:  Should there be technical challenges with FOREVR VR, we will use 
HeartMath Inner Balance as a back -up means to collect heart rate and use data 
(www.heartmath.com ), a commercially available biofeedback device. HeartMath Inner Balance is 
also considered a non- invasive device and uses an ear clip to collect heart rate data (analogous to 
FOREVR VR) . There is minimal risk with the use of this device.  
Drug/Device Handling : All equipment w ill be kept in a secured area in a locked 
cabinet/office to be used only on subjects by [CONTACT_19062]. 
 
6.0 Procedures Involved * 
Table 2  (below)  summarizes the measures and goals of this proposal.  
 
Overall experimental design. We hypothesize  that the use of VR -BF in children undergoing 
surgery resulting in moderate to severe pain will be feasible and acceptable. Findings from this

udy will be conducted in 
two phases: Phase 1 (Aim 
1) will refine our VR- BF 
intervention allowing us 
to create a treatment 
protocol for VR- BF. 
Phase 2 (Aim 2)  will 
conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347405]. Phase 2 will 
inform development of a 
manual of procedures for 
efficacy trial design and 
provide key pi[INVESTIGATOR_347406].  
 
Study population.  
 Subjects  will be recruited when scheduled for surgery at Nationwide 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will coordinate recruitment efforts with surgeons who perform surgeries 
that require pain management by [CONTACT_21172]. We will screen patient lists provided by 
[CONTACT_347446]. Messages assessing interest in the study will be sent through MyChart. We anticipate recruiting 1 patient per week. We are confident that we can 
successfully recruit and enroll our full cohort of up to 102 patients : up to 32 for Aim 1 (minimum 
12 patients) and [ADDRESS_431757] to the study arms. Therefore, the consent will describe the 
study as assessing technology-based interventions for the management of pain without specific detail about VR -BF (FOREVR VR ) or Manage My Pain or indicate the use of any device, such as 
a headset. Once assigned to a group, patients will receive a handout describing the intervention with instructions and information about what participation entails. We will also blind data collection by [CONTACT_2329] a s tudy number for each patient and will not indicate in which arm the patient 
is enrolled in data collection forms. The biostatistician will be blinded to the patient groups during analysis.  
 
Study Materials  
Self-reported measures. Patients will be asked to  complete a survey at the end of study 
participation as well as participate in a semi -structured interview. Parents will also be asked to 
complete a survey. The questionnaires will be completed through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.

device. When necessary, we will use the software supplied by [CONTACT_347447] ( Mindful Aurora  
application) with the Oculus /Meta  Quest.  
 
The Oculus /Meta  Quest VR devices are non -invasive, relaxation devices that are commercially 
and widely available to deliver mobile (untethered) VR content to the patient; they are not FDA 
regulated. Both devices are all -in-one headsets, so no additional hardware is requi red to deliver 
the VR experience. These devices have audio capabilities built into the headset to deliver 
instructions and application sounds, creating an immersive experience. We have used these 
devices in multiple IRBs since 2018 without any adverse events. Each VR headset will be cleaned with an alcohol or peroxide wipe according to infection control standards following use of the 
device by [CONTACT_347448] ( https://cleanboxtech.com /).  
 VR session . All participants will receive a device tutorial at the start of the study which will entail 
teaching them how to use the device and introducing them to the VR -BF software. They will be 
taught how to sync their breathing with the application. Patients will be instructed to remove the 
device should any discomfort or side effects occur, such as motion sickness, dizziness, or nausea.  
 FOREVR VR. FOREVR VR is the result of the collaboration between our research team, 
engineers at the Digital  Experience (DX) Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
programmers at House of Moves, an animation and motion capture studio in Los Angeles, [LOCATION_004]. FOREVR VR integrates real -time patient physiological data into a gamified 
environment using a chest strap (to monitor respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) and an ear clip (adapted from HeartMath, 
see below ) to measure heart rate. This technique is effective in reducing respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
consequently, increasing heartrate variability.
20,[ADDRESS_431758] is a 360 -video shot in Eden Park (a public park in Cincinnati, OH) that starts out as a stand-
still, black and white image that adds color and eventually motion as the participant achieves target heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_347407]. The second is a blooming flower scene that starts 
with a clean, blank scene that allows the participant to have a flower appear and fully bloom as 
he/she achieves target physiological parameters.   
We are currently finalizing the Mysterious Island  game with House of Moves which we plan on 
using for the study once it becomes available. In this game, participants will be transported to a 
beautiful tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347408] b reath to explore the island. As the 
patient breathes in, they will make a small rise in the VR world upwards and breathing out will 
propel forward movement. The motions are small and gentle to minimize the risk of motion 
sickness. The entire VR space syncs with the patient’s breathing. During the course of the 
experience, the participant will travel through a sunny island full of palm trees, caves, and 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347409]. The user will move towards a beach to watch the sunset. The user will also 
encounter sev eral tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347410]. The VR world will combine a total of 3 locations: a 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347411] a cave, the cave, and a beach. On the tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347412], the user will encounter a waterfall, up to 5 different tropi[INVESTIGATOR_347413], and 2 different animals 
(hippo and monkey). This experience in its entirety will take up to [ADDRESS_431759] a

Oculus /Met a Quest with the Mindful Aurora application and monitor heart rate/heart rate 
variability with the commercially available HeartMath Inner Balance device 
(www.heartmath.com ). HeartMath is a program that is used clini c ally at Cincinnati Children’s

respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and consequently, increasing heartrate variability.
20,97 This increased heartrate

Study Procedures  
Aim 1 : We will accomplish Aim [ADDRESS_431764]-op. We will use a grounded theory114,115 and thematic analysis116 approach to study design, 
data collection, and analysis.

Setting  
   
V8 – 08/18/22  Page 11 of 25  HRP -503  v.12.10.18  Research Design.  We will recruit up to 32 patients ( minimum 12 patients, 12-18 years) 
scheduled for surgery anticipated to cause moderate to severe pain with admission of at least one 
night in 
the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347415]-op to participate 
in Aim 1 
(Figure 2). 
Purposive 
sampling will be used to select a representative patient group according to age, sex, and race. We anticipate recruiting about 1 patient  per week. Patients will be identified when scheduled for 
surgery. They will receive scripted instruction on the Oculus /Meta  Quest and a tutorial on the 
biofe edback application. Once device and content education are complete, patients will receive 
manual -based training on the benefits of HRV BF.
56 They will be given the appropriate 
equipment and instructed to complete an independent daily, 10- minute session (based on the 
standard duration of a BF session ) and record each session in a log. Patients will bring the 
equipment to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347416] 1b. After surgery, patients will have free use of VR -BF. They will be instructed to undergo, at minimum, one daily, 
10-minute session. They will also be instructed to freely use VR -BF, particularly when in pain. 
They will use a log to record their VR-BF usage (date, time, and duration). Patients will be visited 
daily, or more or less  frequently as applicable/needed , to assist  with log completion and any 
issues. On the day of discharge, a study team member will conduct a detailed, semi- structured 
interview. Patients may take the VR -BF device home for up to two weeks for home pain 
management; a similar log will be used to docume nt home use. We will enroll 4 patients at a time 
and analyze data to refine the protocol in an iterative fashion; this process will be repeated until  
[ADDRESS_431765] feedback on the FOREVR VR platform content and usability, preoperative VR-BF education and training, postoperative application of VR-BF, and perceived efficacy. 
Review of patient daily use obtained from FOREVR VR will provide quantitative data about 
frequency and duration of VR- BF use. As mentioned below, we will assess sensitivity to change 
of physiological parameters (HRV, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) to different frequencies and durations of VR-
BF use (dose).

duration) of VR-BF for training and postoperative pain management to be trialed in Phase 2. Iterative refinements to the VR -BF treatment protocol will be made throughout Aim 1 based on 
this data. Refinements will be documented, tracked, and applied by [CONTACT_3476]. 
 
Aim 2 : 
 We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347417] -
BF protocol defined in Aim 1. Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_347449], enrollment and 
randomization, retention, and adherence. Acceptability will be assessed by [CONTACT_3148]/study 
burden, satisfaction, treatment credibility, and intervention tolerability. Qualitative data will also be used to assess feasibility and acceptability.  
 
P
atient Groups.  Seventy patients with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria described in Aim 1 
will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio: VR-BF or attention control condition using a web-based application ( www.randomizer.org ). The randomization scheme will be generated prior 
to the start of the study and patients will be randomized based on subject number. We will use the

Research Design (Figure 3).  Eligibility, recruitment, and study procedures will follow those 
described in Aim [ADDRESS_431768] a personal device, we will ask a parent to download the program onto his or her phone or computer. We will provide explicit instructions on how to use the application and what features 
should be used. Patients will also be instructed on how to create a daily report documenting each 
day’s use of the application prior to surgery. These daily reports will be returned to our study 
team. Like the VR -BF group, patients will receive scripted instruction on t he benefits of mind 
body therapy, will be instructed to use the application for at least 10- minutes per day for seven 
days prior to surgery, and will be asked to complete a daily report using the application each day. On the day of surgery, a study team member will visit each participant to document possession of 
the FOREVR VR platform (intervention group), to collect reports, and to any answer questions.  
 After surgery, as in Aim 1, a trained CRC will visit patients daily or as needed while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
Control group patients will complete a daily application -generated usage report (date, time, 
duration); VR- BF patients will have this information, along with HRV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_347418], 
obtained from the device. To help determine what outcomes may be im pacted by [INVESTIGATOR_6731] -BF for 
future trial development, patients will also be asked to document pain and anxiety scores before 
and after each VR -BF or application session using the NRS.
110,111 Patients will self -report and 
document the se scores before each session and then immediately, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes 
after session completion. All pain scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (in morphine equivalents 
mg/kg/day) will be collected from EPIC, the electronic medical record, for each 24 -hour period 
during study enrollment; anxiety scores are not documented by [CONTACT_347450]-
reported scores will be used. Documented pain scores will also help finalize the “dose” of VR -BF 
to be used in the efficacy trial as we will assess for cor relation, if any, between pain score and use 
of VR -BF. At the final study visit prior to discharge, patients will answer a questionnaire and 
engage in a semi- structured interview soliciting qualitative feedback about their experience with 
the intervention or control to finalize the study protocol for the clinical efficacy trial. Participants 
will be given the option to take the VR -BF platform home or continue using the Manage My Pain 
application for up to two weeks after discharge. If this option is selected, patients will complete a daily log/report documenting use, pain scores, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. During the first 
postoperative clinic visit, VR-BF and reports/logs will be collected and questions about home use 
will be asked, answered, and recorded. Parents will also be asked to complete a survey about their 
experience and opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]. If patients cannot be met during the first postoperative clinic visits, 
other arrangements will be made to collect the information and equipment.

Additional Data Collection    
The following data may be collected in the CRF: (a) type and duration of anesthesia and surgery 
where applicable; (b) anxiety and pain scores (both intensity and unpleasantness a s well as pain 
medications used to treat the patient (including doses and number of rescues); (c) satisfaction with VR device/comments; (d) desire for study team to return; (e) any critical or adverse events. 
Survey data will be captured directly into REDCap or paper forms.  
We will also collect descriptive data from the health record for each patient, such as age, sex, 
race, ethnicity, ASA status, type of surgery, diagnosis at surgery, underlying medical conditions, 
medications taken prior to surgery, and treatment history. We will record VR experience, 
presentation order, and any use of corrective lenses. Anxiety and pain will be collected with 
numerical rating scale (NRS) prior to and after the VR intervention for patients in all 3 cohorts. 
Additional out come measures will be pulled from EPIC regarding narcotic/medication 
consumption during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], all pain assessments during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and length of 
stay. We will collect all heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and FOREVR VR usage from the FOR EVR 
VR device (or HeartMath if necessary).

populations will be included. 
 
11.0 Vulnerable Populations * 
We will include children, and will not include pregnant women , and prisoners as they are 
not part of our usual patient population. 
 This study presents no more than minimal risk as it only requires use of VR- BF or 
computer application and completing questionnaires and interviews.  Study staff will discuss the study with the parents and children together, review the consent form with them, answer any questions, and obtain parental permission and assent from those children able to provide it. 
 
12.0 Local Number of Subjects

We anticipate a > 80% recruitment and retention rate 
 
 
13.0 Recruitment Methods 
Patient Recruitment. Participants who are being managed by [CONTACT_347456].  
Once  the family agrees that this is a study that they want to hear more about, a team member will 
describe the study procedures and verify eligibility criteria.  Specifically, a team member will explain the study in greater detail and invite them to participat e in the study. If the family is 
interested in proceeding to the consenting phase of the study, a team member will review the consent and assent in detail and cover all required elements of consent. The team member will 
answer any questions and verify understanding of the consent by [CONTACT_347457]. The research coordinator will give the family adequate time to review the 
consent/assent form in full on their own. It will be made clear to the family that participation is

free to withdraw at any time for any reason. 
 
Consenting/Assenting Procedures and Considerations. Due to needing subjects to begin study 
participation prior to surgery, we are requesting permission to consent by [CONTACT_648]. Consent for 
participation will be done via an  e-consent platform conducted through an application (REDCap 
or another  NCH supported application or with a paper informed consent form (ICF) provided 
ahead of time. A member of the study team will arrange for a time to discuss the study with the 
parent/LAR over the phone and answer any questions they may have about study participation. Informed consent will be documented by [CONTACT_347458]/LAR will be 
asked to sign via the e -consent platform or if using the paper ICF, to bring the original version of 
the ICF with them to the training appointment.  (see Section 12 for further detail). 
Subject/parent/guardian identity will be  verified with documentation in EPIC. 
 
Requirements. A signed consent form will be obtained from the participant. For participants who 
cannot consent for themselves, such as those below the legal age, a parent, legal guardian, or 
person with power of attor ney, must sign the consent form; additionally, the participant's assent 
must also be obtained if he or she is able to understand the nature, significance, and risks/benefits associated with the study. The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures 
to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy of the signed consent form will 
be given to the participant, parent, or legal guardian, and this fact will be documented in the 
participant’s record.  
 
Procedure. The approved, HIPAA compliant informed consent/assent will be provided to the 
study participant and the parents for review. The consent will be completed through the Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database or on paper forms (if eConsent is unavailable at the 
time of consent).  After allowing adequate time for review, the participant and parents will have 
the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers. When all questions have been answered, the 
consent and/or assent will be signed, and a si gned copy will be provided to the participant and 
parents. This will all be conducted before any study measures interventions are undertaken. 
 
Phone Consent . Due to needing subjects to begin study participation prior to surgery, we are 
requesting permission to  consent  by [CONTACT_347459] . Potential subjects may schedule surgery over the 
phone or at an in-person visit however subjects who are in person may not be available for 
approach  due time constraints or already being overwhelmed with information regarding the 
surgery.    
 
Documentation of Ineligibility .  Screen failures will be documented on the source workshe ets with 
the supporting data accompanying the eligibility screening form. Documentation of ineligibility 
or non-participation for each consented participant will be maintained in an electronic database 
(e.g., REDCap). Reports detailing the reasons for screen -failure and non- participation of eligible 
participants will reviewed by [CONTACT_347460].  
 
Payment . 
 Patients may receive a sti pend for participation, not to exceed a total of $[ADDRESS_431771] will receive up to $100 - $50 for completing all 
pre-surgery activities and an additional $50 when the device is returned. There is no difference in 
how subjects will be compensated based on the phase of the study they are in.

14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  
We do not anticipate any withdrawal of subjects or early termination.  
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects * 
There are minimal physical risks to participants and  enrollment in this study will not alter their 
management.  All patients will receive pain management per the Acute Pain Service during the 
duration of the study.  
 
Clinical Care . Enrolled patients will receive the same care and attention in the postoperative 
period or during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347421]- enrolled patients. Patients will be given the 
opportunity to end participation in the study at any time.  
 
VR Headset . VR headsets  used in this study are  minimal risk device s, and because they are 
considered a relaxation device by [CONTACT_1622], they are not regulated. Risks specific to this research study are minimal or absent with the greatest risk being motion sickness while the headset is in 
place
113 and a theoretical risk of inducing seizures (0.025% in pediatric data supplied by a similar 
Samsung device ). Should motion sickness occur, the participant will be instructed to remove the 
device to ensure resolution of symptoms; we will exclude patients with a history of seizure disorder or other relevant neurological conditions. Other adverse events will be defined using 
standard criteria. The researchers shall monitor the patient while the device is applied. Serious 
adverse events, although unanticipated, will be reported using routine avenues. The Starlight Xperience device was used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( CCHMC IRB #2018-2892)  without any 
documentation of adverse effects. We have since purchased new headsets, the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2, which have been used in prior studies without any reported adverse events 
(CCHMC IRBs #2019 -1090, 2020- 0258, 2020 -0612 ). We will continue updating to newer 
versions of the Oculus/Meta Quest as they become available when new equipment is requir ed. 
 
FOREVR VR. This device has been approved for both research  and clinical  use by [CONTACT_347461]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. It is a noninvasive device to measure respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (via chest movement) and heart rate using an  ear clip. This device is 
also considered a minimal risk device. This is the first study to use FOREVR VR.  
 HeartMath Inner Balance.  If FOREVR VR is unable to be used, we will use HeartMath Inner 
Balance as a back -up means to collect heart rate and use data ( www.heartmath.com ), a 
commercially available biofeedback device. HeartMath Inner Balance is also considered a non-
invasive device and uses an ear clip (analogous to FOREVR VR) to collect heart rate data. There 
is minimal risk with the use of this device.  
 
W
e do not anticipate any psychological, social, legal, or economic risks to this study. We also do 
not anticipate risk to others who are not subjects in this study. 
 
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects * 
Individual study participants may derive direct benefit from participation in the study as the 
addition of VR or Manage My Pain may enhance standard pain management strategies and result 
in decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness and anxiety at the time of participation in the 
study. Participants may also have a longer lasting benefits, but these are currently unexplored, 
Feasibility and Acceptability of Technology-Based Interventions in the Perioperative 
Setting  
   
V8 – 08/18/[ADDRESS_431773] with postoperative pain control. Participation in the study may also 
decrease medication consumption; however, this potential benefit will be assessed in subsequent 
studies using the treatment protocol developed in this proposed work. Patients may receive a stipend for participation, not to exceed a total of $100 per patient. 
 
17.0 Data Management * and Confidentiality  
Aim 1 : 
Data analysis. Statistical analysis will be done using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients (categorical variables : frequency and 
percent; continuous variables : mean + standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range 
(IQR)).  
 
Q
ualitative analysis . Qualitative data will be collected via questionnaires and a semi -structured 
interview (see Appendix 1 for the interview guide and Appendix 2 for the questionnaires) conducted by a trained CRC. The interview s cript creates a framework for the discussion with 
further probing based on patients’ responses to elicit a rich and informative description of their 
experiences and perceptions. Interviews will be recorded, assigned an identification number to 
anonymize content, and transcribed for coding. Each transcript will be independently reviewed by 
[CONTACT_347462]-by- line content will be analyzed using a priori  themes evaluating the 
acceptability and satisfaction with content (understanding, difficulty le vel, ease of use), feasibility 
of practice (both at home after preoperative training and after surgery), and perceived helpfulness 
in reducing pain and distress after surgery. Results will be analyzed and reviewed by [CONTACT_347463] r patients has completed Aims 1a and 1b so that iterative changes 
can be made to refine the protocol (e.g., improvements to the education component, involvement of parents, device adjustments, recommendations for duration and frequency of use 
postoperatively, etc.) before the next group of four patients is enrolled.  
 
Quantitative analysis (dose). Data will be collected on number of daily practice (preoperative) 
a
nd therapy (postoperative) sessions completed by [CONTACT_6904], duration of each session, and 
changes in HRV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_347422]. We will also assess the total daily dose of sessions by [CONTACT_347464]. These quantitative data together with qu antitative responses from the 
questionnaires and interviews will be summarized using frequency and percent for categorical 
variables and mean + SD or median and IQR for continuous variables. For variables measured 
multiple times per participant (duration o f each practice/therapy session, changes in HRV and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), within - and between -subject summary measures of location and variability will 
be derived and examined. 
 
S
ample size.  No statistical power analysis was done to determine the sample size for Aim 1. 
Rather, sample size determination was based on our extensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_347423]’s expertise in protocol refinement studies in intervention 
development.   
Anticipated outcomes.  At the end of Phase 1, we anticipate having a refined treatment protocol 
for preoperative education and training, and postoperative application of VR-BF. This protocol will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_347424] 2. Results from Aim 1 will provide a preliminary study protoco l and 
manual of procedures for the clinical efficacy trial that will be finalized at the end of Aim 2.

V8 – 08/18/22  Page 19 of 25  HRP -503  v.12.10.18   Aim 2 : 
Data analysis. Phase 2 is a single- center, randomized, two- arm, parallel -group, single blinded 
trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment protocol designed in Aim 1. We 
will ensure study transparency, describing recruitment, enrollment, and outcom es in a 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram106,120 and provide detailed 
descriptions of the intervention and active control. Demographic and baseline characteristics will 
be summarized fo r all patients and within each study group ( categorical variables: frequency and 
percent; continuous variables : mean + SD or median and IQR). 
 Quantitative analysis. We will assess measures of feasibility and acceptability for each arm.  
Feasibility .
 We will calculate descriptive data on 1) How many patients are screened per month; 
2) Percentage of patients meeting eligibility criteria; 3) Percentage of eligible patients approached, enrolled, and randomized; 4) Percentage of patients completing Phase 2; and 5) 
Percentage of patients adhering to preoperative education and postoperative application of VR-
BF as defined in the study measures. For each measure, the rates, variances, and two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) will be reported. Each CI will be examined to determine if the 
hypothesized value of 80% is contained within the interval. This data will also be used to generate a diagram of participant flow. Because this is a feasibility study, we will not conduct 
statistical tests on the clinical outcome s collected for exploratory purposes (pain and anxiety 
ratings, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]). We will analyze this data using descriptive measures stratified by [CONTACT_2939]. Acceptability . We will calculate descriptive data on 1) Treatment/study burden: number and 
percen tage of patients completing all study measures; 2) Tolerability: number and percentage of 
patients experiencing AEs; and 3) Any quantitative data of satisfaction and treatment credibility 
from questionnaires and semi -structured interviews. For each of these measures, the rates, 
variances, and two-sided 95% CI will be reported. The CI for treatment/study burden will be 
examined to determine if the hypothesized value of 80% is contained within the interval. 
Qualitative treatment credibility and parent/patient satisfaction data will be assessed qualitatively 
as described below.  
 
Dosing. To finalize VR - BF dosing prior to the efficacy trial, data will be collected on the number 
of daily practice (preoperative) and therapy (postoperative) sessions completed by [CONTACT_26735] h patient, 
duration of each session, changes in HRV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and achievement of target HRV 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_347425]. We will also assess the total daily dose of sessions by [CONTACT_347465]. 
Achievement of target physiological parameters will be assessed by [CONTACT_347466] a patient spends within specified targets for each session. Consistency in achieving target 
HRV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_347426] a binary outcome (yes/no) when the target 
range is achieved >75% of the time during use (by [CONTACT_347467]). We will run descriptive 
statistics on duration of each session stratified by [CONTACT_347468] (or not) and on frequency and duration of daily use by [CONTACT_347469] (or not). Mean duration per 
session and mean duration and frequency per day in the group achieving consistency will be used 
to guide minimal dosing in the efficacy trial . Exploratory analysis . We will examine the 
association of VR-BF dose (frequency and duration of use) with the change in target physiological parameters to help identify the minimal dose (frequency and duration of use) required to reach consistency in achi eving these targets. We will also examine the correlation 
between pain score reduction and VR-BF use (frequency and duration). We will calculate mean changes in pain score before and after VR-BF and mean frequency and duration of VR-BF use for 
each patient. We will visualize any correlation using a scatter or box plot and quantify the 
correlation using Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficients between two continuous variables

categorical variable. Regression on changes in pain score will be used to examine linear or 
nonlinear correlations between pain reduction and VR- BF use. The same analysis will be repeated 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (mg/kg/day) and patient- reported anxiety scores.  
 
Qualitative analysis . From the questionnaires and semi- structured interviews, we will compi[INVESTIGATOR_347427], credibility, and tolerability as well as additional feasibility data. This 
qualitative data will be analyzed in the same way as in  Aim 1.  
 Sample size.  Seventy subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of two study arms: 
intervention and active control. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347428], no 
confirmatory hypothesis testing will be done. Our sample size is ba sed on estimation of two-sided 
CIs for one proportion with exact formula of the binomial probabilities. To estimate a 95% CI with targeted width of 0.22 and an assumed proportion of 80%, we will need a sample size of 70 
(35 per group), resulting in a total of 56 patients (28 per group) included in the analysis after 80% 
retention.  
Anticipated outcomes. We anticipate creating a final VR -BF study manual that will define study 
procedures for an efficacy trial and provide key pi[INVESTIGATOR_347429]. By [CONTACT_347470] 2, we expect to have 1) A defined patient population with clearly delineated 
eligibility criteria; 2) A clearly delineated preoperative education and training protocol for VR -
BF/active control; 3) A dosing strategy (frequency, duration) for postoperative administration of VR-BF/active control; 4) Feasibility and acceptability data for VR -BF/active control; and 5) A 
preliminary assessment of key outcome measures (pain, anxiety, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]) to be 
evaluated in the efficacy t rial. 
 
Data Safety :  
Data confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_347471] a password protected computer 
and any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_347430] a locked office. Data will be transmitted to a 
password -protected  Nationwide Children’s  computer for further analysis. Data held in REDCap is 
deemed secure.  All individuals using and interacting with this data will be trained appropriately 
and a member of the study team. Any data transmission will occur via secure email s (not 
personal). Proper agreements have been executed  to cover the sharing of de -identified data from  
REDCap with a statistician at CCHMC. Data will be de -identified by [CONTACT_347472] (date, name, address, MRN, 
etc.) removed. The exported data set will then be shared with CCHMC. Data will be stored for the 
duration of the study and analysis/presentation up to the time period specified by [CONTACT_1201].

form; additionally, the participant’s assent will also be obtaine d if he or she is able to understand 
the nature, significance and risks/benefits associated with the study. The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks/benefits of 
participation. A copy of the signed consent form (including assent where appropriate) will be given to the participant, parent or legal guardian and a copy will be placed in the patient’s 
medical record.  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_347473]. If interested, 
consent may be signed electronically (see below) or may be obtained during the first preoperative study visit.  
 
Participants may choose to complete an electronic consent by [CONTACT_347474] (e.g., 
REDCap) supported by [CONTACT_347475]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347431]. Participants that choose to 
complete the electronic consent will have the opportunity to review the consent form and talk 
with research staff. If the potential participant agrees to participate, they will have an opportunity 
to check a box stating that that agree to provide their consent / parental permission / assent. There 
will also be fields for their typed name [CONTACT_347479], along with witness fields. Once the 
electronic form has been submitted, a copy of the signed form will be provided to the participant. 
Electronic consents will be maintained within the application.  In the event electronic consent is 
not available papers consent forms will be used.  
 
Subjects and participants will be informed during the consent process (and included in written 
form) that their consent/assent in the study is fully voluntary and that they may withdraw at any 
time with no consequence or penalty. The consent process will follow the SOP: Informed 
Consent Process for Research (HRP -090) . Parental permission will be obtained from one parent, 
even if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably available, and shares legal 
responsibility for the care and custody of the child as this is a minimal risk study. If a parent is 
not available or the legal guardian, consent may be obtained from one legal guardian or an 
individual with the abil ity to consent for the child. This ability to consent will be verified with 
documentation in the patient’s medical record. As this  study involves children of the age of 
assent, appropriate assent will also be obtained per the SOP: Legally Authorized Repres entatives, 
Children, and Guardians (HRP-013)  and will be documented via signature [CONTACT_347480].

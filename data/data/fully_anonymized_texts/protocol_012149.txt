 1.1 Background  
Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for the development of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC).  BE is defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the distal 
esophagus, and is associated with a 25 -30 times increased risk of EAC.1    Unfort unately, the 
prognosis of esophageal cancer is poor, with 5 -year survival rates of  
16.5% in the US.2  
The development of BE is thought to be caused in part by [CONTACT_581103].  The change in 
esophageal lining presumably develops as a result of chronic exposure to refluxed stomach 
acid and bile, leading to recurrent mucosal injury.3  
Current management of BE pa tients consists of endoscopic surveillance and acid 
suppression.4  In theory, gastric acid suppression reduces chronic inflammation within the 
BE segment, which in turn may reduce the risk of progression to EAC. By [CONTACT_581104], proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at therapeutic 
doses can cause secondary hypergastrinemia.  Gastrin exerts trophic effects in BE via 
cholecystokinin -2 receptor (CCK2R) activation5, and there is some evidence that 
hypergastrinemia is associat ed with an increased risk of progression to high grade 
dysplasia and cancer.[ADDRESS_764052] of CCK2 
receptors.7  The primary hypothesis for this study is that administration of YF476 to 
patient s with BE will result in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation in the Barrett’s 
mucosa.   
1.2 Trial medication  
YF476 (25 mg) or matching placebo: one capsule to be taken by [CONTACT_96488] [ADDRESS_764053] overnight and take study medication after completion of study procedures.  
1.3 Objectives  
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of YF476 (a CCK2R 
antagonist) to p atients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) decreases tissue Ki67 expression, a 
marker of cellular proliferation.  
 Secondary:    
The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of YF476 on:   
• biomarkers associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, in particular, cyclooxygease -2 
(COX -2), p53, CCK2R and DCAMKL1; and  
• fasting serum gastrin, a marker of gastric acid suppression, and plasma chromogranin A 
(CgA), a marker of ECL cell hyperplasia.  
 
 We a lso aim to determine whether YF476 is safe in patients with BE.

2 Objectives  
2.1 Primary objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of YF476 (a CCK2R 
antagonist) to patients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) decreases tissue Ki67 expression, a 
marker of cellular proliferation.  
2.[ADDRESS_764067] ives are to assess the effects of YF476 on:   
• biomarkers associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, in particular, cyclooxygease -2 
(COX -2), p53, CCK2R and DCAMKL1; and  
• fasting serum gastrin, a marker of gastric acid suppression, and plasma chromogranin A 
(CgA), a marker of ECL cell hyperplasia.  
We also aim to determine whether YF476 is safe in patients with BE.  
3 Background  
3.1 Barrett’s esophagus  
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for the development of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC).  BE is defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the distal 
esophagus, and is associated with a 25 –[ADDRESS_764068] three decades in the [LOCATION_002] (US), with 
similar patterns o f incidence observed in most developed western countries.8  
Unfortunately, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is poor, with 5 -year survival rates of 
16% in the US.2  
 
 The development of BE is thought to be caused in part by [CONTACT_581103].  The change in 
esoph ageal lining presumably develops as a result of chronic exposure to refluxed acid and 
bile from the stomach leading to recurrent mucosal injury.3  The esophageal injury is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_581106], ultimately, a cellular change (metaplasia) to a 
specialized columnar epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  BE -associated intestinal metaplasia can ultimately 
progress to low grade (LGD) and high grade dysplasia (HGD), states that are associated 
with elevated risk of progressing to EAC.  
Current management of BE patients consists o f endoscopic surveillance and acid 
suppression.4  For example, current American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 
guidelines recommend periodic upper endoscopy with random biopsies of the Barrett’s 
segment in order to assess for the presence of LGD, HGD, o r EAC.  The purpose of 
surveillance is to allow for early detection, which may lead to improved patient outcomes.  
ACG guidelines for the management of BE also recommend gastric acid suppression with 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).  In theory, gastric acid suppression reduces chronic 
inflammation within the BE segment, which in turn may reduce the risk of progression to 
EAC.    
3.2 YF476  
Details of YF476 are in the Investigator ’s Brochure (Trio Medicines Ltd)7, so only a 
summary is provided here.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_764069] of gastrin receptors in vitro  and in vivo .9-11  
Toxicology studies of YF476 consisted of: single - and/or repeat -dose toxicity studies i n rats 
and dogs; toxicokinetics in rats and dogs; and embryo -foetal toxicity studies in rats and 
rabbits.  Other non -clinical studies consisted of: safety pharmacology studies in rats, mice 
and dogs; genotoxicity studies in vivo  and in vitro;  studies of me tabolism by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 in human liver microsomes  in vitro ; a study to determine the extent of YF476 protein 
binding in normal human serum in vitro ; a study of the effect of YF476 on the hERG ion 
channel in human embryonic kidney cells in vitro : and a study to compare the metabolism 
of 14C-YF476 in rat, dog and human cells in vitro .  
In acute toxicity studies in beagle dogs, 100 and 500 mg/kg/day resulted in similar plasma 
concentrations of YF476, and caused no adverse effects.  Therefore, 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day were tested in a [ADDRESS_764070] of YF476 cannot be excluded, so the 
study did not clearly establish a NOAEL.  
A 13 -week toxicity study of YF476 doses 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day was done in rats.  
At 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, some animals had minor, reversible changes in enzyme 
activities and heart weight, and discoloured urin e and pale faeces.  Also, there were minor 
 
 histopathological lesions in the heart and pancreas of four treated animals and one control 
animal.  The NOAEL was deemed 100 mg/kg/day.    
In the [ADDRESS_764071] the hERG channel in vitro .  Because ∼84% of YF476 
is bound to serum protein in vivo , that represents 25 -fold safet y cover.    
Embryo -foetal studies were done in the rat and rabbit, using YF476 doses of 100, 300 and 
1000 mg/kg/day.  YF476 had no effect on embryo -foetal survival, growth or development 
in rabbits.  There was slight delay in foetal development in rats giv en 1000 mg/kg/day, so 
the NOAEL was deemed 300 mg/kg/day.  
The metabolism of parent 14C-YF476 was most efficiently catalysed by [CONTACT_74934] > dog > rat 
hepatocytes in vitro .  Phase I and II metabolites were formed.  There was no evidence for 
formation of unique major human metabolites, although the main metabolite was different 
from that formed by [CONTACT_581107].  Thus, the rat and dog are appropriate species to assess the 
potential toxicity of YF476 in humans.  
YF476 caused some reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro .  The likelihood 
of a drug -drug interaction via those enzymes in trials in patients is remote or possible, 
respectively, at the proposed doses of YF476.  
Non-clinical studies support administration of YF476 to humans for up to 13 weeks.  Th e 
treatment period for this clinical trial will be 12 weeks.  
3.2.2  Phase 1 studies  
Trio has completed 11 studies of YF476 in healthy men and women.7  184 subjects 
received YF476: single doses up to 400 mg; up to 25 mg daily for 14 days; 100 mg twice 
daily for 7 days; 100 mg YF476 daily, either alone or with 20 mg rabeprazole, for 6 weeks; 
and 25 mg YF476 daily for 14 days either alone or with 40 mg esomeprazole.  The 
outcome measures were: safety; tolerability; pharmacokinetics; and  
pharmacodynamics ([ADDRESS_764072] ric pH; pentagastrin -induced gastric acid secretion; serum 
gastrin; and markers of ECL -cell hyperplasia).  The comparators were placebo, ranitidine, 
omeprazole and rabeprazole.  
Safety and tolerability   
In all studies, YF476 was well tolerated.  Adverse ev ents were minor, transient, occurred in 
subjects given placebo or comparators as well as YF476, and were not YF476 -dose 
dependent.  YF476 affected neither vital signs, ECG, nor safety tests of blood and urine.    
Pharmacodynamics    
Single doses caused dose -dependent increases in [ADDRESS_764073] after repeated doses, whereas that of omeprazole pers isted.  
Single doses of YF476 also caused dose -dependent inhibition of pentagastrininduced falls 
in gastric pH and increases in gastric volume and H+ output.  Again, the effect on gastric 
pH was mostly lost after repeated doses of YF476.  But, the effects on volume and H+ 
 
 output persisted.  So, gastrin receptors must still be blocked after repeated doses of YF476.  
In a study of YF476 and rabeprazole, alone and in combination for 6 weeks, YF476:   
• was as effective as the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581069] H + activity;   
• was as effective as the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581070];   
• did not increase plasma chromogranin A (CgA), a biomarker for ECL -cell 
activity, whereas the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581071];   
• abolished the PPI -induced increase in CgA;   
• augmented gastric acid su ppression by [CONTACT_246407] [INVESTIGATOR_581072]; and   
• prevented the rebound increase in H+ activity induced by [CONTACT_246407].    
In conclusion, the combination was more effective than either the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581073]476 alone in 
suppress ing gastric acid production.  YF476 prevented stimulation of ECL cells and 
rebound hyperacidity, both of which are caused by [CONTACT_67164] -induced hypergastrinaemia.  
Overall, the effects of YF476 are consistent with antagonism of gastrin receptors.  
Pharmacokinetic s  
The pharmacokinetic profile of YF476 varied among the 1996, 2001, [ADDRESS_764074] favour able 
profile.  In a single -dose study of 50 –400 mg of the current (2009) formulation of YF476, 
absorption was rapid, T max was 1.5 –2 h, T ½ varied with dose, and C max and AUC 0-24 were 
not proportional to dose.  T ½ after 100 mg YF476 was about 7 h.  Food incr eased C max and 
AUC 0–24 by 1.9 and 1.6 -fold, respectively.  The absolute bioavailability was about 16% in a 
study of 100 mg ‘cold’ YF476 by [CONTACT_581108] 15 µg 14C-YF476 intravenously.  
Protein binding in human serum was about 84%.  In a [ADDRESS_764075] that PPIs may be associat ed with an increased  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_581074],14 and Feagins et al reported anti -proliferative effects of acid exposure in non -
dysplastic BE cells.15  
 
 By [CONTACT_581109], PPIs at therapeutic doses can cause secondary 
hypergastrinemia.  Gastrin exe rts trophic effects in BE via CCK2R activation.5 There is 
increased expression of CCK2R in BE compared to squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and gastrin can 
stimulate proliferation, anti -apoptosis, COX -2 expression, and loss of cell -cell adhesion in 
BE cells.5, 16  The chief investigator’s group recently reported that BE patients with high 
serum gastrin levels had significantly increased odds of a history of high grade dysplasia 
(HGD) or EAC.6  In that cross -sectional study, they enrolled 95 patients with BE (with and 
without dysplasia or EAC) and GERD controls on chronic PPI [CONTACT_48831].  Subjects in the 
highest serum gastrin quartile had significantly increased odds of a history of advanced 
neoplasia (adjusted OR 5.46, 95% CI 1.20 –24.8).  The group also analyzed 19 samples 
from non -dysplastic Barrett’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and found marked elevations in Ki67 expression, 
with a mean Ki67 index of 48.3% (SD 16.0%).  They also found a moderate correlation 
between serum gastrin and tissue Ki67 index (r=0.64, p=0.05) in a subset of ten pa tients 17.  
Those studies support the notion that gastrin may promote carcinogenesis in BE, and that 
these potentially pro -neoplastic effects occur via activation of the CCK2 receptor.  We 
therefore propose the following clinical trial to analyze the effects of a CCK2  receptor 
antagonist in patients with BE.  The primary hypothesis is that administration of YF476, a 
CCK2 receptor antagonist, in patients with BE will result in a significant decrease in 
cellular proliferation in the Barrett’s mucosa.  
[ADDRESS_764076], in patients with Barrett’s esophagus without 
dysplasia.  Patients will take YF476 or placebo for 12 weeks.    
There a re 2 research sites, Columbia University and the University of Cambridge.  We aim 
for 20 patients to complete the study.  Patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to treatment 
with YF476 or placebo.    
Patients will make up to 5 visits to the research site (Visits 1 and 2 may be combined, or up 
to 2 weeks apart.  See schedule of events in Section 8.1.):  
• Registration (Visit 1)  
• Baseline (Visit 2 – start of treatment phase)  
• Study treatment (6 weeks after the start of the treatment phase). • End of 
study trea tment (after 12 weeks’ treatment)  
• Follow -up (4 weeks after the end of treatment).  
After giving informed consent (Visit 1) and after the initial endoscopy (Visit 2), patients 
will be given one bottle of YF476 or placebo. They will be given a study bottle again at the 
Week 6 visit.    
 
 The primary endpoint of the study (Ki67 expression) will be assessed using endoscopic 
biopsies taken at baseline and at 12 weeks.   
Esophageal tissue from endoscopic biopsies will be evaluated for Ki67 expression  
(primary end point) and expression of additional markers potentially associated with  
esophageal neoplasia (secondary endpoints).    Expression of these markers will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) and reverse transcriptase -PCR (RT -PCR), as appropriate.  
Blood  samples will be taken at Visit 2, the Week 6 visit and the Week 12 visit for 
measurement of serum gastrin and plasma CgA, and at the Week 6 and Week 12 visits for 
trough and peak YF476 concentrations.   
Safety tests and pregnancy tests (pre -menopausal wome n only) will be done at each visit.  
Patients will complete a diary card daily to record study drug, concomitant medication and 
adverse events.  Adverse events will be assessed [ADDRESS_764077] of care for patients with high grade dysplasia (HGD) at the study institutions 
consists of endoscopic ablative therapy and not continued endoscopic surveillance. The 
diagnosis of low grade dysplasia (LGD) is confounded by [CONTACT_581110], even among expert pathologists.  Additionally, a blative therapy is also 
frequently recommended for LGD patients. Therefore, BE patients with LGD and HGD are 
not ideal candidates for chemoprevention studies in BE.  Dose regimen  
The dose regimen of 25 mg YF476 or matching placebo once daily has been chos en based 
on a previous study of YF476 (T -013), which showed that a dose as low as [ADDRESS_764078] h ad prolonged 
hypergastrinaemia, so a dose of 25 mg YF476 is appropriate.  A placebocontrolled design 
is appropriate for this study as there is no alternative treatment known to reduce the levels 
of Ki67 expression in patients with BE.  
Efficacy tests  
We w ill use Ki67 index as the primary endpoint, as it is a reliable and reproducible marker 
of ongoing cellular proliferation.  Quantitative assessment of the number of proliferating 
 
 (Ki67+) epi[INVESTIGATOR_581075]  (IHC).  We 
will also take blood samples to assay fasting serum gastrin and plasma CgA, and trough 
and peak YF476 concentrations.  
4.3 Risk -benefit analysis  
What are the potential risks of harm to the trials patients from YF476 and from the trial 
procedures, and how might they be mitigated?  
Reported adverse events and potential risks  
In all studies in healthy volunteers, YF476 was well tolerated.  Adverse events were minor, 
transient, occurred in subjects given placebo or comparators as well as YF476, and we re 
not YF476 -dose dependent.  YF476 did not affect:  vital signs; ECG; or safety tests of 
blood and urine.  There was no evidence of effect on QT interval in human studies, but in 
vitro  studies showed that YF476 has a low potential for prolonging QT interv al (See 
Section 3.2.1).  So, until we have more information about YF476, patients with prolonged 
QT interval are excluded from clinical trials.  
The adverse effects that occurred at a frequency of 10% or greater were:  abdominal 
distention, diarrhea, abdom inal pain, nausea, and headache.  None of these adverse effects 
were observed with greater frequency as compared to placebo or comparators.  Because of 
the pancreatic findings in the 13 -week toxicology study of dogs (Section 3.2.1), serum 
amylase and lipase  will be monitored at each visit.  Also, any patient who complains of 
abdominal discomfort at any time during the study will be seen immediately by [CONTACT_581111], physical examination, and laboratory 
tests, includi ng serum amylase and lipase, and other appropriate tests, including 
radiological investigations. Risk from concomitant medications  
In vitro  studies have shown that the likelihood of a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  
is:  
• CYP2C8:  possible for 50 –400 mg YF476   
• CYP3A4 (testosterone):  remote for 50 & 100 mg YF476, and possible for 200 & 400 
mg  
• CYP3A4 (midazolam):  remote for 50 mg YF476, and possible for 100 –400 mg. 
Although YF476 caused some irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4, the degree of 
inhib ition makes a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  unlikely.  And, a clinical 
study (T -007) of YF476 and midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) alone and in 
combination showed that neither medicine affects the pharmacokinetics of the other 
(see YF476 Inves tigator’s brochure for further details).  
Many medicines are metabolised via CYP3A4/5. Very few are metabolised via  
CYP2C8.  Examples of the main types of medicine that are metabolised by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5  
and CYP2C8 are listed in Appendix B.  Guidance about assessing the risk and managing 
drug-drug interactions is also provided in Appendix B.  All medications (prescription and 
over-the-counter), vitamin and mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken by [CONTACT_581112], and the patient will record any new concomitant 
medications in the diary card, which will be checked at each visit. Risk from study 
procedures: endoscopy   
Patients who take part in the trial must undergo endo scopy at baseline and at the Week [ADDRESS_764079] infection after endoscopy.  Rarely, the 
endoscope damages the esophagus, causing bleeding or infection.  Patients will be given 
information on how to  prepare for their endoscopy according to local procedures.  
Overall, the potential benefits to the trial patients of taking part in the trial greatly outweigh 
the risks of any harm.

Men and women of all races  and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  However, the 
described epi[INVESTIGATOR_581078]’s esophagus is such that the majority of study patients 
are likely to be white males.  
5.4 Recruitment and retention plan  
There will be 2 study sites: Columbia Uni versity Medical Center (CUMC), [LOCATION_001],  
US, and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Investigation Ward 
(CIW), Cambridge University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], Cambridge, [LOCATION_006].  Eligible patients will be 
recruited from the clinical practices of the st udy investigators (JAA, CJL, JMP, RF). All of 
the study investigators see a large volume of patients referred for management and 
treatment of Barrett’s esophagus.  We aim for [ADDRESS_764083] with study patie nts.  The study staff will meet regularly to review issues 
related to recruitment and retention, identify areas of improvement, and implement 
appropriate strategies to address any deficiencies.  Additional recruitment methods such as 
advertising may be per formed by [CONTACT_581113]’s 
Institutional Review Board or REC.   
Withdrawals will be replaced at the discretion of the investigator.   
 
 6 Administration of study medication  
Study medication will be dispensed on an outpatient basis, and self -administered by 
[CONTACT_1962].  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 4.3.    
6.1 Dose regimen and dose groups  
• Patients will take 25 mg YF476 (1 x 25 mg capsule) or matching placebo capsules, by 
[CONTACT_16629].  
• The treatment period for this trial will be 12 weeks.  
6.2 YF476 administration  
• Each study patient will self -administer the YF476 or placebo.   
• The study me dication will be dispensed into bottles: 46 capsules of 25 mg YF476 or 
placebo per bottle.  1 bottle will be dispensed to participants at the baseline visit 
(Visit 2) and at the Week 6 visit.  
• Study medication should be taken once daily, in the morning, wi th breakfast. But, if a 
patient takes the study medication without food, or at a different time of the day, it 
will not be recorded as a protocol deviation.  Missed doses will be recorded as 
protocol deviations.  
6.3 Run-in procedures  
No run -in phase is plann ed for this study.    
6.4 Contraindications  
Contraindications to taking YF476 include prolonged QTc interval, pregnancy or 
breastfeeding.  Patients with prolonged QTc interval (>450 msec) are excluded.  Women of 
childbearing potential will be included in the study only if they are using adequate 
contraception and will be advised by [CONTACT_581114].   
Pregnancy tests will be done at each visit.  
6.[ADDRESS_764084] once daily.  Any formulation of 
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581079].  
All medications (prescription and over -the-counter), vitamin and mineral supplements, 
and/or he rbs taken by [CONTACT_581115]: 1) start and stop date, dose and route of administration, and 
indication. Medications taken for a procedure (eg: biopsy) should also be included.  
CYP 450 enzymes  
Studies were done to assess the potential of YF476 to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes in 
vitro .  For details, see Appendix B – drug interactions, and the YF476 Investigator’s 
Brochure. The likelihood of a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  is:  
• CYP2C8:  possible for 50 –400 mg YF476   
 
 • CYP3A4 (testosterone):  remote for 50 & 100 mg YF476, and possible for 200 & 400 
mg  
• CYP3A4 (midazolam):  remote for 50 mg YF476, and possible for 100 –400 mg.  
Although YF476 caused some irreversible inh ibition of CYP3A4 in vitro , the degree of 
inhibition makes a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  unlikely.  And, a clinical study 
(T-007) of YF476 and midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) alone and in combination 
showed that neither medicine affects the  pharmacokinetics of the other.  For details, see the 
Netazepi[INVESTIGATOR_5328] (YF476) Investigator’s Brochure.  
Many medicines are metabolised via CYP3A4/5. Very few are metabolised via CYP2C8.  
Examples of the main types of medicine that are metabolised by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 an d CYP2C8 
are listed in Appendix B.  Guidance about assessing the risk and managing drug -drug 
interactions is also provided in Appendix B.  
Drugs that are substrates for, or inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_764085] be 
informed of any new concomitant medications via the patient’s diary card.  Midazolam 
may be used during endoscopy.  It was used safely before gastroscopy in a study of YF476 
in healthy subjects.  
6.6 Dose modification  
Dose modifications of study drug will not be performed.  If drug -related toxicity is 
suspected, then treatment will be discontinued.   
6.7 Compliance  
• All randomized patients will be eligible for statistical analysis.  Patients will be 
analyzed  on an intent -to-treat basis, and also per protocol.  
• Compliance will be measured by [CONTACT_581116] 6 and Week 12 visits, 
and by [CONTACT_581117].

responsible for study medication accountabilit y for participants at  
NIHR CIW.  
At the end of the trial, all unused study medication supplies will be returned to the HMR 
Pharmacy.  
7.6 Registration and randomization  
• A member of the HMR Statistics and Data Management Department will generate a 
randomizati on list for each site.  Patient numbers will be allocated to eligible patients 
immediately before the EGD and biopsy at Visit 2 (Baseline).  Patients enrolled at 
CUMC will be allocated patient numbers 01 –24.  Patients enrolled at NIHR CIW will 
be allocated  patient numbers 1001 –1024.  The lists are independent of each other.  At 
both sites, patients on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581082], and patients on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581083].    
• At each site, the site coordinators will maintain a site -specific list of participants, 
including patient codes, start date, and duration of treatment.  Every time a patient is 
recruited at one of the sites, the coordinator for t hat site will inform the chief 
investigator (if applicable) and the coordinator for the other site.  It is the chief 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the total number of study patients does not 
exceed the target.  
The randomization list will sp ecify whether the patient receives a dose of YF476 or 
placebo.  Fixed allocation randomization will be performed, with equal allocation (1:1) 
between the [ADDRESS_764090].  The study investigators and the 
study patients will remain blinded.   
7.7 Blinding and unblinding methods  
• Bottles containing study medication for i ndividual patients will not be labelled with 
any information to indicate whether the capsules are YF476 or placebo.  
• Patients will be blinded to study treatment.   
• One member of the HMR Statistics and Data Management Department will not be 
blinded.  That p erson will generate the randomization code. The Columbia University 
biostatistician will be blinded.  
• All Investigators will be blinded to study treatment.   
• For each site, there will be a blinded monitor and an unblinded monitor.  The 
unblinded monitor wi ll review dispensing records at the site Pharmacy.  
• Pharmacy staff will not be blinded.  
• The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will not be blinded.  
 
 • The blind will be broken by [CONTACT_581121]:  
o If unblinding is required in the interest of the safety of a subject, an investigator 
will discuss the matter with the sponsor before opening the individual code -
break envelope for that subject.  In a medical emergency, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_581084] -break envelope for that 
subject without prior consultation with the sponsor.  In that event, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_581085].  
o The blind will be broken for the entire study population at the completion of the 
study, after the statistical analysis plan (SAP) has been signed and the database 
has been locked.  
7.8 YF476 destruction/disposal  
At the completion of investigati on, the site Pharmacy will return all unused YF476 and

There will be a ±4 day window for clinic visits.    
8.7 Withdrawal of patients from the trial  
8.7.1  Termination of study medication  
Patients may stop takin g study medication for the following reasons.   
• When a patient has completed the protocol -prescribed treatment, we will not provide 
any further study medication.  
• If a patient has an adverse event, grade 2 or greater (see section 11.1), the patient or 
investigator may choose to terminate study treatment.  
• A patient might be non -compliant and stop taking the protocol -prescribed treatment; 
or the investigator may choose to terminate study treatment.   
• The investigator may terminate study treatment because of a medical 
contraindication.  
• The investigator may terminate study treatment because of evidence of serious 
interactions with medications metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 or CYP2C8, (see Appendix 
B for list of relevant medications).   
In all cases listed above, pati ents will continue to be followed, if possible, for safety 
reasons and in order to collect endpoint data according to the schedule of events.   
8.7.2  Termination of study participation  
Patients may go ‘off -study’ (ie leave the study with no follow -up possible) for the following 
reasons.   
• The protocol treatment and any protocol -required follow -up period is completed.   
• If a patient has an adverse event, grade 2 or greater (see section 11.1), the patient may 
choose to terminate study participation.   
 
 • A patient might be lost to follow -up, if the investigator is unable to establish contact 
[CONTACT_180932].  
• A patient might be non -compliant and not attend the clinic visits (including the 
follow -up visit).   
• The investigator may terminate study participati on because of a medical 
contraindication.  
• A patient may withdraw his or her consent to participate in the study.   
• Determination of ineligibility, not discovered before enrollment.  In particular; 
patients will be withdrawn from the study if their baselin e endoscopy (Visit 2): o 
does not show any intestinal metaplasia; or  
o biopsies are read as indefinite for dysplasia, low grade dysplasia, high grade 
dysplasia, or adenocarcinoma.

10 Methods  
10.1 Methods for clinical procedures  
Upper endoscopy with biopsies will be performed at baseline (Visit 2) and at the Week 12 
visit, after 12 weeks’ treatment with study medication.  Patients will fast before the 
endoscopy, and will need to come accompanied to the site en doscopy suite, according to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581089].  Upon arrival at the endoscopy suite, a peripheral 
intravenous line will be inserted.  Informed consent will be obtained for the endoscopy 
prior to starting the procedure.  In the procedure roo m, a local anaesthetic (xylocaine) will 
be sprayed in the back of the mouth to diminish the gag reflex.  Subsequently, intravenous 
medication (specifically, midazolam, fentanyl, and/or propofol) will be administered in 
order to achieve moderate sedation.  Once the patient has been sedated, the upper 
endoscope will be inserted into the esophagus and advanced to the second portion of the 
duodenum.  The following represents standard clinical care for Barrett’s esophagus: 1) the 
area of Barrett’s esophagus will  be carefully inspected for any focal nodules or mucosal 
irregularities that could represent the presence of dysplasia; 2) if any such abnormalities are 
noted, then targeted biopsies of these areas will be taken; 3) irrespective of the presence of 
such abn ormalities, random 4 -quadrant biopsies will be taken every 1 –2 cm along the 
length of BE.  For study purposes, 6 additional biopsies will be taken and snap frozen for 
qRT-PCR analyses: GE junction (top of the gastric folds; 2 biopsies); mid -Barrett’s 
segme nt (2 biopsies); normalappearing esophageal mucosa (2 cm above the maximal extent 
of BE; 2 biopsies).   
10.2 Rationale for laboratory methods  
In general, it is desirable to perform quantitative analyses of biomarkers, as achieved by 
[CONTACT_581122] -time PCR (qRT -PCR), in contrast to qualitative or  
semi -quantitative immunhistochemical analyses (IHC).  Quantitative analysis allows for 
detection of small differences between different tissue samples.  However, qRT -PCR does 
not discriminate between differen t cell types within a particular tissue sample, whereas IHC 
allows for visual assessment of the type and location of cells that express a biomarker of 
interest.  
 
 • IHC for Ki67 is a robust marker of ongoing proliferation, and has been reliably and 
reproducib ly used to evaluate cell type -specific evaluation.  Quantitative assessment 
of the number of proliferating (Ki67+) epi[INVESTIGATOR_581090].  
• For the assessment of CCK2R expression in human esophageal tissue, qRT -PCR 
seems to be the best method, as IHC with various antibodies has proven to be 
unreliable and non -specific.   
• Biologically relevant COX -2 expression can be quantitatively assessed usi ng qRT -
PCR, but cannot be detected by [CONTACT_4658].   
• DCAMKL -1 is a putative marker of intestinal stem cells.  In order to analyze 
expansion of these putative stem cells in the development of Barrett’s esophagus, it is 
important to get an impression of the precise location of these cells.  Therefore, both 
qRT-PCR and IHC will be used to analyze DCAMKL -1 expression.  
• Changes in the levels of p53 protein expression can be detected best with IHC, as 
mRNA levels of p53 do not differ very much despi[INVESTIGATOR_581091].  The 
function of p53 is more likely determined by [CONTACT_581123].   
All the above described methods have been performed in previously published studies (by 
[CONTACT_581124]’s group and others) as well as in [CONTACT_581147]’s laboratory i n a 
new mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus and adenocarcinoma.  Therefore, the investigators 
will be able to compare the achieved data with previously published and unpublished 
results from the chief investigator’s laboratory and other groups.

(Columbia University, [LOCATION_001], NY).  Histological review of specimens, including IHC 
assessment of Ki67, p53, and DCAMKL1 expression, will be per formed by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  
Antonia Sepulveda (Columbia University, [LOCATION_001], NY).  Routine testing of blood and 
urine specimens will be performed locally.  
10.3.2  Collection and handling procedures  
• Collection and analysis of tissue for IHC and qRT -PCR qRT-PCR.  Routine 
endo scopic biopsies (4 quadrant biopsies every 2 cm along the length of BE) will be taken 
for clinical purposes and placed in formalin.  The formalin -fixed biopsies taken at CUMC 
will be submitted to the Columbia University Department of Pathology (CUDP).  The  
formalin -fixed biopsies taken at NIHR CIW will be stored there; slides of the biopsies will 
be sent by [CONTACT_581125], or as agreed between the investigators 
and sponsor.  The respective Departments of Pathology will store the par affin -embedded 
samples as per usual practice. Histologic analysis of biopsies from both study sites will be 
 
 done at CUDP.  As per clinical practice, these biopsies will be reviewed to assess the 
presence of dysplasia.  Six additional biopsies (from each en doscopy; 2 biopsies each from 
GE junction, mid -Barrett’s segment, and normal esophagus) will be taken for study 
purposes, placed in Qiagen Allprotect™ tissue reagent, and then stored at –80°C for future 
qRT-PCR analysis. The freezers for storing these samp les are located in the laboratory of 
[CONTACT_581147] at Columbia University.  Samples taken at Cambridge University will be 
stored in freezers in [CONTACT_581146]’s laboratory at the MRC Cancer Unit, 
University of Cambridge, until dispatch to Colu mbia University.  
IHC analyses.  Additional sections will be cut from paraffin -embedded endoscopic biopsies 
for study purposes.  Slides from NIHR CIW will be sent by [CONTACT_581126], or as agreed between the investiga tors and sponsor. Ki67 expression 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_581127]’s esophagus.  Paraffin -
embedded biopsies from the most distal esophageal biopsies containing intestinal metaplasia 
will be immunostained for Ki67.  Ki67 index wil l be calculated as:  (# crypt epi[INVESTIGATOR_581092]67) / (# BE crypt cells counted).  Five representative 
crypts with goblet cells will be evaluated from five separate fields at 100x magnification.  
∆Ki67 for YF476 and plac ebo arms will be compared.  The pathologist evaluating Ki67 
staining will be blinded to both treatment arm and timing of endoscopy (ie pre - or post -
treatment).  
• Collection and processing of blood samples for laboratory safety tests:  
20 mL of blood will be collected.  10 mL (one purple top, one gold top tube) will be used 
for routine measurements.  The other 10 mL (one purple top, one gold top tube) will be 
processed for separate storage of serum, plasma, and Buffy coats at –80°C.   
 o  Safety tests:  
 haematology:  Hb, RBC, haematocrit, WBC and differential, and platelets;    
 biochemistry: creatinine,  total bilirubin, BUN, LDH,  total protein, albumin, 
alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, glucose, potassium, sodium, calcium, 
magnesium, chlo ride, amylase and lipase.  
Blood specimens will be collected when the patient is fasting.  If the blood collection occurs 
on the day of the endoscopy, the blood will be collected prior to the endoscopy.    
 •  Collection of urine for laboratory safety test s  
A routine urine sample will be collected for standard urinalysis: dipstick test:  protein, 
blood, ketones, glucose, specific gravity, pH; microscopy if the result of the dipstick test 
for protein or blood is abnormal; and pregnancy test (pre -menopausal women only).  • 
 Collection and processing of blood samples for serum gastrin and stored serum 
Venous blood for serum gastrin assay and stored serum (2 × 2.5 mL) will be collected into 
polypropylene tubes and will be allowed to clot at room temperature for  at least 20 min.  
After clotting, the tubes will be centrifuged at about 1500 G for 10 min at 4 °C, and the 
serum transferred to smaller tubes in equal aliquots then stored at –80°C before shipment to 
the HMR Analytical Laboratory, Cumberland Avenue, Park Royal, London, NW10 7EW.  
 
 Shipment of serum samples for gastrin assay and storage will be agreed between the 
investigator and sponsor.  Serum will be stored by [CONTACT_581128] -
related markers only, which will be decided on at a later date.    
 •  Collection and processing of plasma for CgA assays  
4 mL venous blood will be collected into an EDTA tube and centrifuged at about 1500 G 
for 10 minutes at 4°C.  2 equal aliquots of plasma will be transferred to polypropylene 
tubes, and stored  at –80°C, before shipment to the HMR Analytical Laboratory, 
Cumberland Avenue, Park Royal, London, NW10 7EW.  Shipment of plasma samples for 
CgA assay will be agreed between the investigator and sponsor.  All sample handling 
materials will be provided by [CONTACT_581129].  
 •  Gastrin and CgA assays    
Serum gastrin and plasma CgA will be measured by [CONTACT_581130].  The analytical laboratory may not analyse samples 
collected from patients wit h HIV.   
 •  Collection and processing of blood samples for YF476 PK  
YF476 is light sensitive, so blood samples (4 mL) will be taken into foil -wrapped or amber 
lithium heparin tubes and immediately placed on ice.  Samples will be centrifuged at about 
1500 G for 10 minutes at 4°C.  Plasma will be transferred to foilwrapped o r amber 
polypropylene storage tubes.  Plasma samples will be stored at –80°C within [ADDRESS_764097] George’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581093]476 by [CONTACT_581131] 2002.18  
• All specimens will be labelled with a code assigned to the study patient.   
• A separate tracking sheet will be maintained for each study patient.  All specimens 
will be logged on these sheets, including date and time of collection.  
• Samples will be kept in storage for the duration of the study.  Unused samples will be 
kept in storage for an additional three years prior to disposal.  
The ana lytical laboratory may not analyse samples collected from patients with HIV.  
11 Reporting adverse events  
Definition:   an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study 
participant.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship wit h the treatment or 
study participant.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with participation in a study, whether or not related to that participa tion.  This includes any 
deaths that occur while a participant is on a study.  
A list of adverse events that have occurred or might occur can be found in Section 4.3, and 
in the Investigator Brochure.    
 
 11.1 Adverse events (AEs)  
• Reportable adverse events  
All adverse events that occur after the informed consent is signed will be recorded on 
the adverse event CRF whether or not related to study medication.  
• AE data elements  o  AE reported date o  AE Verbatim Term  
o SOC (System Organ Class from MedDRA)  
o Common Terminology for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) AE term o 
 Event onset date and event ended date o  Severity grade  
o Attribution to study medication (relatedness)  
o Whether or not the event was reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) o 
 Whether or not t he patient dropped due to the event o  Action taken with the 
study medication o  Outcome of the event o  Comments  
• Severity of AEs  
Adverse events will be identified using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  The CTC AE provides descriptive 
terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the CTCAE 
can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/pro tocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_4 [ADDRESS_764098] a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed accor ding to the 
general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4.0. as stated below.

5  Fatal  Death related to AE.  
 
 • Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
• Assessment of relationship of AE to treatment  
The possibility that the adverse event is related to study medication will be classified 
as one of the following:  not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definite.   
• Follow -up of AEs  
All AEs, including abnormalities that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_581094], will be followed according to good medical pr actices and documented as 
such.  
11.2 Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
11.2.[ADDRESS_764099]. 7, 1997 define serious adverse events as those 
events, occurring at any dose, which meet any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death.   
• Is life threatening (Note: the term life -threatening refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more sever e).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].   
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect.   
• Events that may not meet these criteria, but which the investigator finds very unusual 
and/or potentially serious, will also be reported in the same manner.  
11.2.2  Reporting SAEs  
• The investigators will report SAEs on the SAE form.   
• The Sponsor representative a nd the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
representative will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 24 hours of knowledge of the event.    
• The following information will be included when informing the Sponsor and the 
DSMB representative:  
o when the SAE occurred o  when the SAE report will 
be available  
o Name [CONTACT_69761] o  Call back phone number (if 
primary contact [CONTACT_42132]) o  Protocol number  
 
 o Description of the SAE, including attribution to drug   
• The investigators will FAX (or email a scan of) written SAE repor ts to the Sponsor 
and DSMB within 48 hours of learning of the event using the paper SAE form.  
• The Sponsor will determine which SAEs require submission to the competent 
authorities.  
• The Lead Organization and all Participating Organizations will comply wit h 
applicable regulatory requirements related to reporting SAEs to the IRB and/or REC.   
• Follow -up of SAE:  site staff will send follow -up reports as requested when 
additional information is available.  Additional information will be entered on the  
SAE for m in the appropriate format.  Follow -up information will be sent to the 
Sponsor and DSMB as soon as available. SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_581132].  
12 Data management and quality assurance  
Patient data will be collected using protocol -specific case report forms (CRF).  These will 
be designed and produced by [CONTACT_212197].  The final version will be approved by [CONTACT_456].  
All data will be entered legibly in black or blue ink with a ball -point pen.  If an error is 
made, the error will be crossed t hrough with a single line in such a way that the original 
entry can still be read.  The correct entry will then be clearly inserted and the alterations 
will be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_581133].  Overwriting or use of 
correction flui d is not permitted.  
To preserve confidentiality, the CRFs will not bear the subject’s name.  The subject’s 
initials, date of birth, and subject number will be used for identification.  
It will be the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the accura cy of all data entered in 
the CRFs.  
The data will be securely stored by [CONTACT_093].  After the CRFs have been signed off 
by [CONTACT_458], the original NCR copi[INVESTIGATOR_581095], where they will be  securely stored on behalf of the sponsor.  
Data will be double -entered into a clinical database management system (ClinPlus Version 
3.3), which is based on SAS® Version 9.2.  Edit checks and generation of queries will be 
done in ClinPlus.  Tabulations and  listings will be produced using validated, trial -specific 
SAS® programs.  
Data will be checked by [CONTACT_581134] (QA) Department.  In addition, the 
HMR QA Department will audit the trial report; that audit will include checks to ensure 
that sta tistical output is correctly reproduced in the report.  
Source documents.  Before the start of the study, the sponsor and investigator(s) will sign 
an agreement listing the source documents to be used in this trial.  The CRF will be source 
for the following datapoints: heart rate and blood pressure.  
 
 12.[ADDRESS_764100] (DSMB) will review all SAE forms as well as all AEs.  
If additional information is required, the DSMB will request that information from the PI.  
The DSMB will review reported AEs at regular meetings and provide written reports to the 
PI.  The reports will contain written information regarding findings for the trial as a whole 
related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to 
continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.

monitor/audit various aspects of the study. These monitors will be given access to facilities, 
databases, supplies and records to review and verify data pertinent to the study.   
12.[ADDRESS_764101] retention  
The sponsor and both principal investigators will keep the following in a trial master file.  
• All the essential documents required by [CONTACT_27727]  
• All data generated during the study  
All documents will be stored such that they are readily available for inspection at the 
request of the sponsor or a regulatory authority.  Any transfer of ownership of the 
investigator’s data or documents will be docume nted, and the sponsor will be informed.  
For at least [ADDRESS_764102] elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the study medication:  
• HMR will ensure that the sponsor’s master file and original copi[INVESTIGATOR_581096] a secure place; and  
• the investigators will ensure that the investigator’s master file, and original source 
documents (other than CRFs) will be archived in a secure place.    
12.4 Clinical Trial Agreement   
The sponsor and the investigators will sign an agreement outlining each par ty’s obligations 
with respect to the trial.  
Each party will allow the other [ADDRESS_764103] one plasma concentration for YF476.  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients who receive at 
least one dose of study medication and have at least one post -baseline assessment.  In this  
population, treatment will be assigned based upon the treatment to which patients were 
randomized regardless of which treatment they actually received. A per -protocol analysis 
will also be completed.  
13.2 General Statistical Considerations  
The null hypothesi s is that there is no difference between YF476 and placebo in the 
treatment of patients with Barrett’s esophagus, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a 
difference between the treatments.  Statistical significance will be defined as p≤0.05.  
Statist ical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_212197].  The statistical package SAS (version 9.2) will be 
used to produce all summary tables and data listings.  
For the data analysis, missing or dropout data will not be imputed; analyses will be 
performed only on observed dat a.  In this study, there will be no significance level 
adjustment for multiplicity.  
Quantitative data will be tabulated with descriptive summary statistics: arithmetic mean,  
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values, and number of observatio ns.  
Geometric mean and geometric CV% will be provided for C max and C trough.   For categorical 
data, frequency tables will be provided.  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing the methodology to be used in the 
final analysis will be prepared  by [CONTACT_581135].  Any deviations from the planned statistical analyses 
in the protocol will be fully described in the SAP.  
13.3 Study Population Data  
The safety population will be summarized for demographic characteristics, and will be 
presented.  Continuous demographic variables (age, weight, height, and BMI) will be 
summarised with descriptive statistics.  Categorical demographic variables (gender, ra ce, 
and ethnicity) will be summarised with frequency counts and corresponding percentages.  
13.4 Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses, summaries and listings will be generated using the efficacy analysis 
set.  
 
 Primary efficacy variables are:  
• Change in Ki67  expression (∆Ki67) Secondary efficacy variables are:   
• Change in CCK2R mRNA levels (measured by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR)  
• Change in DCAMKL1 expression (measured by [CONTACT_4658])  
• Change in DCAMKL1 mRNA levels (measured by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR)  
• Change in COX -2 mRNA levels (measured by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR )  
• Change in p53 expression (measured by [CONTACT_4658])  
• Change in serum gastrin and plasma CgA between baseline and Visit 
5 For all efficacy variables listed above, individual values will be presented by 
[CONTACT_581136].    
The primary endpoint (Cha nge from baseline (Visit 2) in Ki67 expression (∆Ki67)) will be 
summarised using descriptive statistics.  The primary analysis for the primary endpoint will 
use two sample t -tests comparing between treatment groups.  Nominal p -value and 95% 
confidence inte rvals for treatment difference will be reported.   To evaluate the robustness 
of the primary analysis, the following sensitivity analysis will also be performed:   
Baseline Adjusted Analysis: this sensitivity analysis will use an analysis of covariance 
model with the primary endpoint as the dependent variable, treatment group as a factor and 
baseline (Visit 2) as a covariate.  Adjusted least square means and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be reported.  
Serum gastrin and chromogranin A (CgA) will  be measured at baseline (Visit 2) and at 
Weeks 6 and 12.  Analyses will be performed to determine whether there is a correlation 
between baseline gastrin and subsequent ∆Ki67.  YF476 assays will be performed at Weeks 
6 and 12.  
Analysis of the secondary e ndpoints will be similar to the primary analysis. No sensitivity 
analysis is planned for these endpoints.   
13.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters will be done by [CONTACT_581137].  
All pharmacokinetic analyses, summaries, and listings will be generated using the 
pharmacokinetic analysis set.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed in tables of individual values and aggregated 
in summary tables.  Descriptive statistics (sample  size, mean, standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation [%CV], standard error of the mean, minimum, maximum, and 
median) will be calculated at each evaluation timepoint for plasma concentrations of 
YF476.  
Individual, mean and median plasma concentration -time data will be presented graphically.  
The relationship between PK concentrations and plasma CgA concentration or serum 
gastrin concentration will be examined using a graphical approach.  
 
 13.6 Safety Analyses  
Summaries and listings of safety data will be g enerated using the safety analysis set.  
13.6.1  Adverse Event Analyses  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that is current when the database is locked.  All AEs 
including serious AEs will be mapped to system organ class and preferred term, and will be 
listed in the data listing.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatment, having been absent pre -treatment, or that worsens relative to the pre -treatment 
state.    
The number and percentage of patients rep orting TEAEs will be tabulated for the safety 
analysis set by [CONTACT_167500], and further by [CONTACT_581138].    
Listings of deaths, SAEs, and AEs that lead to discontinuation of a patie nt will be 
presented.  
13.6.[ADDRESS_764104] -baseline assessment, will be summarized.     
13.6.3  Electrocardiogram Analyse s  
The ECG variables (PR, RR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF) and heart rate (HR) at each 
planned assessment will be summarised.  The QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate 
by [CONTACT_581139]’s and Fridericia’s formula (QTcB = QT/[RR]1/2 and QTcF =  
QT/[RR]1/3).  The incidence of outliers in absolute QT, QTcF and QTcB intervals (>450, 
>480, and >500 msec), and the change from time -matched baseline in QT, QTcF and QTcB 
intervals (>30 and >60 msec) will be summarised.  
13.7 Determination of sample size  
Based on our preliminary data, we estimate a mean baseline Ki67 index of 45 –50%, with a 
common SD of 14 –18%. Assuming a two -sided type I error rate of 0.05, a sample size of 
20 (10 per arm) has 98% power to detect a 30% absolute difference in ΔKi67 between  the 
two arms if the common SD is 16%, and 97% power for a 25% difference with a 14% 
common SD (see Table 1).

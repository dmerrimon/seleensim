2 INTRODUCTION :  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
Actinic Keratosis (AK) a common skin condition in which excessive and prolonged exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation. AK typi[INVESTIGATOR_565801] 58 million people in the US and is more 
common in older adults, males, and those who are fair skinned. (Kempers et al, 2020). AK 
manifests as scaly, red lesions on face,  trunk, scalp, and other sun exposed extremities; it could 
lead to epi[INVESTIGATOR_565802] (SCC) if left 
untreated (Khanna et al., 2017), with up to 65% of SCC arising from pre -existing AKs (Marks  et 
al, 1988; Criscione  et al, 2009). The rationale behind treating every AK lesion is based on the 
difficulty in predicting which single AK lesion will progress to SCC (Werner  et al, 2015; Drake  
et al, 1995). The goal of treatment is to eliminate AK lesions, ther eby [CONTACT_565831], while 
obtaining the best cosmetic outcomes. While the clinical trials have compared the treatment 
outcomes of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Zane et al, 201 6), patient reported outcomes (PROs), including 
patient preferences and what patients value the most for the AK treatment could improve total 
patient management in AK (Esmann  et al, 2015, Siegel et al, 2017, Kopasker et al., 2019).  
The AK lesions may caus e cosmetic discomfort and due to the premalignant nature of the 
condition, patients may fear developi[INVESTIGATOR_192785]. This fear may affect patients’ overall well -
being by [CONTACT_565832] (Tennvall et al, 2015). Patients may feel embarrassed an d 
frustrated with AK lesions located on the face  (Esmann et al, 2007). Studies have shown that AK 
has negative impact on the patient’s daily living activities and their Quality of Life (QoL) (Grada 
et al, 2021), and presence of higher AK lesion counts on the face have been shown to be 
associated with worse skin -related quality of life among AK patients (Siegel et al, 2017; Emilio 
et al, 2016). AK treatments are associated with different level s of local skin reactions (LSRs) 
such as erythema, swelling, erosi on, crusts , scaling, itching and burning sensation (Jansen et al, 
2019) , and such negative experience s with treatment may adversely impact the future willingness 
to retreat and treatment adherence  among AK patients  that can lead to poor outcomes in long 
term (Balcere et al, 2019; Del Rosso  et al, 2014; Goldberg, 2017; Rosso et  al., 2021 ). Therefore, 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

it is important to incorporate PROs that provides patient perspectives and provides important 
supplement to efficacy and safety data for the treatment(s), showcasing their complete value 
proposition.  
Several PRO instruments have been utilized to measure patients’ Q oL and satisfaction with 
treatments for AK (Grada et al, 2021). Skindex -29 and Skindex -16 are frequently used validated 
PRO tools th at measure skin -related Q oL among dermatologic patients (Chren et al, 2001; Chren 
2012); the 16 -item shorter version is a newer instrument that measures the frequency at which 
skin condition’s symptoms, personal emotions and functions impact patients’ Q oL, and could 
directly aid measurement of treatment effect in studies (Emilio et al, 2016; Augustin et al, 2015). 
Actinic Keratosis Quality of Life is a AK -specific validated instrument that assesses patient 
QoL; it is a 9 -item questionnaire that has three do mains covering function, emotions and control 
and one single global item  (Esmann et al, 2013) ; potential  overlap of these domains with 
Skindex -[ADDRESS_743233] of 
treatments on patients. The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is a 
frequently used validated instrument to measure patient satisfaction across different product 
attributes; TSQM -9, encompassing 9 items covering satisfaction with treatment effectiveness and 
convenience, and global satisfaction has been shown to correlate improvement in clinical 
outcomes to better satisfaction across the questionnaire domains (Bharmal et al, 2009; A ugustin 
et al, 2015, Stockfleth et al, 2017). A combination of these PRO instruments may provide the 
foundation to assess patients’ perspective and capture different aspect s of health related Q oL, 
impact of treatment on patient QoL,  and patients’ satisfaction with the AK medications and fill 
critical gaps in AK literature.  
Several ther apeutic options  are currently available to manage AK, including, lesion -directed and 
field-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Eisen  et al, 2021). F ield-directed ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969] , 
are usually found effective, while causing LSRs at the treated area . The duration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_197435] s and severity of LSRs may affect patients’ QoL, treatment adherence , satisfaction,  and 
overall outcomes  (Balcere et al, 2019 ; Del Rosso  et al, 2014; Diepgen  et al, 2019; Goldberg, 
2017 ; Rosso et al., 2021 ). Some patients may even reject treatments altogether  if they feel the 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

risks and burdens outweigh the benefits (Kopasker  et al, 2019 ; Stockfleth  et al, 2015 ). There 
remains an unmet need for a treatment which has more tolerable LSRs and more convenient 
dosing for patients while still being effective in clearing the lesions (Kempers  et al, 2020).  
Congruently, assessment of patient perceptions of cosmetic o utcomes  and their future 
preference/willingness to retreat  with a specific treatment could serve as key outcome measures 
in patient -centric studies, especially in the real -world settings , to inform optimal management of 
patient s with AK in routine clinical practices .  
Qualitative tele -depth interviews of AK patients w ere conducted to solicit their perspectives on 
impact of AK and topi[INVESTIGATOR_565803] . The interviews  
highlighted the importance of key  QoL domains such as emotions and functioning, as well as the 
impact of treatment related  LSRs on patient QoL, daily activities  and overall treatment 
satisfaction. Using a qualitative modified delphi method, an expert panel was convened to 
determine the questions to solicit patient (and clinician) perspectives  of clinical and cosmetic 
outcomes  associated with AK , future treatment preferences and  the perceptions of treatment 
related  LSRs ; the expert panel a greed on 11 specific items  encompassing these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] . The 
overall appearance of the skin in the treated area, satisfaction with the treatment’s ability to 
improve how skin looks, satisfaction with the treatment’s ability to improve skin texture were 
suggested to address facets of cosmetic outcome s; likelihood to consider treatment again, and 
overall satisfaction with current (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) treatment  were suggested to support future preference 
assessment; relative rating of duration of LSRs  and severity of LSRs associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_197435] s, and relative impact of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] s on patient’s daily activities  were suggested 
to assess perceptions of LSR.  The expert panel also suggested evaluating the relative 
‘convenience /ease of use ’ of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969] , considering its potential impact on treatment 
adherence . These collective recommendations are aligned with the consensus statement on core 
outcome set for AK  (Reynolds et al, 2020) . Lastly, t he panel also suggested two novel clinical 
outcome measures to assess the clinical status of AK in the real -world settings , incl. a n IGA on 
the level of AK lesion clearance, and an  IGA of severity of skin photodamage  in the treated area . 
These eleven questions constitut ed the Expert Panel Questionnaire (EPQ) . As a consensus, the 
expert panel concluded that the EPQ,  along with Skindex -16 and TSQM -9 are optimal tool s to

use in community -based real world research involving AK patients  to highlight treatment 
benefits . These tools are depi[INVESTIGATOR_162036] -B. 
Tirbanibulin (Klisyri®) offers a safe and efficacious treatment option for AK patients. 
Tirbanibulin is a synthetic, first -in-class, potent anti -proliferative agent that inhibits tubulin 
polymerization and disrupts Src kinase signaling that are upregulated in AK and iSCC (Kempers  
et al, 2020). Two double -blind, vehicle -controlled, randomized Phase 3 studies, as well as 
supportive data from the Phase 2a study, demonstrated that treatment with tirbanibulin ointment 
1% for 5 days was efficacious in the clearance of AK. When compared with vehicle, treatment 
with tirbanibulin ointment 1% resulted in statistically significantly higher rates of complete 
(100%) AK clearance, as well as clearance of each the face, and scalp su bgroups, independently, 
for each Phase 3 study  (Blauvelt  et al, 2021). Concordant with the primary efficacy endpoint, 
partial (≥75%) clearance rates and reduction in AK lesion counts over time were also statistically 
higher in the tirbanibulin -treated grou p than the vehicle group in both Phase 3 studies. No 
discontinuations or SAEs related to tirbanibulin were reported in the two trials (Blauvelt  et al, 
2019). Due to the advantage of shorter treatment duration and less severe LSRs, tirbanibulin 
have potenti al to enhance treatment adherence  and satisfaction, compared to other topi[INVESTIGATOR_73211]  (Marson  et al, 2021; Rosso et al, 2021).  
The clinical trial results of tirbanibulin highlight the clinical benefits derived by [CONTACT_565833]. 
The demonstration of ti rbanibulin -related benefits, including its impact on patient HRQoL, 
patient and clinician satisfaction with tirbanibulin treatment, and their preferences in real world 
community practice settings is warranted to highlight tirbanibulin value proposition to patients, 
clinicians and payers alike. The Skindex -[ADDRESS_743234] on different aspects of patient QoL is still evolving. A real -
world study l everaging validated instruments such  as Skindex -16, AKQ oL and  the 
complimentary novel EPQ (developed using modified delphi method)  could help portray a 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1 
Protocol # M-[ADDRESS_743235] of AK and AK treatment on patient s’ QoL.  Further, assessing the 
impact of tirbanibulin  treatment  on AK patient outcomes  and preferences , including treatment 
satisfaction  and future preference , in real -world  community practice settings could highlight the 
humanistic  and clinical benefits  associated th is tirbanibulin treatment . 
3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate PROs in terms of health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL) among Subjects with AK in the face or scalp  who are administered tirbanibulin in real -
world community practice settings in the  U.S. The secondary obje ctive is to evaluate 
effectiveness of tirbanibulin treatment, measured by [CONTACT_565834] (IGA) of 
the status of AK in the treated area on the face  or scalp .  
 
The additional study objectives include the following evaluations among study Subjects and Site 
Investigators:  
• Subject and clinician satisfaction with tirbanibulin treatment  and associated outcomes.  
• Subject and clinician reported improvement in overall appearance of Subject’s skin in the 
treated area . 
• Subject and clinician reported effect/impact of LSRs . 
• Subject and clinician  reported future treatment preference.  
• Safety and tolerability of tirbanibulin . 
 
Note: Dermatologists are expected to predominantly constitute the Site Investigator category, while a few physician 
assistants and nurse practitioners may be included in the study, reflecting the routine care management of AK in 
community practice settings .

Investigators ’) shall provide the commercial supply of tirbanibulin (Klisyri®) to eligible study 
Subjects.  
 
Tirbanibulin has a n evolving market access in the U.S, with payers reimbursing for the commercial 
prescri ptions on a restricted basis. Selection of only the patients who are able to fill the prescription 
for reimbursed tirbanibulin may not be representative of individuals who might be candidates for 
tirbanibulin in the U.S; this may impact the generalization of the study results. To avoid this 
potential selection bias and improve the prospect of generalization of study results, the commercial 
supply of tirbanibulin (Klisyri®) will be supplied to Site Investigators for the 5-day treatment 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_565807] . 
 
Per FDA prescribing information, the recommended dosage of Klisyri® (tirbanibulin ointment  
1%) is 1 single -dose packet (2.5 mg tirbanibulin in 250 mg) per application , for 5 consecutive 
days.  The Site Investigators will prescribe tirbanibulin to patients per their clinical judgement. 
Correspondingly, tirbanibulin prescribed dose and frequency will be captured as part of study data 
collection.

6.3.2  Study  Subjects  
Upon successful recruitment of the study sites, the respective Site Investigators may identify a 
study coordinator at their clinics. Site Investigators and/or the study coordinator will approach, 
screen and consent up to  a maximum of [ADDRESS_743243] during the routine patient visit or via email or 
phone; upon establishing contact [CONTACT_565837], they will be provided with a descri ption of 
study objectives and procedures.  
In the case of in -person recruitment of study Subjects, Subjects will be screened for study 
eligibility using the study screener. The Subjects deemed eligible for the study will then be 
provided with a study inform ed consent form. The study coordinator or Site Investigator will 
ensure that Subjects can read the consent form and ask questions and be given adequate time to 
consider the benefits/risks associated with participation in the study. An informed consent will  be 
obtained from each subject in accordance with applicable regulations prior to participating in any 
study procedures.  
In the case of recruitment of study Subjects via email or phone, study coordinator or Site 
Investigator will pre -screen the Subjects fo r study eligibility and will then contact [CONTACT_565838]. The eligible Subjects will be then provided with a weblink to an 
onlin e screener and electronic consent (e -consent) form. If a Mobile App is used for the purpose 
of the study data collection from the Subjects, recruited study Subjects will be asked to download 
the Mobile App; as they log -in an e -consent form may be presented  via the App. Subjects will be 
able to quickly read and provide informed consent prior to participating in any study procedures 
by [CONTACT_62262] a box next to the statement, “I h ave read the above statement and I consent to 
participate in this study” and signin g their name(s) along with dating the online form (using their 
web browser or the study Mobile App) . 
Site Investigator  or the study coordinator will assign subject IDs to Subjects sequentially, as they 
are recruited. Site coordinator will maintain a recruitment log that will identify the subject ID 
number to their name/contact [CONTACT_2997]. Study site staff alone will have access  to Subject contact

determines that the withdrawal is related to a n adverse drug reaction (A DR) or  serious adverse 
event (SAE) associated with tirbanibulin, he/she will gather necessary information concerning 
the ADR/ SAE. The Site Investigator may follow -up with the subject subsequently to ensure 
resolution of ADR/ SAE epi[INVESTIGATOR_565810].  There will be no replacement of Subjects who withdraw or discontinue early from the 
study.  
7 STUDY SCHEDULE & PROCEDURES  
Study eligible patients who are considered as candidates for tirbanibulin treatment as part of 
usual care AK management will be screened, consented,  and recruited into the study, followed 
for up to [ADDRESS_743247] data  collection encounters. With 
‘T’ being the index date of tirbanibulin treatment initiation, the baseline data collection (from 
both Site Investigator s and Subjects) may transpi[INVESTIGATOR_565811] T= -[ADDRESS_743248] -index 
date and T= + [ADDRESS_743249] -index date; t he 8-week follow -up data collection (Study Encounter  # 2; 
from both Site Investigators and Subjects) will happen at T=[ADDRESS_743250] -index date + 7 days; 
and 24 -week follow -up data collection (Study Encounter  #3; from both Site Investigators and 
Subjects) will happen at T=[ADDRESS_743251] -index date + [ADDRESS_743252] application/ initiation of tirbanibulin treatment, after the subject was prescribed the 
tirbanibulin . 
Different data elements will be collected from Site Investigators  and from study Subjects at these 
data collection encounters, as outlined below.

Protocol # M-[ADDRESS_743253] Study Encounter / Baseline  
Baseline data collection will take place at the time of subject enrollment into the study or within 
a few days of recruitment. The subject encounters are expected to take place during in -person 
subject visits to the clinic. The recruited Site Investigators  and study Subjects will be sent a 
weblink to the eDCFs and survey respectively for their completion. Subjects will be able to 
access the surveys on their mobile phone, using a study -specific Mobile App.  
The following data elements will be collected at bas eline, from patient medical charts and/or per 
Site Investigator’s best clinical judgement based on their recent encounter with the study subject 
while prescribing tirbanibulin as part of usual care and based on subject’s recent past medical 
history:  
• Demogr aphics (e.g., age, gender).  
• General clinical characteristics, as documented in medical charts (incl. blood pressure, 
waist circumference, height/weight measurements, comorbidities).  
• AK disease characteristics ( incl. AK history , IGA of severity of current skin 
photodamage in the AK treated area on the face or scalp  (using EPQ item )). 
• Past AK treatment history (used ever, and those used within the past 6 months).  
• Tirbanibulin treatment characteristics (dose, frequency, date of recommendation).

shipped to the attention of Site Investigator  at their clinic/s ite. The Site Investigators will be 
asked to record the planned first day of administration of tirbanibulin , and this date will 
constitute the study ‘index date’ , upon which the follow -up encounter timepoints (at weeks 8  & 
24) will be determined.  
7.3 Second  Study  Encounter  
At the completion of 8 weeks (+ 7 days) post -index date, the Site Investigators  and Subjects  will 
be asked to complete the data collection  corresponding to the study primary endpoints . The 
subject encounters (post -baseline) are expected to take place during in -person subject visits to 
the clinic, but remote/virtual visits may be allowed where COVID -related protocols prevent in -
person visits .

• Perceptions and satisfaction with different attributes of tirbanibulin (using TSQM -9 and EPQ 
items , where applicable ), and future preference to re -treat with tirbanibulin . 
 
Both the Site Investigators  and Subjects will be thanked for their participation in the study. No 
specific study close -out tasks are expected of the study Subjects. Site Investigators  will be asked 
to submit any outstanding data queries to the research team and then close out the st udy records 
at their respective sites.  
7.5 AK Photography & Subject Insights  
In a small subset of sites  (up to 2), Site Investigators will utilize Canfield® photography 
equipment to take photographs of Subject’s AK treated area in the face or scalp to visually  
capture the clinical status of AK at baseline (study entry) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 , and will 
document the ir assessment /grading  of LSR . In addition to the baseline and Week -8 encounters, 
Subjects  at these sites will hence be consented to undertake additional in-person visits  at Weeks 
1, 2 & [ADDRESS_743255] a 1 -3 minute audio 
narrating their perceptions of treatment benefits associated with the tirbanibulin.  
7.6 Early Termination Encounter ( Study Encounter  # x) 
Site Investigators  will attempt to follow the progress of every subject admitted to the study  
through to study completion.  If a subject fails to complete requested study procedures (i.e,  
completion of online sur veys, or complete study visits ), a reasonable  effort will be made to 
contact [CONTACT_565842](s) for  non-compliance  with study procedures .  

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1 
Protocol # M-[ADDRESS_743256] does not complete the study for any reason (including Site I nvestigator discretion), 
the reason and circumstances for the subject’s early termination will be documented ; if possible, 
the assessments specified for the forthcoming (next) study encounter will be performed.  
8 STUDY ASSESSMENT S 
PROs , encompassing HRQoL , treatment sa tisfaction and elements from EPQ , will be assessed 
with study Subjects . Tirbanibulin  treatment effectiveness and treatment satisfaction will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_565843] s. Future treatment preferences will be assesse d with both 
Subjects and Site Investigators. Safety will be evaluated in terms of AEs and ADRs during the 
treatment period.  For pertinent measures, the study respondents will be given an option to 
indicate “don’t know / not applicable” , especially related to absence of information tied to a 
missing visit or Subject discontinuation from the study.  
8.1 HRQoL Assessments   
The Skindex  16 consists of 16 items that are classified into three domains: symptoms (four 
items), emotions, (seven items) and functioning (five items) (Chren 2012; Chren et al, 2001) . 
The following questions (items) correspond to each subscale:  
 
Scale  Items  
Symptoms  1-4 
Emotions  5-11 
Functioning  12-16 
 
All items are scored on a seven -point adjectival response scale, with a potential score of 0 to 6. A 
total score is the average of all 1 6 items  and tran sformed to a liner scale of 100  varying from 0 
(never  bothered) to 100 (always bothered).  A domain score is determined by [CONTACT_565844] o f 
scores in each scale within the domain.  The higher the score, the more severe is the impairment.  
The questionnaire will be administered in entirety, at baseline and at Week [ADDRESS_743257] -index date.  

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1 
Protocol # M-[ADDRESS_743258]  Treatment Satisfaction  Assessments  
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM -9) will be used to assess the 
treatment satisfaction of Subjects at Weeks 8 & 24 for all patients , in relation to the tirbanibulin 
treatment they received at the beginning of the study . TSQM -9 will measure patient satisfaction 
with treatment on three key domains , namely, effectiveness , convenience , and global 
satisfaction. The following questions (items) correspond to each subscale:  
Scale  Items  
Effectiveness  1-[ADDRESS_743259] items are scored on a 7-point Likert  scale  of: 1: very dissatisfied; 2: moderately 
dissatisfied; 3: slightly dissatisfied; 4: neutral; 5: slightly satisfied; 6: moderately satisfied; 7: 
very satisfied.  Items 7 and 8 of TSQM -9 are scored on a 5-point scale  of: 1: not at all 
confident/certain ; 2: a little confident/certain; 3: somewhat confident/certain ; 4: very 
confident/certain;  5: extremely confident/certain . TSQM subscale scores will be computed per 
tool owner specifications and transformed to score s ranging from [ADDRESS_743260] 16 weeks (since Week 8 visit) , to solicit their satisfaction 
with the most recent course of tirbanibulin treatment.  
Subject’s rating (at Weeks 8 & 24) of their satisfaction with the ability of tirbanibulin treatment 
to ‘improve how their skin looks’ and ‘improve their skin texture’ respectively , in the original 
treated area will be assessed. The responses will be solicited on the following 7 -point Likert  
scale: 1: very dissatisfied; 2: moderately dissatisfied; 3: slightly dissatisfied; 4: neutral; 5: 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

slightly satisfied; 6: moderately satisfied; 7: very satisfied . These two EPQ ite ms will also be 
administered at Week [ADDRESS_743261]’s rating of their ‘overall satisfaction’ with tirbanibulin treatment, in comparison to other 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786](s) will be assessed using a 5 -point Likert  scale of: 1: much worse; 2: somewhat 
worse; 3: same; 4: somewhat better; 5: much better . This ‘overall satisfaction’ assessment will be 
conducted among two Subject sub groups:  
• Among Subjects who have experienced other topi[INVESTIGATOR_565813]: At Week 8, compare rating of tirbanibulin treatment vs. previous 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786](s).  
• Among Subjects who have been retreated with other topi[INVESTIGATOR_565814] (other than 
tirbanibulin) between Week -8 and Week -24 visits: At Week 24, compare rating of 
original tirbanibulin treatment (at beginning of the study) vs. most recent topi[INVESTIGATOR_197435](s).  
To complement the overall satisfaction question, factors assoc iated with Subject’s satisfaction 
rating will be assessed.  
8.2.1  Site Investigator Treatment Satisfaction Assessments  
An ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire very similar to TSQM -9 will be used to assess Site 
Investigators’ satisfaction with tirbanibulin treatment at Weeks 8 & 24, in relation to the 
tirbanibulin treatment they administered to Subjects at the beginning of the study . The individual 
item and subscale scorings will be done similar to the original TSQM -[ADDRESS_743262] 16 weeks (since Week 8 visit), 
to solicit their satisfaction with the most recent course of tirbani bulin treatment.  

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

Site Investigator’s rating (at Weeks 8 & 24) of their satisfaction with the ability of tirbanibulin 
treatment to ‘improve how their patient’s skin looks ’ and ‘improve their patient’s skin texture’ 
respectively , in the original treated area  will be assessed . The responses will be solicited on the 
following 7 -point Likert  scale: 1: very dissatisfied; 2: moderately dissatisfied; 3: slightly 
dissatisfied; 4: neutral; 5: slightly satisfied; 6: moderately satisfied; 7: very satisfied . These two 
EPQ items will also be administered at Week [ADDRESS_743263] recent course of tir banibulin treatment.  
Site Investigator’s rating of their ‘overall satisfaction’ with tirbanibulin treatment, in comparison 
to other topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786](s) will be assessed using a 5 -point Likert  scale of: 1: much worse; 2: 
somewhat worse; 3: same; 4: somewha t better; 5: much better . This ‘overall satisfaction’ 
assessment will be conducted among two Subject subgroups:  
• Among Subjects who have experienced other topi[INVESTIGATOR_565813]: At Week 8, compare rating of tirbanibulin  treatment vs. previous 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786](s).  
• Among Subjects who have been retreated with other topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969] (other than 
tirbanibulin) between Week -8 and Week -24 visits: At Week 24, compare rating of 
original tirbanibulin treatment (at beginning of the study) vs. most recent topi[INVESTIGATOR_197435](s).  
To complement the overall satisfaction question, factors associated with Site Investigator’s 
satisfaction rating will be assessed.  
8.3 Treatment  Effectiveness Assessments  
The effectiveness of tirbanibulin  treatment  will be assessed from the perspective of Site 
Investigator s as well as the Subjects . It is expected that the Site Investigator assessments will be 
conducted via in -person visits/encounters at baseline , Week 8 and Week 24 , and when in -person 
assessments are not feasible (owing to COVID -related travel restrictions), the assessments

evaluations for a subject during the study, as feasible . 
8.3.1  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA):  
Site Investigators  to assess the status of subject’s AK in the treated area on the face or scalp 
using the following IGA scale, at Weeks 8  and 24. The IGA should be representative of the 
investigator’s overall genera l assessment of the subject’s AK and take into account the quality, 
as well as the quantity, of AK lesions.  
Outcome Measure  Score  
Completely cleared - Approximately 100% clearance of AK 
lesions in the treated area  0 
Partially cleared - Approximately >75% clearance of AK 
lesions in the treated area  1 
Moderately cleared - Approximately 50 -74% clearance of 
AK lesions in the treated area  2 
Minimally Cleared - Approximately <50% clearance of AK 
lesions in the treated area  3 
Not Cleared - Approximately 0% clearance, i.e., all AK

8.4.4  Adher ence  to Treatment  
Subjects will report (at Week 8) their a dherence to tirbanibulin treatment by [CONTACT_565846] -dose applications within the expected 5 -day application period/regimen.  
8.5 Safety Assessments  
8.5.1  Definition of Adverse Events & Adverse Drug Reactions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical  product 
which does not necessarily h ave a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can  therefore 
be any unf avorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
The Site Investigator will use the following terms to assess the severity of each AE:  
• Mild :  Awareness  of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable)  
• Moderate :  Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)  
• Severe :  Interferes significantly with ability to do work or usual activity (unacceptable)  

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significa nt hazard,  
contraindication, side effect or precaution. With respect to human clinical experience, this  
includes any event which:  
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] * or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with  any 
deterioration in condition.  
o elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated  to 
the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug . 
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] . 
o social reasons an d respi[INVESTIGATOR_565816]’s 
general condition . 
• results in persistent of significant disability / incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,  
• is a significant or important medical event that, based on appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above.  
* Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_565817] (in-patient) stay at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202902].  
For all AEs (either re lated or not related  to study medication ), information about the outcome 
(i.e., recovered, recovering, not recovered, recovered with sequelae, fatal , unknown ) and the 
action taken with the study treatment ( i.e., drug withdraw n, dose reduced, dose increased, dose 
not changed , not applicable ) will be documented . 
Each AE, either serious or non -serious for which a causal relationship to tirbanibulin  cannot be 
excluded, will be considered as an ADR. An ADR is an injury caused by [CONTACT_565847]. 
ADRs may occur following a single dose  or prolonged administration of a medicinal product or 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

result from the combination of two or  more medicinal products. LSRs  (such as: erythema, 
flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation , and erosion/ulcer ation ), skin scarring  
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (such as: hypo - and hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]) as a result of application of 
tirbanibulin in AK treatment area will not be considered as ADRs , but will be documented 
separately .  
The determination of whether an AE is related to study treatment (tirbanibulin ) will be based on 
information  regarding the degree to which the study treatment had caused or contributed to the 
event and will be categorized per the following criteria:  
• Related :  There were good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. plausible time sequence, 
dose-response relations hip, pharmacology, positive de -challenge and/or re -challenge) to 
assume a causal relationship with the study medication in the sense that it is plausible, 
conceivable or likely.  
• Not Related :  There were good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. implausible time 
sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs) to rule out a causal 
relationship with the study medication.  
8.5.2  Documentation of AEs and Reporting of SAEs and Serious  ADRs  
The Site Investigator is responsible for assessing and documenting (in subject medical charts, as 
part of usual care) all AEs that occur  at any time during the study. The Site Investigator will 
determine the relatedness, seriousness, and severity for each AE, which is then recorded in the 
Adverse Events page of the eDCF , per study schedule of events (Appendix A) . Following the 
Subject encounter  at Weeks 8  and 24 (be it, via in -person or remote en counters) , the Site 
Investigator will evaluate the documentation (in subject medical charts ; corresponding to the 
time since the last visit ) to report AEs  and indicate whether those events resulted in stoppage or 
changes to dose of tirbanibulin, as applicable . 
Each AE that meet s the definition of SAE  or Serious ADR  will be recorded in the eDCF and 
comprehensively documented on the “ Safety Report Form ” and reported within 1 working day 
(24 hours) of learning of the event to Almirall via email.  If any additional information is needed 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1 
Protocol # M-[ADDRESS_743268] results in modification of study medication dose  or 
discontinuation of  study medication  and/or withdrawal of subject from the study, such 
information will be documented as part of eDCF  and in  the Safety Report form . 
As part of usual care, Site Investigator will follow Subjects concerning all SAEs and Serious 
ADRs until adequate resolution or stabilization.  If the SAE/Serious ADR has not resolved or 
stabilized by [CONTACT_565848]’s 
termination from the study, the Site Investigator may subsequently follow -up with the Subject to 
check the status of Subject’s SAE/Serious ADR, prior to completing the eDCF for Subject’s last 
encounter , if feasible.  
If a study subject (in case of female) becomes pregnant during the study  period , the Site 
Investigator may withdraw the patient from  the study (i.e., early termination) for safety reasons. 
In this scenario, the Site Investigator will document the reasons for withdrawal in the eDCF  and 
may conduct necessary follow -ups with the patient to ensure safety, as part of usual care.  
Occurrence of this (pregnancy) event will be rep orted to the study sponsor within 1 working day 
(24 hours) of learning of the event . 
The full description of safety reporting logistics  will be outlined in the study Safety Reporting 
Plan.  
9 STUDY OVERSIGHT  
The overall study principal investigator s (PIs) along with the principal investigator (Program 
Lead) at CRO will be responsible for this real-world study oversight, including monitoring 
safety, ensuring that the study is conducted according to the protocol and ensuring data integrity. 
The Program Lead within the CRO will review the data for safety concerns and data trends at 
regular intervals, and will prom ptly report to the study PIs, the central IRB (and any local IRBs, 
if applicable) and to the study Sponsor any ADRs, protocol deviation, or any other significant 
event that arises during the conduct of the study.

10 SITE MONITORING, QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURA NCE  
Study site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights of human Subjects  are protected, that 
the study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and/or other operating procedures, and 
that the quality and integrity of study data and data col lection methods are maintained. Site 
monitoring for this minimal -risk, real-world study will be performed by [CONTACT_2024].  The CRO will 
routinely evaluate study processes and documentation based on the protocol  and other applicable 
requirement s, if any . 
All site monitoring activities will be performed remotely  for this study , with occasio nal visits to 
select sites to check on study procedures . Site Investigators or the assigned study coordinators 
will be contact[CONTACT_565849] -ups happen as planned.  Study data review will be undertaken 
by [CONTACT_565850] -up encounters for data collection from Site 
Investigators and stu dy Subjects . Data inquiries will be shared with the Site Investigators for 
clarification and/or fill missing data elements, or gather additional information, as it may pertain 
to reported AEs/SAEs.  
[ADDRESS_743269], linked data sources, one being the traditional 
EDC containing eDCF to gather data from Site Investigators ; another being the mobile App that 
gathers data directly from study Subjects . The back -end EDC platform will be programmed with 
edit checks  and will be reflected on the Data Validation Plan  and the programmer -version of 
eDCFs with edit checks will be made part of the DMP . The EDC will be appropriately validated 
by [CONTACT_565851] -tested with a few clinicians and patients prior to start of the  study. The study 
data procedures will ensure that the incoming data from Site Investigators and Subjects  are 
automatically checked for data quality  and safety events.  
A centralized data review strategy will ensure consistency, integrity  and logical completeness  of 
the AE data . Queries will be generated for study sites to solicit additional required information, 
as needed. Site Investigators will respond to any data query generated by [CONTACT_166181] a prompt 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

manner. Incoming AE data will be routinely chec ked to flag SAEs  and serious ADRs  and 
Pregnancy reports , ensur ing site’s completion of relevant Safety Report or Pregnancy Report 
forms, and shar ing them with the study sponsor in an expedited manner. As a result of data 
queries, if a ny data corrections are required in the EDC portal , those edits  will be made at the 
back -end by [CONTACT_565852].  
Any additional quality assessment(s) will be carried out at the time of pre -specified study 
analy tic timeframes , per the data management plan. Following completion of all data review 
activities  for all patients , records within the master dataset will be locked , followed by 
[CONTACT_565853].  The medical history, AEs, and concomitant medications 
(including rescue medications) will be coded; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and 
WHO -DRU G Enhanced dictionaries will be used, version number of each dictionary will be 
documented in the DMP.  A Quality Control check to ensure the accuracy of the data will be done 
by [CONTACT_565854] . Specific ations of the 
Quality Control check will be found in the DMP.  An audit trail of data modifications will be 
maintained in order to protect the authenticity and integrity of the study data.  
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Detailed plans for the statistical method s will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
which will be finalized prior to database lock.  
12.1 Sample Size Considerations  
No formal sample size and power calculations were undertaken. Considering the descriptive nature 
of the study and the feasibility of recruiting the study population , approximately 300 study Subjects  
from across a maximum of 50 clinical sites for the entire study has been identified as a sample to 
guide the planned analysis addressing the study objectives.

12.2 Analysis Populat ions and Datasets  
Statistical analysis and data tabulation will be performed using the following analysis 
populations unless specified otherwise:  
• Safety Population : All patients who received at least one dose of tirbanibulin  during the 
study observation pe riod of 8-weeks  related to primary endpoint , as part of usual care.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All patients within the Safety Population that had at least some 
data pertaining to the key variables studied at relevant timepoints , post -baseline . 
 
There is a likelihood that the Safety population and FAS may be the same in certain scenarios, 
including  when no patient discontinues tirbanibulin  following study enrollment and prior to 8-
week  follow -up data collection. In such scenarios, FAS will be the main dataset for all analyses. 
In the event that the safety population and FAS differ, all safety evalua tions (part of additional 
objectives) will be conducted among the safety population, while FAS will be used to conduct 
analyses addressing rest of the study objectives, including the primary objective.  
 
12.3 General Statistical Procedures  
12.3.1  Overview  
Data from Site Investigators and study Subjects  will be combined into one dataset. No site -specific 
analyses will be conducted. Validated instruments will be scored according to developer 
guidelines, reporting domain scores and overall summary scores, as appropriate. EPQ and other 
ad hoc questions  will be analyzed and reported individually, based on the respective response 
scales. For all outcome measures, the analyses will focus on baseline , Week -8 and Week -24, as 
applicable . 
  
All statistical analyses will be based on all available  data assuming that all missing data are 
uninformative and will be conducted using appropriate statistical software, such as  SAS.  An 
interim analysis will be conducted after the completion of 8 weeks of data collection for all study

summary tables and figures.  
 
12.3.3  Subgroup Analysis  
 
Primary , secondary,  and additional (non-safety) endpoints may be summari zed and repeated for 
the following  subgroups , if sample size permits , using  FAS: 
• AK Treatment location: face, scalp.  
• Age groups: <49 years, 50 -64 years , and ≥ 65 years .  
• Fitzpatrick I/II, and III/IV/V/V I. 
• Prior treatment experience , as applicable : 
o Cryosurgery vs . all others ; 
o Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_565818] . all others ; 
o Treatment naïve vs.  all others . 
• Patients re -treated between Week -8 and Week -24 visits , vs. all others , as applicable.  
 
Descriptive analyses of Safety data will be carried out using safety population dataset.  

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

applicable ), and at Week 24 (where applicable ) post-index date will be assessed  using relevant 
multivariate analyses, adjusting for subject baseline characteristics and other variables (such as 
medication adherence) to discern the factors influencing these outcomes, as feasible. Pearson 
correlation coe fficients may be used to assess the correlation between key outcome measures; 
this may also inform the consideration of covariates in the select ed multivariate analyses (to 
reduce multicollinearity).  
12.4 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary endpoint of PROs  measured using Skindex -16 at Week 8 will be assessed 
descriptively  using the FAS dataset . 
The individual item and domain/ subscale scores of Skindex -16 will be created per instrument 
developer instructions , analyzed descriptively  (ie, using mean, SD, median, minimum and 
maximum), for the baseline and Week 8 encounters, treating the responses as categorical variables  
and/or continuous variable , as appropriate.  CFB in Skindex -16 score will be explored and reported 
using descriptive statistics. For the overall questionnaire data evaluation, no missing data 
imputation will be applied to compute domain /subscale  scores . 
12.5 Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The secondary endpoint of the study is the proportion of Subjects with a n IGA success, defined as 
achieving a rating of ‘ completely clear ed’ (0) or ‘partially clear ed’ (1) in IGA of AK status at Week 8. This 
analyses of IGA will be conducted for the overall cohort  (using FAS) . 
12.[ADDRESS_743272]’s satisfaction with tirbanibulin treatment at Week s 8 and 24  measured using TSQM -9 
will be analyzed  for relevant groups of Subjects , using descriptive statistics (ie, mean, SD,

• Subject and Site Investigator’s rating of how tirban ibulin (at Week s 8 and 24 , for relevant 
groups of Subjects ) treatment impacted their daily activities due to skin reactions , in 
comparison to previous (or most recent) topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786](s) to treat their AK ; proportion 
of respondents who indicated ‘somewhat better or much better’  on the response scale will 
be reported  using FAS.  
12.6.6  Unscheduled Patient Encounters  
Number of unscheduled clinician encounters (via in -person clinic visits, telehealth visits and phone 
calls) that AK patient had in the past 8 weeks will be analyzed  at Week 8 using descriptive  statistics 
(i.e., mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum)  and reported.  
12.6.7  Treatment Adherence   
Treatment adherence will be assessed (at Week 8) as the number of missed single -dose 
applications within the expected 5 -day application period/regimen divided by [CONTACT_325501], the expected 
number of single -dose applications of tirbanibulin during the study observation period  within 
first [ADDRESS_743278] , using FAS. Summaries 
will be presented using descriptive statistics for the Safety population.  
Percentage Adherence  = [1 - [# of missed single -dose applications  out of 5 ] / 5 ]*100  
12.6.8  Safety Assessments  
The safety data will be analyzed descriptively using Safety Population dataset (if it is different 
from FAS), to report the frequency of occurrences of AEs , SAEs, ADRs , and LSRs . These will 
be reported at individual item level as well in aggregate at relevant category level  for Week [ADDRESS_743279]-index 
date because of AEs , ADRs  and for any other reasons  will be reported, as documented in patient 
medical charts.

12.7 Missing Data Handling  
The missing data pertinent to the validated instrument s Skindex -16, and TSQM -9 will be 
handled per instrument owner instructions  / scoring manual.  For all study variables and 
endpoints, n o missing data imputation is planned.  
12.[ADDRESS_743280] visits are conducted via remote 
visits instead of in -person visits, the nature of visit (remote vs. in -person) may be used to stratify 
the analysis of secondary en dpoint involving IGA , if sample size permits . Details of the sensitivity 
analyses will be further described in SAP  prior to database lock . 
 
13 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
Study staff will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study  for the integrity 
of research and protection of confidentiality of Subjects . Study staff will permit authorized 
representatives of the IRB and study CRO to examine research records for the purposes of 
quality assurance revie ws, audits, and evaluation of the study safety  and progress . 
The eDCFs represent a record of the subject’s experience in the study, therefore, the eDCF data  
will be supported by [CONTACT_532208] (or source) medical records, where feasible . Prior to enrolling a 
subject in the study, the s Site Investigator or site staff  will document his/her review of  subject 
eligibility criteria in the source records for the subject.  Curre nt or c hanges in clinical 
characteristics of the AK patients, including current or changes to disease severity and 
medications will be documented in patient medical charts as part of routine clinical practice, and 
these  may constitute source records  for the Subjects . Data recorded directly into the eDCF (via 
online portal) is also considered source data when there are no other written or electronic records 

PROAK Study Protocol                                                       Version 1.1

preceding the eDCF entry; data from online surveys completed by [CONTACT_565856], with no back -up records (or data copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) in patient medical charts.  
No study monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_565857], as the sites and 
Subjects  will be managed remotely , and all data will be collected using eD CFs.  
The electronically collected data will be periodically reviewed to evaluate the progress of the  
study; to verify the accuracy and completeness of eDCFs ; to ensure that all protocol  
requirements, and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled; and  to resolve any inquiries 
related to the study data.  
The Site Investigator s agrees that the Study CRO or the IRB will have  reasonable access to study 
source documentation (albeit, in de -identified manner) for purposes of audit both during and 
after completion of the study.

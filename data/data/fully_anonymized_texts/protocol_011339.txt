(SOARING)  
 
Objectives  
The overall aim s of the study are  to determine feasibility , any adverse events,  
variability of proposed outcomes, and acceptabi lity of the Mindful Movement and 
Breathing (eMMB) and Attention Control (AC) interventions  that have been adapted 
to the eHealth Format . To accomplish these aim s, we will c onduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_296357] 31 women undergoing surgery for a su spected gynecologic malignancy.  More specifically, we will : 
(1) Calculate recruitment, adherence, assessment completion , and retention rates ; 
(2) Document the frequency of adverse events ;  
(3) Assess descriptive data on proposed outcomes (i.e., pain, sleep disturbances, 
psychological distress) for the next phase of study; and  
 (3) Q ualitatively assess acceptability to guide future study planning.  
Design and Outcomes   
We propose a  prospective stratified randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_296358], sleep disturbances, and psychological stress. P articipants enrolled  (N= 31) will be randomize d 1:1: to 
eMMB  or AC. Allocation will be  stratified by [CONTACT_105975] (i.e. ovarian, uterine)  and 
invasiveness of the planned surgical procedure type (i.e., laparotomy or robotic ). 
Patient -reported assessments will be conducted at four time points: before surgery 
(baseline), one day after surgery, two weeks after surgery and [ADDRESS_361737] prior to surgery and a meeting with the par ticipantby [CONTACT_296380]. Participants will also be given a self -directed video to be 
used before surgery and daily for two weeks following surgery in the eMMB group 
SOAR ING Study  9 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 and diaries to complete daily in the AC group.  
The approximately 20- minute eMMB will teach: (a) Awareness Meditation -  noticing 
the current state of the body, emotions, thoughts, energy, and breath ; (b) Movement –
gentle movements coordinated with the breath; (c) Breathing and Relaxation -  placing 
the hands above the navel and noticing them rise and fall with a focus on slightly 
exten ding the exhale; (d) Awareness Meditation – 5 minutes of awareness of noticing 
the natural breath without changing it to enhance mindfulness. The intention to maintain attention or mindfulness (sthira), comfort and ease (sukha) is highlighted throughout the eMMB.  
An AC group focused on providing caring attention will be employed to account for the added time, attention, interaction with an interventionist, and efficacy expectations of the eMMB . In addition, the interventionist will ask patients to write 
brief diary entries daily at home as used in previous research and our current study. The AC will be implemented by [CONTACT_296381] a medical setting who will be trained to create and maintain a relationship by [CONTACT_296382], reflection of statements, a nd avoiding negative judgments.  
Sample Size and Population  
The target population of the proposed research is adult women scheduled to undergo 
surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy at the Wake Forest Baptist 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC).  We will enroll 31 participants, who will 
be eligible regardless of race, ethnicity, or national origin.

 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objecti ve 
The overall aim s of the study are  to determine feasibility , any adverse events, 
variability of proposed outcomes  and acceptability of the Mindful Movement and 
Breathing (eMMB) and Attention Control (AC) interventions that have been adapted 
to the eHealt h Format. To accomplish these aim s, we will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_296359] 31 women undergoing surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy. More specifically, t he primary 
feasibility objective is to: 
(1) Calculate recruitment, adherence, assessment completion, and retention rates;  
Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that we will enroll at least 50% of eligible patients, 
participants will adhere to 70% of the interventions, and at least 70% of 
participants will comp lete study assessments and be retained in the study.    
An adequate retention rate at week 2 (future primary outcome assessment time point) will be our primary indicator that this study was successful.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
(2) Document the frequency of adverse events ;  
(3) Assess descriptive data on proposed outcomes (i.e., pain, sleep disturbances, psychological distress) for the next phase of study; and 
(4) Qualitatively assess acceptability to guide future study planning. Refining study  
methodology will result in a M anual of Operations and Procedures for an efficacy 
trial.   
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.[ADDRESS_361738] (64%) experience considerable pain,2 yet 
management of postoperative pain is still inadequate.3 For example, less than half of 
patients who underwent surgery for cancer felt their postsurgical pain was relieved by 50% (on scale from 0- 100%).
9 In addition, many of these women also report 
postoperative sleep disturbances (39 -70%),2,4 and psychological distress (20%),2,5 
both associated with pain.2,6–[ADDRESS_361739] -treatment, the prevalence of chronic 
pain is estimated to be up to 40% among post -treatment cancer survivors15 and 
women with cancer report more severe pain than do men.16 Due to the increasing 
numbers of patients surviving cancer for longer periods of time, pain management is a 
chronic problem with guideline s for treatment similar to treatment of chronic pain in 
the general population.17 These guidelines recommend use of multimodal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101899] a stated preference for n onpharmacologic therapy  (including mind -body 
techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation)  and nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_101900] .14,18 However, the level of evidence for use of such modalities is only 
moderate.14,19 Additional fully -powered randomized controlled trials of 
nonpharmacological interventions compared to active control groups are needed. 
Similarly, adverse effects of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_296360].17,20,21 
Indeed, one study reported that 29% of cancer patients were at high risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422]21 and women respond differently to pain medication such that they use more 
posts urgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_101902].13,[ADDRESS_361740] on  pain relief.
19 Pain has sensory (e.g., location, 
physical characteristics) and affective dimensions (e.g., unpleasantness, appraisal of consequences); interventions to alleviate both may be more effective than those that address only the sensory as pects of pain.
23,24 Mind -body interventions, are commonly 
sought after nonpharmacological approaches for addressing pain, sleep disturbances, and psychological stress, parti cularly in cancer patients.
13,25,26 Specifically, yoga is 
gaining popularity,27 and there is a generally positive impression of and curiosity 
about yoga.28 Yoga is a promising intervention to simultaneously improve such 
aspects of pain, and associated symptoms (i.e., sleep disturbances, psychological 
distress). The key elements of yoga are movements, breathing exercises, and 
meditation.29 Empi[INVESTIGATOR_296361],30–32 sleep disturbances,33 and psychological distress,34,35 in a variety of 
populations36 and in studies  specific to cancer sur vivors.37–[ADDRESS_361741] cancer or studies of yoga for low back pain.30,41 There are limited studies 
investigating the efficacy of yoga for other cancer types or perioperatively.  
 
Yoga has a potential advantage over other perioperative interventions (i.e., relaxation, hypnosis)
32,42 because it has multiple components that also support the goals of usual 
care (e.g., to encourage early postoperative ambulation and deep breathing via incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) and thus may help treat other surgical comlications.
43–45 Usual 
care to manage pain includes teaching patients to splint the abdomen by [CONTACT_101939] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_296362], allowing them to perform these functions with less pain and monitoring pain every four hours on a scale from 0- 10 
([ADDRESS_361742]  pain) to ensure that adequate pain medication is given. Early 
postoperative ambulation aims to reduce postoperative ileus (bowel obstruction) and deep venous thrombosis (blood clots ). Deep breathing via incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_296363] e lungs of fluid to prevent pneumonia. About 30% of 
women undergoing surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy have a surgical complication (e.g., postoperative ileus, deep venous thrombosis, pneumonia );
46,47 
these contribute substantially to costs.8,46 Research supports that yoga breathing 
practices improve lung function36,48 and yoga movements increase mobility (i.e., 
balance and flexibility).36 Further, c ombining awareness with movement is a method 
of promoting meditation that may be easier for some people to experience than methods that are taught while still.
49 Thus , adding  yoga to usual care may be helpful 
for postsurgical pain in a number of ways.  
 
Proposed mechanisms of effects of yoga on pain and co- morbid symptoms.  A 
Self-Regulation Framework50,51 proposes both psychological (e.g., mindfulness, self -
efficacy) and physiologi cal (e.g., relaxation, ambulation, deep breathing) explanations 
for the positive influence of yoga, which primarily affects psychological and physical 
well-being through reducing the stress response. One component of the Self -
Regulation Framework proposes that cognitive appraisals such as self -efficacy for 
managing pain30,52,[ADDRESS_361743] of learning self -regulation 
skills (i.e., yoga) on pain. A recent study also suggested that mind- body interventions 
likely address pain through a mechanism different than opi[INVESTIGATOR_296364], potentially 
providing a self -regulation strategy that works with medication in an additive fashion 
to improve pain management.[ADDRESS_361744] . A growing body of literatures supports the idea that behavioral skills can be 
taught through information technology (eHealth).[ADDRESS_361745] been quantitatively evaluated specifically for people with cancer; 
thus their efficacy for cancer patients is unclear.56,[ADDRESS_361746].
56 EHealth addresses barriers to participation such as 
accessibility (e.g., one treatment can be utilized by [CONTACT_101940]), travel distance, and dissemination (e.g., increased treatment fidelity).
56  
 Some research supports that adherence to treatment offered through behavioral internet interventions (e.g., for improving depression, physical activity) is as good as adherence to face-to face interventions.
58,[ADDRESS_361747] important when the 
treatment focus is on providing skills training.
60 In addition, the Supportive 
Accountability model suggests that the influence of these interaction factors on adherence may be moderated by [CONTACT_296383] “bandwidth” (i.e., the number of communication cues a medium can convey). Although some suppose that as the bandwidth lessens, the quality of interaction factors lessens, this is not always so, people can effectively communicate through various media. Thus, the optimal level of content guidance and communication medium to implement behavioral interventions is yet to be determined.

 2.2 Study Rationale  
The proposed Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention adapts 
key elements of a longer intervention (about 10 weeks61) to a shorter format . 
Yoga implemented as traditional (often longer) group classes has demonstrated 
efficacy for reducing pain,31,[ADDRESS_361748] shown that interventions to reduce pain, sleep disturbances and psychological distress such as cognitive -behavioral thera py, 
Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction (Co- I Zeidan), and yoga (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906]) can be 
successfully adapted to be brief.

61 in a manner that may be easily adapted to other perioperative and 
cancer populations. This approach aims to design an intervention with promise for future dissemination.
66 
 
The proposed Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) intervention is 
implemented perioperatively. Although other yoga studies have been implemented 
in clinical settings, these studies either did not exclusively evaluate yoga67 or the yoga 
interventions were not brief.40,68 The eMMB is designed to improve upon previous 
interventions with its brevity and its adaptation to the acute needs of patients undergoing surgery for cancer. In addition, the eMMB will potentially contribute to a shift in the paradigm of yoga, which has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_296365] a complementary medicine modality (a separate p ractice used together with 
usual care), to become a component of integrative medicine (incorporated into usual care in a coordinated way).
[ADDRESS_361750] in perioperative yoga (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906], Co -I’s: Danhauer & Tooze).  To 
investigate patient interest in our proposed study, we surveyed 9 women who were in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101908].
70  Of 20 
women ap proached, 10 (mean age = 51 years; 89% White) agreed to complete the 
survey. Reasons that women declined participation included: not interested (n=8); non-cancer related health issues (n=1); other (n=1);  plus one screen failure. 
Participants indicated on a  scale from 1 (not useful) to 10 (useful) that they expected 
that the described “Yoga Skills Training” (YST) would be useful for reducing pain 
(M=6.7; SD=2.5) and distress (M=6.9; SD=2.0). They also provided feedback on the 
intervention name [CONTACT_296401] ‘yoga’ might deter some potential 
participants. The average length of time women reported being willing to participate 
in a YST session was [ADDRESS_361751] popular format 
selected for independent practice (n=4), followed by [CONTACT_398] (n=2), written material (n=1) 
and other (n=2). Thus, the proposed intervention is called “Mindful Movement and 
Breathing” and will primarily be implemented via a 20 -minute video.

Perioperative yoga feasibility (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101906], Co- I’s: Danhauer & Tooze). “Mindful 
Movement and Breathing (MMB)” describes the gentle physical activity in this intervention compared to other types of yoga. The MMB was designed for patients receiving chemotherap y
71 and 
then tested in this non-randomized trial to determine feasibility of the MMB (three 20-minute in person sessions) 
among women undergoing an exploratory laparotomy  for a suspected gynecologic 
malignancy (60% ovarian; 20% uterine; 20% cervical).
65 Type of surgery was the 
primary reason for exclusion (86%) since we did not inc lude less invasive surgeries 
(e.g., robotic). Of 18 eligible women approached, 10 (age M = 54.7 years; 90% White) enrolled in the study (55% recruitment) . Seven women were retained in the 
study and no adverse events were reported. Only five women received the MMB pre -
operatively due to scheduling challenges. Participants completed two Visual 
Analogue Scale items of pain and distress immediately before and after each MMB  
(average session = 20.6 minutes) . Pain and distress decreased with moderate to large 
effects (Table 1 ). On a scale f rom 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) patients liked the 
MMB (M = 4.29, SD = 0.76), found it helpful (M = 3.71, SD = 0.95), and planned to 
continue to use what they learned (M = 3.71, SD = 1.11). These data support 
feasibility of testing the MMB in these patients, but revealed challenges to consistent  
implementation of the in -person MMB before surgery . Therefore, the proposed 
intervention will utilize an eHealth approach to test whether adherence would be greater. In addition, the proposed study will also include women scheduled for less 
invasive types of gynecologic cancer surgeries, which have become m ore common 
and may have more room for improvement in pain management.

Efficacy of a brief mind -body intervention for reducing pain (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_101913]). A brief 
mindfulness meditation intervention (four 20 -minute training sessions)  was 
significantly  more effective at reducing pain than two well -validated placebo 
interventions (placebo cream, sham mindfulness mediation).74 Yet, all had 
significantly reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings compared to the 
control group (reading). Sham mindfulness meditation (participants trained to take deep breaths and led to believe they were practicing mindfulness) was associated with greater reductions in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], demonstrating a mechanistic difference between 
sham and mindfulness meditation. Mindf ulness meditation –related pain relief was 
associated with greater psychological executive- level modulation of pain and, in 
contrast, sham mindfulness meditation –induced analgesia was driven by 
[CONTACT_296384] . Similar instructions 
for nonjudgmental attention to the breath, and instructions for taking deep breaths to 
slow breathing, will be incorporated into the eMMB to optimize the influence of the intervention on pain reduction. 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
The proposed r esearch will determine feasibility and acceptability of investigating the 
eMMB and AC interventions to reduce pain and other surgical outcomes through an exploratory stratified randomized  controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_268106] [ADDRESS_361755] ed gynecologic malignancies.  
Participants enrolled will be randomized 1:1 to eMMB or AC. Allocation will stratified by [CONTACT_105975] (i.e. , ovari an or uterine)  and invasiveness of the planned surgical 
procedure type (i.e., laparotomy or robotic ). Patient -reported assessments will be 
conducted at four time points: before surgery (baseline), one day after surgery, two weeks after surgery and [ADDRESS_361756] prior to surgery and a meeting with the par ticipant via 
videoconferencing the day following surgery. Participants will also be given a self -
directed video to be  used  before surgery and  daily for two weeks following surgery in 
the eMMB group and diaries to complete daily in the AC group.  
SOAR ING Study  17 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
  
The approximately 20- minute eMMB will teach: (a) Awareness Meditation -  noticing 
the current state of the body, emotions, thoughts, energy, and breath ; (b) Movement –
gentle movements coordinated with the breath; (c) Breathing and Relaxation -  placing 
the hands above the navel and noticing them rise and fall with a focus on slightly extending the exhale; (d) Awareness Meditation – 5 minutes of awareness of noticing 
the natural breath without changing it to enhance mindfulness. The intention to maintain attention or mindfulness (sthira), comfort and ease (sukha) is highlighted throughout the eMMB.  
 An AC group focused on providing caring attention will be employed to account for the added time, attention, interaction with an interventionist, and efficacy expectations of the eMMB . In addition, the interventionist will ask patients to write brief diary 
entries daily at home as used in  previous research and our current study. The AC will 
be implemented by [CONTACT_296381] a medical setting who will be trained to create and maintain a relationship by [CONTACT_296382], reflection of stateme nts, a nd avoiding negative judgments.  
 The total length of time each participant will be on study is approximately [ADDRESS_361757] (IRB) prior to 
implementing the proposed study and take precautions to ensure adequate protection of human subjects. Recruitment of women scheduled to undergo surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) will be facilitated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kelly (Co -Investigator). To increase 
homogeneity, only the most prevalent gynecologic malignancies will be recruited (i.e. uterine, ovarian) that occur in only women. W e chose this target population because 
adult women undergoing surgery for suspected cancer are at particularly high risk for experiencing chronic pain.
13 In addition, this sample reduces variability due to sex 
differences in pain tolerance75 and response to pain m edication.13 There are mul tiple 
theories that may explain these differences. Of particular note is the “vulnerability theory”, which posits that sex hormones affect the nervous system’s and 
psychological responses to pain.

 4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will 
be excluded from study participation:  
 
• Have schi zophrenia or any other psychotic disorder;  
• Have a diagnosed sleep disorder including untreated obstructive sleep apnea, 
periodic limb movement dis order, or restless leg syndrome.  
   
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures   
Individuals scheduled to undergo surgery for suspected gynecologic malignancies 
(i.e., uterine, ovarian) will be recruited from the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (WFBCCC). To identify potential patients, the Project Manager will screen ap pointment lists and communicate with attending physicians regarding 
patients’ potential eligibility for  the trial.  Subject recruitment will be documented in a 
Screening Log including reasons for ineligibility, eligible patients approached, number who decli ned participation, and number successfully recruited.  
 If the patient is interested and referred by [CONTACT_099], t he Project Manager will 
approach or call interested patients prior to surgery to explain the protocol, answer questions, determine eligibility, and discuss informed consent. After making sure the patient clearly understands the study procedures and agrees to follow them, the patient will be asked to sign the informed consent form electronically  or in person. If 
signed electronically , patients will be asked to send the form back to us by a secure 
means (e.g., REDCap). In the case that the patient is consented electronically , either a 
hard copy or email attachment of the informed consent document will be provided to the participant.  (Appendix A: Informed Consent Document) . The original copy will 
be kept in the participant’s file. Each participant will be asked to separately agree to be audio recorded  for the study, which will not affect their ability to participate. If 
they do consent to be videotaped, they are told in the consent form that they can ask not to be included in the filming or withdraw their consent to be videotaped at any time. These videos are focused on the interventionist for the sole purpose of increasing treatment fidelity.  
 Eligible participants enrolled in the study will be randomized after baseline assessments to the eMMB  or AC prior to surgery .

uterine), and concealed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tooze (Biostatistician). Study team members will not know group assignment when enrolling participants. The Project Manager  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_296366] a 
participant has provided informed consent. The Clinical Studies Staff member who will collect primary outcome data will be blinded to group assignment.  Participants 
will be informed that they could be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 different supportive treatments with a general description of what they will involve (i.e., counseling, 
SOAR ING Study  19 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 gentle movement, writing, and/or relaxation strategies) and will be asked not to 
discuss study procedures with their treating surgeon, medical staff, or research personnel. Thus, participants and healthcare providers will also be blinded to randomization. 
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
Active Intervention. The Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB)  intervention 
will be administered individually  via telephone and video conference for initial 
guidance and is primarily  intended to be  self-directed (video). We considered the 
style, delivery, components of the intervention, specific class sequences, faci litation 
of home practice, dose, dealing with modifications, selection of instructors, and measurement of intervention fidelity, as recommended in the development of a yoga intervention for a randomized trial.
76  
Style.  The content of the eMMB was informed by [CONTACT_978]’s training from the 
Integral Yoga Academy’s Yoga for People with Cancer Teacher Training a nd Urban 
Zen Integrative Therapy training, and was refined for this study by [CONTACT_296385][INVESTIGATOR_101245] (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wheeler, Consultant) and an expert in instructing mindfulness for reducing pain ([CONTACT_101960], Co-Investigator). Expert yoga therapi[INVESTIGATOR_296367] (e.g., pain) and places an emphasis on daily home practice.
77,78 Furthermore, the eMMB aims to promote mindfulness and relaxation.  
Delivery components and class sequence . The approximately 20 -minute eMM B 
will teach: (a) Awareness Meditation -  2 minutes of noticing the current state of the 
body, emotions, thoughts, energy, and breath. Brief meditation has been shown to be effective for decreasing pain,
79 sleep disturbance80 and psychological distress81 and 
will increase mindfulness to facilitate safe physical movements; (b) Movement  – 10 
minutes of gentle movements coordinated with the breath also aim to enhance mindfulness to reduce pain, facilitate bowel movement (to prevent ileus) and blood flow (to pr event deep venous thrombosis); (c) Breathing and Relaxation  - 3 minutes 
of placing the hands above the navel (rather than on the belly to avoid discomfort) and noticing them rise and fall with a focus on slightly extending the exhale to induce relaxation. This practice aims to improve lung capacity (to reduce pulmonary compromise) and reduce pain, sleep disturbance and psychological distress; (d) Awareness Meditation  – 5 minutes of awareness of noticing the natural breath 
without changing it to enhance mindfulness. The intention to maintain attention or mindfulness ( sthira ), comfort and ease ( sukha)  is highlighted throughout the eMMB. 
We also propose that teaching these skills will increase self -efficacy for pain 
management  through providing successful pain management experiences.  
Dealing with modifications.  The movements were chosen to be appropriate 
following surgery. Each session contains the same content, but the number of repetitions and the magnitude of movements are self -adapted based on how the 
partic ipant is feeling. Any medical restrictions are within the scope of the eMMB.  
SOAR ING Study  20 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 Selection of instructors. Yoga instructors (one primary, two back -ups) will be 
contracted employees, accredited (i.e., certified as at least 200 -hour-level teachers 
with the Yoga  Alliance), and experienced teaching patients with medical conditions . 
 
Dose and Implementation of eMMB . A 20 -minute eMMB video will be saved as a 
local file  on study tablets  and/or will be accessible via the internet (participants will 
be given the option to receive a link to the study video via email) . Participants will 
also be given a written description of the eMMB practice. A lthough guidance (i.e., 
supportive accountability60) is important in promoting adherence to eHealth 
interventions, one study of a stress- management intervention found that adherence -
focused guidance (e.g., email reminders, guidance upon request by [CONTACT_4317]) was as good as more resource intensive content -focused guidance.

83 The yoga 
instructors’ contact [CONTACT_296386]. Instructors will attempt to call participants [ADDRESS_361760] cancer surgery.
84 A self -directed approach may also 
empower participants to establish self -regulation strategies.  
 Attention Control (AC). An AC group focused on providing caring attention will be 
employed to account for the added time, attention, interaction with an interventionist, 
and efficacy expectations of the eMMB as recommended for the study of mind- body 
practices
[ADDRESS_361761] will ask 
patients to write brief diary entries  once before surgery and daily for two weeks 
following surgery . A diary form will be saved as a local file  on study tablets  via the 
SOAR ING Study  21 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 REDCap App and /or will be accessible via the internet (participants will be  given the 
option to receive a link to the study diary via email) . Participants will also be given 
the option to complete a paper diary. The Project Manager will monitor patient-
reported self -directed diary completion and call to check in with participants  if they 
have not completed the diary after the first two days. The AC will not include instruction of movement, meditation or breathing practices, which are the active ingredients of the eMM B. The format for interactions with a professional, amount of 
recommended home practice, and home assessments will be matched to the eMMB. The AC interventionist will call participants before surgery to initiate additional caring attention upon request at any time throughout the study and meet with the participant via v ideoconferencing following surgery (postoperative day 1 or as soon 
as feasible) for [ADDRESS_361762] Manager and will be recorded . The AC will be 
implemented by [CONTACT_296381] a medical setting who will be trained to create and maintain a relationship by [CONTACT_296382], reflection of statements, and avoiding negative judgments. S(he ) will utilize 
standardized instructions to prompt the patient as adapted from previous studies
87,89,90: “What were some of the events or circumstances th at affected you in the 
past two weeks? ” Patients will be encouraged to ‘‘ discuss one experience at a time, 
even if it means talking about the same experience each session. However, if you find that you have discussed it in adequate detail, please move on t o a new topic.’’ The 
instructions for daily diary entries will be, “ What were some of the events or 
circumstances that affected you in the past day? Think back over the past day and write down on the lines below up to five events that had an impact on you.”
90 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   
Participan ts will be informed that they could be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 different 
supportive treatments with a general description of what they will involve (i.e., counseling, gentle movement, writing, and/or relaxation strategies). Information about both arms will be revealed to participants after completion of data collection.  
Measurement of intervention fidelity.  Recommended steps will be taken to ensure 
treatment fidelity of the videoconference session for both groups to increase reproduceability.
91,[ADDRESS_361763] (Wheeler) will train the 
interventionists to guide participants on the eMMB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Danhauer will train the intervent ionists on the AC. All sessions will be recorded and 20 % randomly 
selected for review by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wheeler (eMMB) or [CONTACT_101959] (AC). Further, the interventionists and [CONTACT_101961] or [CONTACT_101959] will meet monthly by [CONTACT_296387].  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions   
5.3.1  Allowed Interventions  
All participants  will continue with routine treatment of medical conditions including 
medications.  
SOAR ING Study  22 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 5.3.2  Required Interventions  
No additional interventions are required except for those propose in the protocol. 
5.3.3  Prohibited Interventions 
 There will be no prohibited medications  among patients in this study.  Prior approval 
of participation in other behavioral intervention studies is required.  
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence will be assessed by: (1) Completion of the videoconference session; (2) 
any additional contact [CONTACT_101945]; (3) use of the self -directed 
intervention: measured daily for up to one week before and one week after surgery as 
assessed in another yoga study38 and self -reported retrospectively (in the past week) 
at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. Instructors will directly observe and document adherence to the videoconference session . We will consider adequate adherence to 
protocol if 70% participants complete the planned video conferencing session one day of home practice before and 3 or more days of home practice per week for the two 
weeks following surgery .

SOAR ING Study  [ADDRESS_361764] care. At the time of enrollment, 
participants will be provided a tablet computer to borrow for the study (unless they 
already have a comparable device that they prefer) and receive training on completing 
questionnaires either online or by [CONTACT_756], similar to a  training successfully 
implemented in a study of symptom monitoring in this patient population.93 This prior 
study suggested that alternate data collection methods such as automated telephone 
calls may increase adherence to web -based sympt om reporting.93 Patient -reported 
questionnaires  will be conducted at four time points: before surgery (baseline), one 
day after surgery, two weeks after surgery and [ADDRESS_361765] longer -term pain. Daily diaries 
are one method for measuring an experience in a participant’s natural setting with low patient burden.
[ADDRESS_361766] 
demonstrated reasonable compliance (86%) with electronic diary assessment
96 and 
daily assessments after gynecologic oncology surgery (68% compliance).94 
Participants will be prompted to complete the surveys (3 -5 minutes) at approximately 
6:00pm each evening and can complete the survey any time before they go to sleep. A 
paper guide with response options for the questionnaire will be provided to improve 
comprehension over the telephone. Participants will also be given a wrist actigraphy 
device and instructions for its use during this same time period.  
 In addition, demographic data will be patient -reported at baseline, medical records 
will be reviewed  to obtain clinical data , treatment fidelity observed  at the 
videoconference intervention session, and an interview conducted at a follow -up 
clinic visit or by [CONTACT_756]. Participants will be compensated up to $[ADDRESS_361767] Manager or other 
study team member will approach or call interested patients prior to surgery to 
SOAR ING Study  25 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 explain t he protocol, answer questions, determine eligibility, and discuss informed 
consent. After making sure the patient clearly understands the study procedures and 
agrees to follow them, the patient will be asked to sign the informed consent form  
electronically  (via REDCap)  or in person. Either a hard copy or email attachment of 
the informed consent document will be given to the participant, and the original copy will be kept in the participant’s file. Each participant will be asked to separately agree to be videotaped for the study, which will not affect their ability to participate. If they do consent to be videotaped, they are told in the consent form that they can ask not to be included in the filming or withdraw their consent to be videotaped at any time. These videos are focused on the interventionist for the sole purpose of increasing 
treatment fidelity.  We will also let participants know at the time of consent that it is 
their choice whether or not visitors remain in the room during the intervention and ask if they have a preference.  
Screening  
Screening evaluations will begin  once a patient is scheduled for a consultation related 
to receiving surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy . The allowable range of 
time for screening is  up to one year prior to study entry and baseline assessment. 
Electronic medical records of patients planning to receive chemotherapy will be reviewed by a study team member  to identify potential patients that meet enrollment 
criteria. This screening will consist of:  
• Review of medical history  
• Review of treatment plan  
 
We will approach patients either in person or remotely (e.g., telephone, myWake Health , mail) regarding their interest in study participation
. For patients 
interested in the study, research staff will verify eligibility through patient interview 
regarding medical history.  
 
6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
Enrollment is defined as the randomization date or as the date all of the screening criteria are met and the individual agrees to participate.  
 
Registration Procedures  
All patients entered on any CCCWFU trial, whether treatment, companion, or cancer 
control trial, must be registered with the CCCWFU Protocol Registrar or entered into 
Oncology Research Information System ( ORIS) Screeni ng Log within [ADDRESS_361768] be performed i n order to ensure prompt registration:  
 
1. Complete the Eligibility Checklist (Appendix K ) 
2. Complete the Protocol Registration Form ( Appendix L ) 
SOAR ING Study  [ADDRESS_361769] and Protocol Registration Form to the 
registrar, either by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail.  
 
 
4. Fax/e- mail ALL eligibility source documents with registration. Patients will not  
be registered without all required supporting documents. 
Note: If labs were performed at an outside institution, provide a printout of the results. E nsure that the most re cent lab values are sent.  
  To complete the registration process, the Registrar will:   
 
 assign a patient study number  
 other appropriate actions  
 register the patient on the study  
Baseline Assessment s 
For participants who have successfully been screened for  eligibility and are enrolled 
into the study, baseline assessments will be performed. The baseline assessment may be completed within two weeks prior to surgery.   
 
• Assessment Completion/Retention. Percent completion of planned standard and daily assessmen ts. 
• Pain. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measure of pain of intensity (i.e., How would you rate your pain on 
average?) , which has been adapted for assessing pain on a numeric rating scale 
from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst  imaginable pain) “in the last day,”
97 is the proposed 
primary outcome (at 2 weeks) for the future larger clinical trial that will be informed by [CONTACT_74556]. Patient -reported pain is considered the ‘gold 
standard’ for pain assessment since pain is a subjective exper ience and PROMIS 
is supported by [CONTACT_101946].
98,99 Pain interference, 
the affective dimension of pain, and analgesic use will be assessed using 9 patient- reported items. Pain interference will also be assessed with a PROMIS 
measure (6 -items).
97 The affective dimension of pain  will be assessed with one 
item on a scale from 0 (not bad at all) to 10 (the most unpleasant feeling possible for me).
84,98,[ADDRESS_361770] -surgery (postoperative day 1 to 8; day added 
since participants may report information from the prior day ) and converted to a 
cumulative analgesic consumption score for analysis  (2-items) .101 We will also 
ask participants if they are taking any analgesic medication postoperatively.   
• Sleep Disturbance  will be assessed with a  PROMIS Sleep Disturbance short -form 
(8-items)102 adapted for daily use.  
• Psychological Distress. The PROMIS Depression (8 -item) & Anxiety ( 7-item) 
adapted short -forms will be used to assess psychological distress “in the last 
day.”97 
SOAR ING Study  27 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 • Pain Self -Efficacy  will be assessed with the  pain management subscale of the  
Chronic Pain Self -Efficacy Scale,103 which has been used postoperatively (5-
items).104 
• Daily Symptoms  will be assessed for up to one  week  before surgery and week 
after surgery starting on postoperative day 1 (or as soon as feasible) using 4 items 
on pain (2), disturbed sleep, and distress. The same adapted PROMIS pain 
intensity item will be asked and sleep disturbance  and psychological distress 
items will be used from the MD  Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) , which 
asks about each symptom  at “its worst” in the past 24 hours  from the MDA SI 
designed to be implemented daily105 and used perioperatively.94 
• Sleep Disturbance  will also be assessed with actigraphy , a non- intrusive 
alternative to the traditional polysomnography when monitoring sleep.[ADDRESS_361771]/activity patterns in a natural setting, and provides summary measures of daily sleep activity. Sleep disturbance will be defined as a daily ratio of circadian disruption (the ratio of nighttime activity to daytime 
activity; h igher scores show greater circadian disruptions). A similar device and 
the same ratio has been used in patients perioperatively.
107 Participants will also 
self-report the time spent nappi[INVESTIGATOR_296368].108  
• Demographic F actors.  Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, ability 
to pay for the basics, distance travelled for care, medical history, previous use of 
mind -body practices , baseline level of mindfulness, and internet access will be 
self-reported at baseline.  
• Clinical Factors.  Cancer site, type of surgery stratified by [CONTACT_66443],109 treating 
physician, date diagnosed, other cancer treatments, comorbidities, height, weight, 
prescription medications for pain, sleep, depressive symptoms, and anxiety will 
be abstracted from medical charts at baseline.  
Randomization  
Randomization will occur the same day that screening is confirmed. Instructions for 
completing the intervention will begin at the same visit.  
6.2.3  Blinding  
• Participants will be told that both groups offer programs to support their experience in copi[INVESTIGATOR_296369].  
• The study team member collecting outcome assessments will be blinded to group assignment .  
• A complete description of each study arm will be presented to participants upon their completion of all study measures.  
6.2.4 Follow -up Visits  
The timing of study assessments is summarized in Table 1. P ostoperative day 1 
assessments may be completed within 3 days after surgery. The two -week and 4-
week assessments can be timed with in -person follow -up visits, which may be 
SOAR ING Study  28 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 scheduled within a week of the schedule d assessment.  Descriptions of additional 
measures not assessed at baseline include:  
• Adherence.  Completion of the videoconference session 
• Interventionist Communication. A ny additional contact [CONTACT_101945] . 
• Intervention Home Practice. U se of the  self-directed intervention (time and 
duration) will be measured daily for  up to one week  before and one week  after 
surgery as assessed in another yoga study .38 Self-reported time of practice will 
also be assessed retrospectively (in the past week) at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. 
• Acute Adverse Events.   Participants will also be asked to complete two Visual 
Analogue Scale items assessing pain intensity and psychological distress daily 
with the instructions to report their experience “right now,” immediately before 
and after the intervention to detect any acute adverse events.65 
• Expected Benefit.  The HEAL Treatment Expectancy measure 6 -items)110 will 
assess expected benefit of the intervention following the videoconference session.  
• Daily Symptoms  will be assessed for up to one before surgery and week after 
surgery starting on postoperative day 1 (or as soon as feasible)  for 8 days (since 
participants may report information from the prior day)  using 3 items on pain, 
disturbed sleep, and distress. The same PROMIS pain intensity item will be asked and sleep disturbance and psychol ogical distress items will be used from the 
MDAS I, which asks about each symptom  at “its worst” in the past 24 hours  from 
the MDAS I designed to be implemented daily
105 and used perioperatively.94 
• Sleep Disturbance  will also be assessed with actigr aphy , a non- intrusive 
alternative to the traditional polysomnography when monitoring sleep.[ADDRESS_361772]/activity patterns in a natural setting, and provides 
summary measures of daily sleep activity. Sleep disturbance will be defined as a 
daily ratio of circadian disruption (the ratio of nighttime activity to daytime 
activity; higher scores show greater circadian disruptions). A similar device and 
the same ratio has been used in patients perioperatively.107 Participants will also 
self-report their bed and rising times daily.108  
• Patient Provider Connection will be measured with a 7 -item short- form from the 
Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL)110 at the 4 -week follow -up visit.  
• Clinical Factors.  Medicat ions prescribed for pain, length of stay, any 
complications experienced, and other cancer treatments, will also be abstracted 
four weeks post -surgery.  
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Assessment s to be performed a t the participant’s final visit are described in the prior 
section.  Participants who discontinue study the intervention early will require no 
specific evaluations. The reason for discontinuation will be documented. We will contact [CONTACT_101280] -up data remotely if they discontinue participation 
due to change in treatment location. Patients terminated from the study will undergo no further monitoring once they have stopped the study intervention.

 7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Expected adverse experiences for each study intervention are as follows:  
            EMindful Movement and Breathing 
• Emotional discomfort  
• Muscle soreness  
Active Control  
• Emotional discomfort  
Each interventionist will monitor and note any adverse events experienced during the 
videoconferencing  (e.g., patients’ experience of disturbed breath, expression of 
physical/emotional discomfort, or request to discontinue the in -person intervention 
sessions). In addition, study staff will ask participants if they experienced any problems 
when doing the home practices and review notes from the home practice logs  at follow -
up visits . Instructors  will have phone numbers for the triage nurse and Cancer Support 
Services available to give to patients  as referrals  if patients tell them about any clinical 
issues t hat arise. S tudy staff will also document in the electronic patient records using a 
telephone note if  a referral number was provided.  
 
Two or more adverse events attributable to the interventions will prompt modification of the protocol.

 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and gradin g scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.[ADDRESS_361774] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
).   
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting 
purposes only.   
• Attribution  of the AE:  
 
- Definite – The AE is clearly  related  to the study intervention. 
- Probable – The AE is likely  related  to the study intervention. 
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study intervention. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study intervention. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly N OT related  to the study intervention. 
 SAEs unequivocally due to disease progression are not considered SAEs for the purposes of this study and will not be reported as such.  
Only AEs related to the study interventi on or measures will be captured with the 
exception of unexpected grade [ADDRESS_361775] on the 
patient. An AE will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if it causes  a substantial disruption to the patient’s well- being.  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely unrelated, definitely related, probably related, or possibly related to the study intervention. 
Interventionists will document and report solicited AEs including physical or 
emotional discomfort. Research  staff will report AEs according to data safety 
monitoring plan. Events will be documented including date  of event which will avoid 
double capture.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
AEs reports will be distributed to the Independent Monitoring Committee ( IMC) 
electronically via email.  
 
SOAR ING Study  [ADDRESS_361776] been reported to the appropriate agencies (e.g. IRB, NCCIH) and that such reports have  been made in a timely manner. Non- serious adverse events will be reviewed on 
a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_27904]. The IMC will be notified of serious adverse events within 24 hours of occurrence and reviewed within 48 hours.   SAEs that are unanticipated, seriou s, and possibly related to the study intervention 
will be reported to the IMC, IRB, and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) by [CONTACT_101283] (Appendix N: Adverse Event Form).  The CCC- WFU Safety and T oxicity Reporting Committee 
(STRC) will also review unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 events regardless of their attribution.  
 
• Unexpected fatal or life- threatening AEs related to the intervention will be 
reported to the NCCIH Program Officer within 7 days . Other serious and 
unexpected AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the NCCIH 
Program Official within 15 days.  
• Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to the Independent Monitor(s), IRB, NCC IH, and other oversight 
organizations in accordance with their requirements. In the annual AE summary, the Independent Monitor(s) Report will state that they have reviewed all AE reports.  
7.5 Followup for Adverse Events  
AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_101284] [INVESTIGATOR_101252], resolution, and ongoing toxicities that may be related to the intervention. Documentation and reporting for follow -up AEs will occur according to reporting procedures described in Section 7.4. 
The duration for follow -up will be for  the length of the study period while 
participants are enrolled in the study. If non- serious adverse events are related to the 
interventions, then the protocol will be modified to avoid adverse events. If the frequency of non- serious adverse events is high er than anticipated or alters the benefit 
risk ratio, the study investigators, after conferring with IMC, will also modify the protocol.  Two or more specific adverse events among participants will prompt modification of the protocol.           
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC) for this study is comprised of the Wake Forest School of Medicine’s Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board members who have expertise in clinical trial methodology and conduct, biostatistics, ethics, and clinical research. The Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
members are not part of the key personnel involved in this grant. They are qualified to review the patient safety data generated by [CONTACT_296388] e in the areas of oncology, mental health/ethics and statistics.  
SOAR ING Study  32 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 Study progress and safety will be reviewed quarterly (and more frequently if needed). 
Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to the Independent Monitor(s) following each of the quarterly reviews. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -

Program Officer within 1 month of each monitoring review.   
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
The intervention will be discontinued for a participant if: ( 1) the intervention is 
associated with an adverse effect for a specific participant ( i.e., participant  does not 
tolerate the intervention ), (2) the participant  no longer is interested or willing to 
receive the intervention or parti cipate in the study, or (3) the participant’s healthcare 
provider no longer recommends that the patient receive the intervention for medical reasons. The  IMC and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101919].  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated 
with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situatio ns occur that might warrant 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_296372], retention, or data collection.  Participants will be followed with their permission if the study is discontinued. The duration of follow -up will be length of the proposed study. We will continue to 
document adverse events during the follow -up period. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.[ADDRESS_361777] control group or stretching. Specifically, the proposed 
empathic attention control was chosen to control for the non- specific effects of the 
intervention without including any of the proposed active intervention components.  
 
SOAR ING Study  33 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 Stratified randomized control design was selected for this study to enable tighter 
control over known influences on outcome. Statistical control via covariate analysis would not suffice.  
1. Primary  Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that we will enroll at least 50% of eligible 
patients, participants will adhere to 70% of the interventions, and at least 70% of participants will complete study assessments and be retained in the study.   
Secondary:  
2. We will describe any adverse events reported as frequencies.  
 
3. Assess descriptive data on proposed outcomes (i.e., pain [primary outcome  -  pain 
interference at week 2] , sleep disturbances, psychological distress) f or the next 
phase of study;  
 
The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
measure of pain of intensity (i.e., How would you rate your pain on average?) , 
which has been validated for assessing pain on a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) “in the last day,”
97 is the proposed primary 
outcome (at 2 weeks) for the future larger clinical trial that will be informed by [CONTACT_74556]. Patient -reported pain is considered the ‘gold standard’ for pain 
assessment since pain is a subjective experience and PROMIS is s upported by [CONTACT_296389].
98,99 
 
4. Qualitatively assess acceptability to guide future study planning.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization 
The target sample size is based on the goals of estimating the rates of feasibility measures (i.e., recruitment, adherence, assessment completion,  adverse events  and 
retention rates ) to inform the design of a larger efficacy trial. This current pi[INVESTIGATOR_296373]. Thus, we will 
accrue a total of [ADDRESS_361778]. W e will be able to estimate these rates within 
+/- 18%  using a two -sided 95% confidence interval, and within 9- 15% using a one -
sided interval (dependent on the observed proportion). If the recruitment rate is below 
50% and the adherence and retention rates are below 70% (i.e., 30% drop- out or non-
adherence), a larger study may not be feasible. That is , with an  observed retention 
rate of  ≥80%  (20% lost to follow -up, target N= [ADDRESS_361779] to follow -up N= 6) we can 
be highly confident that the true rate is at least 68 % (the lower limit of a one -sided 
95% CI for an observed rate of 80% is 68.2% ). An adequate retention rate for Week 2 
data will be an indicator that this study is successful and we are ready to proceed to 
the next phase of study.  
 
Power calculations for a sub sequent larger study will be based on clinically 
meaningful differences between the groups on the primary outcome.
112 The number 
of participants interviewed (20- 31) will be determined when dat a saturation is 
SOAR ING Study  [ADDRESS_361780] interviews until we 
think there is enough qualitative data to address issues rela ted to the acceptability of 
study procedures. 113 The study team’s experience leads us to believe that [ADDRESS_361781] ive. Our 
analyses of differences between cancer type and invasiveness will be for exploratory 
purposes and therefore data saturation using those variables is not the goal. If unexpected information emerges  and our timeline allows , we will consider amending 
the protocol to recruit additional participants.  
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Eligible, consented, and enrolled participants will be randomized to eMMB  or AC. 
To control for type of cancer  and invasiveness of surgery , randomi zation will occur 
within  cancer  type ( uterine or ovarian)  and surgery type (laparotomy or robotic) . 
There is not a sample size goal within strata.  
 Randomization (1:1) lists within each strata will be generated . Study team members  
who are collecting outco me data will not be informed of group assignment.  
9.3  Definition of Populations  
We will use the revised CONSORT 2010 guidelines for intention- to-treat (ITT) 
analysis of randomized control trials
114 in our sample considerations. Those 
guidelines dropped specific  ITT in favor of clear descriptions of exactly who would 
be (or was) included in the analysis per our specification above. We also took into account considerations for minimizing missing data within the context of ITT specified by [CONTACT_101286].
[ADDRESS_361782] incorporated flexible windows for the data 
collection in our protocol and are al lowing for possible randomly missing interim 
assessments.  Therefore the population to whom these pi[INVESTIGATOR_296374]. 
9.4 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101921]. Summaries of process variables (i.e., recruitment, adherence, data collection, adverse events,  retention ) will 
be conducted on a rolling basis as the study progresses. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_296375] (IMC) . Based on the 
Cancer Registry at WFBCCC from 2015- 2017 an average of 1 28 patients/year had 
surgery for uterine or ovarian cancer  (73% uterine; 27% ovarian). Therefore, 
assuming 80% of patients are eligible  (n=102) , and that we can recruit about 30- 50% 
of those eligible  (n= 31-51), we anticipate recruiting 31 participants over 
approximately 8- 16 months  (2-4 per month) . Fidelity of implementing the 
interventions will also  be evaluated during the study period. If we document fidelity 
less than 80% during the clinical trial, than interventionists will undergo  further  
training with subsequent re -evaluation demonstrating sufficient fidelity.  
 
Futility analyses for efficacy or safety will not be conducted in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. SAE’s 
related to the intervention will suspend enrollment and/or the study intervention until 
SOAR ING Study  35 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 a safety review is convened (either routine or ad hoc) by [CONTACT_296390], proceed with caution, be further investigated, discontinued, or be modified and then proceed. If SAEs events are related to the interventions, then the relevant intervention protocol will be modified to avoid adverse events. If the frequency of non- serious adverse events is higher than 
anticipated or alters the benefit risk ratio as determined by [CONTACT_101291], the study investigators will also modify the relevant intervention protocol. Two or more specific adverse events among part icipants will prompt modification of the protocol.     
9.5 Outcomes  
The study team member  collecting outcome data will be masked to the participant’s 
intervention group assignment.  
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
The primary study outcome is feasibility (i.e., recruitment, adherence, assessment 
completion, and retention rates)  
 
9.5.2  Secondary Outcomes   
Secondary outcomes include proposed outcomes (i.e., pain [primary outcome  -  pain 
interference at week 2] , sleep disturbances, psychological distress) f or the next phase 
of study. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measure of pain of intensity (i.e., How would you rate your pain on 
average?)  is the proposed primary outcome (at 2 weeks) for the future larger clinical 
trial that will be informed by [CONTACT_74556].  
 
Adverse events and qualitative data will also be collected .  
9.6 Data Analyses  
This study  will provide quantitative data on recruitment, adherence, assessment 
completion, adverse events and retention rates and qualitative assessment of 
acceptability to guide future study planning. We will calculate  95% confidence 
intervals for each of the feasibility measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with our data. We will track the number of screened participants, those who are eligible, and the percent who agree to participate. For those not meeting the eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The proportion of participants and corresponding 95% CI for participants  who participated in the eMMB and AC 
sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed; we will also calculate the frequency of any adverse events and  percent of participants who 
complete the 2w visit to assess retention. We will use one -sample tests of binomial 
proportions to compare the recruitment, adherence, and retention rates to the hypothesized values of 50%, 70% and 70%, respectively. In exploratory analyses, we will compare participants who are non -adherent or who drop out by [CONTACT_296391], intervention group, and baseline scores of the measures. We  will also  
investigate any differences in participant recruitment, adherence, assessment 
SOAR ING Study  36 of 47  Version 5.0 
  19 AUG 2020  
 completion, adverse events,  and retention rates by [CONTACT_296392] a future study.  
 
Baseline analyses will include descriptive statistics of pain (i.e., intensity, 
interference, affective, analgesic use), sleep disturbance (patient -reported), 
psychological distress,  background characteristics (i.e., demographic) and other 
possible confounding variables (e.g., type of cancer, type of surgery, medications) by [CONTACT_65237]. The distributions of continuous variables will be examined to determine the presence of out liers and whether transformations are necessary for 
analysis. The primary goal of the statistical analysis of these measures for this Aim will be to estimate standard deviations (SD) for use in future studies. Additional analyses will include fitting mixed  ANCOVA models (adjustment for baseline) to 
model the trajectory of pain (and sleep disturbance and distress) by [CONTACT_296393] a subject; if any meaningful differences between the groups are found at baseline, we wi ll include them in these models. 
Analgesic use will be modeled in a similar manner using a GEE model with a logit link. We will also use mixed models to examine the daily actigraphy, pain, and other symptom data by [CONTACT_296394]. The purpose of all of the se models will be to obtain 
estimates of the SD of change adjusted for covariates of interest and the within-person correlation of the repeated measures, not to perform formal hypothesis testing. In exploratory models we will examine the impact of adherence to eMMB on changes in the measures, subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_58314], and we will examine the role of pain self -efficacy as a potential mechanism. The purpose of these analyses will be to 
estimate SD and within -person correlation by [CONTACT_296395]; no formal hypothesis testing will be done. We will also examine the 
validity of the patient report for intervention practice by [CONTACT_101952] -report of MMB practice and the activity level on the acceler ometer.  
 Interview transcripts will be coded independently by [CONTACT_296396]. Twenty -five percent of the transcripts will be coded independently by [CONTACT_296397].  Unresolved discrepancies  
reconciled by a third person. Using thematic analysis , the coded text will be 
iteratively reviewed and interpreted.
113 The qualitative and quantitative analyses will 
be evaluated in a mixed- methods framework for consistency and discrepancies to 
refine the protocol for future studies. For example, if the qualitative interviews 
indicate that a particular subgroup of patients (e.g., by [CONTACT_105975], surgery type ) 
perceive greater benefit from the eMMB, then we will perform exploratory subgroup analysis of the quantitative data.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
Questionnaires will be collected by a blinded study team member (Clinical Studies 
Coordinator) . Questionnaires will either be completed directly in REDCap or using 
paper forms.  Data records for each participant will be identified by a unique study 
code number that does not contain personal identifying information. Data collection 
SOAR ING Study  [ADDRESS_361783] ID numbers will be stored in a locking cabinet at WFB CCC or 
in the PI’s office building  while on s tudy. Data from these documents, clinical data 
from the medical chart  and data collected via daily automated surveys  will be entered 
into a REDCap database at Wake Forest University . The actigraphy data, audio 
recorded semi -structured interviews and videos of the intervention sessions will also 
only be coded by [CONTACT_32221].  
 
All participants will be assigned a study ID number; however, it is necessary fo r the 
study team to know participants names during time on -study. Names will be 
maintained in a participant tracking database accessible only to approved study staff 
through password protected files stored on a secure server, not on laptops or thumb drives . To protect confidentiality, all data will be stored in a locked file cabinet 
located in the secured office of a  study team member  or PI . All computers and data 
files will be password protected. All data processed will be in aggregate form and 
data collection forms will only be labeled with participant’s unique identification number.

[CONTACT_101305] or study  staff will also review all data collection forms on an ongoing basis 
(i.e., quarterly) for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. A study member not involved in data collection will enter the data  colle cted via paper 
questionnaires . At least ten percent of all data entered from questionnaires will be 
randomly selected and verified for accuracy against original source documents. Any discrepancies will be discussed with the Independent Monitors. Data will also be reviewed for outliers and to determine if values are missing at random prior to analysis.  [CONTACT_101305]  will provide quarterly updates to the IMC and research mentors 
regarding patient accrual.  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_361787]. Sohl  will monitor for protocol compliance, data quality, and review of 
documentation to assure protocol compliance. This will include review of informed 
consent  process  (upon enrollment ), adverse  event reporting (upon occurrence), and 
data collection (monthly).    
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY

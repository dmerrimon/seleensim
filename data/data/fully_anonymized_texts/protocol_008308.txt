Synopsis  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of  Mydayis on ADHD 
symptoms and executive function throughout the day into early evening, about 14- [ADDRESS_595913] morning dosing. The primary measure of ADHD symptoms will be the 
total score on the AISRS, the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scal e. 
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to examine the changes after Mydayis 
treatment in:  
1.  Overall inattentive (IA) and hyperactive- impulsive (HI) ADHD symptom subsets on 
the AISRS and overall impairment via the Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -
S) scale.  
2.  Total ADHD symptoms fourteen to fifteen hours after morning dosing as measured 
via total scores on the Time Sensitive Adult ADHD Symptom Scale (TASS) and the 
Inattentive (IA) and hyperactive - impulsive (HI) ADH D symptom TASS subsets.  
3. Neuropsychological measurement of executive function in the early evening (fourteen 
to fifteen hours after morning dosing) as measured by [CONTACT_464904](Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No -Go, Continuous Performanc e Test/Test of 
Variables of Attention, or TOVA)  
4.  Clinical symptoms of executive function, as measured by [CONTACT_464905] -Adult Version (BRIEF -A). 
Study Duration  
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595914]'s 
participation will last about seven weeks, depending on the amount of time spent in 
the screening phase of the study.  
It will take 12 months to recruit the initial 50 subjects (consented subjects). The last 
subject will be in the  study for approximately [ADDRESS_595915] 
an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disor der (ADHD) diagnosis meeting all inclusion 
criteria while also not meeting any of the exclusion criteria.  
Number and Description of Each Treatment Arm/Group  
 This six -week, treatment/placebo trial will be conducted after thorough screening has 
occurred and subjects are deemed eligible to move to the treatment/placebo portion of 
the study. After a two -week, subject, single –blinded, placebo lead -in, all patients will 
receive four weeks of order -fixed treatment with Mydayis (12.5mg — 37.5mg/day).  
Doses per Su bject per Treatment  
During the two -week, placebo lead -in, all subjects will receive 12.5mg of placebo at Visit 
[ADDRESS_595916] single- blind treatment phase, Mydayis will 
be initiated at a dose of 12.5mg/day at Visit 3 and can be titrated up (in the judgment 
of the investigator) in increments of 12.5mg, based upon clinical response and 
tolerability, up to 25mg at Visit 4, up 37.5mg at Visit [ADDRESS_595917]’s parti cipation in the study approximately [ADDRESS_595918] completed Visit 7.

predominantly inattentive presentation or combined presentation) as diagnosed 
via the Adult ADHD Clinician Diagnostic Scale version 1.2 (ACDS v1.2)  
2. Any other current psychiatric disorder, determined via the M.I.N.I, which requires 
pharmacotherapy treatment; exception for major depression, dysthymia and anxiety 
disorders  in remission but stable on psychiatric medications for three weeks or more 
at the discretion of the principal investigator  
3.  Current suicidal ideation or history of suicide attempts, based on the Columbia - 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale(C -SSRS)  
4. Lifetime history of bipolar disorder or any psychotic disorder as per the 
M.I.N.I ; exception for major depression, dysthymia and anxiety disorders in 
remission , but stable on psychiatric medications for three weeks or more at the 
discretion of the principal investigator . 
5.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant.  
6. Positive urine drug toxicology is excluded.  
7. Any other reason that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], prevents the subject 
from participating in the study or compromises the subject’s safety.  
Number of Participants 
In this study, approximately [ADDRESS_595920] 50 participants coming in for screening and consenting for participation. Up to 
50 patients will be enrolled, to ensure that 32 evaluable patients reach the end of 
treatment at week seven.  
There will be screen failures in this study. Subjects can fail the phone prescreen or 
those that passed the phone prescreen can fail during the in -clinic screening during the

IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595921] 12, 2021  version  
 
5 MINI (psychiatric interview), ACDS (ADHD diagnostic interview) or upon notice of 
abnormal safety test results.  
The remaining 34 subjects will be randomized/enrolled into the treatment/placebo part 
of the study. During the two -week, placebo lead -in, if the subject has a 30% decrease in 
the AISRS, they will not move into the [ADDRESS_595922] 32 subjects complete the study. The graph shows power 
at different values of the Cohen's d effect size for estimating the difference between 
baseline and endpoint values. For our primary analysis, which uses a two -sided test 
with a type I error of 0.05, it shows that 32 evaluable patients will give power of 90% 
or more for effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_595923]

6 neuropsychologica l assessments of executive function (WebNeuro:  Verbal 
Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, Continuous Performance Test (CPT)/TOVA) versus 
changes in BRIEF -A measures. Furthermore, it will examine potential differential 
effects of Mydayis in the sample of patients who have defined executive dysfunctions 
(defined by a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score on BRIEF -A ≥ 65 at placebo -
baseline). The study will also examine correlations in self -report of ADHD symptoms 
on the ASRS versus clinician report on the AISRS and also changes in self report 
measures of executive function and emotional dyscontrol on the ASRS versus these 
measures on the BRIEF -A.

14 1 - Introduction 
1.1 Introductory Statement  
One purpose of this trial is to extend the evidence basis for Mydayis in adult ADHD to 
include efficacy with a clinical ADHD symptom measure validated for DSM -5 adult 
ADHD. Spencer et al. (2008)  and Weisler et al. (2017)  used the ADHD -RS scale; the former 
also used DSM -4 adult ADHD criteria and training for adult ADHD prompts. Weiser et 
al. (2017)  embedded adult ADHD prompts into the ADHD -RS. Although the ADHD -RS 
with prompts has been widely utilized in ADHD trials, it not yet been fully validated for 
DSM -5. The Adult ADHD Investigator Sym ptom Rating Scale (AISRS) is a similar scale 
to the ADHD -RS with adult prompts, but it employs adult stem questions (as compared 
to the ADHD -RS using childhood stem questions), rates the 18 DSM symptoms of ADHD 
and has been validated for the DSM -5  (Silver stein MJ et al. 2018).   
The AISRS has also been used in multiple adult ADHD clinical treatment trials evaluating atomoxetine, droxidopa, and OROS methylphenidate (see section on scales) and its use in a Mydayis trial will further the comparison of Mydayis results with these 
agents. Another purpose of this trial is to reexamine the clinical efficacy of Mydayis later 
in the day on ADHD symptoms; the data on ADHD symptoms via the TASS (Spencer et 
al. 2008 ) is a decade old and has not been examined in subsequent trials. This study will 
specifically examine TASS ratings 14- [ADDRESS_595937] purpose is extend the data on the effects of Mydayis on executive function to 
include neuropsychological measures of executive function and specific clinical scales of executive function.

15 2 - Background  
2.1.1 Preclinical Experience  
Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_464906], organization, planning, 
procrastination, daydreaming, restlessness, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Adult ADHD is a common and highly impairing disorder affecting 4.4% of the US population  (Kessler 
RC et al. 2006 ). Recent factor analyses (Adler et al. 2017 ) have highlighted the importance 
of co- travelling symptoms of executive function deficits (organization, planning, time 
management and working memory) in addition to the core symptoms of in attention and 
hyperactivity -impulsivity noted in the DSM (DSM —5)  (American Psychiatric Association 
2013). Furthermore, it has been posited that executive function deficits (organization, 
planning, time management and working memory) define the impairment  in ADHD 
(Barkley and Murphy 2010). Psychostimulants are a mainstay of pharmacotherapy for 
adult ADHD and five sustained release preparations have been FDA approved for adult ADHD.  
The recommended starting dose of Mydayis is 12.[ADDRESS_595939] shown no additional clinically meaningful benefit. ( FDA 2017 
Reference ID: 4114154). 
2.1.2 Clinical Experience  
Mydayis is a triple -beaded preparation of mixed amphetamine salts which in early studies 
(Spencer et al. 200 8) has been shown to have a clinical duration of up to 16 hours via the 
TASS scale and a documented efficacy on adult ADHD DSM -4 symptoms via the ADHD -
RS (where training on use of adult ADHD prompts was given but not utilized with scale 
administration). Data from this study also supported some efficacy of Mydayis on co -
travelling symptoms on executive function as measured by [CONTACT_464907] ( Bron et al. 2014). However, specific executive function clinical scales and 
neuropsychological tests of executive function were not utilized, and executive function 
was not assessed later in the day.  
MYDAYIS was studied in adults between the ages of 18 to 55 using the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th or 5th editions (DSM -IV-TR and  DSM -5) 
criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double -
blind, placebo- controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the 
maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demon strate 
additional clinical benefit and are not recommended.  (FDA 2017, Reference ID: 4114154).

16 The decision for the dosage amount in this study was made based on the results from 
former studies on the efficacy of Mydayis in treating adult ADHD.  
 In the pr oposed study, subjects can receive Mydayis in doses of 12.5mg to 37.5mg per 
day. Subjects will receive Mydayis at an initial dose of 12.5mg per day after the two- week, 
placebo, lead -in phase. Dosage can be titrated up in increments of 12.5mg at the approva l 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. At Visit 4, dosage can be increased to 25mg per day for 
some subjects based upon clinical response and tolerability. At Visit 5, dosage can be 
increased to 37.5mg per day for some subjects. At Visit 6, the decision to sta y at the 
maximum dosage of 37.5mg per day or decrease dosage in increments of 12.5mg for the remainder of the study will be made. The decision for dosage amount was made based on 
the results from former studies on the efficacy of Mydayis in treating adult ADHD.   
 Efficacy of MYDAYIS in the treatment of ADHD was established in the following trials:  
 Three short -term trials in adults (18 to 55 years, Studies 1, 2, and 3)  
 Two short -term trials in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years, Studies 4 and 5)  
 Adult patients (18 to 55 years) with ADHD  
The approved adult doses, 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 37.5 mg are based on Studies 1 and 3 and the 50 mg dose efficacy is based on Study 2. Doses up to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended adult dosage) were evaluated, but demonstrated no additional 
clinical benefit.  
A 4 -week, randomized, double -blind, multi -center, placebo -controlled, forced -dose 
titration, safety and efficacy study (Study 1) was conducted in adults aged 18 to 55 years 
(N=275) who met DSM -5 criteria for ADHD. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, to 
two MYDAYIS treatment groups and a placebo group. Group 1 received a dose of 12.5 mg/day throughout the study. Group 2 were titrated on a weekly basis from the initial dose 12.5 mg until target dose of 37.5 mg/day was reached by [CONTACT_10585] 3 and were maintained at 37.5 mg throughout the study. Group 3 received placebo.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline of the adult ADHD -Rating Scale (RS) with prompts total score at  Week 4. Baseline adult ADHD -RS 
with prompts total score was defined as the last valid adult ADHD -RS with prompts total 
score assessment prior to taking the first dose of double- blind investigational product, 
usually at Visit 2. The primary comparison of interest was at Week [ADDRESS_595941] compared with placebo on change of ADHD -RS total score from baseline at visit 6 (Week 4), for both 12.5 
mg and 37.5 mg dose s respectively (Study 1 in Table 4). Patients on MYDAYIS also 
showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) score compared with placebo treatment.

17 Two multi -center, randomized, double- blind,  placebo- controlled, crossover studies of 
MYDAYIS 25 mg/day (Study 3) and 50 mg/day (Study 2) were conducted in adult patients 
who met DSM -IV TR criteria for ADHD. The efficacy was determined using the 
Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a sk ill-adjusted math test that 
measures attention in ADHD. PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of 
math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. Efficacy 
assessments were conducted at 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, and [ADDRESS_595943] -dose using the PERMP. 
MYDAYIS treatment, compared to placebo, reached statistical significance at either 2 
hours (Study 2) or 4 hours (Study 3) post- dose to [ADDRESS_595944] -dose in both studies. In a 
pre-specified supplementary analysis for Study 2, the maximum approved dose of 
MYDAYIS (50 mg) demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect compared with placebo beginning at [ADDRESS_595945] -dose(FDA 2017, Reference ID: 4114154).  
2.2 Background/prevalence of research topic  
Recent factor analyses ( Adler et al. 2017 ) have highlighted the importance of co -travelling 
symptoms of executive function deficits (organization, planning, time management and working memory) in addition to the core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity -
impulsivity no ted in the DSM (DSM -5). ( American Psychiatric Association 201 3).  
Furthermore, it has been posited that executive function deficits define the impairment in ADHD ( Barkley and Murphy 2010). Psychostimulants are a mainstay of 
pharmacotherapy and five sustain ed-release preparations have been FDA approved for 
adult ADHD.   
This proposal specifically addresses these issues by [CONTACT_464908], a triple-beaded 
preparation of mixed amphetamine salts, which in early studies ( Spencer et al. 2008 ) has 
been shown to have  a clinical duration of up to 16 hours via the TASS scale and a 
documented efficacy on adult ADHD DSM- 4 symptoms. We propose to assess ADHD 
symptoms with the AISRS, an ADHD symptoms scale validated for the DSM- 5 then re -
assess ADHD clinical symptoms later in the day via the TASS. We will also assess 
executive function throughout the day with the clinical scale BRIEF -A and 
neuropsychological tests (WebNeuro: Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, CPT/TOVA). 
Psychostimulants are a mainstay of pharmacotherapy for adult ADHD and five sustained release preparations have been FDA approved for adult ADHD

18 3 - Rationale/Significance  
3.1 Problem Statement  
One purpose of this trial is to extend the evidence basis for Mydayis in adult ADHD to 
include efficacy with a cl inical ADHD symptom measure validated for DSM -5 adult 
ADHD. The Spencer et al. (2008) and Weisler et al. (2017)  studies used the ADHD -RS 
scale; the former using DSM- IV adult ADHD criteria and training for adult ADHD 
prompts. The Weisler et al. (2017) study embedded adult ADHD prompts into the ADHD -
RS. Although the ADHD -RS with prompts has been widely utilized in ADHD trials, it not 
yet been fully validated for DSM -5. The Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale 
(AISRS) is a similar scale to the AD HD-RS with adult prompts, but it employs adult- stem 
questions (as compared to the ADHD -RS using childhood stem questions), rates the 18 
DSM symptoms of ADHD and has been validated for the DSM- 5 (Silverstein MJ et al. 
2018).  It has also been used in multip le adult ADHD clinical treatment trials studying 
atomoxetine, droxidopa, and OROS methylphenidate (see section on scales) and its use in 
a Mydayis trial will further the comparison of Mydayis results with these agents.  
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact   
Another purpose of this trial is to re -examine the clinical efficacy of Mydayis later in the 
day on ADHD symptoms; the data on ADHD symptoms via the TASS (Spencer et al. 2008)  
is a decade old and has not been examined in subsequent trials. This study wil l specifically 
examine TASS ratings 14- [ADDRESS_595947] on ADHD would be more knowledge regarding effects 
of Mydayis and its effects on executive function would improve the quality of life for people 
with ADHD. 
3.3.1 Potential Risks  
MYDAYIS is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients [ADDRESS_595948] been associated with the use of amphetamines.  
Cardi o
vascular : Dyspnea, sudden death. There have been isolated reports of 
cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use.  
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595949] 12, 2021  version  
 
19 Central Nervous System :  Psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_464885], overstimulation, 
restlessness, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, headache, tics, fatigue, aggression, anger, 
logorrhea, dermatillomania, and paresthesia (including formication).  
Eye Disorders: Mydriasis. 
Gastrointestinal: Unpleasant taste, constipation.  
Allergic : Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions, including ang ioedema and 
anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_131653].  
Endocrine : Impotence, changes in libido, frequent or prolonged erections. Skin :  Alopecia.  
Vascular Disorders: Raynaud's phenomenon. 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Rhabdomyolysis.  
Risk of taking a placebo  
The subject will have periods of taking a placebo and during this time, their symptoms 
may return and or get worse.  
Risk of Safety Clinical assessments  
Potential risks associated with obtaining blood samples are minimal but include: slight bruising, swelling, pain, blood clots, and a small risk of infection or a temporary feeling of faintness.  
Potential risks associated with an EKG include an initial feeling of coldness when the test material (sticky pads and gel) touches the skin, localized rash or skin irritation from the test material.  
Risk of loss of Confidentiality 
Possible loss of confidentiality related to urine screens and clinical data obtained du ring 
this study is recognized. As a guard against the loss of confidentiality, all information will 
be stored in locked files, which can be accessed only by [CONTACT_464909].  
Patients will be told to take medication once daily  in the morning and report if they have 
any of these effects at each visit.

20 4 - Study Objectives  
4.1 Hypothesis  
In subjects with adult ADHD after Mydayis treatment (from end of single -blind placebo 
lead- in) there will be significant improvement in:  
 1)  Overall symptoms of adult ADHD as measured by [CONTACT_464910] (AISRS) (primary effect).  
 2)  Overall inattentive (IA) and hy peractive -impulsive (HI) ADHD symptom subsets on 
the AISRS and overall impairment via the Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S) 
scale.  
 3)  Total ADHD symptoms fourteen hours after AM dosing as measured via total scores 
on the Time Sensitive Adult AD HD Symptom Scale (TASS); Inattentive (IA) and 
hyperactive -impulsive (HI) ADHD symptom subsets (TASS) subsets.  
 4)  In neuropsychological measurement of Executive Function in the early evening 
(fourteen to fifteen hours after morning dosing) as measured by ( WebNeuro: Verbal 
Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, CPT/TOVA)  
 5) In clinical symptoms of Executive Function in the early evening, as measured by [CONTACT_464911] -A. 
4.[ADDRESS_595952] morning dosing. The primary measure of ADHD symptoms will be the 
total score on the AISRS, the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale.  
4.3 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to examine the changes after Mydayis 
treatment in:  
1.  Overall inattentive (IA) and hyperactive -impulsive (HI) ADHD symptom subsets on 
the AISRS and overall impairment via the Clinical Global I mpression -Severity (CGI -S) 
scale.  
2.  Total ADHD symptoms fourteen to fifteen hours after AM dosing as measured via total scores on the Time Sensitive Adult ADHD Symptom Scale (TASS) and the Inattentive 
(IA) and hyperactive - impulsive (HI) ADHD symptom TAS S subsets.  
3. Neuropsychological measurement of executive function in the early evening (fourteen 
to fifteen hours after morning dosing) as measured by ( WebNeuro: Verbal

22 5 - Study Design  
5.1 General Design Description  
Description of Study type  
This will be a phase three, single- blind study, with a two -week, placebo lead -in and then 
a four -week forced titration treatment with Mydayis with star ting dose of 12.5 mg/day 
with titration based on clinical response and potential adverse events.  
Number and Description of Each Treatment Arm/Group  
This will be a six -week trial after the screening period. After a two- week, subject single - 
blind, placebo lead -in, all patients will receive four weeks of Mydayis (12.5mg -
37.5mg/day), with treatment order fixed. Study visits are hybrid; conducted remotely  and 
in clinic.  
Doses per Subject per Treatment  
During the two -week, placebo lead -in, all subjects will receive 12.5mg Placebo at Visit 1 
and Visit 2. During Visit 3, Mydayis treatment will be initiated at a dose of 12.5mg/day 
and will increase in increments of 12.5mg, based upon clinical response and tolerability, up to 25mg at Visit 4, up 37.5mg at Visit [ADDRESS_595955] in clinic/remote 
visit f or this study. Patients will be seen weekly throughout the trial both in clinic and 
remote. 
Our primary outcome is effects of Mydayis on overall adult ADHD symptoms via total 
AISRS Score. In secondary analyses, we will also analyze the following variables:  
Evaluation of ADHD subset IA and HI symptoms on the AISRS; TASS scores [ADDRESS_595956] dose (total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive subsets) 
(for effects of Mydayis over time at different points of the day and within the day); 
expanded Adult ADHD Self Report Symptom Rating Scale (expanded -ASRS) Symptom 
Checklist (total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive, executive function and emotional 
control subsets); symptoms of executive function (BRIEF -A: GEC, metacognition, 
behavioral regulation scales and subscales: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, 
Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor); and 
neuropsychological tests  (WebNeuro: Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, CPT/TOVA) : 
Response Time Variability [RVP], Response Time, d', Errors of Omission, Errors of Commission, Post -Commission Response Times, Multiple Responses, Anticipatory 
Responses). 
Our statistical analysis framework will be the general linear regression model. We will 
choose the distri butional family and link function based on the distribution of the outcome 
variables. Each regression model will predict the outcome as the dependent variable with 
weeks in trial after the end of the two -week, single- blind, placebo lead -in as the 
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595957] chosen an IIT analyses 
as we can include all patients except for placebo responders in the analyses. We ha ve 
chosen a single -blind placebo lead -in to define placebo responders, which are defined as 
patients who experience ≥30% decrease in their total AISRS scores during placebo lead -
in treatment. Placebo responders will be discontinued from the study. We antic ipate that, 
based on the literature, 10% or fewer of patients will be placebo responders and that the 
overall discontinuation rate in the trial will be 20%. Changes within the day in TASS ratings [ADDRESS_595958] dose will also be 
analyzed via the general linear regression model. Correlations between ADHD and 
executive function ratings will be examined via Spearman's correlation coefficients.  
  
Statistical Power Analysis 
  
   
Justification for sample size : 
Up to 50 patients will be enrolled to be sure that 32 evaluable patients reach the end of 
treatment at week six. The graph shows power at different values of the Cohen's d effect 
size for estimating the difference between baseline and endpoint values. For our primary 
analysis, which uses a two -sided test with a type I error of 0.05, it shows that 32 evaluable 
patients, will give a power of 90% or more for effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_595959] size: it is half of the [ADDRESS_595960] size reported by [CONTACT_464912]. (2008)  and thus is at the lower end of what we should expect to see in this study.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_595961] recruitment to follow -up is 
approximately 15-18 months. The individual recruitment from screening to the follow up 
GCP phone call will be approximately 7 -8 weeks. Note: screenings/washouts can take a 
few weeks. 
5.1.2 Number of Study Sites  
This is an investigator -initiated protocol with funding from Shire. Shire will provide the 
investigational products Mydayis and placebo, in addition to some funding. This is a single site study, where all subjects are consented and all study activities are conducted in person and/or remotely at the address below.

5.2 Outcome Variables  
5.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of Mydayis on ADHD 
symptoms and executive function throughout the day into the early evening –(14-[ADDRESS_595963] morning dosing). This study will extend the evidence basis for Mydayis i n adult 
ADHD to include efficacy with a clinical ADHD symptom measure validated for DSM- 5 
adult ADHD. The Spencer et al. (2008)  and Weisler et al. (2017)  studies used the ADHD -
RS scale; the former using DSM -IV adult ADHD criteria and training for adult ADH D 
prompts. The Weisler et al. (2017) study embedded adult ADHD prompts into the ADHD -
RS. Although the ADHD -RS with prompts has been widely utilized in ADHD trials, it not 
yet been fully validated for DSM -5. The Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale 
(AISRS) is a similar scale to the ADHD -RS with adult prompts, but it employs adult stem 
questions (as compared to the ADHD -RS using childhood stem questions), rates the 18 
DSM symptoms of ADHD and has been validated for the DSM- 5 (Silverstein MJ et al. 
2018 ).  It has also been used in multiple adult ADHD clinical treatment trials evaluating 
atomoxetine, droxidopa, and OROS methylphenidate (see section on scales) and its use in a Mydayis trial will further the comparison of Mydayis results with these agents.  Another 
purpose of this trial is to re -examine the clinical efficacy of Mydayis later in the day on 
ADHD symptoms; the data on ADHD symptoms via the TASS ( Spencer et al. 2008) is a 
decade old and has not been examined in subsequent trials. This study will specifically examine TASS ratings 14- [ADDRESS_595964] purpose is extend the data on the effects of Mydayis on 
executive function to include neuropsychological measures of executive function and specific clinical scales of executive function.  
Background/Rationale  
Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder 
characte rized by [CONTACT_464906], organization, planning, 
procrastination, daydreaming, restlessness, impulsivity and hyperactivity.  Adult ADHD is a common and highly impairing disorder affecting 4.4% of the US population (Kessler 
RC et al. 200 6).  Recent factor analyses  (Adler et al. 2017)  have highlighted the importance 
of co- travelling symptoms of executive function deficits (organization, planning, time 
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595965] 12, 2021  version  
 
25 management and working memory) in addition to the core symptoms of inattention and 
hyperactivity -impulsivity noted in the DSM (DSM -5) (American Psychiatric Association 
2013).  Furthermore, it has been posited that executive function deficits define the impairment in ADHD ( Barkley and Murphy 2010 ).  Psychostimulants are a mainstay of 
pharmacoth erapy for adult ADHD and five sustained- release preparations have been 
FDA approved for adult ADHD.  One of these preparations, Mydayis, is a triple -beaded 
preparation of mixed amphetamine salts, which, in early studies, ( Spencer et al. 2008 ) 
has been shown to have a clinical duration of up to 16 hours via the TASS scale and a documented efficacy on adult ADHD DSM -IV symptoms via the ADHD -RS (where 
training on use of adult ADHD prompts was given but not utilized with scale administration). Data from this study also supported some efficacy of Mydayis on co -
travelling symptoms on executive function as measured by [CONTACT_464913]. However, specific executive function clinical scales and neuropsychological tests of executive funct ion were not utilized, and executive function was not assessed later in the 
day. This proposal specifically addresses these issues by [CONTACT_464914], an ADHD 
symptoms scale validated for DSM -5, re -assessing ADHD clinical symptoms later in the 
day via the TASS, and utilizing clinical scales (BRIEF -A) and neuropsychological tests 
(WebNeuro: Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, CPT/TOVA)   
5.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables  
Exploratory Objectives: We will explore correlations of TASS ratings w ith AISRS 
ratings to examine overall ADHD ratings vs. ADHD ratings throughout the day. We will also explore correlations of changes in neuropsychological assessments of executive 
function (WebNeuro: Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No- Go, CPT/TOVA)  versus ch anges 
in BRIEF -A measures. Furthermore, we will examine potential differential effects of 
Mydayis in the sample of patients who have defined executive dysfunctions (GEC score 
on BRIEF -A ≥ 65 at placebo -baseline). We will also examine correlations in self -report of 
ADHD symptoms on the ASRS versus clinician report of ADHD symptoms on the AISRS, 
and also changes in self report measures of executive function and emotional dyscontrol on the ASRS versus these measures on the BRIEF -A.

The remaining 34 subjects will be randomized/enrolled into the treatment. During the two-week, placebo lead -in, if the subject has a 30% decrease in the AISRS, they will not

30 Prior Medications Allowed/Disallowed During Study 
Subjects taking stimulant or non -stimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD 
during screening will be washed out for a period equivalent to 5 half -lives of the 
medicatio n prior to baseline evaluations. This would be approximately 7- 21 days per 
investigator's decision.  
Disallowed medications  
Use of any of the following medications is not permitted during the study; unless approved 
by [CONTACT_464918].  
1)  Antidepressant prescription medication (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, monoamine oxidase [MAO] blocker, tricyclic, etc.) and St. John's Wort.  
2)  Anticonvulsant medications (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lamotrigine,valproic acid, etc.) a nd antipsychotic medication.  
3)  Sedating antihistamines (e.g., doxilamine succinate, diphenhydramine) for use in sedation or aiding with sleep. Subjects' routinely using sedating antihistamines for 
seasonal allergies will be required to switch to non -seda ting alternatives for the duration 
of the study, unless otherwise contraindicated.  
4)  Other medications or supplements that may interfere with the assessment of cognitive 
function are not permitted during the study.  
6.1.8 Restrictions  
Subjects will be screened for drug and alcohol abuse during the prescreen phase. Subjects 
are instructed on the dangers of drinking alcohol or engaging in drug use during 
treatment with Mydayis. They will be warned not to use Mydayis for any other condition except the condition for this study: ADHD. Subjects will be instructed and reminded at each study visit not to share this medication with other people, even if they have ADHD. 
They will be reminded that the Mydayis may harm those for who it is not prescribed for 
and it is against the law. Subjects will be reminded to report any adverse events or 
concomitant medications they are taking at each visit.  
Subjects will be reminded to take their medication at 5am each morning, as the study 
assessments are dependent on the consumption of Mydayis at 5:00 am.  
6.2. Assessments  
The Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS)  
The AISRS is an 18 -item, clinician -administered, semi -structured interview methodology 
developed to evaluate treatment responses ( Spencer et al. 2010). The measure contains 
prompts and stem questions designed to capture the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) symptoms of the disorder ADHD as they present in adulthood. 
Based on the responses from the patient, the administering clini cian rates the symptom 
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595978] 12, 2021  version  
 
31 severity as 0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, or 3= severe. The scale has been used and 
validated many times in a variety of clinical drug trials ( Adler  &  Gorny,  2015;  Adler,  
Zimmerman,  Starr,  Silber,  Palumbo,  Orman  &  Spencer  2011 Goodman  et al.,  2017; 
Spencer  et al.,  2010)  . 
The Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale (ASRS)  
The Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale (ASRS) Symptom Checklist is a self -report that 
presents the 18 DSM ADHD symptoms in adult context and is rated on a frequency  basis. 
It was developed by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) work group on adult ADHD, and comprises an [ADDRESS_595979]) to help identify adults at risk of ADHD ( Kessler et al., 2005;Ustun et al., 2017). 
The Screener and the Symptom Checklist use a 5 -point Likert -type scale to rate ADHD 
symptoms (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4= very of ten). Depending 
on the question, "sometimes," "often," or "very often" suggest clinical impairment for that specific item. The ASRS v1.[ADDRESS_595980] part of a dia gnostic evaluation or to be 
used in monitoring treatment response (Adler, Shaw, & Alperin, 2015;Adler et al., 2006 ). 
The ASRS has been expanded to include additional symptoms intended to assess 
executive function deficits (EFDs; nine items) and emotional d yscontrol (EC; four items). 
EFDs are deficiencies of high order cognitive processes, such as self -control, self -
regulation, and ability to prioritize and to plan multiple tasks. EC includes symptoms of mood lability, irritability, and emotional overreactiv ity. 
Time Sensitive Adult ADHD Symptom Scale (TASS)   
The TASS scale is an 18- item scale matching the 18 DSM ADHD symptoms, with 
language changed to allow self -report ratings and assessment of ADHD symptoms 
throughout the day. It has been validated and used  as a measure of change throughout 
the day in the in the Mydayis trial ( Spencer et al. 2008).   
The Clinical Global Impression Severity  
The CGI- S scale is a validated, highly utilized measure of impairment in studies of adult 
ADHD and has been employed in p rior Mydayis studies.  
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function® —Adult Version  
The BRIEF -A is a 75 item self -report scale which is highly validated and normed It has 
three major scales: GEC, metacognition, and behavioral regulation scales and also has several subscales (see stats section). It is log transformed so scores ≥65 are considered significant as they are ≥ 1.5 SDs above the population mean. The scale has been used as 
a measure of executive function in several ADHD clinical trials  (Vyvanse and  Mixed 
Amphetamine Salts: Adler, L.A. et al. 2014; atomoxetine: Adler, L.A. et al. 2014).  
Protocol Number Shire # IIR -[LOCATION_003]-002255  
IRB#s19 -[ADDRESS_595981] has been proven to be reliable and valid when compared to scores done via paper and pencil. The WebNeuro platform is HIPPA  compliant and can use the combination of personal and neurocognitive 
data making it an efficient battery for use in this research study.( Silverstien et al 2007) 
For the purpose of this study we will only be using three out of the available eleven cognitiv e assessments: Verbal Interference (or the Stroop Test), Continuous Performance 
Test -CPT(equivalent to the TOVA), and the Go/No- Go. 
 
Go/No -Go 
The Go -No is a cognitive test of the balance between automatic responding and response 
suppression. This tests im pulsivity and inhibition by [CONTACT_1601] a stimulus to respond to 
and a stimulus to suppress response to, or the go - and no -go stimuli, respectively.  
Stroop Color Word Test (Verbal Interference)  
The Stroop Test is a test of executive function where there is presentation of a list of 
colors, then words and then a list of colors and words where there is interference.  It has been used as a measure of executive function in ADHD trials (atmoxetine: Faraone et al. 
2005).  
Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) (Cont inuous Performance Test (CPT))  
The TOVA is a continuous performance test, which also gives a measurement of executive function.  The key measures of executive function are noted in the statistics section; specifically response time variability has been exa mined as a measure in both children 
and adults as measure sensitive to treatment effects ( metadoxine: Manor et al. 2012; 
OROS methylphenidate: Bron et al. 2014).  The TOVA test is FDA approved for ADHD.  
6.2.1 Efficacy  
To evaluate the efficacy of Mydayis, we will explore correlations of TASS ratings with AISRS ratings to examine overall ADHD ratings vs. ADHD ratings throughout the day. We will also explore correlations of changes in neuropsychological assessments of 
executive function (WebNeuro: Verbal Interference/Stroop, Go/No -Go, CPT/TOVA)  versus 
changes in BRIEF -A measures. Furthermore, will examine potential differential effects 
of Mydayis in the sample of patients who have defined executive dysfunctions (GEC score 
on BRIEF -A ≥65 at placebo -baseline). We will also examine correlations in self - report of 
ADHD symptoms on the ASRS versus clinician report of ADHD symptoms on the AISRS, and also changes in self -report measures of executive function and emotional dyscontro l 
on the ASRS versus these measures on the BRIEF -A.

33 6.2.2 Safety/Pregnancy -related policy  
Throughout the study, we will monitor subjects for safety and possible pregnancy. During 
the screening and eligibility period, we will conduct and report, if applic able clinical 
laboratory results, to include pregnancy testing, ECG readings and the C -SSRS  
(conducted as needed per clinician discretion) if there are significant clinical findings. We 
will monitor subjects weekly for abnormal vital signs, adverse events,  and concomitant 
medications. All adverse events results will be tabulated in manuscripts along with significance testing using the appropriate general linear model.  
Subjects will be given a pregnancy contact [CONTACT_464919] a pregnancy. The pregnant woman will be given a pregnancy inform consent to read and sign to allow us to follow- up with the pregnancy until terminated or full term delivery.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom,  sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of a study. Inter -current illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the a bnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal  
•  Is associated with a serious adverse event  
•  Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
•  Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
•  Is considered by [CONTACT_464920] t 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) 
is any AE that is:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening 
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .

Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study pe riod. 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an 
adverse event.  
Post- study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is o therwise explained. At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject's personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The  investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study. The sponsor should also be notified if the in vestigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented  as an adverse event if any one of 
the following conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
The abnormality is of a degree that  requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.

adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document (though should be grouped under one diagnosis). All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
partici pation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

During Screening/Baseline Visit (Week -3- 0) 
The screening visit  will be conducted and completed in two parts: remote and in -clinic. 
During the remote portion, informed consent will be obtained at the screening visit before 
any study procedures are conducted. Study staff will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria , collect demographics, medical and psychiatric history, prior and concomitant 
medications, and confirm the ADHD diagnosis via the ACDS v 1.[ADDRESS_595988] 28 days up to 90 days. Subjects will be re- consented every 30 days and/or at baseline. Subjects will be called 
every other week during the holding phase to check willingness to continue to participate. 
During the dual remote/in -clinic portion, study staff will conduct a physical examination, 
medical review of systems, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and electrocardiogram 
(ECG/EKG). A blood sample will be collected for routine laboratory testing (hematology and blood chemistry) and a urine sample will be collected for urinaly sis, urine pregnancy 
test (for females of child bearing potential), and urine drug screen. All or some of these clinical examinations can be waived from the screening process if subject can provide record from their primary care doctor and the principal in vestigator approves them. 
Trained Study staff will conduct the WebNeuro neuropsychological testing.  Participant 
will complete self -report forms.

6.3.7 Removal of subjects  
Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Patients can withdraw or take back their permission to use and share his/her health information at any time. When the patient withdraws their permission, they will not be able to take back in formation that has already been used or shared with others. In order 
to withdraw their permission from the study, patients must send a written notice to the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_464898]. If patient 
withdraws their permission, he/she will not be able to stay in this study.  
Patients will be withdrawn if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_464899], it is no longer safe for the patient to participate in the study. We can get verbal permission to follow -up with the 
patient  in the event they suffer adverse events. We will document three attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_244451]. If unable to contact, we will send the patient a certified letter. (Attachment)  
6.4 Statistical Method  
6.4.1 Statistical Design  
Statistical Analysis Plan : Our primary outcomes are the correlations of TASS ratings 
with AISRS ratings to examine overall ADHD ratings vs. ADHD ratings throughout the day into early evening.  In secondary analyses, we will also analyze the following 
variables: Evaluation of ADHD symptoms on AISRS; the TASS [ADDRESS_596037] dose: (total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive subsets); expanded ASRS 
(total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive, executive function and emotional control 
subsets); symp toms of executive function (BRIEF -A: GEC, metacognition, behavioral 
regulation scales and subscales: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor); and neuropsychological tests (Verbal Inter ference/Stroop: Color, Word and Interference Score;Go/No -Go: 
Accuracy, False Negative errors, False Positive errors, and Response Time; CPT/TOVA: 
Response Time Variability [RVP], Response Time, d', Errors of Omission, Errors of 
Commission, Post -Commission Response Times, Multiple Responses, Anticipatory 
Responses). 
Our statistical analysis framework will be the general linear regression model.  We will 
choose the distributional family and link function based on the distribution of the outcome 
variables. Eac h regression model will predict the outcome as the dependent variable with 
weeks in trial after the end of the single- blind placebo lead -in as the independent variable.

placebo lead -in to define placebo responders, which are defined as patient s who experience 
≥30% decrease in their total AISRS scores during placebo lead -in treatment and will be 
discontinued from the protocol. We anticipate that based on the literature that 10% or fewer of patients will be placebo responders and that the overall  discontinuation rate in 
the trial will be 20% ( Manor et al. 2012 ). Changes within the day in TASS ratings [ADDRESS_596039] dose will also be analyzed via the 
general linear regression model. Correlations between ADHD and executive function ratings will be examined via  Spearman's correlation coefficients.  
  
Statistical Power Analysis 
  
  
 
  
Justification for sample size : Up to 50 patients will be enrolled to be sure that 32 
evaluable patients reach the end of treatment at week six. The graph shows power at 
different values of the Cohen's d effect size for estimating the difference between baseline 
and endpoint values.  For our primary analysis, which uses a two -sided test with a type I 
error of 0.05, it shows that  32 evaluable patients will give power of 90% or more for effect 
sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_596040] size; it is half of the 1.[ADDRESS_596041] size reported by [CONTACT_464922].  (2008) REF and thus is at the lower end of what we 
should expect to see in this study.  
6.4.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Justification for sample size : Up to 50 patients will be enrolled to be sure that 32 -30 
evaluable patients reach the end of treatment at week six. The graph shows power at

48 6.4.3 Planned Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analyses  
Our statistical analysis framework will be the general linear regression model. We will 
choose the distributional family and link function based on the distribution of the outcome 
variables. Each regression model will predict the outcome as the dependent variable with weeks in trial after the end of the single- blind placebo lead -in as the independent variable. 
All analyses will use the ITT sample. For our design, a significant effect of week assesses the significance of the drug effect. We have chosen an IIT analyses as we can include all patients except for placebo responders in the analyses. We have chosen a single-blind placebo lead -in to define placebo responders, which are defined as patients who experience 
≥30% decrease in their total AISRS scores during placebo lead -in treatment and will be 
discontinued from the protocol. We anticipate that, based on the literature, 10% or fewer of patients will be placebo responders and that the overall discontinuation rate in the trial will be 20% ( Manor et al. 2012 ). The changes within the day in TASS ratings, 1- hour post 
dose vs. [ADDRESS_596045] dose will also be analyzed via the general 
linear regression model. Correlations between ADHD and executive function ratings will be examined via Spearman's correlation coefficients.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Objectives Analyses  
In secondar y analyses, we will also analyze the following variables: Evaluation of ADHD 
subset IA and HI symptoms on AISRS, TASS [ADDRESS_596046] dose: 
(total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive subsets) (for effects of Mydayis over time at 
different points of the day and within the day); expanded Adult ADHD Self Report Scale 
(ASRS) Symptom Checklist (total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive, executive 
function and emotional control subsets); symptoms of executive function (BRIEF -A: GEC, 
metacognition, behavioral regulation scales and subscales: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional 
Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor); and neuropsychological tests (Stroop: Color, Word and Interference Score; and TOVA: Response Time Variability [RVP], Response Time, d', Errors of Omission, Errors of 
Commission, Post -Commission Response Times , Multiple Responses, Anticipatory 
Responses). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Safety/Pregnancy -related policy  
Throughout this study, we will monitor safety  and possible pregnancy by [CONTACT_464923]. We will collect blood tests and urine test to ensure safe participation in the study. In addition, we will conduct the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) to evaluate continued mental health 
and suicidality. We will monitor weekly vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and 
blood pressure). Adverse events and concomitant medications will also be monitored. All

No additional analysis other than what was already discussed will be done.  
6.4.4 Subsets and Covariates  
Statistical Analysis Plan : Our primary outcome is effects on overall adult ADHD 
symptoms via total AISRS Score. In secondary analyses, we will also analyze the following variables: Evaluation of ADHD subset IA and HI symptoms on AISRS, TASS [ADDRESS_596048] dose: (total, inattentive and hyperactive -impulsive subsets) 
(for effects of Mydayis over time at different points of the day and within the day);

will be 20%. Changes within the day in TASS ratings [ADDRESS_596050] dose will also be analyzed via the general linear regression model. 
Correlations between ADHD and executive function ratings will be examined via 
Spearman's correlation coefficients.  
Exploratory Objectives:  We will explore correlations of TASS ratings with AISRS 
ratings to examine overall ADHD ratings vs. ADHD ratings throughout the da y. We will 
also explore correlations of changes in neuropsychological assessments of executive 
function (WEBNEURO; STROOP, GO/NO -GO, CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST) 
versus changes in BRIEF -A measures. Furthermore, we will examine potential 
differential effect s of Mydayis in the sample of patients who have defined executive 
dysfunctions (GEC score on BRIEF - A >= 65 at placebo -baseline). We will also examine 
correlations in self -report of ADHD symptoms on the ASRS) versus clinician report of 
ADHD symptoms on the AISRS, and also changes in self -report measures of executive 
function and emotional dyscontrol on the ASRS versus these measures on the BRIEF -A.

7.4 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems  
Protocol deviations or violations (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional 
deviations from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations:  
• One or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
• The event has the potential to occur again  
• The deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake (e.g., violation of informed consent process, IMP dispensing or subject dosing 
error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria or concomitant medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_464924].  The investigator, medical monitor and 
sponsor will come as quickly as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject's continuation in the trial. This decision will be documented by [CONTACT_31376], and reviewed with the Data Safety M onitor. 
7.5 Data Collection  
The documentation into the source documents for research visits should occur in real time and no later than 3 business days from the date of the visit. If the documentation is later 
than three business days, this should be cons idered a late entry with an explanation. 
Documentation of the data should occur within 7 business days of the visit. If not entered 
within that time period, we will document in the source documents the reason for the delay. 
Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. 
Source data are contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents,  
and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_464900] r

in accordance with established research principles, the ICH E6 GCP: Consolidated 
Guidance, and applicable regulatory requirements and local laws. The investigator will ensure all research staff working on this protocol meet the accept ance of the IRB. In 
addition, all investigators and clinical site personnel will undergo initial and ongoing training for this clinical trial. The training will be documented on training logs.  
Either institution or senior research staff may conduct quality  assurance audits. Audits 
will include, but are not limited to: IMP supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, and comparison of the data in REDCap against the paper 
source documents. The senior research staff, investigator or co -investigator will also spot 
check charts, REDCap, and sign off on completed subjects.  
During each subject's visit to the clinic, research staff will record progress notes to 
document all significant observations. The investigator or co- investigator will s ign these 
notes at each visit.  
At a minimum, these notes will contain: documentation of the informed consent process, 
any revised consents, eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to study medication 
administration), date of the visit and the corre sponding visit in the trial schedule. The 
note will also include the presence or absence of adverse events (severity, frequency, 
duration, action taken, outcome and relationship to study medication as assessed by [CONTACT_093]/co- investigator). Notes wi ll also include changes in concomitant medications 
or dosages. Included in the progress note will be all telephone numbers or other means of contact [CONTACT_464925]. Source documents and source

7.9 Data or Specimen Storage/Security  
In this study, data will be collected, stored (digital, hard copy, etc.) and maintained in a secure manner (encryption, password protection, etc.).Only minimal information will be 
collected from the prescreens. Prescreens will be shredded after all necessary information 
is collected. The prescreens of those who have passed to screening will be added to a source chart and stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room until eligibility is determined. Once  
eligible, the subject is baselined and all source documents are stored in the same manner 
in a locked room in a locked cabinet. Data will be entered into the secure data capture 
system REDCap. Unidentified data will also be stored in our shared drive for writing purposes.  
 
 
7.10 Retention of Records  
Records Retention  
It is the investigator's responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_596061]. These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477]. In such an instance, it is the respon sibility of

need to be retained.  
7.11 Study Monitoring  
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan. The investigator will 
allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities. The investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study - related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laborat ory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
[CONTACT_426913], as PI, will be responsible for review of all aspects of the study at our site, and will review subject progress weekly, including:  
• Recruitment procedures  
• Informed consent  
• Protoc ol violations  
• Occurrence and handling of adverse effects  
• Patient Outcomes  
• Participants' safety, privacy and confidentiality  
• Study progress toward recruitment goals and participant retention/attrition rates  
• Review of new scientific literature pertinent to t he safety of participants  
All subject source charts will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_3647]. Subject REDCap data will be spot -checked by [CONTACT_464926] a 
month for any discrepancies and for completion.  
[CONTACT_464929] ler will determine whether risk/benefit ratios have changed to the extent that the 
trial should be modified or discontinued. Specific recommendations for protocol modifications, should they be necessary, will be elaborated, with accompanying rationale 
for each. This will be reported to sponsor, IRB, Study Monitor and manufacturers who 
will donate the study drug (Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc.)  
7.12 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_464901]/her site and communicate safety issues as per the monitoring plan. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting 
of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation 
of a site data and safety -monitoring plan. Medical monitoring will include a 
regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events and a report to be submitted to the IRB.

7.13 Study Modification  
Study modifications and specific recommendations for these protocol modifications, 
should they be necessary, will be elaborated, with accompanying rationale for each. This will be reported to sponsor, IRB, Medical Monitor and manufacturers who will donate the study drug (Shire Pharmaceuti cals Group plc.).  
After IRB approval the protocol, change will be communicated to the team at our weekly meeting. The protocol training for the change will be documented in the Protocol Training Logs. The change will be implemented as soon as possible.  
7.14 Study Discontinuation  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_464902] a decline of 30% per the clinical assessments conducted, they 
will be withdrawn. Patient experiencing adverse events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the subject can no longer pa rticipate due to a change in medical status, 
experiences from adverse events, or patient becomes pregnant), the subject will be discontinued from the study. These are the possible reasons for termination from the 
study:  
• Adverse events  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Lost to follow -up  
• Pregnancy  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]  
• Noncompliance 
• Protocol violation  
• Other  
Documentation of study discontinuation will be added to subject source records. 
Withdrawal assessments will be conducted if investigator deems it is necessary. This will 
also be documented in the subject’s source document folder..

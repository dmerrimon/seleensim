 1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Primary:  To assess the feasibility of blinatumomab post allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as consolidation therapy in patients with 
B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Toxicities attributable to 
blinatumomab,  acute GVHD, and secondary graft failure  will be the p arameters to 
define feasibility.   
 
1.2 Secondary :   
1.2.1 To evaluate the progression -free survival (PFS) rate at 1 -year for patients 
with ALL compared to contemporary patient cohort.  
 
1.2.2  To evaluat e other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival  (OS)  and 
minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity rate in patients treated with 
blinatumomab for consolidation therapy.  
 
1.2.3  To evaluate, non -relapse mortality (NRM) and chronic G VHD.   
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1083210] group of 
patients with ALL.  
Overall survival 
(OS) ranges from 
30%-60% 
depending on the 
patients disease 
stage and risk 
profile at time of 
transplant (1,2).  
Increasingly, 
minimal residual 
disease (MRD), both before and after HCT, is becoming an important predictor for 
relapse (3).  In a series of [ADDRESS_1083211], measured by [CONTACT_787305][INVESTIGATOR_007] (FCI) with a sensitivity of 0.01%, present at time 
of HCT had a shorter PFS compared to patients who were MRD negative, 28% vs. 
47%, p=.08 (4).  Furthermore, among [ADDRESS_1083212], and 18 of these patients developed 

Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 5 of 26 
 overt hematologic relapse within a median of 3.8 months (4). Of note, among [ADDRESS_1083213], 41% did NOT have preceding MRD, 
suggesting that positive MRD post HCT essentially confirms eventual relapse, but 
negative MRD post HCT in a high -risk patient does not preclude relapse. Our 
findings corroborate similar published studies (5,6).  Patients transplanted beyond 
second remission routinely have a significantly lower PFS and OS rates. In  our 
study of 97 patients (CR1 51, CR2 29, others 17) treated with busulfan and 
clofarabine chemotherapy conditioning following a matched sibling (MSD) or 
matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant, patients in CR1 had a significantly 
better disease free sur vival (DFS) compared with others (Figure 1).  For patients 
in CR1, the 2 -yr DFS rate was 61% with 9/51 patients relapsing at median 9 
months, the 2 -yr DFS rate was 40% for CR2, with 10/29 relapsing at median 3 
months, and for patients with more advanced di sease, the 2 -yr DFS rate was 33% 
with 3/17 progressing at a median of 3 months.  Our preliminary results with this 
regimen were similar (7). Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) corroborate our findings. Betw een 1996 and 2001, 
in patients less than 20 years -old, OS ranges from 25% for patients transplanted 
beyond first remission to 50% for sibling transplants in first remission.  Similarly, in 
adult patients, greater than [ADDRESS_1083214] remission with OS of 60%, as compared to 35% if 
transplants are performed beyond CR1 (CIBMTR Registry).   
 
In pediatric patients with B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cure rates 
with chemotherapy ( in com bination with  radiotherapy  in certain situations ) can be 
as high as 80 -85%. Children with second or greater relapse or refractory disease 
have dismal prognosis even when treated with a llogeneic stem cell transplantation 
which is usually reserved for patients with high -risk features (i.e. poor -risk 
cytogenetic markers), those who fail to achieve remission or relapse after standard 
or intensive chemotherapy. From the CIBMTR data base, among the 1,569 
patients younger than 18 years receiving an HLA -match ed sibling transplant for 
ALL between 2005 and 2015, the 3 -year probabilities of survival were 73% ± 2%, 
58% ± 2%, and 40% ± 5% for patients with early  (CR1) , intermediate  (second or 
subsequent CR) , and advanced disease  (primary induction failure and advan ced 
disease) , respectively. The corresponding probabilities of survival among the 
2,845 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_787299] 68% ± 2%, 56% ± 1%, and 
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 6 of 26 
 43% ± 4%.  Disease 
relapse represent the 
most common cause of 
death post -transplant.   
 
No effec tive treatment 
options exist for patients 
who relapse following 
HCT. Multiple published 
series report less than 
10% survival for these 
patients, regardless of the 
treatment modality used, 
with a median survival of 
2-3 months (2,8). To date, 
the most common  
strategy employed to reduce relapse rates after HCT has usually involved some 
form of immune manipulation, ranging from donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to 
second transplant (9 -12).  However, although it has been consistently shown that 
patients with B -ALL who develop graft -versus -host-disease (GVHD) have less risk 
for relapse (13), DLI has not shown appreciable efficacy in this patient population; 
remission rates have been less than 10%, and have been associated with a high 
incidence of GVHD (14).  Of note , the best responses to DLI in ALL occur when 
the DLI is administered prophylactically to prevent relapse (10); this approach has 
been demonstrated in pediatric patients but no data for prophylactic DLI has been 
reported in adults.  
 
Thus, there is an unmet  need for effective therapy for ALL patients at high risk for 
relapse following allogeneic HCT, with high risk defined as positive MRD and/or 
disease beyond first complete remission.  Blinatumomab has demonstrated 
efficacy in both the MRD setting (15, 16) and for patients with active disease (17). 
Importantly, since its mechanism of action is through immune modulation rather 
than cytotoxicity, it has a favorable risk profile with minimal cytopenias noted in 
patients (18). Furthermore, a recent series of 9 p ediatric patients (19) and our 
personal experience in patients treated with blinatumomab after relapse following 
HCT indicate a low risk for GVHD.  
 
2.2 Blinatumomab  
 
The Bispecific T -cell Engaging (BiTE) antibody blinatumomab represents the first 
agent in a class that redirects host T -cells to cell surface antigen -expressing 
cancer cells. Blinatumomab contains the variable domains of a CD19 antibody and 
a CD3 antibody which are joined by a non -immunogenic linker (20). Upon binding 
to CD19, the cytotoxic T c ells become activated and induce cell death via the pore -
forming perforin system. The drug was initially administered as an intermittent 
infusion two to three times weekly, but lack of activity and serious neurologic 

Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 7 of 26 
 toxicity caused the schedule of adminis tration to be abandoned (20). Based on the 
short half -life of the drug and the mechanism of action, continuous infusion over 
several weeks were investigated. This drastically improved the activity of the drug, 
particularly in ALL, and helped reduce adverse  effects.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1083215] (15). MRD -positivity in ALL almost universally 
heralds systemic relapse and confers poor prognosis. Patients treated in this study 
were in hematologic and morphologic CR, but had persistent or reappearing MRD 
during consolidation chemotherapy. Blinatumomab was given at a dose of 15 
µg/m2/day as a continuous infusion for 28 days every 6 weeks (14 days off) (15).  
After completing one cycle, responding patients could receive up to three 
additional consolidation cycles or proceed to ASCT if a donor is available. MRD 
conversion after one cycle was observed in 16 of 20 evaluable patients (80%). In 
a long -term follow up  update (median observation time 33 months), 12 of the 20 
patients remained in CR. The estimated 3 -year relapse -free survival was 60% (16). 
Nine patients underwent ASCT, but interestingly, non -transplanted patients had 
similar favorable outcome compared to  the transplant group. Most relapses after 
blinatumomab treatment occurred early, within seven months of the start of therapy. 
In a confirmatory open -label multicenter phase II trial in [ADDRESS_1083216] negativity was 80% (78% occurring after one cycle of treatment) (21).   
 
2.4 Blinatumomab in relapsed and refractory ALL  
 
Blinatumomab was subsequently studied in patients with active systemic ALL 
relapse. In a confirmatory open -label, single -arm, multicenter phase II study in 189 
patients with relapsed -refractory disease, b linatumomab was administered as the 
overall response rate was 43% with 80% of the responses occurring within cycle 
1. The median response dur ation and overall survival were 9 and 6 months, 
respectively (Table 1) (17).  
 
In a pediatric phase I/phase II study of blinatumomab in relapsed/refractory ALL 
(defined as second or later bone marrow relapse, any marrow relapse after 
ASCT, or refractory to  other treatments, and had > 25% blasts in bone marrow), 
among the 70 patients  (median age 8 years, range 7 months to 17 years)  who 
received the recommended dosage (15 µg/m2/day for 28 days and 2 weeks 
treatment free per cycle), 27 (39%) achieved CR within the first two cycles, 14 
(52%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. 40 out of 
70 (57.1%) had undergone allogeneic HSCT prior to receiving blinatumom ab, 
and 39 out of 70 (55.7%) had refractory disease. The median number of 
treatment cycles was 1 (range 1 to 5)  (23). 
 
 
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 8 of 26 
 2.5 Blinatumomab toxicity profile  
 
The toxicity profile of blinatumomab has been largely consistent with historical 
studies, with fever,  chills, and hypogammaglobulinemia occurring frequently. 
Tremor, headache, and other mental status changes (e.g., confusion) have been 
reported. Fever, chills, and other constitutional symptoms are thought to be due to 
a cytokine release syndrome that occu rs shortly after the start of therapy and are 
reduced with the use of steroids (e.g. dexamethasone 8 -24 mg daily x 2 -3 days). 
The adverse effects coincided with a rapid rise in activated T -cells after 
blinatumomab initiation, essentially confirming the hyp othesis (22).  Life-
threatening neurologic adverse events were uncommon and generally reversible, 
but seizures have been observed in both the MRD and th e active disease studies. 
Corticosteroids before the first dose and prior to dose escalation ameliorate some 
of the toxicities . 
 
The adverse reactions in pediatric patients treated with blinatumomab were similar 
to those seen in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B -cell precursor ALL. 
Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently in the pediat ric population 
compared to the adult population were pyrexia (80% vs. 61%), hypertension (26% 
vs. 8%), anemia (41% vs. 24%), infusion -related reaction (49% vs. 34%), 
thrombocytopenia (34% vs. 21%), leukopenia (24% vs. 11%), and weight gain 
(17% vs. 6%). In  infants and children < 2 years of age, the incidence of neurologic 
toxicities was not significantly different than for the other age groups, but its 
manifestations were different (agitation, headache, insomnia, somnolence, and 
irritability). In the phase I/II open label blinatumomab study in pediatric patients 
with relapsed / refractory ALL, among the [ADDRESS_1083217] frequent grade 3 adverse events were anemia (36%), thrombocytopenia 
(21%), and hypokalemia (17%). Three patients (4%) and one patient (1%) had 
cytokine -release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3%) 
interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures.  Reports of compassionate use of 
blinatumomab in pediatric patients with relapsed / refractory A LL and prior ASCT 
have shown that blinatumomab did not induce nor exacerbate acute graft versus 
host disease  (24, 25) . 
  
3.0 Drug Information  
 
3.1 Blinatumomab  
 
Each BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) package contains 1 vial BLINCYTO and 1 vial 
IV Solution Stabilizer.  
BLINCYTO is supplied in a single -use vial as a sterile, preservative -free, white to 
off-white lyophilized powder for intravenous administration. Each single -use vial 
of BLINCYTO contains 35 mcg blinatumomab, citric acid monohydrate (3.35 mg), 
lysine hydrochloride (23.23 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.64 mg), trehalose dihydrate 
(95.5 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 7.0. After reconstitution with 3 
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 9 of 26 
 mL of prese rvative -free Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting 
concentration is 12.5 mcg/mL blinatumomab.  
IV Solution Stabilizer is supplied in a single -use vial as a sterile, preservative -
free, colorless to slightly yellow, clear solution. Each single -use vial of IV Solution 
Stabilizer contains citric acid monohydrate (52.5 mg), lysine hydrochloride 
(2283.8 mg), polysorbate 80 (10 mg), sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 7.0, and 
water for injection.  
Since blinatumomab will be administered via continuous intra venous route, it 
needs to be stabilized at low concentrations to prevent absorption to surfaces. 
Therefore, the IV bag must be conditioned by [CONTACT_787306] a product -specific 
diluent (IV solution stabilizer), resulting in a final diluent concentration of 0.5 mM 
citrate, 25 mM lysine hydrochloride and 0.002% (w/v) polysorbate 80.  Sterile 
water for injection and supplies required for reconstitution and injection of 
blinatumomab will not be provided to clinical sites.  
 
Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol 
Preservative:  
Gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_80565]  (central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis and 
irregular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516])  is a serious and potentially fatal adverse reaction in infants 
treated with benzyl alcohol -preserved d rugs. The 7 days bag of BLINCYTO 
solution for infusion with benzyl alcohol is not recommended for use in pediatric 
patients weighing < 22 kg. Consider the combined daily load of benzyl alcohol 
from all sources (including BLINCYTO) when prescribing BLINCYTO  to pediatric 
patients.   
 
3.1.2 Blinatumomab dosage, administration, and schedule  
 
Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIV).  
A single cycle of blinatumomab treatment is [ADDRESS_1083218] will be visited by a well -trained ambulant/home care 
service provider at specific intervals to change the infusion bag. The subject and 
the ambulant/home care provider wi ll be trained and will receive written instructions 
for storage of the IV bags.  
 
In the event of drug interruptions of >4 hours, the restart of the infusion should be 
performed in the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787300] . 
 
In case of any adverse event in the outpatient setting, the ambulant/home care 
provider should directly contact [CONTACT_787307].  
 
3.2 Dexamethasone premedication  
 
Premedication with dexamethasone is intend ed to prevent CRS events associated 
with blinatumomab treatment. Within 1 hour before the start of treatment in each 
treatment cycle, mandatory premedication with dexamethasone at 20 mg  IV if ≥ 45 
Kg (or 5 mg/m2 to a maximum of 20 mg if < 45 Kg) IV is required for the prevention 
of CRS resulting from blinatumomab (Table 1).  
 
3.3. Dose modifications (interruptions, withholdings, and criteria for restarting 
treatment) (Tables 1 and 2) . 
 
3.3.1 Infusion interruption/dose modification due to adverse events  
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade [ADDRESS_1083219] possibly related to blinatumomab will require permanent 
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 11 of 26 
 discontinuation of blinatumomab. For CTCAE grade 4 adverse e vents that are 
numerically defined laboratory parameters, independent investigator assessment 
should be used to determine the risk: benefit  for each individual patient to continue 
or discontinue blinatumomab treatment.  
 
For CTCAE grade 3, cytokine release syndrome, and CTCAE grade 3 
DIC/coagulopathy , treatment with blinatumomab will be interrupted until the event 
resolves to at least grade 1. Blinatumomab can then be restarted at the lowest 
starting dose (9 μg/d ay if ≥ 45 Kg or  5 µg/m2/day if < 45 Kg ). If the AE lasts for ≥ 2 
weeks, then blinatumomab will be permanently discontinued.  
 
For all other CTCAE grade 3 events and clinically significant laboratory value 
changes, investigator assessment should be used to determine the risk: benefit  to 
continue blinat umomab therapy with or without dose reduction or discontinue 
therapy.  
 
Patients who have been dose reduced will have an option to receive the higher 
dose level once the AE has resolved to grade [ADDRESS_1083220] 7 days. Re -start 
of the infusion should  be performed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Before blinatumomab is re -
started, premedication with dexamethasone 20 mg  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 5 mg/m2 if < 45 
Kg) IV is required. The patient should be observed over night for possible side 
effects after the restart in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
 
In addition to the events described above, the dose may be temporarily or 
permanently reduced to 9 μg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 5 μg/m2/day if < 45 Kg)  if, by 
[CONTACT_1697]´s judgment, it is necessary for safety reasons. After  at least 7 days of 
dosing at 9  μg/day  if ≥45 Kg  (or 5 μg/m2/day if < 45 Kg) , the dose may be increased 
to 28 μg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 15  μg/m2/day if < 45 Kg)  or treatment may be continued 
at the dose of 9 μg/day after consultation with the investigator.  
 
If the interruption after an adverse event is no longer than [ADDRESS_1083221] to be repeated (eg, 
if cycle 1 was interrupted on day 8 for more than 7 days, the next cycle will be 
denoted as cycle 1.1  and the same assessments will be performed as in cycle 1). 
For cycle 1.1, subjects will be started at 9 μg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 5 μg/m2/day if < 45 
Kg) for the first 7 days of dosing followed by a dose step to 28 μg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  
(or 15 μg/m2/day if < 45 K g) beginning at day 8 and continuing for the remainder 
of cycle 1.  
 
An infusion interruption of more than 2 weeks due to an adverse event related to  
blinatumomab will lead to permanent discontinuation of treatment. In case of 
logistical difficulties, restart of treatment can be postponed for up to 5 additional 
days without resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation.  
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 12 of 26 
  
Treatment may be also interru pted or permanently discontinued at the discretion 
of the investigator if any clinical/laboratory adverse event is considered to be 
medically relevant.  
 
In case of signs of cytokine release, dexamethasone should be administered orally 
or IV at a dose of at  maximum 3 x 8 mg/day  for subjects ≥ 45 Kg  (or 0.2 -0.4 
mg/kg/day divided 3 -4 times per day not to exceed 24 mg/day  for subjects < 45 
Kg) for up to 3 days. The dose can then be reduced step -wise over 4 days.  
 
3.3.2 Infusion interruption/dose modification d ue to CNS events  
In case of CNS -related adverse events, dexamethasone should be administered 
at a dose of at least 24 mg/day  for subjects ≥ 45 Kg  (or 0.2 -0.4 mg/kg/day divided 
3-4 times per day not to exceed 24 mg/day  for subjects < 45 Kg ). The 
dexamethaso ne dose will then be reduced step -wise over 4 days.  
 
In case of CTCAE grade 3 or higher CNS -related adverse events, blinatumomab 
will be stopped immediately and a physical exam, vital signs and safety laboratory 
tests will be performed. Additional measures  can be taken upon discretion of the 
investigator, depending on the nature of the adverse event. Diagnostic measures 
to exclude potential infectious causes should be conducted after CNS events ≥ 
CTCAE grade 3; an assessment of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_787301], cell count, B - and T -cell measurement (flow cytometry at local lab), and 
viral studies (HSV 1/2, HSV6, JC virus and adenovirus) , and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI).  
 
Patients, who had experienced a Grade [ADDRESS_1083222] two days.  
 
Following dexamethasone premedication, a new treatment cycle will start with a 
dose of 9 μg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 5 µg/m2/day if < 45 Kg ). Blinatumomab will  be 
escalated to 28 mcg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 15 µg/m2/day if < 45 Kg ) after 7 days if the 
toxicity does not recur. If the toxicity occurs  at 9 mcg/day  if ≥ 45 Kg  (or 5 µg/m2/day 
if < 45 Kg )., or if the toxicity takes more than 7 days to resolve, blinatumomab 
therapy will be stopped permanently.  
 
If the CNS event was a seizure (CTCAE grade 2 or above), appropriate 
prophylactic anticonvulsant treatment will be administered during the next 
treatment cycle.  
 
Version 9.0 22 October  2020  Page 13 of 26 
 A grade 3 CNS event leading to treatment interruption at the dose of 9 μg/day  if ≥ 
45 Kg  (or 5 µg/m2/day if < 45 Kg ) or a CNS event needing more than 1 week to 
resolve to grade ≤ [ADDRESS_1083223] to be stopped 
immediately and treatment will  be permanently discontinued.  For patients who 
discontinue treatment because of a CNS e vent ≥ Grade 3 an MRI is 
recommended.  For patients in the additional evaluation cohort, an MRI is 
required after CNS  event grade 3 or higher, regardless of continuation of 
treatment with blinatumomab.

 5.0 Treatment Plan  
 
5.1 This is an open -label, single -arm, phase II clinical study.  
 
5.2 All patients will be registered through Core . All of the enrolled subjects’ 
concomitant medications will be collected and readily available in the MDACC 
electronic medical record and will not be entered into the CRF.  
 
5.3 Patients will receive blinatumomab as continuous intravenous infusion over 4 
weeks . 
 
Since this study includes children and adults, dosing will be weight  and BSA -
based as per FDA approved dosing guidelines:  
 
For patients >/= 45 kg , the dose is  28 mcg/day administered as a cont inuous 
infusion on days 1 -28 of each cycle.  
 
For patients < 45 kg  the dose is 15 mcg/m2/day (maximum 28 mcg/day) 
administered as a cont inuous infusion on days [ADDRESS_1083227], and then at  6 (+/- 2 weeks), 9 (+/ - 2 
weeks), and 12 (+/ - 2 weeks) months following HCT (day of hematopoietic 
progenitor cell infusion).  This schedule was selected to allow for treatment with 
blinatumomab during the one year following transplant when patients are at risk 
for relapse while the GVL effect is maturing and becoming robust.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1083228] is not permitted.  
 
5.6 Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use for patients with Ph+ ALL will be left to the 
investigator’s discretion.

Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Expanded Common Toxicity 
Criteria , version 4 .  
 
 
7.0 Criteria for Removal from the Study  
 
7.1 Completion of study at 1 year.  
 
7.2 Non -compliance by [CONTACT_787311] . 
 
7.3 Occurrence of CTCAE grade 4 adverse event probably or definitely related to 
blinatumomab . 
 
7.4 An infusion interruption of more than 2 weeks due to an advers e event 
related to blinatumomab.  
 
7.5 Occurrence of a CNS -related adver se event probably or definitely related to 
blinatumomab, and meeting one or more of the following criteria:  
• More than 1 seizure  
• A CNS -related CTCAE Grade 4 adverse event  
• A CNS -related adverse event leading to treatment interruption that 
requires more than one week to resolve to CTCAE Grade ≤ 1  
• A CTCAE Grade 3 CNS -related adverse event leading to treatment 
interruption that occurred at a dose of 9μg/day  
 
 
 
Version 9.[ADDRESS_1083233] to the date of event.  The cumulative 
incidence (CI) of GVHD will be determined using the competing risks meth od.  The 
competing risks included will be relapse and death, and patients who do not 
experience GVHD or relapse and are still alive at the last follow -up date will be 
censored  at that date .   
 
8.3  Secondary Objectives  
 
8.3.1  Progression -free and Overall Survival  
 
Progression -free Survival ( PFS) will be defined from date of allogeneic HCT to the 
date of disease progression or death.  Patients who are still alive at last follow -up 
date without disease progression will be censored  at that date .  OS will be define d 
from date of allogeneic HCT to date of last known vital sign .  Patients who are still 
alive at the last follow -up visit will be censored.  A contemporary cohort of patients 
with ALL being transplanted in first complete remission will be identified 
prospectively. PFS and OS will be e stimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and 
differences between the patients receiving blinatumomab and the contemporary 
cohort  will be determined using the log -rank test.  Patient outcomes in the 
contemporary cohort will b e stratified by [CONTACT_787312] . 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1083234] negative at the end of the study will be summarized using 
frequency and percentage.  
 
8.3.3  Non -relapse Mortality  
 
Non-relapse mortality (NRM) will be computed from date of allogeneic HCT to last 
known vital sign.  The CI of NRM will be determined using the competing risks 
Version 9.[ADDRESS_1083235] cohort of five patients.   Assuming a prior beta distribution 
of (0.6, 1.4), the study will terminate if the Pr  (δt > 0.30 | data) > 0.85, where δt is 
the toxicity rate attributable to the treatment.   Toxicities are defined as any 1) grade 
3-4 acute GVHD greater than 30% , 2) secondary graft fa ilure >30% , or 3) NRM 
within one cycle of blinatumomab (i.e., 30 days).   The decision rule for terminating 
for toxicity is presented in Table 5 and the operating characteristics for this rule are 
presented in Table 6.  The method used to produce the decisi on rule and operating 
characteristics was designed by [CONTACT_203320], Simon, and Estey (1995).

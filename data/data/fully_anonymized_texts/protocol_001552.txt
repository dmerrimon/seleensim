CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007G-CL201 Amendment 1 
04 October 2013  
 
 
The Original Protocol version of Protocol UX007G- CL201 (dat ed [ADDRESS_1068149] 2013) has been 
modified by [CONTACT_11827] 1 to incorporate a number of changes based on additional 
information acquired since the beginning of the study, feedback from clinical investigators involved in the study, and review by [CONTACT_777769] ( US 
FDA) .  The major changes to the protocol are summarized below; additional minor changes 
have also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary. 
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated contact [CONTACT_777770]:  Emil Kakkis , MD PhD,  Chief Executive Officer, Ultragenyx.   
2. Study Sites .  The number of study sites has increased from [ADDRESS_1068150] been made to 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1) and Study Procedures and Assessments 
(Section  7.5): 
• The visit to the site previously indicated at Week 2 will now be conducted by 
[CONTACT_756].  The Week 4 visit (originally a telephone visit) will now be conducted 
at the clinic and include clinical assessments of secondary efficacy variables (i.e. 
CANTAB, 6MW T, and GMFM -88). 
• In lieu of the Borg Scale referenced in the ATS guideline, the Borg Rating of 
Perceived Exertion (RPE) will be used to assess PED occurring during the test. 
• The 24-hour EEG has been changed to an overnight EEG.   
• At Week 26, a Population PK assessment has been added which requires a total of 3 blood samples (pre-dose for all subjects and [ADDRESS_1068151]-dose).   
• Table 2.[ADDRESS_1068152] the sample for the Erythrocyte Glucose 
Uptake Assay (i.e. once during Week 26, 39, or 52 Visits). 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 1 – [ADDRESS_1068153] 2013  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 3 of 83 
• The requirement to complete a 3 -day diet diary following dose adjustment was 
removed. 
Rationale :  During the 8- week placebo -controlled T reatment Period, visits to the 
clinic will now be conducted at 4- week intervals.  A telephone assessment of seizure 
incidence and safety/tolerability will take place at the end of the [ADDRESS_1068154].  A minimum of 12 hours EEG monitoring is believed to provide sufficient data to assess the frequency of EEG seizures and interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_777745].  
The changes to PK and Bioassays are consistent with the study objectives and provide 
for a population PK assessment (as requested by [CONTACT_1622]) in addition to peak PK and 
metabolites.  Modifying the range of visits for the Erythrocyte Glucose Uptak e Assay 
provides greater flexibility and opportunity to obtain the sample in conjunction with other blood draws, thereby [CONTACT_777771]. 
A 3-day diet diary is used solely for the purposes of establishing caloric intake, and 
not necessary following dose adjustment during the Titration Period. 
5. Primary Efficacy Hypothesis .  The primary efficacy hypothesis as stated in Section 
5.5 has been modified as follows: 
“The primary efficacy hypothesis for the study is that UX007 is superior to more 
effective than  placebo for the treatment reduction  of seizures in patients with Glut1 
DS…”  
Rationale :  The revised language provides a more accurate description of the 
statistical methodology planned for the study. 
6. Study Objectives , Efficacy Measures  and Endpoints.  There is no change to the 
primary efficacy measure; the primary objective language has been modified as 
follows: 
“Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo between Weeks 2 and 8 of 
treatment as measured by [CONTACT_777772]- onset seizures” 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 1 – [ADDRESS_1068155] 2013

Secondary and exploratory objectives and associated efficacy measures /endpoints of 
the study have been modified as outlined below:

Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 1 – [ADDRESS_1068156] 2013  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 5 of 83 
Rationale :  Upon further consideration of pre-specified endpoints and the potential 
implications for statistical analysis and interpretation of the data, the primary 
objective language has been modified, and a number of secondary endpoints have now been designated as exploratory endpoints. The secondary endpoints are focused 
on independent domains of disease: 1) motor dysfunction, 2) cognitive dysfunction, and 3) absence and unrecognized seizure activity by [CONTACT_777773].  We will also assess the fraction of patients achieving a clinically large response of 50% reduction in seizures.  The secondary objectives and associated efficacy endpoints will now focus 
on the following: 
• Seizure response rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with at least 50% 
reduction from baseli ne in generalized or partial -onset seizures  
• Change from baseline in frequency of seizure activity as measured by [CONTACT_66954] (EEG) abnormalities  
• Change from baseline in cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)  
• Change from baseline in distance walked as measured by 6MWT  
• Time to onset of paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia (PED) as measured during 6MWT.  
• Change from baseline in gross motor function using the Gross Motor Function 
Measure -88 (GMFM-88)  
 
7. Inclusion Criteria .  The inclusion criteria ha ve been modified as follows: 
1) “Confirmed diagnosis of Glut1 DS Diagnosis of Glut1 DS confirmed by [CONTACT_103095]2A1 
mutation” 
7)  “Not on, or not fully  compliant with a prescribed diet plan (e.g. ketogenic diet) 
comprised of at least 50% total daily caloric intake from fat during previous 60 days (confirmed by 3-day diet diary at Screening), or at any time during the course of the trial” 
Rationale.  The change to inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1068157] be completed prior to study entry; Ultragenyx 
will not collect additional blood samples for SLC2A1 mutation anal ysis as previously 
indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Medical History.  The change to inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1068158]’s level of compliance with a prescribed diet plan. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 1 – [ADDRESS_1068159] 2013  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 6 of 83 
8. Treatment Administration .   
A recommended dose titration schedule has been inserted ( Table 7.4.1).  In addition, 
dose administration guidelines have been modified as follows: 
“Treatment will be mixed with food and administered PO with food or by 
[CONTACT_777774] (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before 
bed).  The dose should be divided into smaller more frequent doses with food as needed.  The dose should always  be mixed with small amounts of food or drink as 
indicated in the administration guideline, and never administered as the oil directly.” 
Rationale :  The original protocol specified initiation of dosing using a 2- week fixed 
titration schedule until the subject has reached a target of 35% of total daily calories by [CONTACT_777775].  The table provides recommended guidelines for the titration, while providing for some degree of discretion by [CONTACT_777776].  
By [CONTACT_777777], and assuring the oil is never directly administered will provide more consistent dosing 
across the study population and reduce the potential risk of GI- associated adverse 
reactions.  
9. Drug Concentration Measurements.  As described in Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_1068160] irrespective of the study adaptation decision. 
Rationale : The additional population PK assessment will further characterize the PK 
properties of UX007 at steady- state, including trough levels, following [ADDRESS_1068161] 
by [CONTACT_777778] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Rationale : The addition of the serum pregnancy test option provides flexibility for the 
site and the subject, as both methods will provide an accurate assessment of 
pregnancy status. 
11. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Assessments.  The Ask Suicide Screening Questions 
(ASQ) has been replaced by [CONTACT_777779] (C -CASA) to assess suicidal ideation and behavior in this study.  
The timing and age range for the assessment remain as specified in the original 
protocol. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 1 – [ADDRESS_1068162] 2013  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 7 of 83 
Rationale :  The Columbia algorithm has been used to classify suicidal adverse events 
in an antidepressant safety analysis by [CONTACT_55257].  The US FDA has recommended 
the use of the C- CASA as a standardized suicidal rating system for anticonvulsant 
trials and other cent rally acting a gents and nonpsychotropic drugs. 
12. Statistical Methods .  Populations for data analyses have been defined ( Section 7.6.2 ).  
The description of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis has been generalized to 
state an appropriate rank -based analysis will be applied, instead of pre- specifying the 
2-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum test ( Section 7.6.3).  The secondary efficacy analyses 
will compare the secondary efficacy variables scores after treatment to before treatment between the treated and placebo groups ( Section 7.6.4).  An alpha-
spending function will be used to adjust the type- I error significance level for the 
interim and final analysis ( Section 7.6.6).  The sample size assumptions for  the 
maximum of  [ADDRESS_1068163] been provided in Section 7.6.8.  
Rationale : While full- details of planned statistical analyses will be presented in a 
formal Statistical Analysis Plan, the revise d information provides transparency as 
pre-specified changes from the original protocol.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007G-CL201 Amendment 2 
20 May  2014 
 
 
The amended  version of Protocol UX007G-CL201 (Amendment 1, dated 0 4 October  2013) 
has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 2 to incorporate a number of changes based on additional 
information acquired since the beginning of the study, feedback from clinical investigators involved in the study, and review by [CONTACT_6628] .  The major changes to the protocol 
are summarized below; additional minor changes have also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary.  
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated Medical Monitor contact 
[CONTACT_3031] ( Section 8.5.6) have been updated to: 
Javier San Martin, MD, Vic e President, Clinical Development , Ultragenyx. 
2. Number of Subjects Planned.  Section 7.8.[ADDRESS_1068164] been met, the total number of subjects has been changed from 
80 - 140 to now be 40-100 subjects.   If the interim analysis  criteria are not met, 
the study will continue as a Phase 2 study until ~[ADDRESS_1068165] been enrolled.  The previous protocol stated subjects may be replaced after receiving study drug and 
prior to Week 8.  This has been amended such that subjects who wi thdraw or are 
removed from the study prior to randomization may be replaced on a case- by-case 
basis, at the discretion of Ultragenyx (Section 7.3.3).  
Rationale :  As described in Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_1068166] a 50% between -group difference in seizure rate per 4 weeks with 
power of 80% and population standard deviation of 55% using Wilcoxon’s rank sum test.  
3. Primary Efficacy Hypothesis .  Section  5.5 has been modified as follows to clarify 
specific seizure types to be investigated as part of the primary efficacy hypothesis.  
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 2 – 20 May 2014

UX007 is more effectiv e than placebo for the reduction of seizures in patients with 
Glut1 DS, as measured by [CONTACT_777780]- onse t seizures, including: Generalized Tonic -Clonic, Generalized Tonic, 
Generalized Clonic, Generaliz ed Atonic, Partial/Focal with Secondary 
Generalization, Myoclonic, Myoclonic Atonic, Myoclonic Tonic, Complex 
Partial/Focal, and Simple Partial/Focal Motor seizures, between Weeks [ADDRESS_1068167] been modified or added to Section 6  
to align study objectives with modifications to study design and endpoints: 
Modified Primary Objectives: 
• Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo, between Weeks 2 and 
8 of treatment, as measured by [CONTACT_777781]- onset seizures  
Modified Secondary, Exploratory, and Optional Exploratory Objectives:  
The periods during which the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo will be 
evaluated have been modified from “change from baseline” to specify either 
change from Randomization or the Baseline Period  
Additional Secondary Objectives: 
• Evaluate long term efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_777782]- onset seizures over time through week 52  
• Evaluate the optimal dose to control seizures and impact on other clinical 
manifestations during the Dose Exploration Period  
Additional Exploratory Objective: 
• Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo, between Weeks 2 and 8 of treatment, as measured by [CONTACT_777783] 
5. Overall Study Design and Plan .  Section 7.1
 has been modified to include a Dose 
Exploration Period which will be conducted in a subset of approximately 40 subjects.  
The remaining subjects enrolled will continue with the optimal dose achieved during 
the previous 26 weeks. The study schematic ( Figure  7.1.1) has been modified to 
reflect the design change.  Specific rationale for the selection of 20 and 40% dose  
levels is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The Dose Exploration Period is described as follows: 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 2 – [ADDRESS_1068168] of UX007 dose level on 
seizure control, other clinical manifestations  such as movement disorders and 
cognitive deficits , and tolerability. For subjects participating in the Dose Exploration 
Period, the dose will be titrated over 1 week down to 20% of total daily caloric 
intake.  After 4 weeks at the 20% dose level, the subject will be evaluated for safety and efficacy measures of seizure control, motor and cognitive function. 
If there are breakthrough seizures during the down titration period, as defined by [CONTACT_777784] 1 seizure in a 4 week period [ except absence ], relative to the 
previous [ADDRESS_1068169] may begin the up-titration phase early. 
After 4 weeks at the 20% dose level, the UX007 dose will then be titrated up over 
1 week to 40% of total daily caloric intake and maintained at that level for [ADDRESS_1068170] cannot tolerate titrating up to the 40% dose level, the dose should be 
titrated to the maximum tolerated dose as determined by [CONTACT_737].  After 4 weeks at the 40% (or maximum tolerated) dose level, the subject will be evaluated for 
safety , and efficacy measures of seizure control, motor and cognitive function. 
At the end of the Dose Exploration Period, the subject will continue in the open-label 
Extension period, and maintained on the UX007 dose (as determined by [CONTACT_3786]) that provided the maximum improvement in clinical status with acceptable tolerability, and continued on this dose for the duration of the study. 
If marked improvements in clinical status were not observed at a higher dose level 
and/or tolerability was unacceptable, the subjec t will return to the UX007 dose level  
where maximal benefit  was achieved as defined by [CONTACT_777785] s 
in motor and/or cognitive symptoms .  As determined by [CONTACT_737], this may be 
the pre-titration UX007 dose from Week 26 or the 20% dose given during the down 
titration phase. 
Rationale (also provided in Section 7.2
):  A dose exploration evaluation in 
approximately  [ADDRESS_1068171] 
(with  an exit clause that would allow the subject to more  quickly move to the up 
titration phase if there is a marked change in clinical status  during the down titration 
phase), and a return to control afterward would demonstrate both that a higher dose was necessary and that UX007 had a sustained effect.  
6. Inclus ion Criteria:  Section 7.3.1  has been modified as follows: 
2)  Males and females, aged 3 - 17  1 – 35 years (inclusive) at the time of informed 
consent 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 2 – 20 May 2014  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 5 of 93 
3) Average of at least 5 4 observable seizures (generalized [except absence ] or 
partial-onset [simple partial motor, complex partial, or secondarily generalized] 
seizures) per month in [ADDRESS_1068172] or 
caregiver report  
4) At least 4 observable seizures (generalized [except absence] or partial-onset 
[simple partial motor, complex partial, or secondarily generalized] seizures) per 
month in 4 weeks  during the Baseline Period, with no 3- week seizure- free period 
during the Baseline Period 
7) Not on, or not fully compliant with a prescribed diet plan (e.g. ketogenic diet) 
comprised of at least 60%  50% total daily caloric intake from fat during previous 
60 14 days (confirmed by 3-day diet diary at Screening), or at any time during the 
course of the trial) 
12) Females who have reached menarche of child bearing potential  must have a 
negative pregnancy test at Screening, be willing to use acceptable method of contraception and have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females 
considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not reach ed 
menarche, had total hysterectomy, have been in menopause for at least two 
years, or have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening.  
Rationale :  The U nited States  Food and D rug Administration (FDA)  has 
recommended expanding recruitment to include patients younger than 3 years.  
Clinical experience with triheptanoin and nonclinical data with UX007 support dosing of children as young as 6 months of age.  A GLP 3 -month interim toxicology 
study in juvenile Yucatan Mini-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_777746] 9 month chronic toxicity study to allow dosing in younger age groups, has been completed; interim results have been inserted in Section 
5.2.2. 
The patient population was further expanded to also include adult subjects up to [ADDRESS_1068173] a similar phenotype of breakthrough seizures into their thirties, significant movement disorders (estimated at 90% by [CONTACT_777786]), and ha ve a more 
difficult time maintaining the ketogenic diet. The expanded age range of the 
population will strengthen the ability to evaluate a possible impact on seizures and movement disorders. 
Modifications to inclusion criteria #3 and 4 provide alignment w ith study endpoints 
used to capture seizure frequency. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 2 – 20 May 2014  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 6 of 93 
Based on feedback from investigators and experts  in the field , inclusion criterion 
#7 was modified to increase the percent of calories from fat to 60% in a prescribed 
diet.  The change aligns with standard practices.  In addition, these i nvestigators and 
experts in the field  noted the potential for carryover effects from ketogenic or other 
high-fat prescribed diets are minimal, and a 7-14 day washout period would be more 
than adequate for patients who wish to discontinue or are non -compliant with current 
diet plans.  The refore, the  duration required to demonstrate non-compliance (or no 
treatment) with a prescribed diet plan has been reduced to [ADDRESS_1068174] would be without adequate dietary control of their condition, and thereby [CONTACT_777787].  In addition, guidance was added to Section [IP_ADDRESS] that subjects should be below 25% dietary fat 
(not including the oil) on the day of randomization and throughout the trial.  The rationale is that if patients are on a diet with >25% dietary fat, then they could 
possibly become ketotic with the addition of placebo  oil at 35% of caloric intake. 
Modifications to inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1068175] 
during the double-blind Treatment Period, 1000 mL UX007 and placebo will be provided in 1 L round amber-colored glass bottles. During the open- label Extension 
Period  of the study, UX007 will be dispensed in 1 L round, translucent high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles  (Section 
7.4.1).  A provision to allow mixing of 
UX007  (or placebo) with formula has been included given the revised age range of 
the study population. 
8. Prohibited Medications .  Barbituates and prescribed high- fat diets (e.g. ketogenic 
diet) have been added to the list of medications prohibited throughout the study 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Rationale : Barbituates may inhibit the Glut1 transporter, thereby [CONTACT_777788].   As required for study inclusion, 
the subject must not be on, or compliant with a prescribed high-fat diet plan, and should not participate in such a plan throughout the course of the study. 
9. Study Procedures and Assessments . The following modifications have been made to 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1) and Study Procedures and Assessments 
(Section  7.5):  
• Subjects participating in the Dose Exploration Period will return for 2 additional visits to assess efficacy,  pharmacokinetic/ metabolites , and safety following 
1 week titration and 4- weeks treatment at each dose level (i.e. Weeks 31 and 36 , 
within a 3  day visit window ). 
• The visit previously scheduled at Week 39 has been changed to Week 44. 
• Peabody Pi[INVESTIGATOR_777747].  
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 2 – 20 May 2014  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 7 of 93 
Rationale :  Several components of efficacy and safety will be measured before and 
after each titration during the Dose Exploration Period to assess change in efficacy, 
safety and tolerability.  These will include change in seizure frequency, cognition 
(i.e. CANTAB , PPVT ), motor function (i.e. 6MWT, GMFM-88), EEG  abnormalities  
(Week 31 only), levels of triheptanoin metabolites, AE rate, and changes in 
assessment s of how the subject is doing (i.e. PEDI -CAT, CGI) .  Given the 
[ADDRESS_1068176] been made to Section 7.5: 
• The description of the primary efficacy measure (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been 
modified to clarify seizure types defined and recorded in the study diary.   
• The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) has been removed as an assessment 
during the 6- minute walk test (6MWT).   
• The severity of paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia (PED) will be assessed by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541], not the subject as previously indicated. 
• The frequency of absence (and other) seizures as captured in the study diary has 
been defined as an exploratory  measure (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• The Short-Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey for adults will be administered to adult subjects as an exploratory measure.   
Rationale :  The listing of specific seizure types provides alignment with the study 
diary.  Following review of the study protocol, the US FDA requested the daily diary 
be used in addition to electroencephalography to document absence and myoclonic seizures.    
The Borg RPE scale was removed as it is not possible to capture perceived exertion in the middle of the 6MWT.  In addition the scale is difficult for children to comprehend and many subjects have cognitive impairment.  The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777748], as such PED severity will not be assessed by [CONTACT_423].  
Since the age range of the popu lation has expanded to include young children and 
adults, age-appropriate modifications have been made to the secondary and exploratory efficacy measures.  The SF -12 was included to assess functional health 
and well -being in adult subjects (as a parallel assessment to the SF -10 in children). 
11. Drug Concentration Measurements.  Based on feedback received from the FDA, 
Section 7.5.3 has been modified to specify the trough (pre-dose) population 
PK sample will be obtained within 15 minutes of dosing.  Additional PK samples 
will also be obtained should potentially related serious adverse events occur, if feasible.

12. Pregnancy Testing.  The language in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  has been modified to specify 
unknown risks and detail acceptable methods of contraception, including abstinence, 
for females and males of childbearing potential.  
13. Suicidal Ideation & Behavior Assessments.  Section [IP_ADDRESS]  has been corrected to 
describe the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) as the instrument 
used to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior. 
14. Statistical Analysis & Determination of Sample Size .  Section 7.[ADDRESS_1068177] been further defined. 
The FDA also requested a secondary analysis for the potential of tachyphylaxis  
(i.e., long term efficacy) .

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007G-CL201 Amendment 3 
09 Dec 2014 
 
 The amended  version of Protocol UX007G-CL201 (Amendment 2, dated 20 May 2014 ) has 
been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 3 to incorporate a number of changes based on additional information acquired since the beginning of the study, from feedback provided by [CONTACT_777789], and review by [CONTACT_6628] .  The major changes to 
the protocol are summarized below; additional minor changes have also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary. 
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medica l Officer and associated Medical Monitor contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (Section 8.5.6) have been updated to: 
Sunil Agarwal , MD, Chief Medical Officer . 
2. The adaptive study design component of the protocol was eliminated. This change 
was carried throughout the protocol and the title of the study was updated to reflect 
this change.   
Rationale :  An interim analysis to adapt this study design is no longer planned. The 
plan is to look at the totality of the data from this Phase 2 study to determine what 
additional studies will be needed to better characterize the safety and efficacy of UX007 in patients with G lut1 DS. 
3. Inclusion criteria 3 and 4 were updated to include subjects with treatment- resistant 
absence seizures . This change was also updated in multiple sections of the protocol; 
the term absence seizure includes both typi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_32539] .  
Rationale : The inclusion crite ria are being updated to also include subject s that have 
only absence seizures (based on medical history and Screening EEG). This change is 
secondary to recently published data by [CONTACT_777790]., which demonstrated clinical activity of triheptanoin in patients with Glut1 DS with absence seizures. In this study 
patients receiving  triheptanoin demonstrated a reduction in their rate of absence 
seizures and improvements in their  neuropsychological performance ( Pascual et al. 
2014). 
 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 3 – 09 Dec 2014   
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 3 of 83 
4. Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1068178] 24 weeks; originally set at 4, this amendment reduces the observable 
seizures to 2 . 
Rationale: This will allow potentially for the inclusion of more subject s into the study 
without compromising the ability to detect a signal with UX007, assuming UX007 meaningfully reduces seizure activity.  
5. Inclusion criterion #9 was removed ; subjects no longer are required to be naïve to 
UX007. 
Rationale: Taking into account the short-lived pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamics profile of UX007, there sh ould be no residual effect of UX007 if 
subjects have not been exposed in the past 30 days prior to screening. Additionally, 
taking into account the Screening  period, the time off of drug would be even longer 
than 30 days.   
6. Inclusion criterion #6 was updated to clarify that “up to” 3 concomitant AEDs are 
allowed for inclusion into the study. 
  Rationale: This change was made for clarification. 
7. The primary and secondary objectives of the study w ere updated  (refer to the 
synopsis and Section 6). Similarly, the criteria for evaluation  (synopsis and Section 
7.5) and the primary and secondary endpoints (Section 7.6) w ere updated to reflect 
the changes to the objectives  to include a more robust evaluation of triheptanoin in 
patients with absence seizures .   
Rationale: This change was made for clarification  since we are now including 
patients who can qualify based on absence seizures only. This change was made secondary to the recent publication by [CONTACT_777790]. as referenced earlier.   
8. The randomization was changed from 1:1 to 3:1 (UX007: placebo).  
Rationale: This change was based on discussions with caregivers  of patients with 
Glut1 DS. The caregivers have stated that in a disease for which seizures are a 
primary manifestation, a 50% chance of receiving placebo has not been acceptable to the majority of potential patients and their families . Also, appreciating that this is a 
Phase [ADDRESS_1068179] s who receive UX007  during 
the study, the sponsor believes this change is clinically appropriate.  
  
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 3 – 09 Dec 2014   
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 4 of 83 
9. An EEG assessment was added at the Screening Visit.  
Rationale: The decision to add an EEG assessment at the Screening  Visit is to 
confirm the diagnosis of absence seizures for patients who potentially qualify for the 
study based on a history of absence seizures. EEG is well recognized as the most reliable method to capture absence seizures, whereas for other seizure types a patient history is considered clinically acceptable.  
10. Study drug accountability in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1068180] or for shipment by [CONTACT_977] . 
Rationale: This text w as clarified to ensure a clear process for chain of custody of 
study drug. 
11. Selection of Study Population in Section 7.3 was updated to clarify that enrollment 
may include subjects from neighboring countries within the European Union, Canada, 
and South America.  
Rationale: There are limited investigative sites participating in this study and 
because Glut1 DS is a rare disease,  there may be subjects from neighboring countries 
who may be considered for study participation. 
12. Exclusion criterion #5 was changed to read “pregnant and/or breastfeeding an  infant 
at Screening ” from “breastfeeding an infant at Screening. ” 
Rationale: This change was made for clarification that both pregnant and 
breastfeeding subjects will be excluded from participation in the study.    
13. Section 7.3.3 (Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment) was updated to 
clarify the conditions under which subjects either will be removed or may be removed 
from study participation.  
Rationale: It was important to clarify that subjects will be removed when an 
unacceptable AE occurs or if an illness occurs that (in the judgment of the investigator 
or Ultragenyx) might invalidate the study or place the subject at risk . Alternatively, 
subjects may be removed if requested  (by [CONTACT_1130], investigator, or Ultragenyx) for 
administrative /other reasons or if the subject has a protocol deviation or exhibits 
unreliable behavior.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX007G-CL201 Amendment 4 
30 Nov 2015 
 
The amended  version of Protocol UX007G-CL201 (Amendment 3, dated 09 December  2014) 
has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 4 to incorporate a number of changes based on additional information acquired since the beginning of the study, and from feedback provided by 
[CONTACT_777791].  The major changes 
to the protocol are summarized below; additional minor changes have also been made for consistency and clarity but are not included in this summary. 
1. Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer and associated Medical Monitor contact  
[CONTACT_3031] (Section 8.5.5) have been updated to Melanie Brandabur, MD, Medical 
Director . In addition, the safety contact [CONTACT_35659] 8.5.5 has been 
updated. 
2. Edited Inclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_1068181] 1  year of age are eligible 
for participation in this study. There is no longer an age limit of 35 years in the study. This change affected the synopsis and Section 7.3.1 of the protocol.  
Rationale: This change was made to allow inclusion of subjects regardless of age. 
3. Edited Inclusion Criterion #7 by [CONTACT_777792].  
Rationale: This change was made for clarity. 
4. Updated Exclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_1068182] serum alanine  
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceeding 3X (previously 2X) the upper limit of normal at Screening.  
Rationale: This change was made to be more consistent with agency guidelines for 
industry regarding drug-induced liver injury. USDHHS FDA, CDER, CBER, 2009.  
5. Updated Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the protocol to remove valproate as a prohibited medication  and include pancreatic lipase inhibitors in the list of excluded 
medications . A li st of these medications was added to Exclusion Criterion 6. 
Rationale:   After a review of the literature on valproate, triheptanoin, and Glut1 DS, 
it did not appear that the addition of triheptanoin to valproate posed significant risk to those patients, due to the low concentrations of VPA in brain tissue; therefore, the Sponsor is allowing subjects sta ble on valproate into the study (
Adkison et al. 1995) . 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201  
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068183] shown that pancreatic lipases hydrolyze triheptanoin 
into free fatty acids and glycerol; therefore inhibitors of pancreatic lipases (e.g., orlistat) should be avoided while taking UX007. 
6. Updated Section 8.5.1 (De finition of Adverse Events) with the following text: “Note  
that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g., for elective surgeries) are not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.” 
Rationale : Updated for clarification of the SAE definition. 
7. Updated Section 8.5.4  (Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx) 
Rationale : Updated to match the current Ultragenyx template.  
8. Primary objective changed to ‘Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo 
as measured by [CONTACT_777793] 8 in frequency of seizures’. This change affects multiple sections  of the protocol related to statistical evaluations 
and analyses.   
Rationale: To correctly reflect that the primary endpoint is to measure change in 
seizure frequency for all seizure types, including absence seizures, as was the intent with the previous amendment. 
9. The text “at select sites” is now used consistently for the Pediatric Evaluation of  
Disability Inventory – Computer Adapti ve Test ( PEDI -CAT ) and  Gross Motor Function 
Measure-88 (GMFM -88) assessments in the schedule of events and body of protocol.   
Rationale: This change was made for clarification . 
10. The EEG at Screening for patients with absence seizures only is required for ~3 hours, not overnight
.   
Rationale: This change was made for patient convenience.  
11. The Erythrocyte Glucose Uptake Assay has been removed from the protocol. This  
change affects the schedule of events ( Table 2.1) and Section 7.5.3.   
Rationale: This change was made to reduce patient burden. 
12. Plasma level sample collection range for the population PK study at Week 26 was 
changed from 30 – 180 minutes to 60 and  180 minutes.    
Rationale: In consultation with a PK expert/advisor, sampling timepoints have been 
defined as [ADDRESS_1068184]-dose.

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
A randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, p arallel -group study to a ssess the safety and efficacy 
of UX007 in s ubjec ts with g lucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome 
PROTOCOL NUMBE R: 
UX00 7G-CL20 1 
STUDY SITES: 
Approximately 15 sites globally 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2  
RATIONALE:  
Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome ( Glut1  DS) is a rare, severely debilitating disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_410505], developmental delay and movement disorder.  Glut1  DS is caused by a 
mutation in SLC2A1 , encoding the Glut1 protein responsible for transporting glucose across the 
blood- brain barrier .  Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, this disorder 
results in a chronic state of energy deficiency in the brain.  Current treatment consists of ketogenic diet  
(KD)  and antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) for the treatment of seizures .  Because of the difficulties in 
maintaining the KD , some patients are not able to fully comply with or tolerate the diet.  These 
patients represent the subgroup of Glut1 DS patients who are most in need of an alternative therapy to 
the KD .  Given the significant unmet medical need in Glut1  DS patients not on KD, UX007 will be 
studied in this subgroup.  
UX007 (triheptanoin) is a triglyceride of medium, odd- carbon chain (C7) fatty acids .  The rationale for 
UX007 in Glut1  DS is that: (1) triheptanoin is metabolized to heptanoate and C4 and C5 ketone 
bodies, providing an alternative energy source to the brain , (2) triheptanoin provides anaplerotic 
substrates to resupply intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and (3) triheptanoin can 
support g luconeogenesis in the brain.  
The seizures due to Glut1  DS are most prominent in the pediatric population and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_777749] .  For these reasons, the proposed Phase 2 study is designed to assess the safety and 
efficacy of UX007 in reduc ing the frequency of seizures in the pediatric population (and older patients 
who are still having seizures) that are not able to comply with or tolerate the KD. The study will also 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of energy -containing metabolites and  correlate  these to the 
potential treatment effects .   
OBJECTIVES:  
The p rimary objectives of the study are to:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo as measured by [CONTACT_777794]:  UX007G-CL201

randomization  to week 8 in  frequency of seizures . Observab le generalized and partial -onset 
seizures measured for 6 weeks by [CONTACT_777795] (EEG). 
• Evaluate the safety of UX007 via adverse event (AE) rates, laboratory values, and 
electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
The secondary objectives of the study are to : 
• Evaluate the efficacy of UX007 compared to placebo, as measured by:  
- Seizure response rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with at least 50%  reduction 
from randomization to week [ADDRESS_1068185] Automated Battery (CANTAB)

Function Measure -88 (GMFM-88) 
• Evaluate long -term efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_777796] 52  
• Evaluate the optimal dose to control seizures and impact on other clinical manifestations during 
the Do se Exploration Period   
Exploratory objectives are to :  
• Evaluate the effects of UX007, from randomization through Weeks 8 and 52 on: 
- Neurological function using the Columbia Neurological Score (CNS) 
- Physician global impression of change in clinical status using the Clinical Global 
Impression - Severity scale (CGI -S) and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale

PRIMARY EFFICACY HYPOTHESIS:  
UX007 is more effective than placebo for the reduction of seizures in patients with Glut1  DS, 
as measured by [CONTACT_777799] -onset s eizures , 
including: Generalized Tonic- Clonic, Generalized Tonic, Generalized Clonic, Generalized Atonic, 
Partial/Focal with Secondary Generalization, Myoclonic, Myoclonic Atonic, Myoclonic Tonic, Complex Partial/Focal, Absence, and Simple Partial/Focal Motor  seizures . 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
UX007G-CL201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group study to assess the 
safety and efficacy of UX007 in Glut1  DS.  The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_1068186] will be considered a screen

randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_1068187] has reached 35% of total daily calories from study drug (~1 -4 g/kg/day 
depending on age).  If a subject has not reached the target of 35% of total daily calories by [CONTACT_255141] 2- week titration period, dose titration should continue until the maximum tolerated dose is 
reached .  
After the initial 8-week double-blind Treatment P eriod, the open- label Extension P eriod will begin, 
wherein all subjects will be treated with UX007 through Week [ADDRESS_1068188] of UX007 dose level on seizure control, other clinical manifestations such as movement 
disorders and cognitive deficits, and t olerability .  At the end of the Dose Exploration Period, the

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
UX007 (triheptanoin) is a colorless to yellow oil .  During the 8 week double blind period of the study 
1000 mL  UX007 will be provided in 1 L round amber colored glass bottles. During the open label 
Extension Period of the study, UX007 will be dispensed in 1 L round, translucent high-density 
polyethylene  (HDPE).  
UX007 is titrated over 2 weeks to a dose of 35% of total daily caloric intake.  During the Dose 
Exploration Period, the dose will be titrated down over 1 week to 20% of total daily caloric intake.  If there are breakthrough seizures during the down titration period, as defined by [CONTACT_777800] [ADDRESS_1068193] may begin the up- titration phase early.  The UX007 dose will then be 
titrated up over 1 week to 40% of total daily caloric intake and maintained at that level for [ADDRESS_1068194] cannot tolerate titrating up to the 40% dose level, the dose should be titrated to the maximum 
tolerated dose as d etermined by [CONTACT_737]. 
At the end of the Dose Exploration Period, the subject will be maintained on the UX007 dose that provided the maximum improvement in clinical status with acceptable tolerability, and continued on this dose for the duration of the study. If marked improvements in cl inical status were not observed at 
a higher dose level and/or tolerability was unacceptable, the subject will return to the UX007 dose where maximal benefit was achieved as defined by [CONTACT_777801]/or 
cognitive symptoms. 
UX007 is a liquid, intended for oral (PO) administration.  UX007 will be mixed  with food (or formula, 
as appropriate) and administered PO or by [CONTACT_777774] (breakfast, 
lunch, dinner, and before bed).  The dose may be divided into smaller more frequent doses with food 
as needed.  The dose should always be mixed with small amounts of food as indicated in the 
administration guidelines and never administered as the oil directly. 
REFERENCE  THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Placebo will consist of safflower oil matching the appearance of UX007.  Dose level and mode of 
administration will be identical to that of UX007  during the double- blind Treatment Period .

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Efficacy:  
Primary Efficacy Variable:     
• Seizure  frequency reduction: P ercent  reduction from randomization to week 8 in frequency  of 
seizures.  Observable generalized and partial- onset seizures measured for 6 weeks by [CONTACT_777802] (EEG).  S eizure types 
include: Generalized Tonic -Clonic, Generalized Tonic, Generalized Clonic, Generalized 
Atonic, Partial/Focal with Secondary Generalization, Myoclonic, Myoclonic Atonic, 
Myoclonic Tonic, Complex Partial/Focal, and Simple Partial/Focal Motor and Absence.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables*:

week 8  in frequency of seizures 
• Observable seizures via diary : Observable seizure frequency reduction and  observable seizure 
response rate as measured by [CONTACT_155668]  
• Absence seizures via EEG : Absence seizure  frequency  reduction and absence  seizure response 
rate as measured by [CONTACT_66594]    
• Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery :  Neuropsychological function measured 
using a standardized, computerized battery of tests designed to assess visual memory, working 
memory, new learning and reaction time  
• Six Minute Walk Test :  Walking ability measured by [CONTACT_777803] (meters) in a

5 INTRODUCTION 
Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome ( Glut1  DS) is a rare, severely 
debilitating  disease characterized by [CONTACT_410505], developmental delay , and movement disorder 
(Pearson et al. 2013 ).  Glut1  DS is caused by a mutation in SLC2A1, encoding the Glut1 
protein responsible for transporting glucose across the blood- brain barrier.  Because glucose 
is the primary source of energy for the brain, this disorder results in a chronic state of energy 
deficiency in the brain.  Current treatment  consists of a ketogenic diet (KD) to provide an 
alternative energy source to glucose (Pong et al. 2012) , (Pearson et al. 2013) and antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_132385] (AEDs).  Because of the difficulties in maintaining a KD, some patients are not able to 
comply with or tolerate the diet.  These patients represent the subgroup of Glut1  DS patients 
who are most in need of an alternative therapy to ketogenic diet.  
UX007 (triheptanoin) is a triglyceride of medium, odd- carbon cha in (C7) fatty acid.  
The rationale for UX007 in Glut1  DS is that: (1) triheptanoin is metabolized to heptanoate 
and C4 and C5 ketone bodies, providing an alternative energy source to the brain, (2) triheptanoin provides anaplerotic substrates to resupply i ntermediates of the tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle , and (3) triheptanoin can support gluconeogenesis in the brain  
(Deng et al. 2009 ), (Kinman et al. 2006) , (Marin -Valencia et al. 2013 ). 
The seizures d ue to Glut1  DS are typi[INVESTIGATOR_777753]  (AEDs)  and are 
most prominent in the pediatric population.  In addition, a subset of Glut1 DS patients is  
either not on, or unable to comply with or tolerate the KD. For these reasons, the proposed Phase 2 study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of UX007 in reducing the frequency of seizures in this pediatric , adolescent, and adult population. 
5.1 Overview of Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome  
Glut1  DS is a rare, severely  debilitating disease characterized by [CONTACT_410505], developmental 
delay , and movement disorder ( Pearson et al. 2013) .  It is caused by a mutation in solute 
carrier family 2, member 1 gene ( SLC2A1), which encodes Glut1 .  This protein transports 
glucose from blood into the brain.  Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, this disorder results in a chronic state of energy defi ciency in the brain.  
Neurological symptoms in Glut1  DS fall into 3 domains: (1) epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
(2) cognitive/behavioral disturbances, and (3) movement disorders.  The classic phenotype is a developmental encephalopathy encompassing all 3 domains.  Seizures are present in 
approximately 90% of Glut1  DS patients and usually present in early infancy.  
The laboratory hallmark of Glut1  DS is a low cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_777754] 
(<60  mg/dL or 3.3 mmol/L in all cases reported to date; <40 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/L in the 
majority of cases). The majority of reported patients (~90 %) have a de novo  heterozygous 
mutation in SLC2A1. About 10 % of affected individuals ha ve an affected parent (autosomal

dominant inheritance pattern). Autosomal recessive transmission has also been described in 
rare cases.  
Glut1  DS is a rare disease with an estimated birth incidence of 1:90,000 (Coman et al. 2006) .  
This birth incidence translates to an estimate d prevalence of ~ 8,500 in the US and Europe.  
There are currently no approved treatments specific to Glut1  DS.  Seizures are refractory to 
conventional AED treatment (Pong et al. 2012 ).   Reports suggest a KD is effective for the 
seizures of Glut1  DS by [CONTACT_777807] (Pong et al. 2012 ), (Pearson et al. 2013) .  However, KD is difficult to tolerate and 
some patients are not compliant with or are otherwise not on the diet.  There exists a significant unmet medical need in the subset of patients who are not on KD, and the proposed clinical development plan targets this specific subset of patients.  
5.2 Brief Overview of UX007 Development  
A brief overview of existing information on UX007 ( triheptanoin) is provided below; 
a comprehensive review of the data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by [CONTACT_435062]. (Ultragenyx) , which should be reviewed prior to initiating 
the study. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1068221]  
Triheptanoin is a triglyceride  composed of three heptanoate (C7 fatty acid)  esters . UX007 is 
manufactured by [CONTACT_435063]. The molecular 
formula and structure are as follows: 
Molecular Formula:   C
24H44O6  
Structure:   
 
UX007 (triheptanoin) is a liquid, intended for oral (PO) administration.  One thousand grams 
(1025 ± 25 g) of neat triheptanoin drug substance is filled into 1 Litre (L), high density polyethylene (HDPE) or round, amber- colored glass bottles.   UX007 is manufactured, 
packaged, and labeled according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations.

[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action  in Glut1 DS 
UX007 is highly purified triheptanoin, a triglyceride of 3 fatty acids with 7 carbons each.  
Triheptanoin is metabolized to heptanoate, which in turn is further metabolized to 4- and 5-carbon ketone bodies.  These metabolites by[CONTACT_777808]1  transporter to cross the 
blood- brain -barrier via the monocarboxylate transporter or potentially by [CONTACT_777809], and provide an alternative energy source to the brain 
(Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). Once in the brain, the metabolites may be further metabolized by [CONTACT_777810].  These metabolites also have the ability to provide propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]-CoA in order to resupply intermediates of the TCA cycle (i.e., anaplerosis) within the brain as well as support gluconeogenesis and glycogen 
production.

published and further support the safety of UX007.  These studies provide data on the absorption, and metabolism of triheptanoin when administered intravenously and PO at doses up to 40% the recommended caloric intake.  Furthermore, triheptanoin has been  found to be effective in 4 animal models of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002],  similar to that of other AEDs 
(Borges et al. 2012) , (Willis et al. 2010 ), (Thomas et al. 2012) , (Kim et al. 2013) .

Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068223] demonstrated that triheptanoin is hydrolyzed to heptanoa te 
and glycerol, which are efficiently absorbed by [CONTACT_4852] ( Kinman et al. 2006) .  Studies have 
demonstrated that triheptanoin is metabolized rapi[INVESTIGATOR_777755] a ser ies of energy 
containing metabolites, including heptanoate, C4- and C5-ketone bodies ( Kinman et al. 
2006), ( Deng et al. 2009) .  In the mouse model of Glut1 DS, triheptanoin administration led 
to the delivery of heptanoate to the brain which was metabolized into glucose and 
neurotransmitter intermediates, consistent with an important role of the odd -chain length 
C7 structure in restoring CNS metabolism (Marin -Valencia et al. 2013 )  
The acute oral toxicity of triheptanoin was performed in rats at four dose levels ranging from 
0.5 ml/kg (n= 2) to 5 ml/kg (n=5M/5F). There were no deaths or signs of toxicity at any time throughout the duration of the study and up to [ADDRESS_1068224] dose ( IND-[ZIP_CODE] )  
A 9 month oral toxicity study in rats was performed with an experimental  oil containing 
64% triheptanoin to determine the effects of a diet containing triheptanoin on animal 
growth,  lipid  digestibility, clinical chemistry, and toxicity in liver, kidney, and small intestine 
(Ataide et al. 2009 ). After [ADDRESS_1068225] since the control group also contained the lesion.  This is likely to be due to the high fat in the diet. The severity of hepatic steatosis was determined to be less in the rats fed 30% and 50% experimental oil compared to the control group fed the soybean oil-based diet.  There was also no significant difference in the clinical chemistries that would indicate hepatic damage or adverse effect on renal function compared to control animals fed a standard diet supplemented with soybean oil as the lipid source.  No  major systemic 
toxicities were observed in either general toxicity study. 
A GLP 9 month chronic toxicity study in juvenile mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_777756]007. The study demonstrated that there is no evidence of accumulation of triheptanoin or metabolites 
in plasma after daily PO dosing as high as 50% of the animal’s daily caloric intake. UX007 was well -tolerated at up to 50% of the daily caloric intake and did not result in any evidence 
of systemic toxicity; therefore, the dose of 50% caloric replacement was considered the NOAEL for UX007 following [ADDRESS_1068226] been treated with triheptanoin for periods of up to 15 years.  Of these subjects, approximately 50 were pediatric patients as

young as neonates; a significant portion of pediatric patients had treatment duration of over 
5 years.  The clinical experience supports the safety of triheptanoin when administered at 
approximately 35% of daily caloric intake in pediatric patients as young as neonates. 
Triheptanoin has been studied for over a decade in a large cohort of patients with 
fatty-acid oxidation disorders (FAOD) as part of a compassionate use program  
(Roe et al. 2002) , (Roe et al. 2006) , (Roe et al. 2008) , (Barone et al. 2012) .  Patients with 
other disorders have also been treated with triheptanoin, including those with pyruvate 
carboxylase deficiency (Mochel et al. 2005) , Huntington’s disease (Mochel et al. 2010) , 
adult polyglucosan body di sease ( APBD ) (Roe et al. 2010) , glycogen storage disease 
type II (GSD- II; Pompe dise ase) ( Roe et al. 2006) and congestive heart failure (IND-[ZIP_CODE]) .  
Triheptanoin treatment has been generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with these disorders. 
Triheptanoin was  studied in [ADDRESS_1068227] clinical activity with triheptanoin in reducing the frequency of absence seizures  
(Pascual et al. 2014 ). 
Ultragenyx is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_777757]007 as a substrate replacement therapy for long- chain 
FAOD ( LC-FAOD).  A prospective open- label  Phase 2 study to assess safety and clinical 
effects of UX007 in subjects with LC- FAOD (UX007 -CL201) is currently underway .

seizure events.  The KD is difficult to tolerate and some patients are not compliant with or 
are otherwise not on the diet.  There exists a significant unmet medical need in the subset of pediatric patients who are not on, or not compliant with a KD; the proposed Phase 2 study 
targets this  specific subset of patients. 
Triheptanoin has been used clinically for over 15 years in approximately 200 subjects in human studies of a variety of different diseases, including Glut1  DS (Roe et al. 2002) ,  
(Roe et al. 2006) , (Mochel et al. 2010 ). Of these subjects , approximately 50 were pediatric 
subjects with some as young as neonates ; a significant portion of pediatric subjects  received 
over 5 years of treatment duration with triheptanoin  (Table [IP_ADDRESS]).  These data support the 
safety of triheptanoin when administered at approximately 35% of daily caloric intake in pediatric patients as young as neonates.  
Nonclinical studies evaluating triheptanoin and its metabolites in mice and rats have been 
published and further support the safety of triheptanoin in the Glut1  DS population.

Data from the animal pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity studies indicates that trihe ptanoin is 
well absorbed after oral dosing and is well -tolerated without overt toxicities at doses as high 
as 1.14 g/kg in mice for [ADDRESS_1068229] 
triheptanoin consumed orally has side effects that are similar to those of orally consumed medium chain triglycerides  (MCT oil) .  The most commonly reported adverse effects are 
gastrointestinal distress and excessive weight gain at high doses.  Both of these issues appear 
to resolve when subjects consume triheptanoin in small doses mixed with foods throughout the day and when total caloric intake is appropriately managed . 
Overall the risk -benefit ratio of UX007 is sufficient to support clinical development for the 
treatment of seizures associated with Glut1 DS . 
5.4 Study Rationale 
Glut1  DS is a rare, severely  debilitating disease characterized by [CONTACT_410505], developmental 
delay , and movement disorder ( Pearson et al. 2013) .  It is caused by a mutation in SLC2A1, 
which encodes for Glut 1.  This protein transports glucose from blood into the brain.  
Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, this disorder results in a chronic state of energy deficiency in the brain.  Current treatment consists of  KD and 
AEDs . KD generates ketone bodies that provide an alternative energy source to glucose 
(Pong et al. 2012) , (Pearson et al. 2013).  However, KD is difficult to tolerate and some 
patients are not compliant with or are otherwise not on the diet. 
UX007, triheptanoin, is a triglyceride of medium, odd- carbon chain (C7) fatty acid s.  
The rationale for UX007 in Glut1  DS is that:  
1. Triheptanoin is metabolized to heptanoate and C4 and C5 ketone bodies.  
These metabolites provide an alterna tive energy source to the brain.  
2. Triheptanoin has the ability to provide succinyl-CoA via propi[INVESTIGATOR_49376]-CoA to resupply intermediates of the TCA cycle  (i.e., anaplerosis).  
3. Triheptanoin can support gluconeogenesis in the brain . 
Because of the difficulties in maintaining a KD, some patients are not able to fully comply 
with or tolerate the diet.  These patients represent the subgroup of Gl ut1 DS patients who are 
most in need of an alternative therapy to KD.  Given the significant unmet medical need in 
Glut1  DS patients not on KD, UX007  will be studied in this subgroup.  The seizures due to

(Pearson et al. 2013 ).  For these reasons, the proposed Phase [ADDRESS_1068231] s.

phenotype of breakthrough seizures into their thirties, significant movement disorders 
(estimated at 90%; De Vivo  personal communication), and have a more difficult time 
maintaining the KD.  The expanded age range of the population will strengthen the ability to 
evaluate a possible impact on seizures and movement disorders.  In addition, the seizures are typi[INVESTIGATOR_777759] (Pearson et al. 2013 ), (Pong et al. 2012)  and thus represent a 
significant unmet medical need that justifies the study of UX007 for the treatment of Glut1  DS. 
The goal of the study is to assess whether UX007 is more effective than  placebo for the 
reduction of seizures in patients with Glut1  DS.  Therefore, s pecific criteria were included to 
define a study population experiencing a quantifiable number of events despi[INVESTIGATOR_777760].  The inclusion criteria are structured to enr oll subjects currently experiencing 
observable seizures despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a prior or current use of at least [ADDRESS_1068242]  60% calories from fat will be excluded from the study population.  Reports suggest 
that KD is effective for the treatment of the seizures  of Glut1  DS, although controlled trials 
have not been performed  (Pong et al. 2012) , (Pearson et al. 2013) .  Nevertheless, KD is 
prescribed in most Glut1  DS patients.  There exists a subset of patients who are not on KD 
because it is difficult to tolerate and some patients are not compliant with or are otherwise 
not on the diet.  In addition, some subjects continue to experience breakthrough seizures while on KD.  Because the seizures of Glut1  DS are typi[INVESTIGATOR_777759], the subset 
of patients who are not on KD represents those most in need of an alter native therapy to KD.  
Thus, a significant unmet medical need exists in this subgroup that justifies the study of UX007 in subjects not on KD. 
Additional exclusion criteria were incorporated to protect the study population from possible 
contraindicated treatments  or unnecessary safety risks .  Although triheptanoin is not known 
to adversely affect the liver, many of the commonly prescribed AEDs are.  In order to minimize confounding factors on interpreting the safety of UX007, subjects with greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) will be excluded from the study. In vitro studies have shown that 
pancreatic lipases hydrolyze triheptanoin into free fatty acids and glycerol; the refore 
inhibitors of pancreatic lipases (e.g., orlistat) should be avoided while taking UX007. 
Many Glut1 DS  patients are severely impacted by [CONTACT_777818] .  
Triheptanoin has been administered previously to newborns, infants, children, and adults.  
The previous clinical experience and nonclinical data suggests a favorable risk/benefit profile 
for the target study population.  The sponsor has taken all reasonable measures to ensure the protection and safety of this population.  Appropria te pediatric expertise will be available at

frequency of s eizures varies among individuals affected with Glut1  DS; some experience 
daily events, while others experience occasional seizures separated by [CONTACT_46062], weeks , or 
months ( Pascual et al. 2004 ).  Seizure frequency does not cor relate with phenotypic severity  
(Wang et al. 2012) .  Randomization will seek to stratify subjects based on seizure frequency 
reported during the 6-week baseline period.  At  the end of the Baseline Period , eligible 
subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either UX007 or placebo.

equivalent to approximately 2-4 g/kg in infants and young children, decreasing to 1- 2 g/kg 
for older children and adolescents.  Triheptanoin treatment has been generally safe and well tolerated at the aforementioned dose levels.   Higher doses are poorly tolerated due to 
gastrointestinal disturbance, such as diarrhea; lower doses would likely provide suboptimal

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Exploration Period 
Based on the historical use of triheptanoin, it is expected that sufficient energy substrate 
replacement will be obtained with dosing of 35% of calories (roughly equivalent to 2-4 grams per kg for small children and 1-2 grams per kg for teenagers and adults ).  
The Dose Exploration Period will also explore doses above and below the anticipated clinical 
dose of 35% in a subset of approximately [ADDRESS_1068257] done after a period of stable treatment to assure that a steady state has been reached in energy metabolism.  This proposed design has been successfully used in a prior development 
program for sapropterin dihydrochloride for the treatment of phenylketonuria ( Lee et al. 
2008) . 
The Dose Exploration Period will look at forced dose titration establishment of efficacy as an 
approach to verify the benefit of the proposed dose range across all domains of disease. At the same time it should verify that there is maintenance of treatment effect after all 
patients have been on active treatment for at least [ADDRESS_1068258] 
to observe for recurrence  of symptoms. 
The lower dose of 20% was chosen for the down titration phase based on anecdotal reports of a significant loss of efficacy when triheptanoin is dosed below 25%. The upper dose of 40% was chosen based on anecdotal reports that tolerability becomes an issue above 25% in some patients and above 35% in most patients.  If there are breakthrough seizures during the down titration period, as defined by [CONTACT_777821] [ADDRESS_1068259].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Duration  
Subject participation will be up to 58 weeks  in duration, including screening, the Baseline 
Period, titration/T reatment Period, and Extension P eriod .  Following completion of the 
double-blind T reatment Period (8 weeks), subjects may continue open-label UX007 
treatment for an additional 44 weeks within  the Extension Period, if indicated by [CONTACT_1275] .  The total treatment duration of up to one year  enables a long -term assessment

Amendment 4 – 30 Nov 2015  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 44 
of the safety and  efficacy of UX007  in subjects with Glut1  DS.  Beyond this period, 
subjects  may  be eligible for an extensi on study , if warranted,  through a separate protocol . 
7.4.5 Blinding 
The titration and Treatment Period ( Weeks 0 -8) will be conducted as a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Double-blind conditions will be established so that 
neither the sponsor, subject or site personnel involved in study conduct will know the identity 
of a subject’s treatment.   Following completion of the double-blind period, all eligible 
subjects will receive open -label UX007 for a 44-week Extension Period (Weeks 8-52) to 
assess long -term safety and duration of effect.  
Study par ameters to achieve and maintain the double-blind status of the study include: 
• Sequential assignment of subject numbers 
• A randomization schedule developed by [CONTACT_120620]-party vendor so that 
Ultragenyx and site personnel receive no knowledge of treatment assignment during the study 
• Management of subject treatment assignment via manual randomization 
• Labeling of study drug with the study number and a unique kit number 
• Packaging and delivery of study drug supplies to sites in a manner that maintains blinding 
of site personnel 
• Matched appearance of i nvestigational product and placebo 
The investigator and site personnel will remain blinded to the randomization code during the 
study.  Treatment assignment for an individual subject should be unblinded by [CONTACT_777822], and only if when knowledge of the treatment assignment is urgently needed for the clinical management or welfare of the subject.  Treatment should 
be provided in accordance with the medical condition and with regard to the information provided in the IB.  The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_528627], when possible, but priority should be given to treatment of the subjec t. 
The Investigator must record the date and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that subject on the CRF.  Treatment assignment may be unblinded by [CONTACT_777823].  If a subject’s  
treatment assignment is unblinded prior to completion of the study, the subject will be discontinued from the double-blind portion of the study (but may still be eligible to complete the open-label Extension Period).

confound study objectives.  The following medications are prohibited throughout the study: 
• MCT oil  
• KetoCal or other KD  supplements 
• Barbitu rates 
• Pancreatic lipase inhibitors  (e.g. , Orlistat) due to possible inhibition of metabolism of

dispensed a n adequate supply of study drug to comprise 35% total daily caloric intake  
(or appropriate dose level if participating in the Dose Exploration Period).  Subjects and/or caregivers will record consumption of study drug in a study diary .  The diary will also be 
used to maintain a daily diet record for the 3 days prior to each visit.  Th e diary will be 
reviewed by a dietitian  or site personnel upon each vi sit.  Subjects will be instructed to return 
all used (empty study drug containers) and open/partially used study drug to the site at the 
next visit for administration during the day(s) of the visit.  Site personnel will maintain a record of all medication dispensed to each subject.  The remaining volume of unused 
medication returned to the site  upon early termination or study completion will be estimated 
for study drug accountability.

The Randomization visit (Week 0 ± 3 days ) will be 2 days in duration to complete all 
assessments and the overnight EEG (prior to randomization).  Subjects will be randomized to 
treatment after inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed.  Assessments at Week 2 
will be completed during a telephone call, including the dietitian  consultation; no visit to the 
study site will be required.  Subjects will return to the clinic at Week 4 (± 3 days)  and at the 
end of the double-blind Treatment Period for a 2-day study visit ( Week 8 ± 3 days ).  
If deemed feasible by [CONTACT_093], subjects will continue on open- label UX007  treatment 
and return for study visits at 6-13 week intervals (± 2 week s) to assess long- term safety and 
efficacy  during the Extension Period.  Subjects participating in the Dose Exploration Period 
will return for additional visits following 1 week titration and 4 -weeks treatment at each dose 
level (i.e. Weeks 31 and 36 ± 3 days).  The study coordinator will telephone the subject/caregiver as needed  throughout the study for additional monitoring .  For subjects who 
discontinue prior to completing the study, eve ry reasonable effort should be made to perform 
the Early T ermination visit procedures within 4 weeks of discontinuation.

Seizure Frequency Reduction : Percent reduction from randomization to week 8 in 
frequency of seizures.   Observable generalized and partial -onset seizures measured for 
6 weeks by [CONTACT_777825]  
(EEG ). 
Seizures are a hallmark of Glut1  DS in approximately 90% of affected individuals  ( Wang et 
al. 2012) .  The frequency of seizures varies among individuals; some experience daily events 
while others may have seizures separated by [CONTACT_46062], weeks, or even months.  The number of observable seizures will be recorded by [CONTACT_777826]. 
The frequency of different seizure types will be recorded.  Seizure types will be defined and 
standardized according to the ILAE Commission on Classification and Terminology  (Berg et al. 2010) .  Indicated seizure types are consistent with those observed in a large 
Glut1  DS cohort study designed to define epi[INVESTIGATOR_777762]  
(Pong et al. 2012) . 
Observable seizures for the primary efficacy measure are defined as : 
• Generalized  Tonic-Clonic, Generalized Tonic, Generalized Clonic, Generalized Atonic 
• Partial/Focal with Secondary Generalization  
• Myoclonic, Myoclonic (Astatic) Atonic, Myoclonic Tonic 
• Complex Partial/Focal  
• Simple Partial/Focal Motor 
Electroencephalography :  Case- report studies in limited groups of Glut1 DS patients 
suggest a normal interictal background is the most common finding on both routine and prolonged EEG recordings.  Both absence and myoclonic seizures have been observed in pediatric Glut1 DS patients during overnight continuous monitoring (

Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068264] ics in Glut1 DS patients on 
KDs (Kessler et al. 2011) . 
Abnormalities on EEG (including absence seizures) will be recorded with an overnight 
EEG  conducted at the Week 0, 8, 26, and 31 visits. Confirmatory EEG at Screening for 
patients with absence seizures only is required for ~3 hours.  For Week 0  EEG, begin EEG 
PRIO R TO Randomization date.  Monitoring periods of less than 12 hours in duration for 
Week 0, 8, 26, and 31 vi sits will be considered a protocol violation. Key measures will 
include: (1) frequency of EEG seizures, including absence; and (2) frequency of interictal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_41713]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary clinical efficacy variables  in this study will evaluate additional measures of 
seizure frequency and response, movement disorders, and neurological  function using the 
evaluations detailed below. Portions of physical therapy assessments  may be videotaped to 
monitor assessment  administration and assess for qualitative changes in function (e.g. gait).  
Subject identity will be protected by [CONTACT_562759](s).  The Investigator 
may use clinical judgment in deciding whether to administer certain assessments to  subjects 
based on age, development, and cognitive ability, as appropriate. 
Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on secondary clinical efficacy 
measures.

CANTAB tests, which have been applied to many age groups, including evaluation in children as young as 4 years of age ( Luciana et al. 2002) .  A standardized, computerized 
battery of the following 5 nonverbal tests: 1) Motor Scr eening Test (MOT), 2)  Paired 
Associates Learning Test (PAL), 3) Reaction Time (RTI), 4) Spatial Span (SSP) and 5) Spatial Working Memory (SWM) will be administered.   Completion time is approximately

Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068266] of working memory that evaluates the ability to retain visual information and manipulate it in working memory using heuristic strategy. The CANTAB tests will be administered by a trained clinician in a standardized order to minimize variability.  CANTAB tests will be administered to age-appropriate subjects during the Screening visit (Week - 6), Randomization visit (Week 0), 
and Weeks 4, 8, 26 and 52 (or Early Termination).  CANTAB  test will also be performed on 
subjects participating in the Dose Exploration Period at Weeks [ADDRESS_1068267] :  Glut1 DS patients often develop complex movement disorders and 
gait disturbances characterized by [CONTACT_777829], dystonia, and chorea (Pons et al. 2010) .  As s ome 
subjects may be too young, cognitively impaired, or physically impaired to reliably perform the test, a practice administration will be performed at the Screening visit to determine feasibility.  The 6MWT will not be performed at subsequent study visits if the subject is unable to reliably or safely perform the test at Screening. The 6MWT will be administered to 
appropriate subjects during the Randomization visit (Week 0), and Weeks 4, 8, 26 and 52 (or Early Termination).  The 6MWT will also be conducted at Weeks [ADDRESS_1068268] in accordance with  American 
Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines  (ATS 2002) .  Subjects will be observed by [CONTACT_777830] 6MWT, and the test will be terminated if there are any 
concerns as to whether the subjects can reliably and safely complete the test.  Pre -existing

Subjects will be instructed to walk the length of a pre -measured 20-[ADDRESS_1068269] for 6 consecutive minutes.  Instructions and encouragement will be given according to the script provided in the ATS guidelines. The total distance walked (meters) in a six minute period will be recorded.  The percent of predicted normal distance walked will also be determined based on published normative data.  PED occurring during the 6MWT will be assessed as an exploratory variable; a subset of sites may also perform gait analysis 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Time of Onset of Paroxysmal Exertional Dyskinesia:  PED i s characterized by [CONTACT_777832], involuntary movements primarily affecting the legs and feet, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_777763].  PED and co- occurring epi[INVESTIGATOR_777764]1 deficiency (

Severity will be assessed  as mild, moderate, or severe.  
Gross Motor Function Measure:   The GMFM -88 was initially designed and validated to 
evaluate change in gross motor function in children with disabilities ( Russell et al. 1989) .  
The original validation sample included children 5 months to 16 years of age.  Gross motor function in Glut1 DS subjects will be evaluated using this standardized observational measure of abilities that includes the following 5 domains: lying/rolling, sitting, crawling/kneeling, standing, and walking/running/jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Completion time is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 30-[ADDRESS_1068270] at the Randomization visit and Weeks 4, 8, 26, and 52 (or Early Termination) visits. GMFM -88 will also be conducted at Weeks 31 and 36 for subjects participating in the 
Dose  Exploration Period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Efficacy Measures  
The Investigat or may use clinical judgment in deciding whether to administer certain 
assessments to subjects based on age, development, and cognitive ability, as appropriate. 
Columbia Neurological Score :  The classic phenotype of Glut1 DS is also characterized by 
[CONTACT_777833], acquired microcephaly, and complex movement disorders (
Pascual et al. 2004 ).  The CNS is a quantitative tool developed to summarize neurological 
exam findings ( Kaufmann et al. 2004) .  The tool focuses on phy sical findings, capturing the 
following domains: 1) height, weight, and head circumference; 2) general medical examination; 3) general neurologic examination; 4) cranial nerves; 5) stance and gait; 6) involuntary movements; 7) sensation; 8) cerebellar function; 9) muscle bulk, tone, and strength; 10) myotatic reflexes; 11) Babinski signs; and 12) other findings.  The CNS 
total score ranges from 0 to 76; higher scores are associated with higher neurological function.  The CNS will be administered at the Randomization visit and at Weeks 8, 26, and 52 (or Early Termination).  
Clinical Global Impression -Severity scale and Clinical Global Impression -Improvement 
scale:  The CGI -S and CGI- I scales evaluate global impression of disease severity (CGI -S) 
at baseline and the degree of change in clinical status (CGI -I) at subsequent study visits as 
assessed by a physician.  Both assessments utilize 7 -point scales to rate the degree of severity 
and improvement, respectively ( Guy 1976 ).  The CGI-S will be administered during the 
Randomization visit (Week 0).  The CGI- I will be administered at Weeks 8, 26  and 
52 (or Early Termination).   The CGI -I will also be assessed at Weeks 31 and 36 for subjects 
participating in the Dose Exploration Period 
Neuropsychological Assessments :   
The majority of Glut1 DS patients experience some degree of developmental delay and 
cognitive impairment.  The broad spectrum of neuropsychological features in Glut1 DS

includes effects on general intellectual function (ranging from mild learning disability to 
severe intellectual impairment), language development, adaptive behavior, b ehavior and 
sustained attention.  Therefore, a panel of neuropsychological assessments will be administered (some at select sites  only) to provide additional characterization of the cognitive 
and behavioral features in the Glut1 DS population.  All neurops ychological tests and 
assessments should be performed within [ADDRESS_1068271]:  Individuals with Glut1 DS commonly have receptive

Glut1 DS have verbal and motor deficits that limit the ability to complete tasks that require visual and motor coordination.  The Beery-VMI measures the extent to which individuals can integrate their visual and  motor abilities  (Beery et al. 2 004).  The test is normed for children 
2-[ADDRESS_1068274] sites by a trained clinician during the Screening  visit 
(Week  -6), and Weeks 8, 26 and 52 (or Early Ter mination).  
Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices:  Spatial reasoning deficits are a key feature of the 
cognitive deficits observed in individuals with Glut1 DS.  The RCPM is a test of spatial understanding and abstract reasoning developed for individuals 5 years of age and older  (Raven et al. 1998) .  Administration time is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_1068275] administrator,

Short Form Health Survey s: Individuals with Glut1 DS are affected by a broad spectrum of 
clinical symptoms, including seizures, cognitive and speech impairment and movement disorders which may impact physical and mental health status. Short- Form (SF) health 
surveys capture practical, reliable, and valid information about functional health and well-being from the patient's perspective.  Depending on the age of the subject, the SF -10 or 
SF-12 will be administered during the Randomization visit (Week 0), and Weeks 8, 
26 and  52 (or Early Termination) . 
The SF -10 Health Survey for Children is a 10 -item caregiver -completed questionnaire for 
pediatric subjects designed to assess physical  and psychosocial health -related quality of life 
in healthy and ill individuals (Saris -Baglama et al. 2006 ).  The 10 items were adapted from 
the Child Health Questionnaire and utilize a 4 -week recall period.   Responses are used to

generate 2 component summary scores: physical summary score (PHS -10) and psychosocial 
summary score (PSS -10).  Higher global scor es are associated with better quality of 
life.  The  SF-[ADDRESS_1068276] administration completes subsequent administrations to minimize variability.  Completion time is approximately 10 minutes.  
The Medical Outcomes Study 12 -Item Short Form (SF -12) is a 12- item interview and self -
administered questionnaire designed to assess generic health -related  quality of life in healthy 
and ill adult populations (Ware et al. 1996 ).  The 12 items in the SF-12 are a subset of the 
items in the SF -36 and measure physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health 
problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health.  Responses are used to generate 2 component summary scores: physical health (PCS) and mental health (MCS). Higher  global scores are associated with better quality of life. The standard version of the 
instrument with a [ADDRESS_1068277] : The constellation 
of clinical signs and symptoms of Glut1 DS can impact a patient’s ability to independently perform activities of daily living.  The PEDI -CAT is a measure of functional capabilities an d 
performance designed for use in children and youth from birth to 20 years of age with a variety of physical conditions (
Haley et al. 2011) .  The PEDI -CAT measures abilities in the 
three functional domains of Daily Activities, Mobility and Social/Cognitive.  The PEDI -CAT 
also includes a Responsibility domain to measure the extent to which a child takes responsibility for the managing multi- step activities of daily living. The PEDI -CAT will be 
completed for all subjects , as deemed appropriate . Caregivers will be asked to complete the 
questionnaire for subjects less than [ADDRESS_1068278] sites 
during the Randomization visit (Week 0), and Weeks 8, 26 and 52 (or Early Termination).  The PEDI -CAT  will also be assessed at Weeks  31 and 36 for subjects participating in the 
Dose Exploration Period. 
Gait Analysis :  Most Glut1 DS patients present with a spectrum of movement disorders.  
A study characterizing the spectrum of movement disorders in Glut1 DS observed gait disturbances in 89% of Glut1 DS subjects (
Pons et al. 2010) .  A computerized walkway mat 
is an electronic walkway providing objective spatial and temporal measurements of gait, with demonstrated test -retest reliability (van Uden et al. 2004) .  Gait parameters include 
stride length, velocity, cadence, base of support, and percentage of cycle time spent in double support.  The computerized mat will be placed between meters [ADDRESS_1068279] sites during the Screening visit,

also be assessed at Weeks 31 and 36 for subjects participating in the Dose Exploration Period. 
7.5.3 Drug Concentration Measurements and Bioassays 
To assess the peak PK of UX007 and UX007 metabolites, blood samples will be collected 
approximately 90 minutes following consumption of food and study drug at Weeks 8 and 
52 (or Early Termination), and at Weeks [ADDRESS_1068280] study drug 
administration will be recorded on the CRF.  The following analytes will be assessed: 
• Plasma peak levels of UX007 
• Plasma le vels of UX007 metabolites:  C4 ketone (BHB), C5 ketones 
(beta-hydroxypentanoate [ BHP ] and beta- ketopentanoate [BKP ]), and heptanoate  
At the Screening and Randomization (Week 0) study visits, the blood samples will be 
collected in the non- fasting state in o rder to assess  a non- fasting BHB.  
All subjects are on study drug a t Week 26, at which time a population PK study  will be 
conducted.  S amples for trough (pre-dose [within 15 minutes] ) UX007 and metabolites 
(same as above) will be obtained  from all subjects, and [ADDRESS_1068281]  at 60 and  180 minutes following consumption of food and study drug.   
If feasible, additional PK samples will be collected whenever a potentially related 
SAE  occurs . 
7.5.4 Safety Measures  & General Assessments 
General assessments include medical history  and demographics.  Safety will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_5205], frequency , severity , and relatedness  of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), 
including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled time points in  vital signs , 
weight, physical examination  and ECG findings, c linical laboratory evaluations , pregnancy 
testing  (or pregna ncy of pa rtner ), suicidal  ideation and behavior assessments, and 
concomitant medications .  Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History

diagnosis, disease course, treatment and outcome. 
Glut1 DS  maintenance treatment history and relevant concomitant medications will be 
recorded (start date, stop date, dose, dose regimen).  Treatments include prescribed diets , 
other s tandard of care treatments, and all other relevant concomitant medicati ons 
(e.g., seizure medications, L- carnitine, vitamin supplements, etc.).  Medications include 
prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements.  Any relevant concomitant 
therapy, including physical/occupational therapy will be recorded. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  and Weight 
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured 
in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, re spi[INVESTIGATOR_467847], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).  Vital signs measurements will be 
performed at every clinic visit before any additional assessments are completed .  At each 
visit, weight (in kilograms) w ill be obtained using a scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
At the Screening visit and Weeks 8 and 52 (or Early Termination), a standard 12- lead 
ECG  will be performed prior to or at least 15 minutes after administration of any motor 
function tests (where indicated)  so that the ECG is performed at a resting heart rate .  
The Screening  ECG should be within normal limits or have abnormalities that clearly reflect 
a stable condition that would not pose a risk to an individual participating in this trial.  Abnormal findings and clinically signifi cant changes from baseline will be recorded as AE . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations  will be performed at Screening and the Week 8, 26  and 
52 study visits  (or Early  Termination Visit).  Physical examinations will include assessments 
of general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, dermatologic, 
lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic 
systems.   Clinically significant changes from Baseline  will be recorded as AE s. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be perfo rmed in this study  are listed in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
Clinical laboratory testing will be performed at the Screening, Randomization  (Week 0) ,

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Testing  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests at the 
Screening  and Randomization visits and at Weeks 8, 26, and 52 (or Early Termination).  
Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not reached 
menarche, had  total hysterectomy, or have been in menopause for at least one year prior to 
Screening.  
Female subjects with a positive pregnancy test at the Screening visit will not be enrolled in the study; female subjects who become pregnant during the study will be removed from the study. Additional pregnancy tes ts may be performed at any time in which pregnancy status is 
in question. A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal urine pregnancy test result, or can be performed if pregnancy test by [CONTACT_11864]. 
Experien ce with UX007 (triheptanoin) in pregnant women is limited. The study drug may 
involve risks to a pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_435075].  
Sexually  active males or females of childbearing potential must use two forms of highly 
effective methods of contraception during heterosexual intercourse throughout the study 
period and for 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. Examples of highly effective methods include: 
• Established use of hormonal contraceptives, such as the birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], injection or 
implant 
• Barrier method, such as a condom with spermicide, or cervical cap

• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a small device with hormones that 
goes inside the uterus 
• Male sterilization, also called vasectomy  
• True abstinence which means not having sex because subject chooses not to (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)

In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information.  Refer to the Study 
Reference Manual for details on the reporting procedures t o follow in the event of pregnancy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Assessments  
Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior is a regular part of development prog rams  
involving AEDs and other neurologic drugs with central nervous system activity (FDA Dr aft 
Guidance 2012 ).  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) is a standardized 
suicidal rating instrument used to assess the suicidal ideation and behavior in an at- risk 
pediatric population ( Posner et al. 2011) .  To prospectively assess suicidal ideation and 
behavior, the C-SSRS will be administered by a clinician.  Depending on the cognitive state 
of the subject, some questions within the C- SSRS  may be deemed by [CONTACT_777834].  Suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed in  subjects ≥ 10 years of age at each  visit.  The Baseline questionnaire will be 
administered on the initial visit; the Since Last Visit questionnaire will be administered at all subsequent visits. The responses to the questionnaire will be reviewed by [CONTACT_528635]; if emergent suicidal ideation or behavior is indicated, the investigator should promptly evaluate the subject to ensure proper management and protection of subject safety . Determination of whether the subject should continue on study will be made by [CONTACT_777835]- up needed , and the Sponsor will 
be informed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded in the subject’s CRF at each 
study visit, beginning at the Screening visit.  Medications (investigational, prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Screening will be reviewed and recorded. At each subsequent visit, change in m edications 
since the previous visit will be recorded.  A discussion of concomitant medications is provided in Section 7.4.6.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent through 
[ADDRESS_1068283] administration of study drug. The  determination, evaluation, 
reporting, and follow-up of AEs will be performed as outlined in Section 8.5.  At each visit 
subjects will be asked about any new or ongoing AEs since the previous visit.  Assessments 
of AEs will occur at each study visit. 
Clinically significant changes from Baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory parameters , suicidal ideation and behavior, and ECGs  will be recorded as 
AEs or SAEs, if appropriate.  If feasible, additional PK samples will be collected whenever a 
potentially related SAE occurs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Monitoring Calls 
For additional safety monitoring, the study coordinator will telephone the subject/caregiver between each Extension Period s tudy visit through Week 52.  Additional telephone contacts 
may be made during the Baseline and Treatment Periods as needed.  A follow -up call is 
recommended within 4 weeks following early termination or study completion.  The  calls 
will be used to assess AE, discuss any problems or di fficulties with treatment, and assess 
protocol compliance.  Study staff will ask about potential adverse effects of study drug 
including presence of gastrointestinal upset, steatorrhea or frequent loose stools, and weight gain.  Staff will inquire about study drug consumption and remaining supply. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dietitian Consultation and Diet Assessment  
Subjects and/or caregivers are required to  maintain a record of the subject’s daily diet in  a

life and activities of daily living  (SF-10/SF -12 and PEDI -CAT ). 
Additional measurements of UX007 and known triheptanoin metabolites will be assessed 
using blood samples.  The panel has been included in this Phase [ADDRESS_1068288] been incorporated into the study design. 
7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study analysi s.  
Therefore , every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate and timely data collection, 
and to avoid missing data. 
The procedures for handling missing, unused, or spurious data, along with t he detailed 
method for analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); in general, 
missing data will be treated as missing.  T he information below is intended as a guide to

into the study.  Study drug may not be shipped to the investigator until Ultragenyx or its designee has received a copy of the letter or certificate of approval from the IRB/EC for the protocol and any protocol amendments, as applicable. 
All subject recruitment and/or advertising information must be submitted to the IRB/EC and 
Ultragenyx or its designee for review and approval prior to implementation.  IRB/EC  approval of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes 
outlined in the amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to protect subject safety.  In such cases, the chair of the IRB/EC should be notified immediately and the amendment forwarded to the IRB/EC for review and approval. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1068297] of Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by [CONTACT_941] 18th World 
Medical Association  General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and subsequent amendments and 
clarifications adopte d by [CONTACT_11878].  The investigator will make every effort to 
assure  the study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those 
principles, current Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations, ICH Good Clinical 
Practices  (GCP) guidelines, and local ethical and regulatory requirements.  Should a conflict 
arise, the investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the greater protection to the individual subject.  The investigator will also make sure he or she is  thoroughly familiar 
with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of the study drug, as described in this protocol and the IB, prior to the initiation of the study.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1068298] Information and Consent  
Appropriate forms for documenting written informed consent will be provided by [CONTACT_492403]/EC.  Ultragenyx or its designee must receive a copy of the IRB/EC's approval of the ICF before the shipme nt of study drug to the study site.  
It is the investigator's responsibility to obtain signed written informed consent from each potential study subject prior to the conduct of any study procedures.  This written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, requirements, and potential risks of 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068299] is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time.   Subjects  under the age of 18 years (or 16 years, depending on the region) 
will provide written assent (if possible), and his/her legally authorized representative 
(parent  or legal guardian) will provide written informed consent for such subje cts. 
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will comply with ICH GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects,” the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPA A) 
regulations, and all other applicable regulatory requirements.  Subjects will be given a copy of the signed ICF and will be provided any new information during the course of the study that might affect their continued participation in the study.  The in vestigator or a qualified 
designee will be available to answer each subject's questions throughout the study, and all of the subject's questions must be answered to the subject's satisfaction.  If the protocol is amended and the ICF is revised, each subject will be required to provide written informed consent again using the revised ICF. 
Receipt of written informed consent will be documented in each potential subject’s CRF.  
The signed ICF will remain in each subject's study file and must be available to th e study 
monitor(s) at all times.  
8.[ADDRESS_1068300] provide Ultragenyx and/or its designee a completed and signed Form  FDA [ADDRESS_1068301] be completed for all sub- investigators 
listed on Form FDA 1572. 
Ultragenyx and/or its designee will be responsible for managing and monitoring the clinical 
trial to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines.  Ultragenyx's trained designated representative (the monitor) will conduct regular visits to the clinical site, to perform source document verification.  The monitor will verify the investigator's ongoing 
qualifications, inspect clinical site fac ilities, and inspect study records, including proof of 
IRB/EC  review, with the stipulation that subject  confidentiality will be maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements. 
8.[ADDRESS_1068302] be available for inspection by [CONTACT_460058].  Subjects will be given instructions on the proper storage of study drug  when 
initially dispensed and reminded of storage requirements at all subsequent visits. Study d rug 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068303] be maintained for all study drug received, dispensed, 
returned, and/or lost during the study.  This record must be kept current and made available to the study monitor for inspection.  Following the close-out of the study, all unused study drug must be returned to Ultragenyx and/or its designee unless other instructions have been provided for final disposition of the study drug.  
8.[ADDRESS_1068304].  A validated electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for entry of the data into electronic CRFs.  Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by [CONTACT_11881].  All information recorded on CRFs for this study must be consistent with the subject's source documentation. 
Initial data entry and any changes to the data will be made only by [CONTACT_11882]-authorized 
users, and data entries and changes will be captured in an electronic audit trail.  An explanation of any data change should be recorded in the CRF.  All data entered in to the 
CRF must be verifia ble; therefore, CRFs will be routinely checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records by [CONTACT_11881].  The investig ator must allow direct access to all source documents.  
8.4.2 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_11883]/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines.  Ultragenyx's designated representative (the monitor) will contact [CONTACT_460060].  The monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the investigator's qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study record s, including proof 
of IRB/EC review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for co nsistency with source documents 
including progress notes, laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or uninterruptable data will be resolved in coordination with the investigator. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068305] communications with the study site by e-mail, telephone, facsimile, and/or mail.  The investigator and all other site personnel agree to cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all questions raised and any and all issues identified by [CONTACT_2037]. 
The investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB/EC, and/or Ultragenyx o r its 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least two years after the last approval of a marketing applicati on or for at least two  
years after clinical development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The investigator is required to guaranty access to these documents and to cooperate with and support such audits and inspections. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1068306] approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until :  1) there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications  in the US or an ICH region, or 2) at least two years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product under study.  
The investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_1068307] with retention should the investigator /institution 
be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_1068308] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether  or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068309] caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the investigator or Ultragenyx , results in  any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. 
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, t he severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI  CTCAE.   
The majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, 
severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions. 
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – 30 Nov 2015  
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 69 
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, bu t are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5): Events that result in death.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided.  The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to stud y drug using the 
following descriptions. Categories of attributions for “Not Related” events: 
• Definitely Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the 
event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the exposure to study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
• Probably Not Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g. , 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigatio n or the relationship in time suggest that a causal relationship is unlikely. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected response 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – [ADDRESS_1068310] been produced by a 
number of other factors. 
• Probably Related:  This catego ry applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a known or suspected pattern of response,  and is strongly associated with study drug exposure. An 
alternative explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drugs(s), concomitant 
medication(s).  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. , concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigation or the relationship in time is very suggestive ( e.g., it is confirmed by [CONTACT_213008]).  
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs  deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Definitely Not or Probably 
Not Related  will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx  
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
All AEs (i.e. any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on the AE eCRF via the EDC system. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460010], obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, re lationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
All AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent through [ADDRESS_1068311] a comment in the 
source document by [CONTACT_35718], recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements 
for Immediate Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported within [ADDRESS_1068312]'s treatment assignment or dosage. 
The reporting requirement for SAEs is from the time of signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_1068313] notify the IRB/E C of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, as 
soon as is practicable and in accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local law. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Reporting  
The regulations governing clinical studies state that the sponsor and investigator are required to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the Ethics Committee (EC) is notified at the same time.”  The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_1068314] dose of study drug. Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures to Ultragenyx within 24 hours. 
Protocol Number:  UX007G-CL201 
Amendment 4 – 30 Nov 2015

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), Ethics Committees, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. Fatal and life- threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_1068315] knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_1068316] knowledge of the event.  
Principal Investigators are requ ired to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regulatory Authorities, 
Ethics Committees, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX007 , major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within 
the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_1068317] dose of study drug. 
The investigator will notify the IRBs/Research Ethics Boards (REB)/ECs of SAEs and urgent 
safety matters, in accordance with IRB/REB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will 
prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic summary reports to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics Committees, as per local laws and regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy in Subject o r Partner  
Pregnancies in subjects or partners must be reported within [ADDRESS_1068318]’s partner, while participating in the study, will 
be monitored for the full duration and/or followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. In the event of a pregnancy in the partner of a subject, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain the female partner’s consent for release of protected health information. Refer  to the Study Reference Manual for details on the reporting procedures to follow in the 
event of pregnancy. Pregnancy-a ssociated SAEs will be processed and submitted, as 
necessary, as per the S[LOCATION_003]R reporting process (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Safety and efficacy  of BIO -101 175 mg b.i.d. and 350 mg b.i.d. 26 -week 
oral administration to patients suffering from age -related SARcopenia, 
including sarcopenic obesity, Aged ≥  65 years and at risk of mobility 
disability. A double -blind, placebo - controlled, randomized 
INTerventional clinical trial (SARA -INT).  
Study Description:  SARA- INT is a three -arm, interventional, phase 2, randomized, double - 
blind , placebo -controlled clinical trial. It will be conducted in the 
European Union ( EU) and in the [LOCATION_002] (US). 
231 community dwelling older adults (men or women ≥ 65 years ), living 
independently at home  (home s are any living communit ies that may or 
may not offer optional services for the convenience of the residents.  
Older adults  living in nursing homes or in medicalized residences  where 
caretaker services are mandatory  are not  eligible ), able to walk outside 
from time to time , reporting  a loss of physical functions and considered 
at risk of mobility disability, were  selected to perform the Short Physical 
Performance Battery1 (SPPB) test.  
Those with SPPB scores ≤ 8  were  selected to perform  a body composition 
analysis with a dual-energy X -ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan . (DEXA 
scans performed no more than 8 weeks  before the date of randomization 
will be acceptable , and in that case , should not be repeated up to the end 
of the study visit). Participants with appendicular lean mass  (ALM)  
adjusted for body mass index (BMI) , or ALM/BMI < 0.789 in men and < 
0.512 in women, or ALM <19.75kg in men and <15.02kg in women , 
corresponding to the  operational definition of sarcopenia based on the 
criteria of the Foundation of National Health Institute ( FNIH)2, were  
definitively included and randomized if other inclusion/exclusion criteria 
are also satisfied.  
The study plan is divided into: a) screening and randomization phase and 
b) treatment and evaluation phase. The recruitment lasts approximately  
24 months. The investigational phase initially comprise s three main visits  
for measurement of drug efficacy , pharmacokinetics (when appropriate)  
and safety parameters : 1) the inclusion visit, 2)  the 3 -month evaluation 
and 3) the 6 -month final evaluation visit . Additionally , three  
communications (visit and phone calls) were planned  for safety 
measures only: 1) an on-site visit at 1-month after randomization , 2) a 
telephone call  at 5-month after randomization, and 3) a telephone call [ADDRESS_125463]  drug intervention (i.e. after M6 visit)  or after the end -of-
intervention  visit.  
The primary outcome  is the change from baseline  in gait speed, in meters 
per second  (m/s), between the treatment groups  versus placebo based 
on the  400 meters walking (400MW)  test.  
The Short Form Health Survey  (SF-36) and two other patient s reported 
outcomes (PROs) will be completed by [CONTACT_112588] 
(Day 0), at the month  3 (M3)  visit and the month  6 (M6) or e nd-of-
intervention  visit.  The Physical Function Domain  (PF-10) sub-score  of the 
SF36 at M6  will be tested as a key secondary outcome  at M6 . 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125464] ( 6MW T) will also be administered during the two main 
visits (Day  0 and M6) and considered as  part of the  secondary criteria at 
M6.  
At any time, participants complaining of meaningfully worsening of  
physical functions may be invited to an unscheduled  visit for further 
assessment for consideration of their continued participation in the 
study .  
The statistical analyses will describe the demographic and functional 
characteristics of the three treatment groups at baseline, and compare the evolution (change in each treatment group versus placebo group) of the primary, key secondary, secondary and exploratory endpoints. The 
evolutions of efficacy parameters will also be analy zed according to 
specific variables or class of variables, e.g. gender, age, initial SPPB  score, 
ALM, ALM/BMI  and etc, in view of identifying a subpopulation at high risk 
of worsening and/or to show the homogeneity of the treatment effect 
across subgroups.  
 A predefined subgroup efficacy analysis will also be performed on a 
number of  pre-identified , at-high risk of worsen ing, subpopulations:  
• Low gait speed  
• Sarcopenic obesity  
• Study p articipants  with a chair stand sub -score of ≤2 of the SPPB  
• Study p articipants who experience a deterioration in their 
ALM/BMI, as measured by [CONTACT_112589] M6 visit  and 
compared to the baseline measurement  
Subgroup analyses will be provided through a forest -plot approach.   
Objectives:  
 General Objectives:  
1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of BIO101 (175 mg b.i.d. and 350 mg b.i.d.) orally administered for 26 weeks 
versus placebo in a population of community dwelling older men 
and women (age d ≥ 65 years)  living at home and  at risk of 
mobility disability .  
2. To estimate treatment effect on improvement of physical 
function after a six-month treatment versus placebo in the target 
population.  
3. To estimate treatment effect on reduced  risk of mobility 
disability after a six-month treatment versus placebo in the 
target population.  
Primary Objective:   
• To e valuate  the effect of two daily doses of BIO101 versus 
placebo on mobility function as measured by [CONTACT_112590] 400MW test. The absolute change from baseline in m/s 
observed in each treatment group at M6 will be compared to the placebo group.  A minimum clinically significant benefit is set at 
0.05  m/s in the mean difference between groups  from M6 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 91 compared to baseline . The preliminary data from the SARA 
observation al study (SARA -OBS) suggests that the untreated 
population naturally experienced a deterioration of 0.05 meter 
per second, when compared at M6 to baseline. Taken together, 
this increases  the expected  difference between treatment and 
placebo  groups  to 0.1 m eter per second  at M6  – corresponding 
to what is considered a clinically significant difference.   
Key Secondary Objectives:  
a. To compare the change from baseline of a standardized patient 
reported outcome (PRO): the PF-[ADDRESS_125465]. A minimum clinically 
significant benefit is set at 2 kg difference of the change at M6 
from baseline versus placebo in the mean difference between 
groups.  
Other Secondary Objectives:  
a. To compare appendicular lean body mass and body composition  
versus placebo , and specifically ALM . 
b. To compare muscle strength using the knee extension test and the 
stair climb power test (SCPT)  versus placebo.  
c. To compare the rate of  success ful patients who complete d the 
400MW  test after the 6-month treatment versus placebo . 
d. To assess the overall score change on the  SPPB as a cumulative 
expression of a physically frail status . 
e. To compare the repeated chair stand  test as a sub-score of the 
SPPB assessment  versus placebo.  
f. To compare the distance walked during the 6MWT versus placebo.  
g. To compare the change from the baseline using the SarQol auto -
evaluation  questionnaire  versus placebo.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint : 
Gait speed measured during the 400MW  test: the change from baseline 
to month 6 will be compared between groups of treatment (each dose 
versus placebo).

Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 91 Key Secondary Endpoints :  
PF-10 sub -score of the SF -36: the change from baseline to month 6 will 
be compared between groups of treatment (each dose versus placebo).  
Muscle strength as measured by [CONTACT_112591]: the change from 
baseline  to month 6 will be compared between groups of treatment 
(each dose versus placebo).  Additionally, a responder analysis will be 
performed with a responder definition of “ study participant  with an 
improvement of gait speed at [ADDRESS_125466] greater or equal to 0. 1 m/s 
versus baseline”, at an individual level.  
A further responder analysis will be performed with a responder 
definition of “ study participant  with an improvement of PF10 greater or 
equal to 2 points versus baseline”, at an individual level.  
Other secondary Endpoints :  
Change from baseline of ALM and other parameters of body composition by [CONTACT_112592]; the rate of success to complete 400MW  test after a 6-month 
treatment versus placebo; change from baseline of muscle strength as 
measured by [CONTACT_112593] ; change from baseline of the  total 
SPPB  score and of the sub -score of the repeated chair stands test; change 
from baseline of the  SarQol auto -evaluation questionnaire . 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Population:  231 community dwelling older adults (men or women  ≥ 65 years)  and 
reporting  a loss of physical function over the last six -twelve months and 
considered at risk  of mobility disability  will be included in the randomized 
interventional clinical trial SARA- INT ( with 64 patients per treatment 
group) with  a treatment period of 26 weeks.  39 additional participants 
will be randomized to allow 20% of non -evaluable  withdrawals or lost to 
follow -up for a total of  231 older adults included in the US and the EU.  
An unblinded ‘promising zone’ interim analysis will take place, based on 
the complete efficacy data from half of the randomized participants  who 
completed the trial , to determine if there will be a need to increase the 
sample size.  
A predefined subgroup ef ficacy analysis will also be performed in a 
number of  pre-identified , at-high risk of worsening  subpopulations:

2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
We aim to perform th is phase 2 , interventional study in Europe and [LOCATION_003] in order  to evaluate the 
clinical benefits, safety and tolerability of the investigational drug , BIO101 . BIO101 will be  
administered orally for a six -month (26 weeks) duration to community dwelling men and women  
aged ≥  65 years  (living at home  and able to walk outside from time to time . Homes can include 
living communities that may or may not offer optional services for the convenience of the 
residents. Older adult s living in nursing homes or in medicalized residences where caretaker 
services are m andatory are not eligible) suffering from age -related sarcopenia (including 
sarcopenic obesity) and at risk of mobility disability.  
This double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial will collect and analyz e data on physical 
performance and body composition and will specifically focus on the  change of one functional 
measurement : the gait speed measured during the  400MW test  plus the change on  a highly 
standardi zed PRO, the PF -[ADDRESS_125472] sarcopenia research and treatment in a number of ways, including the 
allowance for clearer establishment of clinical guidelines for diagn osis and treatment of 
sarcopenia and opening new avenues for development of novel therapeutics by [CONTACT_112598] (FDA).  Of note, the FDA organized a 
public consultation meeting to gather the point  of view of patients suffering from sarcopenia in 
April 2017
5. 
 Depending on the definition  used, sarcopenia prevalence in 60 -70 year s old is reported as 5  to 
13% while the prevalence for people >80 years old ranges from 11 to 50%. The number of people 
around the world aged ≥60 years was estimated at 600 million in the year 2000, a figure that is expected to rise to 1.2 billion by 2025 and 2 billion by 2050. Even with a conservative estimate of 
prevalence, sarc openia affects >[ADDRESS_125473] >200 million in the next 40 
years
6. According to the World Health Organi zation (WHO) in 2009, the estimated direct 
healthcare cost attributable to sarcopenia in the [LOCATION_002] of America in 2000 wa s $18.[ADDRESS_125474] , the European Working Group 
on Sarcopenia in Older People  (EWGSOP)  defined sarcopenia as a low muscle mass index in

with  a walking speed of <0.8 m/s, or a normal walking speed and low muscle strength (<20 kg for 
women and <30 kg for men)7. Subsequently, the FNIH  developed a data -driven definition based 
on a meta -analysis of 11 clinical studies and 26 ,725 participants (mean age  of 75.2±6.1 years in 
men and 78.6±5.9 years in women). This definition takes into account the prevalence of low gait 
speed (≤0.8m/sec) and weakness (grip st rength  of <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) in older 
individuals (≥  65years) and is defined by [CONTACT_112599]  <19.75kg in men and

and <0.[ADDRESS_125475] definition of sarcopenia integrating the  BMI was derived from a 
sensitivity analysis, and it allows for  better apprais al of  obese (sarcopenic) individuals. In fact , 
sarcopenic obesity (SO) represents a subgroup of sarcopenia characteri zed by [CONTACT_112600] a concomitant increase of fat mass. It is mainly affecting older obese 
individuals. A higher rate of functional decline has been reported  in participants with SO. Indeed, 
lipid infiltration in muscle tissues seems to exacerbate sarcopenia, since accumulation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_112565] , reduces protein synthesis and induces a chronic 
inflammation in the muscle
8-10. The p rogressively increasing cohort of older people with SO are at 
particular risk of negative health impact such as loss of independence, increased disability and 
increased morbidity and mortality11.  
 Establishing a consensus definition of SO is challenging since most of previous studies specifically 
focused on body composition (gain of fat mass and loss of muscle mass) and not on physical 
function
10. The problem of the SO definition  is also revealed  by [CONTACT_112601] (4-
84% in men a nd 4 -94% in women depending on body composition measurement methods 
used)12. The lack of a consensus definition as well as the imprecision in its prevalence hampers SO 
recognition as a specific geriatric condition and has also led to its under -diagnosis. T hus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_112566]’s high relevance, appropriate clinical studies including both  body composition and physical 
function measurements will contribute to better understanding of SO’s  prevalence and clinical 
importance in the ageing population. In that regard, t he definition of Batsis et al.13 that integrates 
the cut -off points for sarcopenia by [CONTACT_112602] a percentage of body fat mass of >25% in men 
and >35% in women, will be applied  in this study.  
 The pathogenesis of SO, adapted from Donini et al.,

Figure 1:  Pathogenesis of Sarcopenic Obesity  
 
In the LIFE clinical trial, it has been shown that in older adults  with a sedentary life style  and low 
SPPB score at baseline , the Physical Activity (intervention) group had better  lower extremity 
performance (SPPB score), compared with the Health Education group, over the course of the 
trial15. These effects were more pronounced in lower functioning participants (SPPB <8)16, with 
the greater benefit and difference between groups vi sible at  as early as  [ADDRESS_125476] the effects of a multicomponent treatment 
strategy (focused on structured physical activity as well) in 1 ,500 physically frail older participants 
(the frailty status being operationalized by [CONTACT_112603] ≤9 or ≤7) and sarcopenia  (defined  by [CONTACT_112604]/BMI or low  ALM, according to the two subsets of criteria by [CONTACT_112605].  In fact , the ALM and 
ALM/BMI cut- off points identified two relatively distinct subsets of sarcopenic individuals as only 
16% of patients do actually meet both definitions17. This clinical trial population is theoretically 
expected to be a t higher risk of mobility disability than the LIFE population because of the dual 
initial diagnosis of physical frailty (based on low function) and sarcopenia (based on body 
composition by [CONTACT_112606] ). 
 The SARA -INT clinical trial population is intended  to include those  at risk of further loss of muscle  
functions even in the medium term (6 months), based on the very low physical performance at 
baseline (SPPB ≤ 8) and the co existing  sarcopenia criteria based on  DEXA  measurements . 
 Sarcopenia management requires not only acting on muscle mass but also on the muscle 
functions in order to prevent subsequent disabilities. Physical performance is mainly measured 
through the SPPB, grip strength, or walking test s like the 400MW  test or the 6MWT.  
 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 91 Several strategies were developed for the management of sarcopenia and/or SO18.These include 
monoclonal antibodies targeting myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, or its 
receptor. Many products of different classes of molecules have been tested over the past decade 
in clinical studies of sarcopenic participants:  
 
• Molecule substrates of protein synthesis which are amino acids or their metabolites 
(leucine, beta -hydroxy- beta -methylbutyrate, citrulline, ornithine), as well as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_112567].  
• Anabolic hormones like testosterone or selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs ), 
growth hormone, IGF -1, vitamin D, ghrelin or progranulin.  
• Myostatin inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptors).  
• Molecules targeting the renin- angiotensin system  (RAS) such as angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists and angiotensin 1 -7 (or agonists 
thereof).  
• Some beta blockers (inhibitors of β -adrenergic receptors), e.g. espi[INVESTIGATOR_8405]19. 
• Various natural substances such as polyphenols (resveratrol, isoflavones), triterpenes 
(ursolic and oleanolic acid), or phytosteroids (brassinosteroids, phytoecdysones).  
 Pharmaceutical companies had developed drug candidates based on the above technologies , 
espec ially on the use of therapeutic antibodies that inhibit myostatin. They also tested other 
strategies, in particular the use of testosterone in combination with aromatase inhibitors or 
receptor SARMs, but the development of these drug candidates was stopped  in Phase [ADDRESS_125477] tested the benefit of 
ACE inhibitors to increase muscle quality and mobility of elderly patients treated for hypertension , 
and t he initial results were promising20. 
 Regarding clinical research on myostatin inhibition for targeting sarcopenia, two main strategies 
are used, either blocking the myostatin receptor (activin A/B) or directly blocking myostatin and 
therefore preventing its interaction with its receptor. Three products have completed Phase 2 studies. These are bimagrumab developed by [CONTACT_5343], LY2495655 by [CONTACT_112607], and REGN1033 by 
[CONTACT_112608].  
 
 using their Troponin activator (CK -2127107), continue to target 
sarcopenia  as well . The latter study with the troponin activator was terminated  
due to a lack of 
efficacy determined during interim analysis.  
Bimagrumab  is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to 
myostatin receptor. The phase 2 clinical trial in patients with sarcopenia showed no change in 
bimagrumab treated group versus placebo. Only a subsequent analysis of the clinical data 
revealed that sarcopenic participants with slow walking speed showed statistically significant 
improvements in gait speed and in the 6MWT  compared to placebo21. However, these res ults 
from very limited cohorts did raise concerns regarding correlation between muscle size and function
22. 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 91 The anti -myostatin antibody, LY2495655, in a phase 2 study on older , weak fallers for 24 weeks23, 
induced a significant difference in appendicular lean body mass of 0.43 kg (95% CI 0.192 to 0.660; 
p<0.0001) but did not show any significant difference compared to placebo with  regard s to 
physical performance (stair climbing, chair rise with arms and fast gait speed).  
REGN1033 or Trevogrumab a fully human mAb targeting myostatin was studied in sarcopenia, 
including disuse atrophy, chronic disease, changes in food and nutritional intake.  The treatment 
induced an increase of total lean body mass of 2.29 % compared with placebo at  the highest dose. 
However, this  gain was not translated to statistically significant improvements over the placebo 
group in strength and function  assessments includ ing the 6MWT24. Clinical studies with REGN1033 
seem to be discontinued.   
To our knowledge, none of the products has concomitantly showed in Phase 2 meaningful effects 
on lean body mass and physical function. There  is still an unmet  need for new drugs for 
sarcopenia. Along with drug treatment, an ideal management would likely  combine daily physical 
exercise to help strengthen muscle mass, adequate nutrition to avoid protein deficiency and drug 
therapy to limit the cardiovascular risk.  
 Biophytis has develop ed BIO101 as an investigational drug candidate for treating age -related 
sarcopenia, including sarcopenic obesity, and prevent mobility disability in at -risk older adults . 
The overall clinical development of this innovative oral treatment currently conducted by 
[CONTACT_112609]-related sarcopenia and SO is called “SARA”  which stands  for SARcopenia and 
sarcopenic obesity in patients A ged ≥  65 years.  
 SARA clinical development program includes 3 steps:  
 
1. SARA -PK: a phase  1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of BIO101 
administered by [CONTACT_112610] ( completed) . 
 
2. SARA -OBS: an observational trial characterizing sarcopenia, including sarcopenic obesity, 
in community- dwelling older adults  complaining about a loss of physical function and 
considered at risk of mobility disability . This is  a 6-month observation al study without any 
therapeutic intervention ( completed ). 
 
3. SARA -INT: a phase 2  double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety 
and efficacy of two oral doses of BIO101 in stud y participants  ≥ 65 years complaining of a 
loss of physical function , suffering from sarcopenia, and considered at risk of mobility 
disability. 
 
The SARA  program is supported and hosted by [CONTACT_112611] -Data, an innovative platform for a novel 
approach of clinical trials management. This includes an electronic Case Report Form (e CRF)  
electronically administered Patient Reported Outcomesas well as a continuous physi cal activityy 
recorded through a wearable  actimetry device. All of this is performed within a different -source -

In the Single Administration Dose (SAD) part, 2 cohorts of young healthy volunteers (18 -55 years) 
in fasting state  were dosed  at 100 , 350, 700 and 1 ,400 mg/day and one cohort of elderly healthy 
volunteers (65 -85 years) was tested at 1 ,400 mg/day. Food effect was evaluated at 700 mg by 
[CONTACT_112612] (18 -55 years). Age effect was evaluated at 1 ,400 mg/day by [CONTACT_112613] (65-85 years).  
 No serious adverse events  (SAEs) were observed up to 1 ,400 mg/day in young or elderly cohorts. 
Adverse events  (AEs)  were mild and were reported at the doses of [ADDRESS_125481] frequently 
reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders (headache) and musculo -
skeletal -and-connective tissue disorders. No meaningful treatment -emergent laboratory, ECG or 
vital sign abnormalities were reported.  
 After a single administration in fasted conditions, BIO1 01 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median 
time to Cmax between 2 and 3.5 hours. BIO101 plasma concentrations increased less than dose proportionally between 100 and 700 mg, and dose proportionally between 700 and 1 ,400 mg. 
After single (fasted) oral administration of 100, 350, 700 and 1400 mg it was observed a Cmax of 141, 317, 399 and 710 ng/mL, respectively. The AUC was 797, 1 ,946, 2 ,658 and 4 ,283 ng.h/mL 
respectively. The mean half -life was short ; between 2.[ADDRESS_125482] was observed on the pharmacokinetic profile of BIO101 ; the comparison of young 
healthy volunteers and elderly healthy volunteers at 1 ,400 mg/day in SAD did not show a 
meaningful difference in the Cmax (710 vs 552 ng/mL) or in  the AUC (4 ,283 vs 3, 630 ng.h/mL).  
In addition, n o food effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic profile of BIO101 ; the 
comparison of healthy young volunteers dosed at 700 mg in fasted or fed conditions did not show 
a meaningful difference in the Cmax (399 ng/mL vs to 505 ng/mL) or in the AUC (2658 vs 3294 
ng.h/mL). It was therefore decided to use the fed condition  in the Multiple Ascending Dose s 
(MAD ) part.  
Overall, BIO101 was well tolerated in doses r
 anging from 100 to 1 ,400 mg in a single oral 
administration. Cmax observed at 350 mg and 700 mg/day (399 and 505 ng/mL respectively) 
corresponds to the  
  
Both dose
s of 350 mg and 700  mg were therefore retained to be tested in the 14 -day MAD part

 Based o
n the relatively short half- life observed under single administration conditions , it was 
decided to compare , sequentially, 350 mg once a day and  350 mg b.i.d. Subsequently, based on 
the good safety profile observed, a higher dose was also tested  at 450 mg b.i.d.  
 In the MAD part, three cohorts of elderly healthy volunteers (65 -85 years) were administered 350 
mg q .d., 350 mg b.i.d . and 450 mg b.i.d . during 14 days. No SAEs  were observed. Reported AEs  
were either mild or moderate (the latest limited to 450 mg b.i.d .). The highest number of study

Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125483] each in the 350 mg q .d. 
and the  350 mg b.i.d . cohorts. None  of the observed treatment -emergent laboratory, ECG or vital 
sign abnormalities were considered clinically significant and none were reported as AEs. Overall, 
350 q .d. and 350 b.i.d. were equally safe.  
 Administration of 350 mg q .d. generated a Cmax of 346 ng/mL on day 1 and 388 ng/mL o n day 
14. From day 2 to day 12, the mean pre -dose concentrations ranged from 7.33 ng/mL to 7.73 
ng/mL. At 350 mg b .i.d., Cmax corresponded to 453 ng/mL on  day 1, and 506 ng/mL on  day 14. 
From day 2 to day 12, the mean pre -dose concentrations ranged from 105 to 126 ng/mL. After 
repeated daily administrations of 350 mg for 14 days (i.e., on Day 14), BIO101 Cmax and AUC
0-τ 
were higher (increase of about 30% for Cmax and 16% for AUC 0-τ), on average, in study 
participants administered 350 b.i.d . (506 ng/mL; 2768 ng.h/mL) than those administered q.d. (388 
ng/mL; 2389 ng.h/mL). The b.i.d . administration was the refore selected as it allowed continuous 
pre-dose plasma concentrations close to the pharmacologically  active dose of 140 ng/mL during 
the whole 14 -day MAD period.  
Administration of 450 mg b.i.d . generated a Cmax of 524 ng/mL o n day 1 and 560 ng/mL o n day 
14. From day 2 to day 12, the pre -dose concentrations ranged from 109 ng/mL to 151 ng/mL.  
AUC0 - τ was 2 ,429 ng.h/mL o n day 1 and 3 ,203 ng.h/mL on  day 14.    
No accumulation of BIO101 was observed after q .d. administration of 350 mg BIO101 for 14 days 
(mean Rac = 1.14) whereas a slight accumulation was observed after b .i.d. administrations of 
BIO101 at 350 mg and 450 mg for 14 days (mean Rac = 1.31 in both panels).  
Median Tmax was the same (i.e., 3 h) in all dose groups and after the first and last dose s. Mean 
BIO101 half -life was short with values approx.  2.8 and 4.4 h in all cohorts. At 350 mg and 450 mg 
b.i.d ., after the day 14 morning administration, mean Cmax and AUC0 -τ increased by [CONTACT_2902] 1.11 -
fold and 1.16 -fold for a 1.29- fold dose increase (from 350 mg to 450 mg), so less than dose -
proportionally.  Based on the above results, no clinically meaningful accumulation is expected over 
the 26-week administration.  
Based on the pharmacokinetic parameters, both 350 mg and 450 mg did show interesting profiles. On this basis, the b.i.d. administration was conf irmed to be used for the next development phase 
of BIO101.

SCIENTIFIC RATI ONALE FOR DESIGNING SARA- INT CLINICAL TR IAL 
Study population  
SARA -INT will enro ll older persons  living at home  and encountering  objective limitation of physical 
functions as defined by a low score at SPPB (SPPB≤8). A similar reasoning has been applied to the 
SPRINT -T16 clinical trial (SPPB≤9 with a quota of patients scoring ≤7), an approach consistent with 
recent recommendations by [CONTACT_112614] (ICFSR Philadelph ia, 2016).  According to 
published data, lower performers are in a state of disease in which therapeutic intervention s such 
as a structured physical activity can produce a significant improvement on various parameters like gait speed or chair stand . We have  therefore targeted participants that combine objective criteria 
for sarcopenia, as measured by [CONTACT_112592], with evidence of reduced mobility.  
The main difference, between SARA -INT and SPRINT -T, is that SPRINT -T tests the impact of 
exercise. It is possible, that individuals who improve with exercise only, will not require an 
addition of a drug  intervention. This is why, in this study, we are including only participants with 
an SPPB score of ≤8, and excluding those with a score of 9, like those who were included in the 
SPRINT -T study and were  considered to be potentially more stable, and may respond well to 
exercise  treatment only.  
Study Endpoints  
Designing and implementing an adapted set of investigations to accurately and efficiently 
describe the progressive decline of physical function in at -risk older individuals is also a challenge . 
In fact, there is no final consensus on the most sensitive and specific primary endpoint s, even 
though there is a general convergence on low gait speed as the key physical function related to 
an increased risk for mobility disability, falls, loss of independence and mortality28,29. 
The LIFE study, and its preparatory LIFE -P clinical trial, extensively evaluated the [ADDRESS_125485] in a 
population of community dwelling men and women aged 70 -89 years with a sedentary lifestyle 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,

Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 91 and an SPPB ≤ 9. The [ADDRESS_125486], with failure being defined as 
the inability to walk  400 meters without sitting and without help within 15  minutes. The incident 
rate of failure in the LIFE control group (n= 817) with no specific therapeutic intervention, was 
35.5% (290 out of 817  study participants) and permanent mobility disability occurred in 19.8% 
over a mean follow- up duration of 2.6 years. Interestingly,  majority of mobility disability events 
were observed in the subgroup with SPPB <8, with 177 out of 378  study participants  or 46.8% 
with  incident disability15. Transition rate from success to failure with the [ADDRESS_125487] over 
6 months had been 6.9% in LIFE -P. However,  this outcome was more efficient as compared to the 
4-meter walk, or the SPPB itself30. 
The 6MWT has been initially validated and extensively used mostly in respi[INVESTIGATOR_112568]
31. This test can be analyz ed as a continuous variable, although a 
threshold value of [ADDRESS_125488].  
However, in a recent clinical trial on the effects of testosterone treatment in old er men aged  ≥ 65 
years, relatively stable values of 6MWT were observed over 6 months in the control group 
(n=196), as well as  in the active treatment group (n=191), and there was no significant difference 
between the two groups32. Several reasons  can be considered to explain the lower than expected 
effect of the tested intervention, among these : a) the selection of a relatively preserved 
population in terms of motor function (i.e. gait speed≤1.2 m/s) and b) the choice of a minimum 
clinically important difference of 50 m (although this threshold was previously validate d in 
different patients  populations, e.g. total and knee arthroplasty or chronic lung disease ; see 
methods in Snyder et al, 2014 ClinTrials33). 
The LIFE study used the 400MW test as a dichotomous variable and a proxy for mobility disability. The same methodological approach was adopted in the case of SPRINT -T. Overall, the choice of 
this kind of primary endpoint is particularly onerous  in terms of study and intervention duration ; 
LIFE participants were treated for  two and a half years and SPRINT -T has an expected treatment 
duration of two years  in order to detect a meaningful difference between treatment groups
15. 
Santanasto et al performed additional prespecified analyses on LIFE results with the objective of 
identifying earlier changes that could anticipate later mobility disability or possibly focus on 
functional improvement and stabilization of muscle  functions16. Interestingly, both the gait speed 
measured during the 400MW test and the chair stand sub -score of SPPB did show a visible and 
statistically significant improvement at six months, followed by a relative stabilization or decline. 
In general , gait speed decl ine has been strongly correlated to major outcomes like incident 
mobility disability, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112569].  
For these reasons,  it was decided to define the 400MW test gait speed as the primary endpoint 
for SAR A-INT.  
In terms of PRO s, both the US FDA  and the European Medicine Agency (EMA)  recently emphasized 
the importance of accompanying physical function objective measurements by [CONTACT_112615] -
evaluation questionnaire to estimate  the corresponding  improvement in the daily life activities  
(ICFSR Philadelphia, 2016 ; FDA Patient- Focused Drug Development Public Meeting for Sarcopenia

chronic conditions and between study participants  with different severity levels of the same 
disease34,35. The SF -36 has also demonstrated sensitivity to significant treatment effects in a 
variety of patient populations. Population -based normative data on the SF -36 is available for the 
US and other countries as well.  
This instrument addresses health concepts that are relevant to the patient's perspective s. There 
is no single overall score for the SF -36, instead, it generates 8 subscales and two summary scores. 
The PF -10, which measures the role limitations due to physical problems, will be a key secondary 
endpoint for SARA -INT. PF -10 has been tested in numerous clinical trials and is considered a 
simple and effective measure of mobility disability and  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037]36. Climbing one 
flight of stairs (no change versus decline of two levels, two -point  difference ) or walking a block 
(no change versus two levels decline) exemplifies a substantial meaningful change, as appreciated 
by [CONTACT_1962]33,3 6.  
Data from the recently completed  SARA -OBS study could be used to  corroborate these 
hypotheses.

described in the investigator’s brochure  and mentioned in section 2. 2. This justifies testing the 
potential benefit of this drug in participants with age -related sarcopenia.  
Elderly participants  suffering from initial loss of physical function  are expected to improve their 
motor ability based on observed BIO101 non -clinical effects on muscles and musc le cells. 
All patients will undergo several nonspecific exams that could contribute to earlier diagnosis of 
unknown diseases.  
A further potential and  indirect benefit is that all participants will be closely followed -up with their 
physical activities continuously reported through the wearable actimetry device and this could 
allow earlier diagnosis of a concomitant condition or of worsening of the mobility impairment.

assessments, putting the completeness of the data that is collected during the study  at risk. The lack 
of information from  participants during this period m ay hamper  the global analysis of the full dataset 
of the study, to the extent that the whole study may become nullified . To mitigate this risk, and based 
on the safety profile of recently available  pre-clinical data, an extension of the participation of these 
subjects under treatment is proposed up to a total of 9 months of intervention. This will allow the 
collection of safety and efficacy data at the end of the COVI D-19 outbreak  based on the update d 
projection s from  national /federal, state and local governments  on the  restrictive measures for travel 
and daily activities  of participants and trial staff.  
All study activities are impacted by [CONTACT_112616] (such as physical distancing 
and stay -at-home orders) due to the COVID -19 outbreak , which could lead to an early termination of 
participation of individuals in the study . The sp onsor will rely on the contingency plans of each vendor

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
SARA -INT is a 3- arm (2 doses versus placebo) , randomized , double -blind , placebo -controlled 
parallel design  phase 2 clinical trial. This comparative clinical trial evaluates the effects of  a 6-
month treatment duration, based on the hypothesis that physical function of sarcopenic , older 
patients with an initial degree of mobility disability (SPPB≤8) will be meaningfully improved after 
6 months of oral treatment with BIO101 ( in at least one of the two tested doses) with respect to 
placebo.  
 
SARA -INT is a multi- site study that aims  to enrol l 231 community dwelling , older adults (men or 
women  ≥ 65 years) , reporting a loss of physical function over the previous 6 -12 months, and at 
risk of mobility disability, to undergo screening tests for inclusion  in the study.  Included 
participants will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_125493] however, the number of completers, based on which it will be 
conducted, will be determined once restrictions are lifted and it is clear, how many participants 
dropped out before the end-of-study assessments. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125494] encountered objective limitation of physical function as defined by 
a low SPPB score (SPPB≤8). A similar reasoning was applied to the SPRINT -T17 clinical trial (SPPB≤9 
with a quota of patients scorin g ≤7)  which is  an approach consistent with recent 
recommendations by [CONTACT_112614] (ICFSR , Philadelphia, 2016).  In fact, prespecified 
analyses from the LIFE study clearly show ed a better response in lower performers and raised the 
possibility of limited benefits in treating more robust individuals  as compared to the lower 
functioning individuals . 
Study Endpoints  
Designing and implementing an adapted set of investigations to accurately and efficiently 
describe the progressive decline of physical function in at -risk older individuals is a challenge . 
There is currently no consensus on what is the most sensitive and specific primary endpoint, 
however,  there is a general convergence on low gait speed being  the key physical function related 
to an increased risk for mobility disability, falls, loss of independence and mortality.  
The LIFE study, and its preparatory LIFE -P clinical trial, extensively evaluated the [ADDRESS_125495] in a 
population of community dwelling men and women aged 70 -89 years old with a sedentary 
lifestyle and an SPPB ≤ 9. The [ADDRESS_125496]  with  failure being defined 
as the inability to walk  400 meters without sitting and without help within 15  minutes. The 
incident rate of failure in the LIFE control group (n= 817) with no specific therapeutic intervention was 35.5% (290  out of 817 study participants ), and permanent mobility disability occurr ed in 
19.8% over a mean follow- up duration of 2.[ADDRESS_125497] is that the majority of 
mobility disability events were observed in the subgroup with SPPB<8, in 177 out of 378 study 
participants or 46.8%, for incident disability
15. Transition rate from success to failure with  the 
400MW  test over 6  months was 6.9% in LIFE -P. However, this outcome was more efficient as 
compared to the [ADDRESS_125498] can be analyz ed as a continuous variable, although a threshold value of 50 
m improvement has been used as a dichotomous variable .  
However, i n a recent clinical trial on the effects of testosterone treatment in old men aged  ≥ 65 
years, relatively stable values for the  6MW T were observed over 6 months in the control group 
(n=196) and in the active treatment group (n=191)  with no  significant difference s between the 
two groups32. Several reasons can be considered to explain th is lower -than -expected effect of the 
tested interv ention: a) the selection of a relatively preserved population in terms of motor 
function (i.e. gait speed≤1.2 m/s) and b) the choice of a minimum clinically important difference 
of 50 m although this threshold was previously validated in different patient populations  that 
included those with  total and knee arthroplasty or chronic lung disease (see methods in Snyder 
et al, 2014 ClinTrials33). The LIFE study used the 400MW test as a dichotomous test  and as a proxy 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 91 for mobility disability. The same methodological approach was adopted in the case of SPRINT -T. 
Overall, the choice of this kind of primary endpoint can be  particularly onerous in terms of study 
and intervention duration: LIFE participants were treated for two and a half years and  the 
expec ted treatment duration  for SPRINT -T is two years  in order to detect a meaningful difference 
between treatment groups.  
Therefore, Santanasto et al16 performed additional prespecified analyses on LIFE results with the 
objective of identifying earlier changes that could anticipate later mobility disability or possibly 
focus on functional improvement and stabili zation of muscle  functions. 
Interestingly, both the gait speed measured during the 400MW test and the chair stand sub- score 
of the SPPB showed  a visible and statistically significant improvement at six months, followed by 
[CONTACT_112617]. In general , gait speed decline has been strongly correlated to 
major outcomes like incident mobility disability, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112570].  
For these reasons, the 400MW test gait speed was chosen  as the primary endpoint for SAR A-INT.  
In terms of PRO s, both the US FDA  and the EMA  recently emphasized the importance of 
accompanying physical function objective measurements by [CONTACT_112618] -evaluation  questionnaire 
estimating the corresponding  improvement in the daily life activities  (ICFSR Philadelphia, 2016 ; 
FDA Patient- Focused Drug Development Public Meeting for Sarcopenia April 6, 2017 ). The SF- [ADDRESS_125499] widely used, validated measures of health -related quality of life and has been 
shown to discriminate between subjects with different chronic conditions and between subjects with different severity levels of the same disease
35. The SF -36 has also demonstrated sensitivity 
to significant treatment effects in a variety of patient populations. Population -based normative 
data on the SF -36 is available for the [LOCATION_002] and other countries as well.  
This instrument addresses health concepts that are relevant to the patient's perspective. There is 
no single overall score for the SF -36, instead, it generates 8 subscales and two summary scores. 
The PF -10 sub- score that measures  role limitations due to physical problems, will be the key 
secondary endpoint for  SARA -INT. PF -10 has been tested in numerous clinical trials and is 
considered as a simple yet effective measure of mobility disability and also for epi[INVESTIGATOR_34207]36. Climbing one flight of stairs (no change versus decline of two levels, two -point 
difference ) or walking a block (no change versus two levels decline) exemplifies a substantial 
meaningful change, as appreciated by [CONTACT_1962]33,36.  
Data from the recently completed  SARA -OBS study could be useful to corroborate these 
hypotheses.  
COVID -19 pandemic  
Safe ty of study  patients  and investigators  should be the priority  during  COVID -19 outbreak. Only 
ePROs (SF36, SARQoL, TSD -OC and Pat -D will be assessed during this period until further guidance.

5 STUDY POPULATION  
231 community dwelling  older adults (men or women  ≥ 65 years) living at home and reporting a 
loss of physical function s over the last six -twelve months and considered at risk of mobility 
disability will be included in th is randomized , interventional clinical trial, with 64 patients per 
treatment group and a treatment period of 26 to 39 weeks.  39 additional participants will be 
randomized to allow  a 20% of non -evaluable withdrawals or lost to follow -up for a total of 23 1 
older adults included in the US and the EU.  
It is expected, that due to COVID -19 related restrictions, that the number of non -evaluable 
withdrawals will be higher than 20%. However, reassessment of the sample size, will take place, as a part of the interim analysis, that will take place after restrictions are lifted.

participants , investigators , monitors or employees of the clinical site involved in the management 
of the study before unblinding of the data  (after database lock) , except  in case of emergency.  
The Clinical Research Organization (CRO) team  from  performing the data management and 
statistical activities will receive a copy of the randomi zation list after database lock.  
A specific unblinding procedure will be made available in the eCRF for the investigator to perform 
emergency unblinding of a given patient for documented reasons. An unblinding procedure can 
only be engaged in an emergency situation where the Investigator considers it essential to know what treatment the subject was receiving. The monitor shall be notified promptly if unblinding is 
performed. It is recommended that the Investigator contacts the  medical monitor before 
unblinding , if possible. The investigator will document the date, time, and reason for the 
unblinding in the patient’s medical records . 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access to 
the remote system in case of emergency. The investigator will inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in case of emergencies when he/she is unavailable.  
Should  the code be  (intentionally or unintentionally) broken by [CONTACT_112628] a clinical

For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by 
a properly authorized/licensed clinician. M edications to be reported in the CRF are concomitant 
prescription medications, over- the-counter medications and supplements . 
The following medications are not allowed during the study:  
1. Anabolic drugs e.g. testosterone , growth hormone, etc.  (replacement hormonal 
treatment for menopause is allowed if started at least 3 months before 
randomization without dose changi ng)  
2. Anabolic supplements, e.g. branched -chain amino  acids, anabolic treatments, or 
treatments containing 20E  
3. Herbal treatments containing    
 
4. Eryth
ropoietin  
5. Corticosteroid agents chronically administered per oral or parenteral route 
(except local administration route such as  eye drops or dermatologic 
formulations ; except emergency parenteral administration for acute conditions 
like asthma, aller gic reactions, etc.) 
6. Chemotherapy  
7. Radiotherapy 
8. Androgen suppressant treatm ents (e.g. finasteride) ; estrogen  suppressant 
treatments ( e.g. tamoxi fen) 
Should a participant need or report the use of these drugs during the study due to 
treatment for an AE , the physician will make the decision to withdraw or to keep the 
patient in the study according to the patient’s best health interest.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/ WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTI ON 
 
The Investigator should discontinue study intervention and specifically ensure that a participant 
stops taking the investigational drug if the bioanalytical results at Month  1 or Month 3 shows the 
following changes:  
1. Confirmed  3-fold or greater elevations above the Upper Limits of Normal (ULN) o f  
 
 
 
 
 
These stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112574]    
. 
 
Discontinuation from investigational oral treatment  does not mean discontinuation from the 
study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to , changes from baseline) 
after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will d etermine if any change in participant 
management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an AE . 
 The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the 
following: 
• AE complete follow- up (if the treatment is stopped following an AE)  
• Last investigational medication administration date and time  
 The physician can decide to re -introduce the investigational treatment if it was stopped because 
of a concomitant acute condition he /she  considers unrelated to the treatment.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participati ng in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from  the study for the following 
reasons : 
 
• Pregnancy: however , in principle , only menopaused women are eligible in this protocol  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situat ion occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant 
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant unable to receive oral treatment for more than 4 weeks  

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125515] above is provided as considerations to guide the investigators and the decision to 
discontinue or withd raw a participant is up to the investigator’s discretion.  A study participant is 
allowed to continue in the study, given his/her own choice, even if he/she needs to stop the study drug intervention.   
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the 
eCRF . Based on the  number of study participants  enrolled in each  center, study participants  who 
signed the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention 
may be replaced.  Study participants  who sign ed the informed consent form were  randomized and 
received the study intervention, but subsequently withdrew , or are withdrawn or discontinued 
from the study, will not be replaced.  
In any case , each subject need s to be randomized via the eCRF  procedure, and already assigned 
TUs cannot be manually assigned to a new participant.  
7.[ADDRESS_125516] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] (and at default his/her proxy when 
available) and reschedule the missed visit within 2 weeks . The site will counsel the 
participant on the importance  of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if 
the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] ( a minimum of  3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_112631]’s 
medical record or study file.  
• If previously agreed by [CONTACT_2299], the study staff can decide to visit him/her at home in order to collect important medical information, and if applicable, perform a minimum 
functional assessment (i.e . SPPB ).  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow- up. 
7.4 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION  DURING THE COVID -19 
During the COVID -19 pandemic, participants may not be willing to continue  their participation in 
the SARA -INT study. Consent withdraw al due to the COVID -19 outbreak will be identified and 
recorded specifically in the eCR F.   
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125517] s will be used in SARA -INT. The specific timing of procedures/evaluations to be 
done at each study visit can be found  in Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities . 
Cumulative Il lness Rating Scale (CIRS)  
The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS)38,39 rates 13, conceptually valid, body systems 
(supporting content validity) on a five -point (pathophysiologic) severity scale. It has been slightly 
adapted to form the CIRS -G (CIRS geriatric), for which guidelines to enhance reliability have been 
formulated. Criterion validity has been confirmed by [CONTACT_112632] (the gold standard) with those based on health histories 
and chart reviews40,41. The CIRS was correlated with four other measures of comorbidity. Three 
out of five corr elation coefficients exceeded 0.40, supporting concurrent validity. There is little 
evidence to support predictive validity. Small to fair positive correlations in the anticipated 
directions have been found for other variables, such as medication usage, ADL, IADL, and age, 
supporting construct validity41. Interrater and test- retest reliability are good.  
In the present protocol , the CIRS is compi[INVESTIGATOR_77251] a medical d octor , on the basis of the physical 
examination and patient’s clinical history. It will provide an estimation at baseline of the overall burden of disease.  
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  
In SARA -INT (and in SARA -OBS) , the low physical performance is assessed first and defined by a 
low score as SPPB ≤ 8. It is imperative to perform the SPPB at the beginning  of the screening 
period, ahead of the DEXA or the ultrasound scans. The SPPB is  a series of tests designed to 
examine physical movements
1. The first test examines balance (without the assistance of a cane 
or walker) with the feet placed in [ADDRESS_125518] leg strength.  
The SPPB, originally developed for the Established Populations for the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_112575] (EPESE) , is a brief performance battery based on timed short distance walk, repeated chair 
stands and balance test1, 29. The battery is administered by [CONTACT_112633]. The measurement 
goal for this battery is to assess lower extremity functional limitations, which indicate s functional 
abilities and is a strong measure of risk for future disabi lity. This test takes about [ADDRESS_125519]. It has been administered to over 20,000 people  in various studies and no serious injuries 
are known to ha ve occurred. The components of the battery are as follows:  
- Walking speed.  Walking speed is assessed by [CONTACT_112634] a 4  m course. Participants are instructed to stand with both feet 
touching the starting line and to start walking after a specific verbal command. 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 91 Participants are allowed to use walking aids (cane, walker, or other walking aid) if 
necessary, but not the assistance of another person. Timing begins when the foot starts 
to move across the starting line and the time in seconds needed to complete the entire 
distance is recorded. The faster of two walks is used to compute walking speed.  
- Chair stands.  The repeated ch air stands test is performed using a straight -backed chair, 
which is placed with its back against a wall. Participants are first asked to stand once from a sitting position without using their arms. If they are able to perform the task, 
they are then asked  to stand up and sit down five times, as quickly as possible. The time 
to complete the task is recorded.  
- Standing balance . For the test of standing balance, participants are asked to maintain 
balance in three positions, characteri zed by a progressive  narro wing of the base 
support:  with feet together (side by [CONTACT_112635]), the heel of one foot beside the big 
toe of the other foot (semi tandem position), and the heel of one foot in front of and 
touching the toes of the other foot (tandem position). For each  of the three positions, 
participants are timed to a maximum of [ADDRESS_125520] of balance, participants are assigned a score 
of 1 if they can hold a side -by-side standing position for 10 seconds but are unable to 
hold a semi -tandem position for 10 seconds; a score of 2 is assigned if they can hold a 
semi -tandem position for 10 seconds, but are unable to hold a full -tandem position for 
3 seconds; a score of 3 is assigned if they can stand in a full -tandem position for 
3 seconds  but less than 10 seconds; a score of 4 is assigned if they can stand in a 
full tandem position for 10 seconds.  
Four categories are computed for walking speed and chair stands, according to cut -off 
points that are based on quartiles of the time to perform each task assessed in the 
EPESE.  The time of the faster of two walks is scored as follows: > 8.7 sec = 1; 6.21 to 
8.70 sec = 2; 4.82 to 6.20 sec = 3; < 4.82 sec = 4; a scor e of [ADDRESS_125521]. The time required to perform five chair stands is scored as 
follows: ≥ 16.70 sec = 1; 13.70 to 16.69 sec = 2; 11.20 to 13.69 sec = 3; ≤ 11.19 = 4. A 
score of 0 is assigned to participants unable to perform the task. A summary score 
ranging from 0 (worst performers) to 12 (best performers) is calculated by [CONTACT_112636] -
scores from the walking speed, chair stands and balance tests.  
The SPPB test will be performed during  screening , at M3 and then at M6 or the e nd-of-study visit . 
During  screening,  it will allow evaluat ion of  the patients’ lower extremities physical function 
impairment and to measure loss of physical function.  
The instructions for  perform ing the SPPB test as well as for h ow to score each component will be 
standardi zed through the participating cent ers before the beginning of the study.

Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 91 Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)  
In SARA -INT, the definition of the muscle mass component of sarcopenia is based on the 
operational criteria proposed by [CONTACT_112637]2. FNIH reports triggered a re -appraisal of 
existing operational definitions of sarcopenia, such as  the one from the  EWGSOP , that were 
mostly based on experts’ consensus. The new findings of the FNIH rel ied on a meta -analysis of 
eleven clinical trials with men and women ≥  65 years. Applying the Classification and Regression 
Tree (CaRT) statistical model allow ed for  testing of  several  variables that best predict ed low gait 
speed and weakness  which are  the two functional consequences of age -related sarcopenia.  
The FNIH project report recommended two alternative gender -specific measures  to be used to 
define low muscle mass2. The first FNIH definition, ALM -to- BMI ratio  or ALM /BMI, is the one 
recommended by [CONTACT_112638], while the second  definition using the  ALM  alone is proposed 
as an alternative.  
DEXA scan examination should be  performed during  the later phase of the screening period after 
the SPPB assessment . This should be performed only if most of the screening procedures , with 
the exception of the ultrasound and the 400MW test, have  passed  the inclusion criteria . 
DEXA is a simple, quick and non- invasive examination . DEXA scan s can provide accurate 
measurements of body composition, recording fat and lean mass distribution throughout the 
entire body. Radiation exposure for the participant is relatively low , approx.  0.0042 mSv for an 
adult scanned  on the Hologic Discovery A device42.  
DEXA exams will be standardi zed through the study participating cent ers. 
400 Meter Walk (400MW)  Test 
The 400MW  test is a measure of how long it takes a participant to walk a distance of [ADDRESS_125522] (yes/no) and the ability to complete the test at all (yes/no) are factored in as variables. Since the gait speed measured during the 400MW 
test is defined as the primary endpoint, it is imperati ve to perform the 400MW test as the last 
test during the screening  period , on Day 0 (prior to randomization) or within [ADDRESS_125523] will be performed at the study cent ers. Study participants will receive instr uctions to walk 
400 m on a 20 m walking course (20 laps of 20 m) following a [ADDRESS_125524] 
encouragement from the study team. Instructions will be to walk at the usual pace . (For precise 
instructions and to obtain the script to be followed, please refer to the study handbook and/or 
the SARA portal digital version of the instructions and script).  
Non- disabled participants are defined as participants who are  able to walk [ADDRESS_125525] the wall, or assistance of another 
person or walker , and  will be the primary study outcome assessed.  
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125526] without any as sistance (i.e. successful test or onset of mobility disability) will 
be reported in the eCRF . 
The inability to complete the 400MW test  during the screening period  is an exclusion criterion.  
If the participant is unable to complete the [ADDRESS_125527] as well as to evaluate it (including timing) will be standardi zed 
throughout  the study cent er teams.  
The choice of gait speed  meas ured using the  400MW test as a primary  outcome in SARA- INT is 
justified by [CONTACT_112639] (LIFE -P30, LIFE15, SPRINT -T17, VIVE2, etc.). 
Gait speed, a continuous variable, is well adapted to a phase  [ADDRESS_125528] also provides a dichotomous result (i.e., capacity/incapacity to complete the task) that 
accurately reflects a specific and clinically relevant condition, which  is mobility disability1. The 
ability to walk 400 m is a proxy for mobility within the community and independent  living16. As 
opposed to walking tests aimed at measuring the reserve capabilities of an individual (e.g. 6MWT), the 400MW  test is very safe and does not need to be performed as fast as possible. On the other 
hand, the relatively long distance walked allows identification of those individuals with mobility limitation but who may appear to be well functioning during  shorter tests (e.g., 4 meters). The 
15-minute  time limit of the 400MW  test is indeed there to differentiate the mobility efficiency of 
the individual. The inability to complete the 400MW test  has already been used as the defining 
criterion for mobility disability in major clinical trials, in particular the LIFE -P and full -scale 
projects
15,30. It has been demonstrated that the capacity of the [ADDRESS_125529] major 
negative health -related events (including disability and mortality) is independent of 
comorbidities.  
A difference of change  from baseline  of 0. 1 m/s is determined to be the  minimal clinically 
meaningful change between treatment group s based on preliminary analysis of the SARA -OBS 
participants, and a change of 0. 1 m/sec will also be  considered as a substantia l clinically 
meaningful change to patients, according to Perera et al , 200636. 
[ADDRESS_125530] (6MWT)  
The 6MWT is a test for functional exercise capacity and involves measuring the distance a participant can cover within the allotted time of 6 minutes.  
The 6MWT has gained importance in the assessment of functional exercise capacity in patients 
with chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765]. It has been used in many studies with elderly people. The 6MWT 
has proved to be reliable, inexpensive, safe and easy to apply
43,44. In addition, it correlates well 
with important outcomes including death45,46. Considerable variability was observed in the

Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 91 distance walked  in the 6MWT in studies performed by [CONTACT_112640]46,47. The study 
performed with healthy elderly study partici pants aged 50 -85 years47 showed that the 6MW T 
distance  ranged from 383 to 820 m. On average, the distance was 631  ± [ADDRESS_125531], 
from a functional point of view, the 6MWT can be used to assess the physical fitness and exercise capacity of individuals with poo r physical condition, heart disease or advanced age as described 
in several studies
1,49. 
The 6MWT should be performed indoors  in a long (approximately 100 m), flat, straight, enclosed 
corridor with a hard surface. The walking course could be 30 m in length; with length marked 
every [ADDRESS_125532] should be stopped at the onset of any of the following:  
• Chest pain  
• Intolerable dyspnea  
• Leg cramps  
• Staggering 
• Diaphoresis  
• Pale/ashen appearance  
Further information on required equipment , patient preparation, measurements and safety 
issues are available in the Guideline for the Six -Minute Walk Test31. The distance walked in the 
6MWT will be measured at Day  [ADDRESS_125533] (SCPT)  
Locomotion on stairs is among the most challenging and hazardous activities of daily living for older individuals. This is evidenced by [CONTACT_112641] 10% of 
fatal fall accidents
50. Moreover, stairs require greater range of motion from the joints of the lower 
limb and greater muscle strength, with the demands on the joints and muscles differing between stair ascent and descent.  Stairs are a more advanced activity of daily living and thereby [CONTACT_112642]
51. All the features render the 
ability to climb one of the key markers of functional independence in older adults52. However, 
there is still a great need for a better characteriz ation for stair negotiation (stair climbing and 
descent) as this activity has been identified as a major limitation in functional assessment in 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125534] multiple limitations. Stairs are currently increasingly being used in clinical practice as both an assessment tool and as part of exercise programs
54. The benefit of the SCPT is that stairs 
are readily available, convenient, and cheap to use. The SCPT has been considered as a clinically relevant measure of leg power impairment as the results are consistent with more complex 
techniques for measuring leg power (double leg press at 40 and 70% of the one -repetition 
maximum) and performance (SPPB with components of gait speed, chair stand time and standing balance)
54.  
The SCPT measures the ability to ascend and descend stairs and tests lower body strength and 
balance and measures  time (in seconds) taken to ascend and descend a flight of stairs ( 10 steps 
with a 20  cm step height; a handrail is recommended). Step heights should be suitable (between 
16 and 20  cm). Measurements will be performed at Day [ADDRESS_125535] will be performed at Day  0 and at M6  visit or the end-of-intervention 
visit. 
At Day 0 it will allow the evaluation of the patients’ strength or weakness and characterization of 
loss of muscle strength in the context of low physical performance and sarcopenia.  
The instructions to perform the test as well as how to score each component will be standardi zed 
through the study cent ers before the beginning of the study.  
Knee Extension Test ( optional according to center feasibility ) 
Strength can be measured isometrically or isokinetically, the latter being a closer reflection of 
muscle function in everyday activity. Isometric strength testing of maximal voluntary contractions 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125536] seated in an adjustable straight -back chair, the lower 
leg unsupported and the knee flexed to 90°57. 
The knee extension measurement will be performed using protocols described in  several 
publications57, and using preferably the Biodex System isokinetic dynamometer. Isometric knee 
extension torque will be measured with a knee extension dynamometer chair. The participants 
will be positioned in an upright position, with straps to aff ix the hips to the chair and the ankle to 
a force or torque transducer at the knee angle of 90°. Lever arm length will be recorded as the distance between the knee axis of rotation and the middle of the pad. After 3 warm -up trials at 
50 and 90% of self -perceived maximal strength, 3 trials will be conducted to measure maximal 
voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the knee extension muscle. For each attempt, maximal force 
or torque will be recorded by [CONTACT_112643] d on the computer. Each assay will b e 
separated by a [ADDRESS_125537] torque 
output will be taken for analyses.  
PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES:  
Short Form- 36 (SF -36) 
The SF-[ADDRESS_125538] widely used, validated measures of health -related quality of life and 
has been shown to discriminate between study participants  with different chronic conditions and 
between study participants  with differe nt severity levels of the same disease
34,35. The SF -36 has 
also demonstrated sensitivity to significant treatment effects in a variety of patient populations. 
Population- based normative data on the SF -36 is available for the [LOCATION_002] and other 
countri es as well.  
This instrument addresses health concepts that are relevant to the patient's perspective. There is no single overall score for the SF -36, instead, it generates 8 subscales and two summary scores. 
The 8 subscales are: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role -limitations due to emotional 
problems, and mental health. The two summary scores are the physical component summary and the mental component s ummary. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 -100 scale on the 
assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score , the more disability ; the 
higher the score the , less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a 
score of 100 is equivalent to no disability).  
The physical function sub- score of PF-10, role limitations due to physical problems, will be a key 
secondary endpoint of SARA -INT. PF -10 has been tested in numerous clinical trials and is 
consider ed a simple  and effective measure of mobility disability and is also often used in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037] (Syddal l, 2009
35). Climbing one flight of stairs (no change versus decline 
of two levels ) with a  2-point  difference ) or walking a block (no change versus two levels decline) 
exemplifies a substantial meaningful change, as appreciated by [CONTACT_1962] (Perera, 200636).

manua lly as provided by [CONTACT_112645] . 
Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT -D) 
The Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT -D) is a disability questionnaire that was developed 
to assess difficulty with functioning in both discrete tasks and social/role functioning. The PAT -D 
has been widely used in randomized controlled trials and observational studies in a variety of 
chronic health conditions58. There are three domains: mobility, activities of daily living, and 
instrumental activities of daily living. Th is questionnaire asks respondents how much difficulty 
they have had with a range of activities in the past month due to their health. For each i tem, 
respondents answer on a 5 -point Likert -type scale whether they experience: (1) no difficulty, (2) 
a little difficulty, (3) some difficulty, (4) a lot of difficulty, or (5) unable to do. For each item there is also a ‘not applicable’ option if the respondent usually did not do that activity for reasons other 
than disability. The PAT -D produces a score for each of the three domains as well as a total score, 
with higher scores indicating greater disability. 
This questionnaire will be administ ered  by [CONTACT_941] c linical cent er personnel  at Day  0 and M6 .  
Sarcopenia Quality of Life (SarQoL)  
The SarQoL  is a sarcopenia -specific, self -administered, quality of life questionnaire designed for 
community- dwelling elderly study participants  aged 65 years and older
59. The questionnaire will 
be provided to study participants  in the appropriate language. The questionnaire contains 22 
questions, which take s approximately 10 minutes to complete. The questionnaire covers 7 
domains: physical and mental h ealth; locomotion; body composition; functionality; activities of 
daily living; leisure activities; and fears. Most questions are answered on a [ADDRESS_125539] SIO Disabilità Obesità Correlata (TSD -OC) 
The TSD -OC is considered a reliable and valid instrument for measuring self -reported disability in 
obese subjects60. The questionnaire is a set of multiple questions in 7 dimensions to measure pain; 
stiffness; function and autonomy in daily activities, housework, outdoor activities, occupational 
activities, and social life. Each question is scored by [CONTACT_112646] 0 (best) to 10  (worst). Each 
dimension score is calculated and then all dimension scores are added together  for a total TSD-
OC score.  
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
Several procedures and evaluations in SARA -INT clinical protocol will be performed to monitor 
the study intervention’s safety. Some of those are necessary for other purposes (e.g., screening, 
eligibility, and enrollment ).  
• Physi cal examination : a standard medical exam of all organ systems to detect possible 
concomitant conditions that could represent an exclusion criterion (e.g. food ulcer, lower 
limbs arterial insufficiency, severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_22342], etc. ) 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 91 • Anthropometry : includes height and weight, subcutaneous tissue thickness (with the help 
of a plicomet er) and various circumference measurements   
• Short Form - Mini Nutritional Assessment (SF -MNA): this is a [ADDRESS_125540] range of HCPs in a variety of settings. Currently, this instrument is administered by [CONTACT_112647] p rofessiona ls to determine patients’ nutritional 
status (Huhmann et al, 2013)
61  
• Vital signs  (pulse  and blood pressure)  are measured at screening, M1, M3 and M6 (or e nd-
of-study) visits. These are measured twice, in lying or sitting and standing position s   
• Electrocardiograms ( ECGs): this is performed for screening purposes only. It will be read 
locally, in order to exclude any underlying  cardiac diseases that could represent an 
exclusion criteria. Meaningful abnormalities will be reported on the eCRF . The original will 
be kept in the source documents . This should be conducted prior to the start of any 
physical functional assessments (e.g. the 400MW test) for the safety of the study participants 
• Radiographic or other imaging assessments:  1) DEXA scan in SARA -INT is mostly devoted 
to assess body composition in terms of appendicular lean body mass, at screening visit 
and M6 (or end-of-study visit). DEXA scan s could be  performed up to 8 weeks before

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS  (AE)  
An a dverse  event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
An AE is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76260], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], bas ed upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requir ing intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For AEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity:  
• Mild  – Events that require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the study 
participant’s daily activities  
• Moderate – Events that result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning  
• Severe  – Events that interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other  treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION  
All AEs must have their relationship to the study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_112651]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about any causa lity will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical 
trial, the study product must always be suspect ed.  
 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 91 • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (de -challenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within  a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely 
to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (de -challenge). Re -challenge information is not 
required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed t o the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “ potentially 
related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “ definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not o ccur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the study intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
For any reported AE, the study investigator will report the relationship to study intervention  in 
the eCRF . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The DSMB  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
The expectedness determination will take place during periodic review s, or exceptional review s, 
as needed.  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLO W-UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits , 
during  interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor. All AEs i ncluding local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be 
captured on the appropriate report form. Information to be collected includes event description, 
time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by 
[CONTACT_112611]- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 91 those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to ade quate resolution.  
A SAE follow -up includes a prompt blood sampling for PK analyses, if deemed applicable by [CONTACT_112652]/her staff. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the study 
participant is screened will be considered as  baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the 
study participant’s condition deteriorates while performing any physical assessments at any time  
after signing the ICF  (including the screening period ), it will be recorded as an AE. Unanticipated 
problems ( UPs) will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. AEs characteri zed as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_112577]. At each study visit, the investig ator will inquire 
about the occurrence of AE s/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome 
information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_125542] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are SAEs  (e.g. all -cause mortality) must be 
reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence su ggesting a causal relationship 
between the study intervention and the event (e.g. death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the 
investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the  site investigator deems the event 
to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_36909] ( DCC) /study sponsor and should be provided as soon 
as possible.  
The study sponsor wi ll be responsible for notifying the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -
threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible , but in no case later than 7 calendar

Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 91 8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving 
risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given:  
• The research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as 
the IEC/IRB- approved research protocol and informed consent document  
• The characteristics of the participant population being studied  
• The event is r elated or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
• The suggestion  that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized  
This study will use the OHRP definition of UP.  
 In this study,  in which tests an investigational drug in older adults, and applies well established 
diagnostic tests and procedures, all precautions will be taken for prompt detection and reporting of UPs. 
 
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M REPORTING  
 
The investigator  will report all medi cally relevant UPs to .  will report to the lead 
principal investigator (PI), Sponsor, the DSMB and the reviewing IRB. 
The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identif ication information including  protocol title and number, PI’s name, and 
the IRB project number 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP  
• A descri ption of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are SAE s will be rep orted to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within 24 h  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event  
• Any other UP s will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 7 days  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem

level, a power of 80%, to detect a difference of 0.05  m/s (minimal clinically important difference ) 
between active groups and placebo on the change from baseline in the [ADDRESS_125545] deviation of 0.13 (estimated from the VIVE2 trial, Fielding et al, 201762).  
After analysis of the preliminary data from our observational trial data (SARA -OBS, with approx. 
105 completers), the following were lear ned: 
• During the [ADDRESS_125546] 
deviation of the change f rom baseline of 0.2  
• The expected effect of BIO101 remains at 0.05 meter per second, as the change from 
baseline  
• Together, this new information allows an increase of up to 0.1 m/s to be considered as a 
minimal clinically important difference of changes at the M6 visit from ba seline  between 
the treatment groups . Under these assumptions, a number of 64 patients/group is 
needed, giving a new sample- size of [ADDRESS_125547] deviation of 
0.20 (estimated from SARA- OBS preliminary data). 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 91 Taking into consideration this increased expected difference between treatment arms, a formal 
interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_112653] 6 visit (See 
section 9.4.6). Once half study participants complete  their End-of intervention  study visit, an 
unblinded ‘promising zone’ interim analysis will take place and determine if there is a need to 
increase the sample size based on the complete efficacy data.  
Based on current calculation and  given a limited 20% provision for premature withdrawals  or lost -
to-follow up , a total number of 23 1 participants will be included in the study.  
It is expected, that due to COVID -19 related restrictions, that the number of non -evaluable 
withdrawals will be higher than 20%. Ho wever, reassessment of the sample size, will take place, 
as a part of the interim analysis, that will take place after restrictions are lifted.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
The following analysis populations will be considered:  
- The safety  population consists of all patients randomized in the study for whom there is any 
evidence that they used study medication  and for whom any follow -up information is 
available. 
- The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  population consists of randomized study participant s, potentially 
excluding a few  participants who  failed to take at least one dose of trial medication and had 
a very early withdrawal (first week after randomization) definitely not related to study 
medication and lack ed any post randomization data (CPMP/I CH/363/96).  
- The Per Protocol (PP)  population will exclude FAS patients with major protocol deviations that 
are related to drug administration (e.g. a long interruption period, see section 7.1)  that may 
impact the efficacy analysis. The exclusion of patients from the PP population will be 
determined in a blinded data review meeting that will be held prior to the disclosure of the randomization list. Reason(s) for exclusion will be provided for each patient.  
The safety population (all the included patients having taken the product at least once) will be the 
set for the safety analyses.  
Concerning the main endpoint and the key secondary endpoints, the FAS population will be the 
population of interest (main population). However, for sensitivity purpose, the corresponding analyses (mixed models and logistic regression models) will also be fitted on the PP population.  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
The SAP will be  finalized & signed- off before database lock and unblinding.  
All inferential tests will be two -tailed and with a 5% alpha risk, unless otherwise specified.  
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval for mean, minimum, 
median, maximum, and number of observations and missing cases) will be used for quantitati ve 
variables, and frequencies and percentages will be used for categorical variables. The descriptions will be broken down by [CONTACT_1570].  
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 91 A Hochberg procedure will be used to deal with the multiplicity concern on the main endpoint  
and the key secondary endpoints. Other multiplicity concerns (relative to secondary endpoints) 
are kept under control by [CONTACT_7416] -specification of key -secondary endpoints and a low number of 
secondary endpoints and analyses.  
Due to the quantitative form of the endpoints (gait speed  PF10 and handgrip strength test) and 
the large number of patients, the normal assumption for the residuals of the mixed models will 
be assumed. However, if found necessary, additional non -parametric approach c ould be added 
and detailed in the SAP of the study.  
The covariates included in the models are the stratification factors ( gender and center) and the 
baseline score of the parameter if available. No interactions will be included by [CONTACT_112654], h owever , in case of interesting findings in the subgroup analyses, further analyses would 
be conducted.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOIN T(S)  
A Mixed Effect Model Repeat Measurement ( MMRM) model with fixed factors in treatment, in 
center s, the baseline score and the stratification factor ( gender ) will produce an estimate of the 
contrast at M6 in the change from baseline of the 400MW test gait speed between each active 
arm and the placebo group (after adjustment by [CONTACT_112655]).   
The MMRM m odel will give a correct estimation in presence of missing data, under the Missing 
at Random ( MAR) assumption. This analysis will provide an estimand of the efficacy of the tested 
product in the population that  stayed in the study for the entire  6 months.  Additional sensitivity 
analyses may be added in the SAP during the blind -review meeting if the number of missing data 
is important (more than 10%).  
The same model will be also fitted in the Per Protocol population to give an estimand of the efficacy of the product in the population with good compliance.  
Alternative methods to adjudicate missing data for the primary endpoint like the Bayesian 
Multiple Imputation  (MI) metho ds could be considered and adopted b efore to finalize the SAP. 
Chen at al (2 017) demonstrated the interest of applying Bayes ian MI method to 400MW non -
completers in the LIFE study
63.  
Additionally, a responder analysis will be provided, using a logistic regression (with the same fixed 
factors as the mixed model) to model the chance to be a responder for the 400MW test 
(improvement of 0. 1 m/s or more).  The odd s ratio of each active group versus placebo will be 
provided with a 95%  confidence interval ( CI).

Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 91 9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The key secondary endpoints ( handgrip strength and  PF-10 sub- score  of the SF -36) will be 
analyz ed with the same strategy as the primary  endpoint ( i.e. using a repeated measures  mixed 
model to estimate the contrast at M6 of the difference of each active group versus placebo).  
Missing data will not be replaced in these analyses but the MMRM model on observed data is 
known to perform well under a MAR hypothesis.  
Additional sensitivity analyses may be added in the SAP during the blind -review meeting if the 
number of missing data is important (more than 10%).  
Concerning the responder endpoints:   
1. for the  PF-10 sub -score of the SF -36, a responder analysis will be performed with a 
responder definition of “patient with an improvement of PF -10 greater or equal to 2 
points versus baseline”, at an individual level.  
2. for the h andgrip strength test: a responder definition is equal to the minimal 
significant benefit set at least 2 kg of improvement versus baseline, at an individual level.  
The rate of responders (according to the predefined definition s provided in the corresponding 
endpoint sections) will be provided in each group of treatment at M3 and M6 visits  for the PF -[ADDRESS_125548]. Participants  without any 
assessment  for a parameter at a visi t will be considered as non -responder for the corresponding 
parameter. 
A logistic regression model with treatment group, gender  and center as fixed effects will be used 
to compare each active group versus placebo at M6. The odd s-ratio comparing groups will  be 
provided as well as its 95% confidence interval. The multiplicity issue due to the two doses of 
active treatment will be addressed using  the Hochberg procedure.  
The other secondary and exploratory endpoints will be analyz ed only in the FAS population.  
Details and exploratory endpoints analyses will be provided in the SAP.

In addition, sample -size reassessment, will take place, based on an interim analysis, which will 
take place once the COVID -19 restriction is lifted, to account for additional non -evaluable 
withdrawals and other considerations, based on reduced activity of participants due to 
restrictions.

Safety variables will be summari zed/analyz ed by [CONTACT_112656], on the Safety population . 
Vital signs, biochemistry and hematology  parameters will be described by [CONTACT_9086], 
for the entire period of the study and  at each timepoint.

The disposition of study participants at each visit will be described, by [CONTACT_1570] s and overall, 
as well as the number of premature discontinuations and their main reasons.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the pati ents will be presented overall and by 
[CONTACT_112657] (mean, standard deviation, median , range and number 
of missing cases for quantitative parameters and percentages and number of missing cases for 
the qualitative parameters ). 
Compliance will also be described and compared by [CONTACT_1570] s. Details of the calculations 
will be provided in  the SAP of the study.

postponed. The timing of this analysis will be defined once restrictions are lifted and will take into 
account, COVID -19 related non- evaluable withdrawals  and reduction of activity.   
The sample size increase will use the ‘promising  -zone’  method of Mehta and Pocock  (Mehta, 
2011)64 for an interim analysis . This approach ensures that the sample size is only increased in 
case the interim results are promising, in which case the overall type -I error is not inflated by [CONTACT_112658]. More specifically, this ‘promising zone’ is defined in terms of 
the conditional probability of rejecting the null -hypothesis at final analysis, given the estimated 
difference at interim (‘conditional power’) and assuming that this estimated difference is the true underlying difference.  Depending on the condi tional power (CP) at interim analysis, we consider 
three different zones and anticipated actions:  
1. Unfavorable zone  
The interim results are so disappointing that it is not worth to increase the sample size to retrieve 
CP and the original sample size is r etained. This zone will be defined for a sample size 
reassessment at 50% information fraction and a maximal increase in sample size 100 additional 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 91 participants . Note that in case the observed gait speed difference  at interim below the threshold 
defined in the SAP, the study would stop for futility.  
2. Promising zone:  
If the CP is below the originally planned 0.80, the sample size will be increased to the maximal 
sample size of 330.  
3. Favorable zone  
The conditional power is at least 0.80. In this zone, th e interim results are sufficiently favorable 
for the trial to continue to the original sample size without the need to adaptively increase the 
trial size.  
The DSMB will be responsible for reviewing accumulated safety and efficacy data at intervals through out the study.  
In particular, the DSMB will evaluate the results of a formal pre -planned interim futility analysis 
and sample size reassessment. The DSMB will recommend to the Sponsor whether to continue, 
modify or stop the clinical trial based on futility but also on safety issues or other considerations 
not related to efficacy or safety.  In case the study continues and the original sample size is 
retained, the DSMB will not communicate to anyone whether this is due to unfavorable or 
favorable results.  
 
9.4.8  SUBGROUP ANALYSES  
A predefined subgroup efficacy analysis will be performed in a number of pre -identified, at -high 
risk of worsening, subpopulations:  
• Low gait speed  
• Sarcopenic obesity 
• Study participants with a chair stand sub -score of ≤2 of the SPPB  
• Study participants who experience a deterioration in their ALM/BMI as measured by [CONTACT_112659] M6 visit compared to the baseline measurement  
  
The subgroup analyses based on these factors will be performed in order to better characterize 
treatment benef its in patients with increased  risk of mobility disability. Results will be presented 
in forest -plots graphs, for both the primary  endpoint and the 2 key secondary endpoints. 
Parameters of low gait speed ( 4-meter walk with a gait speed < 0.8 m/s) and sarcopenic obesity 
(having a percentage of body fat mass of >25% in men and >35% in women) will be used as 
stratification factors, as well as important demographics or baseline characteristics such as gender , age,  country, etc.

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 91 With the participant’s approval and as approved by [CONTACT_112666], de -identified biological samples 
will be stored at the Sponsor premises or at an independent Biobank (according to local 
legislat ion) with the same goal as the sharing of data. These samples could be used to research 
the causes of sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity, its complications and other conditions for which 
individuals with sarcopenia  or sarcopenic obesity are at increased risk, and to improve treatment. 
The third part  will also be provided with a code -link that will allow linking the biological specimens 
with the phenotypic data from each participant, maintaining the blinding of the identity of the 
participant.  During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research. Ho wever, withdrawal of consent with regard to 
biosample storage may not be possible after the study is completed.   When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the Sponsor or the mandated Biobank . 
With the partic ipant’s approval and as approved by [CONTACT_50810], genetic material from de -identified   
samples collected under this protocol may be used to study sar copenia and sarcopenic obesity. 
DNA material will be kept for secondary research.  
Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited. Samples and data will be stored using codes 
assigned by [CONTACT_473]. Data will be kept in password -protected computers. During the 
study, only investigators and laboratory personnel will have access to the samples. Both investigators and Biophytis/Biophytis representatives will have access to de -identified data.  
Disposition at the completion of the study: all stored samples will be sent to a central storage 
facility. Study participants who request destruction of samples will be notified of compliance with such request and all supporting details will be maintained for tracking.

  The overall organi zational structure of the SARA -INT Clinical Trial will be organiz ed and managed 
through the following bodies:  
- SARA Managing Board (on behalf of the Sponsor)  
- Steering Committee (independent)  
- Plenum: all the study investigators (independent)  
- Data Safety Monitoring Board (independent)  
- Independent Scientific Advi sory Board  
This governance structure is meant to guarantee a high level of the scientific quality of SARA -INT. 
The SARA Managing Board  
The Managing Board is composed by [CONTACT_112668] . 
Main responsibilities inc lude:  
- Making and implementing strategic decisions as advised by [CONTACT_112669]  
- Coordinating and optimi zing the study resources 
- Monitoring the progress of the SARA -INT activities with respect to its objectives  
- Identifying possible issues and proactively proposing solutions  
- Coordinating communication activities  
It is envi sioned  that the Board will meet regularly, at least once every [ADDRESS_125554] as Secretary of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will be able to invite other experts from Biophytis and Biophytis subcontractors , e.g. 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 91 clinical operations, clinical development, etc. as deemed necessary for the purpose of the 
meetings.  
The Plenum  
The Plenum consists of all SARA -INT Investigators  and will be chaired by [CONTACT_112670]. The 
Plenum can be asked  to meet and advise on topi[INVESTIGATOR_112579], their possible improvements and/or opportune changes.  
The Plenum will meet at least once a year to conduct a general project review and project outlook  
and will meet via teleconference in case an urgent decision has to be under taken based on their 
advice. 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
The DSMB  is periodically review ing all safety data and raise alerts in case of negative or dangerous 
findings. Members of the DSMB will be selected based on their expertise by [CONTACT_112671] . 
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_125555] of SPPB, (for rules of 
conversion see MCDermott, 200758) with a comprehensive individual case obj ective evaluation. 
Precise rules will be endorsed by [CONTACT_112672].  
Any effort will be undertaken to contact [CONTACT_112673]- up, 
including home visits where feasible.  
The Scientific Advisory Board  (SAB)  
This is an independent advisory committee, able to advi se and discuss the overall study conduct 
and scientific bas is in view of ongoing progress of knowledge within the scientific community. The 
SAB will meet yearly and may ask DSMB questions and recommend specific actions to the other 
governance committees.  
 
 
10.1.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
 
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a DSMB composed of individuals with the 
appropriate expertise, including geriatrics, gerontology, clinical trial methodology, human and clinical nutrition, internal medicine, bioethics, data privacy and ethics of information technologies, informatio n and communication technologies applied to health (e -health) . 
Members of the DSMB should be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or measures should be in place to minimize perceived conflict of interest. The DSMB will 
meet quarterly to assess safety data of all study participants  enrolled in the study. The DMSB will 
operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. At this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB will provide its input to the Study Managing Board and will answer questions from  the Steering Committee and the Scientific Advisory Board.  
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125556] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with ICH GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
• Monitoring for this study will be performed by  [CONTACT_3655] 
• On-site monitoring will be complemented by [CONTACT_112674]. The first on-
site visit will take place no later than 4 weeks after the start of clinical activities. Frequency 
will be adapted according to the center inclusion rate.  Training on the study procedures , 
including the use of eCRF  will be provided jointly by [CONTACT_112675]. T argeted review of critical data and targeted data verification of endpoint s, 
safety and other key data variable s will be specified in the Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP ) 
• The Sponsor  will be provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_10376] 10  days of visit  
• Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a CMP. The CMP describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency the monitoring will be done, at what 
level of  detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports  
• Independent audits could  be conducted by [CONTACT_18484] a mandated sub -contractor to 
ensure monitoring practices are performed consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the CMP  
Planned Sponsor audits are postponed  during the COVID -19 outbreak and will resume once 
permitted under national, local and/or organizational social distancing restrictions.  
The investigator shall permit the Site Monitor  to review study data as frequently as deemed 
necessary to ensure that data are being recorded in an adequate manner and that protocol 
adherence is satisfactory.  
The investigator shall access medical records for the Monitor so that the entries in the eCRF  may 
be verified.  The investigator, as part of his/her responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with  
in ensuring that the study adheres to GCP requirements.  
The investigator may not start recruiting  study participants  into the study until a sponsor/  
monitor has conducted  a visit  to give a detailed review of the protocol and the eCRF.  Alternatively, 
with the agreement of the sponsor, attendance at the investigator meeting can be in lieu of an 
on-site visit by [CONTACT_112676].   
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_125557] of participants who  signed ICF s, protocol deviations with the identification of the  COVID -

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125558] operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the study is conducted and that the 
data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulato ry requirements. Specifically, for clinical operations, the SOPs of the CRO in 
charge,  will be applied.  
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with FDA regulations (CFR, Sections 
312.50 and 312.56) and with ICH GCP (CPMP 135/95).  
The investigator should  not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment 
approved by [CONTACT_85347]/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subject or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  
Any deviations may result in the subject having to be withdrawn from the study and render that subject non -evaluable. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_125559]  KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSI BILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
site investigator . The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All sour ce documents should be completed in a neat  and legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data. Source data are all informational, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial.  Electronic source data are data initially recorded in electronic form. Examples of 
source data include, but are not limited to : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, participa nts’ memory aids or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, audio recordings of counseling sessions, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, and participant files and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico -technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source documents.  If this is the case, it should be stated 
in this section what data will be collected on CRFs and what data will be collected from other sources.  
It is not acceptable for the CRF to be the only record of a participant’s inclusion in the study.  Study 
participation should be captured in a participant’s medical record.  This is to ensure that anyone 
who would access the patient medical record has adequate knowledge that the patient is participating in a clinical trial.  
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_112580] b e made available (as printable version of eCRF)  and 
could be used in addition to standard medical records  as source document  worksheets for 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 91 recording data for each participant enrolled in the study.  Data recorded in the eCRF derived from 
source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents .  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and 
clinical laboratory data will be e ntered into a proprietary eCRF , a [ADDRESS_125560] 
protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appea r inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the 
source documents.  
To obtain a high level of readability and easy data exchange between different systems, and to make statistical analysis easy, the following standards and dictionary will be used.  
1. CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) CDISC ODM v.1.3.2.  
2. CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) SDTM v. 1.4 or more recent 
versions as applicable  
3. MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities    
4. WHO -DD: World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  
This study will use a dedicated Information and Communication Technology (ICT) centraliz ed 
infrastructure for clinical data capture, different data source integration (e.g., DEXA sca n results, 
actimetry), PROs electronic entry, and secure data storage.  
The collected information will be initially handled and stored by  [CONTACT_112677]’s SARA Clinical Data Platform.  
The SARA Clinical Data Platform will allow to securely keep and access anonymi zed clinical data 
for the purpose of the clinical trial remote monitoring, managing, validation and result analyses.  
The investigator shall be provided with standardi zed eCRF and shall ensure th at all data from 
participant visits are promptly entered into the eCRF in accordance with the specific instructions 
given. The investigator must electronically sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data recorded.  Further det ails will be provided in the MOP . 
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the documentation to be collated prior to study start. If a central laboratory has been selected to conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analy zed at that laboratory.  
The investigator must maintain source documents, such as laboratory reports, X -rays, ECGs, 
consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports.  
For patients that are not able to use an  electronic device (desktop, laptop, tablet or analogous 
device) , a printed booklet will be made available to complete the PROs foreseen at the protocol. 
The PRO booklets should be considered to be a source data.  
After the end of SARA -INT clinical trial, SARA Clinical Data Platform will continue operations and 
allow secondary research on the collected data.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION  
The investigator/institution should maintain the study documents as specified in the ICH 
guidelines of GCP and as required by [CONTACT_1214]. The 

SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 3  20 April 2020  
Biophytis for SARA  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 91 investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destr uction of 
these documents.  
Essential documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_125561]. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_112678]. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to 
when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or the GCP.  Further 
details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.  
 The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study 
site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478].   These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality A ssurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
No changes from the final approved and signed protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and local competent 
authorities as applicable, except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the 
patients or when the change involves only non- substantial logistics or administration. Each 
investigator and the sponsor will sign the pr otocol amendment.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report all deviations to Biophytis and the local IRC/IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the ir IEC/IRB requirements.  
The sponsor expects that the COVID -19 situation will introduce more protocol deviations than 
normal. All protocol  deviations  will be accurately recorded  and identified as deviations that 
incurred due to the COVID -19 outbreak and as reasons why the procedures  were not 
performed  according to  protocol . They will be assessed and reported in the clinical study report, 
following ICH E3.  
 
10.1.11  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
The sponsor shall retain the ownership of all data. When the study is complete , the sponsor shall 
arrange the analysis and tabulation of data. A clinical study report shall then be prepared, which may be used for publication, presentation at scientific meetings or submission to regulatory 
SARA- INT  Version 1.2.11,  
Biophytis Protocol: BIO101-CL0 [ADDRESS_125562] to the sponsor's 
approval requirements.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_125563] been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC and IRB. The IEC and IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with the FDA, ICH GCP and 
local requirements as applicable. 
The IEC and IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes),  including but not limited to:  written informed consent documents and document 
updates, participant recru itment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be 
provided to the participants, available safety information, information about payment and 
compensation available to participants, the investigator's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence

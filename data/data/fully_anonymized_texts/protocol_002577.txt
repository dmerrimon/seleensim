1.Introduction
1.1 Background
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in aging as well as multiple diseases,
including heart failure . Multiple dietary supplements aim at improving mitochondrial
function, often without clear evidence of efficacy.  In myocardium, mitochondrial
dysfunction is characterized by [CONTACT_511184]/NAD+ ratio and mitochondrial
protein acetylation.  Recently, we have demonstrated in mice that intraperitoneal
administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD+ precursor, can incr ease
myocardial NAD+ levels and normalize the NADH/NAD+ ratio, decrease mitochondrial
protein acetylation, and protect against pressure overload -induced cardiac dysfunction..
Though NMN is not orally bioavailable, we and others have shown that oral
supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), th e precursor from which NMN i s
produced, also decreases (normalizes) tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio and impr oves
mitochondrial function in mouse models. These animal model results suggest a
conceptually innovative mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the development
and progression of heart failure that is distinct from the existing hypotheses of oxidati ve
stress and energy starvation. We hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR will
increase NAD+ levels, thereby [CONTACT_511185]/NAD+ ratio caused by [CONTACT_511186], and improve functional capacity and ventricularfunction in systolic heart failure.
We have data suggesting that NR is safe and well -tolerated at a dose of up to 1000mg
twice daily in humans:
1.1.1. We have completed an NIH -funded study of NR pharmacokinetics in 8 healthy 
volunteers, in which NR was up -titrated to a dose of 1000mg twice daily by [CONTACT_2006] 
7. NR appeared to be safe and well -tolerated in this Study (Airhart PLOS ONE
,
2017). Whole blood NAD+ levels increased by a mean of 100%
1.1.2. We currently are performing a  safety and tolerability trial of NR in 30 participants 
with clinically -stable, systolic heart failure. In this Study, patients are randomized 
2:[ADDRESS_661165] completed the Study. While we, as investigators, are therefore still blinded to Study results, the Study’s Data Safety and Monitorin g 
Committee (DSMC) has completed interim reviews Study results after completion 
of 10 and then 20 participants. Following each interim review, the DSMC 
recommended Study continuation .  
1.1.3. In a 2x6 -week double -blind crossover study of NR at a lower dose of 500mg BID, 
NR was well- tolerated in 24 participants completing the protocol.  This lower dose 
was associated with an approximately 60% increase in blood NAD+ levels —a 
lesser effect than seen with . While blood pressure (BP) was decreased with NR in those with “elevated” blood pressure (systolic BP >120mmHg or diastolic BP>  
80mmHg), it was unchanged in those with baseline BP <120/80.  
1.2 Study rationale 
While preliminary data show that oral NR supplementation increases myocardial NAD+ levels in mice, there has  been no direct evidence that suggests  oral NR increases NAD+ 
Clinical Study Protocol November 18,  [ADDRESS_661166] devices (LVADs). We recently submitted an R01 application (1 R01 HL144937-01) to the NHLBI to test the hypothesis that oral NR supplementation will increase myocardial NAD+ levels and improve cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function in participants with advanced heart failure planned for elective LVAD implantation. The NHLBI CICS Study Section recently reviewed this R01 application, giving it a Priority Score of 42 and a Percentile Score of 24%. However, each of the three Reviewers gave individual review category scores of 1-2 for Significance, Investigator(s), 2-3 for Innovation, but 3-6 for Approach, primarily for lack of preliminary data on feasibility. Therefore, to demonstrate feasibility, we propose to enroll 5 participants planned for LVAD implantation in a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_511173], up-titrated over 3 days to a final NR dose of 1000mg BID. Blood and myocardial tissue analyses collected previously from age- and gender-matched LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_511174]. We propose the following Aims:  Aim 1: Enroll [ADDRESS_661167] labs (including safety panels) drawn at baseline (Day 1), then receive escalating doses of NR to a maximum dose of 1000mg twice daily by [CONTACT_2006] 3. Participants will be continued on NR at 1000mg twice daily until LVAD implantation surgery. On the morning of LVAD implantation Surgery (Day 5 or later), participants will have final labs drawn. Samples of fresh cardiac tissue removed from the left ventricular apex during LVAD implantation surgery will be collected in the operating room. The primary analyses will be performed on NR-treated participants who were on the maximum NR dose of 1000mg twice daily for at least 2 days prior to LVAD implantation surgery. We will cap the maximum day of NR administration to 21 days. If the surgery doesn’t happen by [CONTACT_221774], we will exclude the patient from the study.  Aim 2: Determine the effect of NR (as compared to historical controls) on NAD(H) levels, mitochondrial function and its regulation through epi[INVESTIGATOR_511175]. a. Measure NAD+ and NADH levels in the blood and myocardium of the participants. b. Assess mitochondrial morphology and function in cardiac tissue using, respectively, EM and isolated mitochondria.  c. Determine protein acetylation in the mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial compartments and changes in nuclear gene regulation. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that NR improves mitochondrial function and reduces inflammatory response in HF patients receiving NR (as compared to historical controls).    a. Measure mitochondrial function in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC).  b. Determine the inflammatory response in PBMC. c. Compare effects on the circulating inflammasome vs. myocardial inflammation.   1.[ADDRESS_661168] on lipid levels. NR does not induce insulin resistance or dysglycemia in mouse models. Thus, NR would potentially be cheap, safe, well-tolerated and readily available.   2. Study Objectives Enroll 5 participants undergoing elective LVAD placement to study the effects of NR on whole blood and myocardial NAD+ levels, as well as on measures of PBMC and cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function. The effects of NR on blood and myocardial markers of inflammation also will be assessed. Blood and myocardial tissue collected previously from individuals at the time of LVAD implantation will serve as historical controls.  3. Study design 3.1 Design Overview This study is a single-center study to compare myocardial NAD+ level and other mitochondrial endpoints from NR administration with baseline untreated patients.  4. Study Population 4.1 Eligibility 4.1.1. Inclusion Criteria:   • Diagnosis of advanced heart failure. • Planned elective LVAD implantation surgery with patient agreements for candidacy in place as required by [CONTACT_511187]. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511176]. • Ability to undergo Study procedures. • Willingness/ability to provide informed consent.  4.1.2. Exclusion Criteria:  • Current smoking • Receiving certain concurrent supplements (to be determined at discretion of the PI). Note that UWMC Nutrition Care standards call for a general multivitamin (1 tab PO daily) as part of the advanced heart failure therapy (AHFT) work-up. • Known allergies to niacin or nicotinamide. • Hepatic, renal, endocrine, or neurological disease that disqualify them from consideration for LVAD implantation. • Inability to perform Study visits or procedures. • Unwillingness/inability to provide informed consent. • Women who are currently pregnant or who wish to become pregnant over the course of the study follow-up are not allowed to join this study. This exclusion is built into the LVAD candidate selection process.   4.2 Discontinuation of subjects from study treatment This is a study of a nutritional supplement. Two published trials of NR administration in healthy participants did not show any major adverse effects. We also will monitor for worsening in signs and symptoms of heart failure, by [CONTACT_511188], dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, arrhythmia/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_511177].

November 18,  2018 Version 1. 3 Page 10 of 11 
Participants may experience discomfort and bruising from blood draws. Rarely, an 
infection could develop.  
This is a study of a nutritional supplement. Two published trials of  NR administration in 
healthy participants did not show any major adverse effects . We also will monitor for 
worsening in signs and symptoms of heart failure, by [CONTACT_511189], 
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, arrhythmia/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_511180].  
9.Adequate Protection Against RiskRecruitment and Informed Consent.  Recruitment for this proposed study will be conducted
according to the IRB policies at the University of Washington, as well as HIPA A policies.
Potential study participants will be identified under HIPAA waiver by [CONTACT_14716].  Their
cardiologist will approve the approach before researcher contact.  Potential participant s
will be contact[CONTACT_511190], or seen in person if at the
clinic or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511181] . Only if the participant expresses any interest will we
continue study recruitment. Study staff will explain the study’s  purpose and design and
what would be required of participants. Then, the informed consent process will be
conducted by [CONTACT_424055] a study coordinator.  Participants will be encouraged to ask
questions and to share the information with their regular doctor. A copy of this consent will
be given to the participants; the original will be placed in the participant’s study chart.
Protection Against Risks . All access to individually identified participant data is limited to
the investigators who are directly involved in this research study,  the clinical research sta ff
of the Translational Research Unit  during the subjects’ visits, and the UWMC Research
Testing  Service . Study charts and password -protected databases are confidential and ar e
not released to outside parties except at the participant’s request. All blood samples for
laboratory analysis outside UWMC are ONLY identified by a study number. The St udy
charts containing paper forms will be stored in the locked file cabinets in the resear ch
clinics or offices where they only can be accessed by [CONTACT_473]. Each participantwill receive a unique study number. The study number is linked to the participa nt’

and linking.
Notification of Participants and Their Physicians.  A participant’s  primary cardiologist  (or
cardiology attending physician  if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511182]) will be any laborator y
abnormalities develop . We will leave the further clinical fol low-up and treatment plans t o
be made by [CONTACT_3038]’ physicians. Participants will not be notified of the results of
other laboratory studies performed specifically for this Study.
10.Potential Benefits of Research to the Participant and Others
Minimal . Although i ndividual participants may benefit from this study by [CONTACT_511191] a
nutritional supplement that has shown some promise in animal models of heart failure , it is
unlikely that a short -term NR administration will yield any substantial clinical improvemen t
or worsening in their clinical status.
11.Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained
To our knowledge, no data exist regarding whether orally administered NR increases
NAD+ levels or improves mitochondrial function in human myocardium. Therefore, we
propose a trial to test the effects of NR on NAD+ levels a nd mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] i n

Secondarily, we plan to determine, using samples obtained at surgery, whether whole blood NAD+ levels and PBMC mitochondrial function correlate with, respectively, myocardial NAD+ levels and myocardial mitochondrial function.  12. Data Safety Monitoring Board The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) previously constituted for our on-going NR in Heart Failure Study will amend its Charter to provide oversight of this proposed Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].  Safety reviews will be performed after Study completion by [CONTACT_511192] 5 planned participants receiving NR. Safety data will include pre-specified evaluation of parameters for blood glucose, myopathy, hepatotoxicity, renal function as well as signs/symptoms of heart failure, or other possible clinical side effects, as requested by [CONTACT_4318].

• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727292].  
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating 
Scale (WI -NRS).  
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -contro lled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727293] . Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be 
randomized in a 1 :[ADDRESS_993070] of three periods, for a total study period of  approximately

timeframe on a daily basis, to wear actigraphy devices during sleep,  and to comply 
with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82482].   
At the B aseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to r eceive 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg  or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken 
orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Study Day 1). Starting 
on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day orally . Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727294] . 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 8 of treatment.  
After completion of the treatment period  or early discontinuation of study drug , all 
subjects will enter a 2 week follow -up period.  
Safety Review:  An internal  safety monitoring team consisting of representatives from Menlo 
Therapeutics Inc. and its designees will monitor blinded safety data on a regular basis throughout the study.  
Planned Sample Size:  Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized. 
Study Population:  The study will consist of adults with plaque psoriasis who have pruritus.

Study Drug : Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo.  
Dosage:  Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]: [ADDRESS_993079] day of the treatment period.  
Matching placebo: Once daily by [CONTACT_5555] [ADDRESS_993080] day of the treatment period.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the WI-NRS 4 -point responder rate at Week 8. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• WI-NRS 4 -point responder rate at Week 4  
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Day 7  
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Day 3  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Change in number of night -time scratching events from baseline to Week 
8 
• Change in WI -NRS from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8  
• The WI-NRS 3 -point responder rate at Weeks 4 and 8  
• Change in Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity (sPGA)  
• Patient Global Impr ession of Change in Itch Severity (PGIC)  
Safety Endpoints:  Safety endpoints include the following:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs)  
• Change in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure  
• Changes in vital sign and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters following 
study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247006]:  Exploratory endpoints include the following:  
• Change in Body  Surface Area ( BSA ), and Physician Global Assessment

• Change in mean activity during the sleep period 
Decision Rule and Sample 
Size The decision rule is based on the Phase 2b screening methodology presented in 
Fleming and Richardson ( Fleming 2004).  This two -category decision guideline 
compares the observed one -sided p- value for the primary endpoint to two 
categories: (0.025, 0. 05) and (0, 0.025].  
• If the one -sided p- value is between 2.5% and 5 % then the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] -
based regimen is plausibly efficacious and should be evaluated definitively in a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial.   
• If the one -sided p- value is less than 2.5%, then the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] -based 
regimen will have met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
The sample size of 1 00 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for the 
primary endpoint with  
• 5% one -sided alpha and responder rates of 2 4% (placebo) and 43.5% 
(serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053])  
• 2.5% one -sided alpha and responder rates of 2 4% (placebo) and 46% 
(serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053])  
Testing of the key secondary endpoints  will take place should statistical 
significance be reached for the primary endpoint.  Testing within the key secondary endpoints will be hierarchical with testing starting with the WI -NRS 
Week 4 responder rate, then the Day 7  WI-NRS endpoint , and finally the Day 3 
WI-NRS endpoint.  
Statistical Methods:  Primary e fficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat (ITT) philosophy.  
The primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which  will 
include all randomized subjects  who received at lea st one dose  of study drug . 
Analyses performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive.  Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary  variable taking on values of responder 
or non -responder.  Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 4-
point  reduction in WI -NRS between baseline and Week 8. Missing data 
imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 8. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_250239] . 
 
The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using  a Cochran Mantel Haenszel  (CMH) test  controlling for the 
stratification factors.  The same test will be used for the Week 4 responder rates. 
Testing , using an analysis of co variance (AN COVA) model , of the  change in WI -
NRS to Day 7 and Day 3 will be employed.

Version 2.0  Page 9 Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_247060] 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, 
AEs by [CONTACT_926], SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.  
Clinical safety laboratory values  will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes f rom baseline will be 
tabulated for laboratory results by [CONTACT_96013]. Graphs of laboratory values 
over time will also be produced.   
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory 
values will be tabulated.  
The observed vital signs and ECG data and change from baseline for each 
measurement day will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Study Sites:  Approximately [ADDRESS_993081]’s Participation  Approximately 12 or 14 weeks: 2 or 4 weeks of screening, 8 weeks of treatment, 
and a follow -up period of  2 weeks.  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_993086] 100 million individuals worldwide ( Boehncke 2015; “Global report on 
Psoriasis”  2016). The most common clinical variant is plaque psoriasis (also known as 
“psoriasis vulgaris”), which affects approximately 85 –90% of all patients with psoriasis; this 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_727302], well -demarcated erythematous skin plaques with adherent 
silvery scales, which are a result of a hyperprol iferative epi[INVESTIGATOR_727303] ( Nestle 2009 ). Next to scaling of the skin (reported by 
92% of patients with plaque psoriasis), the most frequently reported symptom is itching 
(reported by 72 –87%) ( “Global report on Psoriasis” 2016).  In a survey of over 3,[ADDRESS_993087] influential factor in determining their perception of psoriasis se verity ( Lebwohl 2016).  In addition, pruritus has 
been associated with reduced health care quality of life in psoriasis patients , including 
impaired sleep quality and reduced psychological well -being ( Zhu 2014). 
1.[ADDRESS_993088] that there may be no clinically meaningful correlation between pruritus severity and psoriasis dise ase severity.  In a study of 
102 patients with plaque-type psoriasis, pruritus was found in 89% of patients; no significant correlation was found between disease severity and presence or intensity of pruritus (Reich  2010).  More recently, Roblin et al ( Roblin 2014) reported baseline data for 
157 psoriatic patients enrolling for a clinical trial; these patients had mild to moderate psoriasis according to Investigator Global Assessment.  Of these, 97% of patients had pruritus, with 34% reporting severe pruritus (VAS score of greater than 70 mm).  These data 
suggest that even when adequate control of psoriasis lesions can be achieved, patients may continue to experience pruritus out of proportion to their visible disease burden.   
Recommendations for available treatments directed specifically to ward reduction of itch in 
psoriatic patients, beyond standard of care psoriasis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], include topi[INVESTIGATOR_727304], pramoxine, menthol or capsaicin; sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine; and antidepressants such doxepin or mi rtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ( Szepi[INVESTIGATOR_110425] 2016; 
Dawn  2006).  However, with the exception of topi[INVESTIGATOR_41956] ( Ellis 1993) and oral 
mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ( Hundley 2004), evidence r egarding efficacy with these agents for treatment of 
psoriatic pruritus is limited.  Use of capsaicin and/or mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_727305]; topi[INVESTIGATOR_727306], and the sedative properties of mirtazapin e limit its use during waking hours.

Version 2.0  Page 17 1.3 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
Substance P (SP) is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, 
a group that also includes neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) ( Hökfelt 2001). 
SP has been implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses (Lotts 2014; Andoh 1998; Steinhoff 2014). 
 The biological 
actions of SP are mediated by [CONTACT_727344], which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified : the neurokinin- 1 (NK -1), neurokinin- 2 (NK -2), and neurokinin- 3 (NK -3) 
receptors ( Harrison 2001 ). The NK -1 receptor (NK
1-R) in particular has been studied in great 
detail. NK 1-R is the p rimary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell 
types, include central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells.  
NK 1-R stimulation has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus perception 
(Stander 2015). Inhibition of this pathway results in decreased pruritus and scrat ching 
reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357478]- related conditions, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist (aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
Emend) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients with chronic pruritus 
due to etiologies such as cutaneous T- cell lymphoma ( Duval 2009; Torres 2012; 
Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus ( Santini 2012; Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a 
study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 16/20 
patients (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity ( Stander 2010). 
Radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical staining studies have demonstrated that biopsies of skin from psoriasis patients contain more neurons immunoreactive for SP, NKA and NK-2 receptors, as well as non-neuronal inflammatory cells positive for SP, NKA, and NK-1 and NK-2 receptors, compared with healthy controls; in addition, numbers of SP positive nerves in plaque- bearing skin are si gnificantly correlated with pruritus intensity 
(Amatya 2011). These findings suggest a role for SP signaling in psoriasis and psoriatic 
pruritus, and are also consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through its primary receptor, NK
1-R, in the transmission of itch across multiple 
disease states . (Crowe 1994; Santini 2012; Akiyama 2015; El -Nour 2006; Lotts 2014; 
Hon 2007; Ward 2004; Slattery 2011 ).

Version 2.0  Page 18 mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased 
salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine and ovarian atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357480] (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to [ADDRESS_993091] level (NOAEL ) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, 
mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2- fold margin for the maximum- targeted 
exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 4- fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).

gender differences ). Peak plasma concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 
4 hours in both young adult and elder ly subjects . 
In a Phase 2 study examining treatment of OAB  (Study P003) , the most common AEs during 
the initial 8 -week base period across all treatment groups were headache (5.7%), diarrhea 
(5.2%), urinary tract infection (4.7%), dry mouth (4.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.5%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (4.3%), fatigue (4.1%), dizziness (3.8%), back pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), and peripheral edema (2.2%).

Version 2.0  Page 19 TCP-101 
TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi -center study that c ompared 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus . A total 
of 257 adult subjects  18–65 years of age with chronic pruritus were randomized to receive 
one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_993095] profound for the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from 
Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week [ADDRESS_993096] squares mean difference compared to placebo was 5.8 mm, 13.2 mm, and 14.2 mm for serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg, 1  mg, and 5 mg, respectively.   
The frequency of TEAEs and study drug related AEs was h igher in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg and 
5 mg groups compared to the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one SAE reported in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357484] (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg  group). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), 
nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%).  
TCP-102 
TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that 
evaluated serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of prurigo nodularis. A total of 128 adult subjects  18–80 years of age with prurigo nodularis were randomized to receive 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727308] a 1:1 randomization. Subjects  received a loading dose of 3 tablets on 
Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints.  
Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by [CONTACT_357534]. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by [CONTACT_357535], the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357486], with a mean difference (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727309]) of -1.[ADDRESS_993097]- hoc analysis of the percentage of subjects who were 4 -point

TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]-treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo- treated 
subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357489] 
(17.2% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]- treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo-treated subjects. The most frequently 
reported treatment -related TEAEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357490] (7.8%) and diarrhea, 
peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]-treated subjects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 
the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247011]; and bradycardia, syncope, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG)
 results.  
The results of the Phase 2 studies in prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus , together with the 
extensive safety experience with serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727311] 1-R 
inhibition in the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis, serve to support the evaluation of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727312].

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727313]. 
The secondary objectives of this study are as follows : 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727314]. 
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS).  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727313]. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_993098] of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 12 or 14 weeks:  
• Screening p eriod: 2 or 4 weeks  
• Treatment period: 8 weeks 
• Follow-up period: [ADDRESS_993099] their 
baseline symptom scores established. Subjects who require a washout of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727315] 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects who do not require a washout of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727316] 2 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects will be provided an electronic  diary (eDiary)  at screening and are 
expected to complete the diary daily for the duration of the study.  Subjects must be willing and able to complete the electronic diary within a consistent timeframe on a daily basis, to 
wear actigraphy devices during sleep, and to comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82482].  
At the B aseline visit (Day 1) , eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 t ablets taken orally) at the 
site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will 
take one tablet  per day taken orally. Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727317].  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 8  of treatment.  
After completion of t he treatment period  or early discontinuation of study drug , all subjects 
will enter a 2 week follow-up period.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
In the TCP-102 study in patients with prurigo nodularis, serl opi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg taken daily for 
8 weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus, in both the overall study 
population as well as the subgroup of subjects  with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the 
TCP-101 study in patients  with chronic pruritus, serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 
6 weeks were superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus, in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects  with an atopic diathesis.  
In both the TCP-102 and TCP-101 studies, serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357499] -tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated.  
The current MTI -109 study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727318]. The serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg dose 
was selected for this study based on the following factors:

Version 2.0  Page 22 • The favorable efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727319] [ADDRESS_993100] been exposed for one year. 
• Human CNS PET receptor occupancy (RO) data for serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727320] 
(Study P002) demonstrated that a serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg LFC once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 93 % NK
[ADDRESS_993101] aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] , optimal clinical efficacy for the relief of 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) was achieved at dose levels 
resulting in > 90% CNS NK 1 RO and preferably > 95% ( Chawla 2003;  Carstens 2010).

6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS  
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  is a validated, self -reported instrument for m easurement of itch intensity 
(Kimball 2016). It uses a 24 -hour recall period and asks subjects  to rate the intensity of their 
itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher 
scores indicat e greater itch intensity. In this study, worst itch intensity (WI -NRS) during a 
24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch NRS scores once daily via eDiary at the same time each day (+/ - 3 hours) throughout the screening, treatment, and 
follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A . Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing 
of eDiary completion within the first week of Screening as needed. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_993115]. 
The device weighs 16  g (0.56 oz) without the strap, and is made of medical device grade 
housing material. The device is water resistant up to [ADDRESS_993116]-tight, and drop- resistant 
to 0.5 m. It is functional for operation be tween 41 –104°F (5 –40°C).  
The assessment requires each subject  to wear the actigraphy devices, which are the size of a 
medium size wrist watch, on each wrist at night ( during sleep), with the option to wear them 
during the waking hours as well ; if tolerated by [CONTACT_423], keepi[INVESTIGATOR_727330]

automatically . The devices are returned to the study site at each subsequent study visit where 
the data are downloaded and sent for analysis.   
The 3 -D acceleration data (m/sec2) from the actigraphy device is analyzed with a neural 
network that was developed to discriminate scratching from other nighttime events. The 
algorithm was developed and tested in a study of 24 subjects (6 healthy, 18 with atopic dermatitis) who were video recorded for one night in a sleep  lab while wearing actigraphy 
devices on each wrist. The video recordings were scored to quantify the time and duration of each scratching event. A strong correlation  was shown  (r = 0.98) between the number of 
scratching events per hour measured with the actigraphy analysis versus the video scoring. In contrast, subjective questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_247064] a poor correlation with the true number of scr atching events. For example, the best correlation 
was 0.6 with a VAS . The full description of the algorithm and the study has been submitted 
to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics ( Moreau 2016 ).

scale from very much better, moderately better, a little better, no change, a little worse, moderately worse,  to very much worse. PGIC will be collected as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.5 Body Surface Area  
The BSA is used to assess the overall extent of plaque psoriasis at a given time point.  The evaluator will measure the percentage (%) of skin covered with plaque psoriasis by [CONTACT_727346].  The hand method is commonly used for estimation with the assumption that 1 hand = 1% of the total body surface area.  One hand is defined as the subject’s palm to the proximal interphalangeal joint. For scoring, multiple small lesions must be “merged” to measure.  Also if central  clearing is noted, include only the affected area in calculation.  The 
percent BSA involvement will be collected as outlined in Appendix A .  The same qualified 
evaluator should assess a subject across all study visits for BSA and PGA, when possible.

The PGA is the physician’s determination of a patient’s overall plaque psoriasis lesions at a 
given time point (“ Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products Indicated for 
the Treatment of Psoriasis” 2004). Overall, lesions are assessed for induration, erythema, and scaling on a scale ranging from clear (0), almost  clear (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), 
to very  severe (5).  PGA scores will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . The same 
qualified evaluator should assess a subject across all study visits for BSA and PGA, when possible.

whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include treatment emergent exacerbations of pre- existing illnesses and AEs that occur as 
a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outc omes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 43 • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may be considered serious by [CONTACT_247065], as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical  events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357512] < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. , routine 
colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the int ensity of an 
AE (e.g., mi ld, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g., s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_993132] dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs.   
Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on th e eCRF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinical ly significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g., elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease ), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs . 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential

reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal .  A postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating 
female; in the absence of [ADDRESS_993135] of Human Clinical Tria ls and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals:  ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines ( “U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010 ” 2010; 
“Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; 
“M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals ” 2010) :  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) 
2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence from heterosexual intercourse 
3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravag inal, implantable, injectable, or 
transdermal delivery methods.   
a. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method, as 
they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
4. Intrauterine device/system s 
5. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner

not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See MTI-[ADDRESS_993137]’s normal fluctuations during the study. It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g., new psoriasis lesions in previously uninvolved skin or pruritus requiring use of excluded therapy).

up visit. After the F ollow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-related should be 
reported. 
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by [CONTACT_357543] a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects  who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not 
have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_993139] ’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -109 
 
Version 2.0  Page 46 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AEs  entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 (“Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.   
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Descriptiona 
1 Mild (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
2 Moderate (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADLb) 
3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  
 Severe or medicall y significant but not 
immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; 
disabling; limiting self care ADLc 
4 Very severe, life threatening, or 
disabling (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Life-threa tening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE   
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in 
the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the alternate description of the grade.  
b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, fee ding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03  
(“Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)”   2010 ) 
 
Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), 
only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF.  
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of causality m ust be provided for all AEs  (serious and non-
serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_993140] caused or contributed to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_247067]: 
• Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug.

8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim analyses are planned. Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_29014]. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As one sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analysis, a repeated meas ures model will be used on observed data. 
Baseline for measures other than the eDiary and actigraphy daily measures, will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, 
baseline will be the average resu lt measured over the week prior to treatment. Additionally, 
the daily measures will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 by [CONTACT_727349].  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
The decision rule is based on the Phase 2b screening methodology presented in Fleming and 
Richardson ( Fleming 2004). The  two-category decision guideline as applied to this clinical 
trial compares the observed one-sided p-value for the primary endpoint to two categories: (0.025, 0.05) and (0, 0.025). 
• If the one- sided p -value is betw een 2.5% and 5% then the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]- based regimen is 
plausibly efficacious and should be evaluated definitively in a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial.   
• If the one- sided p -value is less than 2.5%, then the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]-based regimen will have 
met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
 
The sample size of 100 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for the primary 
endpoint with

Version 2.0  Page 49 • 5% one-sided alpha and responder rates of 24% (placebo) and 43.5% (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) 
• 2.5% one-sided alpha and responder rates of 24% (placebo) and 46% (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) 
 
Testing of the key secondary endpoints will take place should statistical significance be 
reached for the primary endpoint.  Testing within the key secondary endpoints will be hierarchical with testing starting with the WI -NRS Week [ADDRESS_993144] been performed in PASS 13  (“PASS 13 Power Analysis 
and Sample Size Software” 2014) and use a Chi- Squared test. The primary analysis will 
control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will 
under- estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction  resulting from 
stratification into account  (Matts 1988). 
8.2 Handling of Missing Data and Excluded Therapy Use  
Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment) be required for 
adverse events or concomitant med ication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a 
partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible.  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputation process, [ADDRESS_993145] fails to complete their eDiary for a week or more the primary endpoint  
(WI-NRS ), may be missing. If the Week [ADDRESS_993146] uses an excluded 
therapy to treat psoriasis or pruritus, their responder status will be defined as non-responder.  If the Week 8 value is missing for any other reason , the WI -NRS change from baseline value 
will be based on imputed data. Missing Week 8 WI-NRS values from which the 4-point responder status is derived will be estimated by [CONTACT_85222].  
Missing WI -NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple 
imputation. Since both primary and key secondary endpoints require WI -NRS, the following 
steps will be followed: 
1. Using the daily eDiary data, calculate Baseline and Week 2 through Week 8 values by [CONTACT_357544]. If any values are available, these will be used i.e. a minimum of 1 observation is require d to compute a week’s average.  
2. From step 1, create a dataset for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing WI-NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets.

In the case of the primary analysis and the secondary responder analyses, the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) statistics computed in the analyses of WI -NRS responder rates will be normalized using the Wilson- Hilferty transformation

8.3 Analysis Population s  
Primary e fficacy analyses will be based upon an intent- to-treat (ITT) philosophy. The 
primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) , which will include all 
randomized subjects  who received at least one dose of study drug . Subjects  will be analyzed  
within the treatment group  to which they are randomi zed.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects  with at least one post- baseline 
assessment . For safety analyses, subjects  will be classified based upon the treatment 
received.   
Additiona l analyses performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population will be consi dered 
supportive.  The PP population will include all subjects in the safety population who 
complete the Week 8 evaluations without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria:

Section  8.2.   
The remaining key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratification factor as fixed effects and the respective baseline values as a covariate.   Both least squares means and observed means will be 
presented.  
To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally 
distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk test. If 
there is overwhelmingly strong evidence that the a ssumptions are not satisfied, the data will 
be rank -transformed prior to submitting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank- transformed 
analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non- rank-
transformed analysis will also be presented.

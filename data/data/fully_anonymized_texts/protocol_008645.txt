 1. Purpose of study:  This is a research study  to better understand the impact of exercise training on 
changes in the heart as well as functional capacity .  Participating in exercise for patients with heart 
failure has been shown to be beneficial at decreas ing symptoms of heart failure however the mechanisms 
that create  that change are still unclear. This study will look specifically at ho w exercise creates changes 
within the hearts filling ability, the heart’s  pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_477208].  
 
This study is a compl ementary study to the approved protocol “Exercise Therapy to Reduce Heart 
Failure Symptoms; sorting mechanisms of benefit ” by (Exercise Therapy) Site-PI [INVESTIGATOR_477209], 
Prime -PI [INVESTIGATOR_477210] (HFrEF), and the related benefits of exercise 
training on skeletal muscle gene expression . This study builds on what will be collected as part of that 
study and adds to it by [CONTACT_477213] s of the heart.  
 
You have been asked to be a part of this study because you have been told by [CONTACT_477214] 
a diagnosis of heart failure  and are currently enrolled in the approved exercise interven tion protocol 
“Exercise Therapy ”. The length of your participation within this study will be approximately  [ADDRESS_612031] Roxbury campus of the VA [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System  
(VABHS) . Before starting the intervention for th e Exercise Therapy study and after the completion of 
the Exercise Therapy study you will complete a visit to the West Roxbury campus  where you will have 
an echocardiogram performed as part of this study .   
 
Please note that several assessments that you wil l have completed as part of the Exercise Therapy 
protocol will be shared with the current study staff as part of  the  project to reduce your burden of having 
to repeat those tests. The assessments that will be shared are 1) cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, 2) 
6minute walk test, 3) Breathing tests, 4) questionnaires looking at quality of life, and 5) the intervention 
group you have been assigned to as well as your adherence to the exercise intervention group (number of 
sessions you complete).  
 
We will recruit  approximately [ADDRESS_612032] 
clinical care . This study is being sponsored by [CONTACT_477215].

 2. Description of the study, procedures to be used, and how long it will last:   
Your participation in this st udy will involve a total of 2  ([ADDRESS_612036]) assessment visit s over a 
[ADDRESS_612037] an 
echocardiogram done which will take about 90 minute s.  
 
Echocardiogram:  An echocardiogram  uses sound  waves  to produce  images  of your heart.  This 
commonly  used test allows  us to see how well your heart  is pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_418954].  During  the test, you will 
be given  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477211].  You will be asked  to remove  your clothing  from  the waist up.  A 
cardiac  sonographer  will place  three  electrodes  (small,  flat, sticky patches)  on your chest.  The 
electrodes  are attached  to an electrocardiograph  monitor  (ECG  or EKG)  that charts your heart 's 
electrical  activity.  The sonogra pher will ask you to lie on your left side on an exam  table.  He or she 
will place  a wand  (called  a "sound -wave  transducer")  on several  areas  of your chest.  The wand  will 
have  a small  amount  of gel on the end, which  will not harm  your skin. The gel is used to help produce  
clearer  pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  You may be asked  to change  positions  several  times  during  the exam  in order  for the 
sonographer  to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_477212].  You may also be asked  to hold your 
breath  at times  during  the exam.  You should  feel no major discomfort  during the test, although  you 
may feel cooln ess from  the gel on the transducer  and a slight  pressure  of the transducer on your chest.  
The test will take about  60 minutes.   
 
In the small chance the echocardiography  technician  is unable to g et a clear image of the heart which is 
in less than 10% of people a contrast agent call ed Definity may be use d that allows for better imaging of 
the heart. For the contrast to be administered an IV may be placed in your arm.  
 
If the echocardiogram indicat es that you have any unexpected medical concerns, your doctor will be 
immediately notified, and you may not be able to continue in the study.   
Please note that all other testing and exercise interventions you will complete are part of the Exercise 
Therapy  study and were outlined in the IFC’s you signed as part of that study.  If you have questions on 
that study please contact [CONTACT_60656] [ADDRESS_612038]. Gottlieb at 857 -203-6375 .

 a. Difficulty completing the [ADDRESS_612042] precautions will be followed in cleaning and sterilizing the  area.  
 
4. Reasonably foreseeable risks of study:  
a. There is a rare chance (1:10,000) that patients may be allergic to the microscopic bubble contrast 
(lipid shell and gas), thus allergies will be confirmed via patient medical charts and verbally with th e 
patient prior to the injection of the contrast agent.  Allergic reactions are most likely to occur within 
[ADDRESS_612043]. These reactions can include breathing problems (shortness 
of breath), heart problems (changes in rhythm ), chest pain, jaw tightness, feeling of faintness, 
seizures, and headaches. Special efforts will be taken to reduce risks by [CONTACT_477216] [ADDRESS_612044].  
 
 If you are or became pregn ant, the particular treatment or procedure might involve risks to the embryo 
or fetus, which are currently unforeseeable . 
 
5. Expected benefits of study:  There are no known direct benefits to you for being in this study.  
 
6. Other treatment available:   This is not a treatment study and therefore, will not alter any treatment 
you are receiving at the VA.  
 
7. Use of research results and Confidentiality:   Information collected for the purpose of this research 
study will be kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371] .  The results of this study may be published for 
scientific purposes, but your records or identity will not be revealed unless required by [CONTACT_2371].

 Information about you is protected in the following way.  All information that is collected will be 
stripped  of any information that would reveal your identity.    Paper data will be stored in secure, locked 
file cabinets in a locked study office at the VABHS JP campus.  Data will be identified only by [CONTACT_477217].  The data will  also be coded and computerized.  Electronic data will 
be stored in a password -protected file on a password -protected computer.  Only the study staff will have 
access to the data.   Finally, all staff involved in this study will be trained to understand th e importance 
of maintaining the confidentiality of study participants.   
 
Your research records  will be kept indefinitely or until the law allows their destruction in accordance 
with the VA Record Control Schedule (www1.va.gov/VHAPUBLICATIONS/RCS10/rcs10 -1.pdf).   Records will 
be destroyed, when allowed, in the following manner .

described in this study as approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
 
 
8. New Findings:  You will be told of any significant new findings that co me to light during the course 
of this study and that may relate to your wanting to stay in the study.  
 
9. Special circumstances:   A veteran subject will not be required to pay for medical care and services 
received as a subject in an approved VA research study.   Some veterans are required to pay co -payments 
for medical care and services provided by [CONTACT_41309]. These co -payment requirements will continue to 
apply to medical care and services (including, but not limited to, dental services, supplies, medicines, 
orthopedic and prosthetic appliances, and domiciliary or nursing home care)  provided by [CONTACT_477218] .   
 
Subjects who enroll into this study have the potential to receive a total of $200  for completing the study 
in whole . For the baseline assessme nts, you will receive $[ADDRESS_612048] exercise assessment  visit you 
will be paid $  100. Additionally you might be eligible for a potential total of $[ADDRESS_612049] you live. You can choose to w ithdraw from the study at any time, but will only

receive the following information at key intervals: 1) instructions about how to prepare for surgery, 
2) information about the procedure, 3) information about medications and pain control, 
4) information about postoperative recovery and rehabilitation.   In addition, several surveys will 
be di stributed using JointCOACH to keep patients involved in their own recovery and to keep the 
surgical team informed of their progress.  The proposed research will help determine if 
JointCOACH can improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.   
 
2. Introduc tion and Background  
 Health systems invest significant resources to improve quality and reduce costs.  However, 
this process is typi[INVESTIGATOR_639393].  Recently, s tudies have shown 
that when patients are engaged, they take more  responsibility for their own health and preventative 
care.  Additionally, these patients are more satisfied with their healthcare experiences and ha ve 
lower rates of healthcare utilization 1,2.  Physicians are in the best position to promote patient 
engagement  since they have direct relationships with their own patients.  Howeve r, physicians 
need frictionless tools with minimal implementation barriers in order to create and maintain this 
relationship in the follow up period.  
Patient engagement has been referred to as the next blockbuster “drug”, and increasing 
evidence demonstrat es that highly engaged patients not only enjoy improved outcomes, but have 
fewer complications, undergo fewer readmissions, and have lower total costs of care  3–5.  While 
these engagement -related outcomes have been shown in several other  specialties, relatively little 
has been done to explore this relationship in orthopedics.  The opportunity to demonstrate the 
 
 
 
Version Date: 12/19 /[ADDRESS_855316] of engagement on outcomes in the orthopedic space is highlighted by [CONTACT_639402] $1.5B 
of medical expenses occurring nati onally due to potentially preventable readmissions following 
orthopedic surgeries alone.   
Stryker  Performance Solutions  Joint COACH™  and the Cleveland Clinic are interested in 
collaborating on a clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_639394] (LOS), readmissions  and 
reoperations, increasing discharge disposition to home rather than another facility, reduc ing the  
need for in -person follow up, and increas ing patien t (and provider) satisfaction after elective 
primary hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA).  These improvements can translate to higher 
financial savings through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_639395].  
 
3. Specific Aims  
Currently in use by [CONTACT_639403], JointCOACH  improves 
perioperative outcomes after THA and TKA and mitigates risk by: 1 ) enhancing patient 
engagement with providers, 2 ) allowing patients to play an integral role in patient -reported 
outcomes, 3 ) generating and relaying actionable pre - and postoperative reporting directly to the 
clinical team, and 4) detecting impending postoperative complications early, enabling timely 
intervention and preventing avoidable complications and readmissio ns.  The specific aims of this 
proposal are to:  
1. Measure patient satisfaction with and without use  of Joint COACH  as a tool for patient 
engagement  
2. Understand the degree to which high postoperative engagement can reduce the amount of 
healthcare resource utilization by [CONTACT_521696]:

b. Does uti lizing JointC OACH  improve clinical workflow by [CONTACT_639404], allowing them to be more efficient?  
c. Does utilizing JointC OACH  reduce the volume of on -call pages by [CONTACT_639405], allev iating concerns, and providing them with the 
information they need when they need it?  
d. Does utilizing JointC OACH  allow the practice to identify patients whose in -person 
follow -up needs are minimal?

(Mesko , Krebs, Greene , Kamath, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_639397] ), Lutheran Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639398] (Mesko , Krebs), 
Marymount surgeons (Kamath, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_639397]), and Medina Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639398] (Greene)  will be assessed 
for eligibility.

1. Undergoing primary total hip or primary total knee arthroplasty  
2. Willing to sign an IRB approved informed consent form  
3. Have internet access or mobile access with a valid email address at the time of enr ollment  
4. Above the age of 18  years

4.3 Sample Size Calculation  
We will enroll 400 patients (200 in each group).  This sample size was estimated using 
patient reported satisfaction  based on the PPE -15 questionnaire  as the primary endpoint. Currently, 
it is not known what w ill be a clinically relevant  difference so w e conservatively estimated  that a 
10% difference in patient satisfaction (difference in  % of  respondents ind icating a problem on the 
PPE-15 between treatment and control groups ) would be relevant .  Based on data published in a 
study by  [CONTACT_639406] , we used a mean of 24.7% (± 7.7) for the percent  of respondents across 
all PPE -15 domains that identified  a problem  with their experience6.  Setting alpha equal to 0.05  
and power equal to 80%, we determined that we will need 153 patients in each group.  However, 
we will enroll 200 patients in each group to account for withdrawals and non-responders.

Version Date: 12/19 /2018  Confidential  Page 9 of 14 4.5 Data Analysis Plan  
The difference in percent of respondents indicating a problem on the PPE -15 between 
treatment and control groups  will be calculated as [percent of standard of care respondents 
reporting a problem, averaged across all PPE -15 domains ] – [percent of JointCOACH 
respondents reporting a problem, averaged across all PPE -15 domains ], such that a positive 
difference indicates that the JointCOACH  group was more satisfied  than the standard of care  
group, while a negative value indicates the opposite.  A superiority hypothesis test using the two -
indepen dent sample t -test will be used to statistically evaluate the difference in the average 
satisfaction  between groups.

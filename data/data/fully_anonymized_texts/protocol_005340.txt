Subjects  
 Impaired glucose counterregulation and loss of hypoglycemia symptom  recognition 
(hypoglycemia unawareness) develops in long standing type 1  diabetes, in part due 
to repeated exposure to hypoglycemia as a consequence  of therapeutic 
hyperinsulinemia, and increases the risk for severe  hypoglycemia, an important 
complication in itself and a significant barrier to the  attainment of adequate glycemic 
control. This study aims to determine  whether hypoglycemia avoidance achieved 
through implementation of hybrid  closed-loop insulin delivery can improve glucose 
counterregulation in type 1  diabetic patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. We 
hypothesize that the  endogenous glucose production response to insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia will  be greater in subjects after 6 months when compared to before 
implementation  of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery. Glucose counterregulatory 
hormone,  symptom, and endogenous glucose production responses will be 
measured  using the stepped-hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp before, after 6  
months’ intervention, and after [ADDRESS_940023] (drug,  
biologic, device, etc.)

glucose monitoring via the MiniMed 670G system or the Tandem t:slimX2 insulin 
pump with the Dexcom G6 sensor according to Medtronic’s and Tandem’s 
labeling.  These systems combine subject-delivered pre-meal boluses with 
automatic  interprandial insulin delivery that include automated functions for both  
predictive and threshold suspension of insulin delivery intended to minimize  
exposure to glucose levels < 70 mg/dl.

Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests as appropriate, and significance will be  considered 
at P ≤ 0.05 (two-tailed) for the primary outcome measure of the  rate of 
endogenous glucose production. For the additional measures, multiple  
comparisons are being made without adjustments for multiplicity, and so any  
findings will be hypothesis generating. The additional responses at [ADDRESS_940025] was unable to treat him/herself and which  was

practical. 
Hypoglycemia in Type [ADDRESS_940026] patients with  
insulin-dependent diabetes, both those with type 1 diabetes and advanced type 2 diabetes (Cryer, 2008).  
Inadequate glycemic control can lead to the development of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and  
neuropathy, the leading causes of adult blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation in the  
[LOCATION_002]. The American Diabetes Association treatment guidelines recommend that adults with type  
1 diabetes target HbA 1c levels < 7.0% unless there is a reason, such as significant hypoglycemia or  
hypoglycemia unawareness, to set a higher target (2015). However, even with HbA 1c < 7.0% the residual  
risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes remains more than twice  
that in nondiabetics (Lind et al., 2014), with the lowest mortality rates seen with HbA 1c ≤ 6.5% (Stadler et  
al., 2014). Unfortunately, despi[INVESTIGATOR_693140], only 30% of adults with type 1 diabetes in the [LOCATION_002] receiving care at  
specialty diabetes clinics are achieving a HbA 1c level < 7.0% (Miller et al., 2015). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_693141], 8% reported experiencing a severe  
hypoglycemic event resulting in seizure or loss-of-consciousness in the prior 3 months, including 6% of  
those with a HbA 1c level < 7.0%, 8% of those with a HbA 1c between 7.0 – 9.0%, and 12% of those with a  
HbA1c > 9.0% (Miller et al., 2015). Thus, current recommendations to set a higher HbA 1c target for  
patients with significant hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness (2015) are unlikely to impact the  
burden of severe hypoglycemia in type [ADDRESS_940027] frequent cause of mortality among patients under 30 years-of-age (Skrivarhaug et al., 2006;  
Feltbower et al., 2008), and while severe hypoglycemia is documented in only ~ 12% of diabetes-related  
deaths, this is likely an under representation due to the presence of twice as many unexplained diabetes-  
related deaths. Not uncommonly, young people with type 1 diabetes are found “dead-in-bed” (Tanenberg  
et al., 2010; Tattersall and Gill, 1991), an unfortunate consequence of likely severe hypoglycemia  
inducing brain death (Auer, 2004) or a fatal cardiac arrhythmia (Tu et al., 2010). In fact, patients reporting  
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_693142] a 3.4-fold increase in mortality over the subsequent 5  
years (Mccoy et al., 2012). The risk of experiencing a severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_693143] a falling blood glucose concentration in the setting of therapeutic hyperinsulinemia. By [ADDRESS_940028] developed near total loss of functioning β-cells (C-peptide  
negative) (Tsai et al., 2006) resulting in loss of inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion as well as  
activation of glucagon secretion in response to declining blood glucose (Cooperberg and Cryer, 2010),  
which together normally increase endogenous (primarily hepatic) glucose production to circumvent the  
development of hypoglycemia. In the absence of these islet cell responses to hypoglycemia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_693144] ( Figure 1 ) (Cryer et al., 2003). Unfortunately, these  
sympathoadrenal responses are impaired by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_693145] a syndrome  
of hypoglycemia unawareness, also known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) (Cryer,  
2013). Hypoglycemia unawareness is associated with a 20-fold increased risk for experiencing life-  
threatening hypoglycemia (Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 2004). Clearly, new strategies are required to  
restore physiologic defense mechanisms against the development of severe hypoglycemia. 
Technologic strategies with real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) hold promise for the

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania amelioration of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes, and particularly when incorporated into to  
an automated closed-loop glucose sensing and insulin delivery system, also known as the artificial  
pancreas. With the establishment of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or pump therapy  
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107], 2012), and CGM via a subcutaneous glucose sensor (Tamborlane et al., 2008) as viable  
technologies there has been increasing academic and industrial effort to develop a closed-loop artificial  
pancreas system. However, mechanical problems with insulin delivery (Heinemann and Krinelke, 2012),  
the delay and variability of insulin absorption from the subcutaneous space (Heinemann, 2002;  
Heinemann et al., 2009), and variability of insulin action (Hinshaw et al., 2013) coupled to the delay and  
potential inaccuracy of interstitial glucose measurements (Basu et al., 2013; Basu et al., 2015) represent  
key challenges to closed-loop control of blood glucose, particularly in the context of perturbations in  
glucose homeostasis introduced by [CONTACT_693173], exercise, and illness. In order to advance component  
development prior to realization of an artificial pancreas system, a roadmap was accepted to include  
sequential steps beginning with automated mitigation of hypoglycemia progressing through control-to-  
range and control-to-target algorithms prior to adopting fully closed-loop control (Kowalski, 2009).  
Unfortunately, patients with long standing type [ADDRESS_940029] reductions in HbA 1c (~0.5%) from a  
baseline ≥ 7.0% with no increase in hypoglycemia for patients ≥ [ADDRESS_940030] 6/7 days per week (Tamborlane et al., 2008). This and most studies of CGM  
excluded patients experiencing problematic hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness, whereas in  
clinical practice CGM is most often implemented in hopes of reducing hypoglycemia. In a retrospective  
clinic-based analysis, implementation of CGM for one year in patients with problematic hypoglycemia at  
baseline was associated with a reduction, but not elimination, of severe hypoglycemic events, but did not  
improve hypoglycemia awareness (Choudhary et al., 2013). Nocturnal hypoglycemia contributes to the  
development of HAAF (Cryer, 2004), is a frequent setting for experiencing severe hypoglycemia, and is  
an important contributor to mortality in type 1 diabetes (Tanenberg et al., 2010; Tattersall and Gill, 1991).  
Prediction and detection of nocturnal hypoglycemia is not fully addressed by [CONTACT_693174] (vibration) and alarms. Implementation of a strategy for  
hypoglycemia avoidance with the goal of recovery from HAAF will require mitigation of nocturnal  
hypoglycemia. Reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia may be particularly amenable to automated  
suspension of insulin delivery with a sensor-augmented pump (SAP) (Bergenstal et al., 2013; Ly et al.,  
2013). Also known as low glucose suspend (LGS), the automated suspension of insulin delivery by a  
pump informed of the sensor glucose level marked the first step toward a closed-loop system dependent  
on information exchange between the CGM and insulin pump. Importantly, SAP with LGS has been  
shown to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia by 38% compared to CGM alone without increasing HbA 1c 
(Bergenstal et al., 2013). Another trial that included patients with reduced awareness of hypoglycemia  
showed similar results plus a reduction in severe hypoglycemic events with use of LGS, but this study  
included rather young patients with short duration disease (Ly et al., 2013). Whether this strategy may  
similarly benefit patients with long standing type 1 diabetes complicated by [CONTACT_693175], but will likely  
require even greater reduction in hypoglycemia exposure. In the present study ( Figure 1 ), we will  
determine the effect of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery on endogenous glucose production during  
insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type [ADDRESS_940031] of hypoglycemia avoidance by [CONTACT_693176]-loop insulin delivery on the 
endogenous glucose production response 
to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Glucose 
counterregulation will be assessed before 
and after 6 and 18 months’ implementation 
of a hybrid closed-loop system in patients 
with long standing type [ADDRESS_940032] one from Medtronic, the MiniMed 670G, which 
was approved for use in the US by [CONTACT_34033] 2016. Medtronic’s predecessor systems, the MiniMed 
530G and MiniMed 630G, are FDA-approved and commercially available in the [LOCATION_002]. All of 
these systems have a LGS feature based on automated suspension of insulin delivery when the sensor 
glucose crosses below a defined threshold. What is unique to the MiniMed 670G system is the 
automated  interprandial insulin delivery (when in “auto” mode) as well as automated suspension of insulin 
delivery when the sensor glucose is predicted to cross below a defined threshold (when in “auto” or 
“manual”  mode). This predictive function is more likely to prevent the ultimate development of low blood 
glucose,  and so should be more effective in mediating hypoglycemia avoidance required for the reversal 
of HAAF  and correction of defective glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia symptom recognition. 
Thus, we  will implement hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery using the MiniMed 670G system in the present 
study.  The second of these advanced systems for automated insulin delivery, including predictive and 
threshold suspension for protection against hypoglycemia is the Tandem t:slimX2 insulin pump integrated 
with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. As stand-alone devices the Dexcom 
G6 and t:slimX2 pump are both FDA-approved and have been commercially available in the [LOCATION_002].  
However; on Dec 13, 2019, the FDA announced the approval of the Control-IQ Hybrid Closed Loop System 
from Tandem Diabetes Care. The approval of the Control-IQ system as a “controller” represents the first-
ever approval of an interoperable algorithm for use in an automated insulin dosing system.  
 
The Medtronic MiniMed 670G system includes the Guardian Sensor 3, Medtronic’s newest and most  
advanced CGM sensor and the first and only sensor approved by [CONTACT_693177]-loop  
insulin delivery, which is driven by [CONTACT_693178], and that includes a predictive low glucose management algorithm, referred to as  
suspend before low, that suspends insulin delivery when the sensor glucose is predicted to fall within 20  
mg/dl of a preset low glucose limit within 30 minutes, and automatically restarts basal insulin delivery on  
recovery from hypoglycemia. This strategy builds on the previous threshold suspend function that would  
suspend insulin delivery once the sensor glucose is below the preset low glucose limit. While alerts  
(vibration) and alarms may be set for activation of the predictive suspension, they remain mandatory  
should threshold suspension be reached. The user can manually restart basal insulin delivery at any  
time, and basal insulin delivery is automatically resumed after 2 hours of suspension regardless of the  
sensor glucose.

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania disease duration 22 years) evaluated the MiniMed 670G system over a 3-month study period (Bergenstal  
et al., 2016). The system was in closed-loop mode for a median (IQR) 87% (75 – 92%) of the study  
period during which HbA1c decreased from 7.4 ± 0.9 to 6.9 ± 0.6% and time spent < 70 mg/dl decreased  
from 5.9 ± 4.1 to 3.3 ± 2.0% with an even greater reduction from 6.4 ± 5.3 to 3.1 ± 2.2% seen overnight.  
There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_693146]. Sensor and reference  
glucose values were in good agreement as indicated by [CONTACT_693179] 
10.3 ± 9.0%. There were 28 devise-related adverse events reported that were resolved at home,  
including 17 epi[INVESTIGATOR_289706] (glucose > 300 mg/dl), 11 attributed to the infusion set as  
is expected with insulin pump delivery, 5 attributed to the algorithm controller, and only 1 attributed to the  
sensor. This overwhelmingly positive safety profile led to licensure by [CONTACT_693180] 2016. 
 
Another study further tested the safety of the MiniMed 670G system in 8 subjects with type 1 diabetes  
(mean [range] age 18 [14-36] years, 63% female, mean disease duration 8 years) challenged with  
aerobic exercise and a purposefully over-calibrated glucose sensor and observed over 4 days that should  
both increase the risk of hypoglycemia (de Bock et al., 2017). Reassuringly, the system driven insulin  
delivery limits were effective in preventing exercise-induced and nocturnal hypoglycemia even in the  
presence of the over-calibrated glucose sensor over-reading the plasma glucose by 14%. The only  
hypoglycemia observed followed subject delivered meal or correction insulin boluses, with none being  
severe. Whether such protection against hypoglycemia is afforded to patients with long standing disease  
and defective glucose counterregulation will be assessed in the present study. 
 
We have previously evaluated the effect of real time CGM on glucose counterregulation in 11 subjects  
with long standing type 1 diabetes complicated by [CONTACT_693181] 
#813094, funded by [CONTACT_693182]. Results  indicated that 
real time CGM can improve the endogenous glucose production response to insulin-induced  hypoglycemia, 
but the effect was not evident until [ADDRESS_940033]-intervention ( Figure 2 ) (Rickels et al.,  2018). Autonomic 
symptoms became distinguishable under hypoglycemic vs. euglycemic clamp  conditions at [ADDRESS_940034]-intervention; however, the change in autonomic symptom response to  insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia was not significantly different over time. 
 
The results of the first large-scale, 6-month randomized (2:1) clinical trial of closed-loop vs. sensor-
augmented pump involved 168 participants ages 14-71 years, and demonstrated an 11 percentage point 
increase of time spent in the glucose range 70 – 180 mg/dl with closed-loop, as well as a 0.88 percentage 
point decrease of time spent with hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dl) and 0.33 percentage point reduction in HbA1c 
(Brown et al., 2019).  The trial compared the new Control-IQ hybrid closed loop vs. the same t:slimX2 pump 
and CGM without the control-IQ algorithm. Time in closed loop / Control-IQ (like the 670G “automode”) was 
92%.

 Figure 2. Results of glucose counterregulation testing from type 1 diabetic patients with hypoglycemia  
unawareness ( n = 11) before and after 6 and 18 months’ implementation of real time CGM, and from 
non-diabetic  controls ( n = 12). There was an improvement in the endogenous glucose production response 
to insulin-induced  hypoglycemia by [ADDRESS_940036]-intervention ( P < 0.05). The gray shaded region gives 
the 95% CI for results  obtained during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic conditions. Autonomic symptoms, 
while not significantly improved,  were not statistically different during hypoglycemia compared to 
euglycemia before, and were greater under  hypoglycemic vs. euglycemic conditions post-intervention ( P < 
0.05 at both 6 and 18 months). 
 
This effect on glucose counterregulation was associated with reductions in both the Clarke score of  
hypoglycemia unawareness and the HYPO score of hypoglycemia severity ( Figure 3 ), indicating clinical  
improvement in hypoglycemia awareness and less problematic hypoglycemia, with a reduction in the  
severe hypoglycemia event rate from 2.2 ± 0.[ADDRESS_940037]-year at baseline to 0.9 ± 0.[ADDRESS_940038]-year  at 
18 months ( P < 0.01), and importantly no deterioration of glycemic control (HbA 1c 7.2 ± 0.2 % at  
baseline and 7.0 ± 0.2 % at 18  months).

Figure 3. Measures of hypoglycemia unawareness and severity in response to implementation of real time 
CGM in type 1 diabetic patients with hypoglycemia unawareness ( n = 11). The dashed line for the Clarke 
score indicates the  cut-off for impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, and the dashed line for the HYPO score 
gives the 90th percentile cut  off for 100 patients with type 1 diabetes (Ryan et al., 2004). 
 
Interestingly, CGM measures of glycemic control indicated only a trend for improvement in glucose  
variability as measured by [CONTACT_542467] S.D. ( P = 0.07), with no significant reduction in time spent  
hypoglycemic (< 60 mg/dl) despi[INVESTIGATOR_693147], hypoglycemia events,  
and glucose counterregulation (endogenous glucose production). Importantly, nocturnal hypoglycemia (<  
60 mg/dl) remained present at ~ 5% of time between midnight and [ADDRESS_940039] even greater recovery in endogenous glucose production and autonomic symptom  
generation. 
 
2 Study Objectives  
This study aims to determine whether hypoglycemia avoidance achieved through implementation of  
hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery can improve glucose counterregulation in type 1 diabetic patients with  
hypoglycemia unawareness. We hypothesize that the endogenous glucose production response to  
insulin-induced hypoglycemia will be greater in subjects after 6 months when compared to before  
intensive implementation of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery. Glucose counterregulatory hormone,  
symptom, and endogenous glucose production responses will be measured using the stepped-  
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp before, after 6 months’ intervention, and after [ADDRESS_940040] of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery using the MiniMed  
670G system (Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA) or the t:slim Basal-IQ and Control-IQ technology 
(Tandem Diabetes, San Diego, CA) on glucose counterregulatory mechanisms in patients  with long 
standing type [ADDRESS_940041] with the primary outcome measure being endogenous glucose production in  response to insulin-
induced hypoglycemia after 6 months’ intervention. Secondary outcome measures will  include endogenous 
glucose production in response to hypoglycemia after 18 months’ intervention, and  glucose 
counterregulatory hormone and symptom responses to hypoglycemia after [ADDRESS_940042] as  his/her own 
control by a within subject design should serve the study purpose, and has been the standard  approach to 
assessing the effects of various approaches to hypoglycemia avoidance in patients with  unawareness 
(Fanelli et al., 1993; Cranston et al., 1994; Fanelli et al., 1994; Dagogojack et al., 1994; Liu  et al., 1996; 
Rickels et al., 2016). The data generated will be available to power future randomized  clinical trials to 
determine the comparative efficacy of emerging artificial pancreas and β-cell replacement  approaches to 
achieve target glycemic control with amelioration of problematic hypoglycemia in type 1  diabetes. 
 
3.1.1 Recruitment, Informed Consent and Screening Phase  
Subjects will be recruited from the diabetes practices of the University of Pennsylvania Health System.  
Additional candidates for participation may be referred by [CONTACT_469978], may respond to the  
website for the Penn Institute for Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism, or may respond to the study posting on  
ClinicalTrials.gov or an IRB-approved secure on-line system iConnect. All inquiries will be subjected to a  
structured telephone interview conducted by a research coordinator to determine potential eligibility; in  
some cases, candidates’ medical records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_3435] a signed release of medical  
records is received. If review of the phone interview and any medical records indicates that the potential  
participant is not eligible, s/he will be notified by [CONTACT_693183]; if  
review indicates potentially unsuitable diabetes care, the potential participant may be referred to Penn’s  
Rodebaugh Diabetes Center for further assessment  and  management;  if review  indicates that the  
potential participant may be eligible, s/he will be contact[CONTACT_693184]. 
 
At the screening visit, the study details and procedures will be discussed with a research coordinator and  
at least one of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_693148]. The potential participant is given adequate time  
to ask questions and review the informed consent document. Once satisfied that all questions have been  
answered, the potential participant will either decline to participate or sign the informed consent  document. 
This may occur at a subsequent visit if the potential participant desires, in order to think  further about 
what participation means and/or to consult with family, friends and/or a personal physician.  The consent 
form is signed in the presence of a witness (research coordinator +/- family member). All  participants 
must read, sign, and date a consent form before entering the study, undergoing physical  examination 
or undergoing any testing. The informed consent form will be revised whenever important  new safety 
information is available, whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new  information 
becomes available that may affect participation in the studies. 
 
Subjects will include adult (ages 25 - 70 years) patients with established (C-peptide negative) type 1  
diabetes of equal to or more than 5 years duration complicated by [CONTACT_693172] (Clarke 
score 4 or  more (Clarke et al., 1995)), experiencing severely problematic hypoglycemia and/or marked 
glycemic  lability (Ryan et al., 2004; Senior et al., 2015), despi[INVESTIGATOR_693149]-bolus insulin analog 
delivery by  [CONTACT_7163]-dose injection or pump therapy together with frequent blood glucose monitoring (more 
than 3 times  daily) and/or CGM under the direction of an endocrinologist. Because modest hypoglycemia 
in the range 50 – 58 mg/dl (Heller and Cryer, 1991) and particularly overnight (Cryer, 2004) impairs  
subsequent counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, subjects will require at least 5% of time with a  
sensor glucose < 60 mg/dl including at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_693150] 7 days. Subjects will be 
excluded for severe obesity (BMI ≥ 38 kg/m2), insulin resistance (daily insulin requirement ≥ 1.0 units/kg·d), 
poor glycemic control (HbA 1c ≥ 10%), uncontrolled hypertension, active cardiovascular disease, 
abnormal  kidney, liver, or thyroid function, anemia, seizure disorder not related to prior severe 
hypoglycemia, pregnancy, and nursing.  Eligibility will be confirmed through the performance of a history 
and physical examination by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_693148], EKG, urine pregnancy test (if 
applicable), serum chemistries, TSH, cell counts, HbA 1c and C-peptide, completion of glycemic lability 
and hypoglycemia awareness and hypoglycemia severity questionnaires, placement of a 7 day blinded

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania CGM (iPro 2, Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA) unless   CGM is available for downloading, and 7 day 
accelerometry ( WGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC, or Actiwatch2) to  define the nocturnal period. Only after all 
eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion) are met, will a  potential subject be enrolled. Repeated clinical 
testing throughout the study (please see Table 1) will ensure the continued safety and minimization of 
risk for the enrolled participants. 
 
3.1.2 Study Intervention Phase  
Eligible subjects will complete a baseline assessment of glucose counterregulation by [CONTACT_693185]-  
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp prior to starting intervention with the hybrid closed-loop system  
(MiniMed 670G system, Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA) or the t:slim Basal-IQ and Control-IQ 
technology (Tandem Diabetes, San Diego, CA). Unless a system becomes available to  the subject via their 
insurance carrier, one will be provided for them or we will cover the upgrade fee as dictated by [CONTACT_316935]. In addition, subjects using the Medtronic system will also receive a study  glucometer 
(Contour Next Link 2.4, Bayer, Indianapolis, IN) that communicates with the MiniMed 670G  insulin pump 
for bolus dosing calculation and glucose sensor calibration. Subjects who cannot maintain >  80% (or 6/7 
day) compliance with the sensor component as assessed at each study visit may be dropped  since less 
compliance has not been associated with any benefit of CGM to glycemic control (Tamborlane  et al., 2008), 
and limits the potential for benefit from LGS on hypoglycemia avoidance. Accuracy of the  sensor will be 
assessed at each visit through devise download and interpretation (Mastrototaro et al.,  2008). Study 
visits will occur weekly for the first month, then monthly until month 6, and then every 3  months until 
month 18. Month 1, 2, 4 & [ADDRESS_940043] for review and interpretation. Uploaded or downloaded  insulin delivery, blood and 
sensor glucose monitoring, insulin dose settings and CGM calibration  accuracy, alert settings, time spent 
in auto and manual modes, and LGS threshold and activity will be  assessed at each visit, targeting > 
80% CGM and LGS compliance, adjusting basal and bolus insulin  dosing in order to minimize glycemic 
excursions while maximizing hypoglycemia (< 60 mg/dl) avoidance,  with adjustment of alarms set to alert 
the subject to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_693151] (Tamborlane, 2008). During manual mode, target  glucose ranges will be 90 – 140 mg/dl 
before meals, < 180 mg/dl after meals, and 120 – 160 mg/dl at  bedtime, with correction dosing to no 
lower than 100 mg/dl during the day, and 120 mg/dl overnight.  Alarm settings may be individualized to 
target these ranges, but the hypoglycemia alarm for LGS will not  be set lower than 70 mg/dl (Cryer, 2009). 
During auto mode, the automated interprandial basal insulin  delivery will adjust according to the closed-
loop algorithm to target a sensor glucose of 120 mg/dl, which  may be temporality increased to 150 mg/dl if 
needed to further minimize exposure to hypoglycemia during  exercise or overnight. Prior to each 3 monthly 
visit, subjects will wear an actigraph monitor (WGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC or Actiwatch2) for three weeks 
in order to define the nocturnal period. Every 6 months’  measures of hypoglycemia awareness (Clarke 
score) and severity (HYPO score), and the glycemic  lability index (LI) will be calculated from 
questionnaires, event diaries, and device downloads, respectively  (Senior et al., 2015). At 6 months and at 
18 months, subjects will again undergo assessment of glucose  counterregulation by [CONTACT_693185]-
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp testing.

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania algorithm, referred to as suspend before low, automated suspension of insulin delivery  when the sensor 
glucose is predicted to fall within 20 mg/dl of a preset low glucose limit within 30  minutes, and when in 
auto mode, automated interprandial basal insulin delivery. 
Following automated suspension of insulin delivery, the system automatically restarts basal insulin delivery on 
recovery from hypoglycemia. This strategy builds on the previous threshold suspend function that would 
suspend insulin delivery once the sensor glucose is below the preset low glucose limit. While alerts (vibration) 
and alarms may be set for activation of the predictive suspension, they remain mandatory should threshold  
suspension be reached. The user can manually restart basal insulin delivery at any time, and basal  insulin 
delivery is automatically resumed after [ADDRESS_940050] subsequent hyperglycemia should the sensor glucose be erroneously low, and the  user 
unresponsive to the alerts and alarms (e.g. due to sleep) that would otherwise prompt the user to  obtain a 
confirmatory blood glucose level. The MiniMed 670G insulin pump also communicates with the  Contour Next 
Link 2.4 glucometer (Bayer, Indianapolis, IN) that will be provided to subjects for bolus  dosing calculation 
and glucose sensor calibration. 
 
The Control-IQ uses the TypeZero/Dexcom hybrid closed loop algorithm which is based on standard insulin 
pump settings.  The t:slimX2 insulin pump is comprised of the t:slimX2 pump, the t:slim 3mL cartridge and a 
compatible infusion set.  The Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor is comprised of the Dexcom transmitter, 
the Dexcom sensor and a receiver. The Control-IQ system aims to keep users between 70-180mg/dl as much 
as possible using a combination of strategies. The Basal-IQ is equivalent to “predict before low” mode and the 
Control-IQ is equivalent to “auto” mode in the closed loop system.

5.1 Intervention Regimen  
At the baseline visit, the research nurse practitioner will train subjects in the use of the system the 
participant has selected, and set  individualized insulin dosing and glucose monitoring alerts, with the low 
glucose limit not set less than 70  mg/dl. Target glucose ranges will be 90 – 140 mg/dl before meals, < 180 
mg/dl after meals, and 120 –  160 mg/dl at bedtime, with correction dosing to no lower than 100 mg/dl 
during the day, and 120 mg/dl  overnight. Basal and bolus insulin dosing will be adjusted at every visit, or 
as necessary in response to  subject inquiry, in order to minimize glycemic excursions while maximizing 
hypoglycemia (< 60 mg/dl)  avoidance, with adjustment of alarms set to alert the subject to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_693153] (Tamborlane, 2008). 
Study visits will occur  weekly for the first month, then monthly until month 6, and then every [ADDRESS_940051] strips, via their carrier. If a participant prefers the t:slim Basal-IQ and Control-IQ 
system, study will cover the cost of the insulin pump upgrade as dictated by [CONTACT_143413]’s insurance and 
the length of time the current pump has been used. 
 
Hypoglycemia in Type [ADDRESS_940052] Compliance Monitoring  
Compliance will be assessed at each visit through device download and interpretation of insulin dosing,  
sensor glucose, and blood glucose data (Mastrototaro et al., 2008). Visits month 1, month 2, month [ADDRESS_940053] website. The downloaded sensor and blood  glucose monitoring data will 
be used both for assessing CGM calibration accuracy, as well as durations of  CGM and LGS use, targeting

their insurance carrier at any time during the study, they will be able to return the study MiniMed 670G  system 
and continue in the study using their own MiniMed 670G system. Any usable devices or supplies  remaining 
at the termination of the study will be donated to study participants for their ongoing use to  offset out-of-
pocket expenses. 
 
6   Study Procedures  
Stepped-Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemic Clamp  
Glucose counterregulation will be assessed using the hypoglycemic clamp technique (Rickels et al.,  
2005). Subjects will be admitted to the Penn Center for Human Phenomic Science (CHPS) the evening  
prior to each study day after avoiding strenuous exercise for 3 days. Following 12-hours of overnight  
fasting, at t = -120 min a primed (5 mg/kg · fasting plasma glucose/90 for 5 min) continuous (0.05 
mg/kg·min for 355 min) infusion of 6,6-2H -glucose (99% enriched; Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories,  
Andover, MA) will be administered to assess endogenous glucose production before and during the  
induction of hypoglycemia (Bernroider et al., 2005).  After baseline blood samples at t = -20, -10, and -1 
min, at t = 0 min a continuous infusion of insulin (1.0 mU/kg·min for 240 min) will be administered to  
produce hyperinsulinemia. Subsequently, a variable rate infusion of 20% glucose will be initiated to  
achieve hourly plasma glucose steps of 80, 65, 55, and 45 mg/dl.   To reduce changes in plasma 
enrichment of 6,6-2H2-glucose during the clamp, the variable glucose infusion will be enriched to ~ 2.0 %  
with 6,6-2H2-glucose (Bernroider et al., 2005). 
 
Blood samples will be taken every 5 min, centrifuged, and measured at bedside with an automated  
glucose analyzer (YSI 2300; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) to adjust the glucose  
infusion rate and achieve the desired plasma glucose concentration. Additional blood samples will be  
taken at t = 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 min for biochemical analysis and  
verification of the plasma glucose levels. The total amount of blood sampled will be 168 ml. A  
questionnaire will be administered every 20 min during the study in order to quantitate autonomic  
symptoms as the sum of scores ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (severe) for each of the following symptoms:  
anxiety, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], sweating, tremor, hunger, and tingling (Towler et al., 1993).

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania  
Biochemical Analysis:  Plasma glucose and lactate will be determined in duplicate by [CONTACT_693192]/lactate analyzer (YSI 2900). Plasma free fatty acid levels will be measured in duplicate 
using enzymatic colorimetrics (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Plasma insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic 
polypeptide will be measured in duplicate by [CONTACT_65752]-antibody radioimmunoassays (Millipore, Billerica, MA, or 
for pancreatic polypeptide, ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH), and plasma epi[INVESTIGATOR_693154]-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection, by [CONTACT_693193]. Enrichment of 6,6-2H2-glucose will 
be measured by [CONTACT_48577]-mass spectrometry analysis by [CONTACT_693194], Obesity 
& Metabolism Metabolic Tracer Resource. Samples for radioimmunoassay and HPLC from before and 6 
months after intervention will be assayed simultaneously using the same assay kit. 
 
Calculations: Basal rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) will be calculated using the formula:   
basal EGP = IR ([enrichment inf /enrichment plasma] – 1), where IR is the basal 6,6-2H2-glucose infusion rate  in 
mg/kg per min, enrichment inf is  the percent enrichment of the 6,6-2H2-glucose infusate, and  
enrichment plasma is the percent basal plasma 6,6-2H2-glucose enrichment.  The rate of appearance (R a) of 
glucose during the clamps will be calculated using Steele’s non-steady state equation modified for the  
use of stable isotopes: R a = F-(V[((C 2+C1)/2)] [(E 2-E1)/(t2-t1)]/(E2-E1)/2) where C 2 and C 1 are the glucose  
concentrations at the times (t) 2 and 1 respectively; V is the effective volume of distribution of glucose (40  
ml/kg), F is the tracer infusion rate, and E represents the isotopic enrichment at the respective time  
points. EGP during the clamps will be calculated from the difference between the rate of appearance of  
glucose in the plasma and the infusion rate of exogenous glucose. We will determine counterregulatory  
responses from the hypoglycemic clamp as the glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],  
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], incremental autonomic symptom, and endogenous glucose production values obtained  
during the last 60 min of hypoglycemia. 
 
Sleep Questionnaires: 4 short sleep/activity-related questionnaires will assist in the analysis of sleep / wake 
data obtained from the participants. 2 of the questionnaires will be administered as a baseline and 2 at the 
various protocol time-points when the participants wear the Actigraph watch or Actiwatch 2.   These 
questionnaires would be administered either via paper or electronically into Redcap.   
 
6.1 Screening  
Once informed consent is obtained as described above, subjects will undergo a history and physical  
examination and review of their glucometer download, insulin pump download (if applicable), CGM  
download (if applicable), EKG, fasting serum biochemistries (glucose, C-peptide, electrolytes, creatinine,  
and liver function tests), HbA 1c, TSH, complete blood count, HCG (females), and retinal status. Subjects  will 
have a blinded 7 day CGM (iPro 2) placed (to be returned by [CONTACT_2319]) unless on CGM available for  
downloading, undergo 7 day accelerometry (Actigraph wGT3X-BT monitor or Actigraph2) to define the 
nocturnal period, and be given a  glucose log for recording [ADDRESS_940055] 
strips for their glucometer, or  whose glucometer is not suitable for downloading, will be provided a 
OneTouch device for use during  the screening period. Subjects will complete hypoglycemia questionnaires

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
8.2 Definitions  
 
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity  
during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event 
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_404550]: 
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a device in humans  
whether or not considered device related. 
 
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is: 
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• an important medical event 
Hypoglycemia in Type [ADDRESS_940067], and may require intervention to prevent one of the  
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result  in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693157]. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious  
adverse events . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events will be reported is the period from the initiation of study  
procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up. For this study, the study treatment follow-up is  
defined as 30 days following the completion of study treatment. 
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition will be  
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during  the 
study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end  of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse  event 
will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_201170], the subject is lost to  
follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, an investigator will  
instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal  
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study. 
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met: 
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality 
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose,  discontinuation 
of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation,  etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693158] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any  
condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the  
criteria for an adverse event. 
 
• Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693159] a  preexisting condition. Surgery should not be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the  purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic 
and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it  is

• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents such as 
the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc). 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a  
reasonable possibility that the incident experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_693199]). 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical,  
psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 
8.[ADDRESS_940068], an investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_693200], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded  
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report  
form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be  
recorded in the source document, and will be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded. The clinical course of each event  will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or  
participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period  will 
be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study  period 
and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be  recorded 
and reported immediately.

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania 8.4.1 Follow-up report  
 
If an AE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the  
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant new or reassessed  
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to the IRB. The investigator  
will be responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable. 
 
8.4.2 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_145181],  
affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to the Penn IRB. The  
University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those events related to study  
participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  
The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet  
the criteria outlined below. The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following  
problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
• Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site or off-site)  
that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_693161]: 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected  
in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable  
investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document and other  relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.) 
AND 
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be caused by  
[CONTACT_28821].) 
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Penn  
IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable  
Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information  
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form  
and/or other study documentation).

Reporting Deaths: more rapid reporting requirements  
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the more  
rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations: 
• Report the event within 24 hours when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and indicates  
participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
• Report the event within 72 hours, for all other deaths, regardless of whether the death is related to  
study participation. 
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the Penn IRB may be made by [CONTACT_693201]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the initial  
submission. 
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB: 
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or  
informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_58865].

• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study; 
• Who will have access to that information and why; 
• Who will use or disclose that information; and 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the PI, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the  
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that  
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect at  
least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
9.2     Data Collection and Management 
Participants’ privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study. Each participant is  
assigned a sequential identification number, and these numbers rather than names are used to collect,  
store, and report participant information. Source data is all information, original records of clinical  
findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation  
of the trial. The University of Pennsylvania will be the only site where the research will be performed.  
Screening visits will involve the documentation of medical history, vital signs, and objective physical  
examination findings, and collection of urine and blood specimens as occurs routinely during standard  
care for patients with type [ADDRESS_940075] (EPIC®) or upon written consent of the potential study participant to obtain  
outside medical records. Specimens will consist of blood and urine samples, to be assayed for metabolic  
and hematological parameters, and to exclude pregnancy. Clinical laboratory test results may be made  
available to each subject’s personal physicians upon their consent and written release of information.  
Additional data collected will include glucose diaries, hypoglycemia questionnaires, adverse event logs,  
insulin pump, glucometer, CGM, and actigraph / Actiwatch 2 monitor downloads, and symptom 
questionnaires and  metabolic response data derived from the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp 
experiments conducted  before and at 6 and 18 months following implementation of hybrid closed-loop 
insulin delivery. Paper  source documents and medical and research records, as well as the code 
linking subjects and ID  numbers are maintained under lock and key at Penn until data analysis is

11.1 Risks  
The risks of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery include local discomfort, skin irritation, bruising, bleeding,  
or rarely infection at the site of insulin infusion cannula or glucose sensor insertion. These risks are  
minimized through proper instruction in insertion technique, including sterile procedures, by [CONTACT_693207]. While the use of a hybrid closed-loop system has been shown to reduce time  
spent in the hypoglycemic range, there is a risk of severe hypoglycemia if an inaccurate sensor glucose  
reading is used to make dosing adjustments to insulin delivery. This risk is minimized through intensive  
education that includes prohibiting insulin dose decisions on the basis of a sensor glucose recording, and  
safety measures that are built-in to the closed-loop algorithm during auto mode that monitors for extreme  
sensor discordance and will automatically exit the closed-loop function. There is also a risk of marked  
hyperglycemia should an insulin infusion set become occluded or when inaccurate sensor glucose  
triggers suspension of insulin delivery; rarely diabetic ketoacidosis could develop. This risk is minimized  
through intensive education that includes recognition of faulty insulin cannulas, rotating insertion sites  
every 2-[ADDRESS_940079] no more than 2 hours, less if delivery is  
resumed by [CONTACT_102]. Finally, acceleration of retinopathy with acute correction in glycemic control was  
seen in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), although the subjects studied here will  
already be receiving intensive insulin therapy as implemented in the DCCT, and so this risk is probably  
not significant. Nonetheless, all subjects will be required to have stable retinopathy documented by [CONTACT_693208]. 
 
Blood drawn for standard of care plus research labs including for the stepped-hyperinsulinemic  
hypoglycemic clamp test will not exceed [ADDRESS_940080] substances  
(glucose and insulin) during the clamp procedures. Blood draws and intravenous line placement for  
clamp testing may cause the subject to experience some discomfort or bruising at the site of the  
needle/catheter entry. The risks of intravenous line placement for clamp testing include bleeding,  
displacement, and interstitial infusion of fluids; rarely local vein thrombosis, infection or thrombophlebitis  
may develop. The administration of insulin intravenously during the clamp procedures may lead to a  
greater degree of hypoglycemia than expected, but would be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_237298].  
The stable isotope of glucose infused during the glycemic clamps is tested for identity, sterility, and  
absence of pyrogens by [CONTACT_693209], and so carries no additional risks. The

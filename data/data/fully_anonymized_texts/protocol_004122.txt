Protocol 1820203 Amendment 2 xx June 2020 
Revance Therapeutics, Inc  Confidential 29 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1   Pathophysiology of Spasticity 
Spasticity is a motor symptom characterized by  [CONTACT_450292], with exaggerated tendon jerks resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as 
one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome ( Brashear, 2016 ). Spasticity is one of 
several abnormalities of muscle tone, and is char acterized by [CONTACT_450293], muscle tightness, joint 
stiffness, involuntary jerky movements, exaggeration of reflexes, unusual posture, abnormal positioning of fingers, wrists, arms, or  shoulders, and muscle spasms. Primary causes 
of spasticity are anoxia secondary to cerebrovascu lar ischemia (stroke), trauma to the brain or 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. ( Brashear, 2011 ). 
Essentially spasticity can result from a lesi on or injury anywhere along the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] 
(pyramidal) tracks including the motor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, central white matter or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Fatigue, im paired coordination, impaired motor control, 
impaired motor planning, and muscle weakness often accompany spasticity and contribute to 
functional motor impairment, discomfort, and pain.  
Effective treatment of spasticity is lacking. Pharmacotherapy has included baclofen (oral and 
intrathecal), benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], dantrolene, phenol or alcohol injections, gabapentin, lamotrigine, 
cyproheptadine and cannabinoids, all with minimal success. Physical therapy, splints, casts and 
functional electrical stimulation have been useful to stimulate or stretch muscles and minimize 
soft tissue contractures.  The most affected subjects may need to undergo orthopedic or neurological surgery.  However, none of these methods of treating spasticity have been effective. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that intramuscu lar injections (IM) of botulinum toxin type A 
shows promise in effectively relieving many spastic symptoms, particularly when combined with 
physical therapy (Royal College of Physicians, 2009 ). By [CONTACT_450294], botulinum toxins (BoNTs) induce a reduction in muscle contraction and muscle tone. 
As a result, BoNTA has become the treatment of choice for multifocal spasticity ( Kaku & 
Simpson, 2016 ).

documented in writing (i.e., subject signs an informed consent form) but who does not meet the 
study eligibility requirements. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of 
failure to meet an eligibility criterion that may requalify them after a waiting period (such as a 
clinically significant out of range clinical laboratory result, prohibited medication use, etc.), or 
because the treatment was not performed within the 21-day window after screening, may be rescreened once. Rescreened subjects may be a ssigned a different subject number from the one 
assigned at initial Screening. 
4.[ADDRESS_573855] Discontinuation/Withdrawal Criteria  
Study subjects will receive a one (1) time only treatment for this study. Discontinuation of study 
treatment is not applicable. However, subjects may choose to discontinue their participation in the follow-up phase at any time.  
x If the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the trial, the Investigator will attempt 
to determine the reason for discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s trial records 
and on the case report form (CRF). 
x If a subject withdraws consent because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason 
for withdrawal. In the event of early disconti nuation, (i.e., prior to the Final Evaluation) and 
whenever possible, the subject should be asked to return to the trial center to complete the 
assessments specified in the Week 12/Early Te rmination visit. Subjects who withdraw from 
the trial will not be replaced. 
x If at any time during the trial, the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation.  
x The Investigator can discontinue a subject from study participation at any time if medically 
necessary or if the subject has failed to follow trial procedures or to keep follow-up 

study visit: The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_19423](s) and counsel the 
participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, three (3) telephone calls and, if necessary, a ce rtified letter to the participant’s las t known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact [CONTACT_450295]’s medical record or 
study file. 
Should the participant continue to be unreachab le, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
5 STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES 
5.1  Screening Visit (Day -21 to -1) 
Subjects presenting with upper limb spasticity will  be examined to verify the diagnosis of spastic 
hemiparesis. Then, subjects with upper limb spasticity  will be screened to determine if they meet 
the study eligibility criteria. Prospective study participants will be informed of the study, and the 
requirements for study participation will be explai ned to them. Subject informed consent must be 
obtained prior to conducting screening procedures. Refer to Table 1.1. Schedule of Study Assessments and Procedures for activities to be performed. 
At screening, protocol-specified procedures include: 
x Physical and neurological examinations  
x Laboratory: serum chemistry, hematology, PT/INR,   
x Urinalysis 
   
x Concomitant medications 

Results from clinical laboratory tests and centrall y-read ECGs must be obtained and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_093]. WOCBP with a positive pregnancy test must be excluded from study entry.  
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guidelines about study 
participation for WOCBP. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]: 
x Informed consent document 
x Pregnancy prevention information 
x Risks to unborn children 
x Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives 
x Contraceptives in current use 
x Guidelines for the follow-up of a reported pregnancy 
 
A female is considered to be of childbearing potential UNLESS she is post-menopausal (no 
menses for 12 consecutive months) or w ithout a uterus and/or both ovaries.  
WOCBP and male subjects must, accordingly, use an effective method of birth control such as 
oral contraceptive, injection, implant, patch, va ginal ring, intrauterine coil or device, tubal 
ligation, and female/male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods). True abstinence (i.e. no heterosexual intercourse) when it is in line 
with preferred and usual lifestyle, or having a vasectomized partner is considered acceptable 
methods of contraception. Effective methods of contraception must be used from the start of study, Screening visit, to [ADDRESS_573858] sign the informed consent document stating that the above-mentioned risks/consequences were discussed with her/him. 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397924] (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The investigator must 
immediately notify the sponsor or the authorized representative of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time during study participati on. The site will be asked to follow-up with 
the subject periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information through term, as applicable. Given that this is a sing le treatment administration study, subjects who 
become pregnant after receiving their study trea tment will not be automatically discontinued 
from the study. 
After the required screening procedures are comple ted and study eligibility is confirmed, the 
subject is enrolled in the study and randomized to a treatment arm. 

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they become 
available. For each laboratory test result outsi de the reference range, the Investigator must 
ascertain if the abnormal lab result is a clinica lly significant result for that individual subject. 
Likewise, if laboratory tests are taken at follow-up visits, the Investigator must ascertain if this is 
an abnormal and clinically significant change fr om pre-treatment for that individual subject. The 
Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the 
original laboratory test. The Investigator must sign and date all written laboratory results (e.g., urinalysis, hematology, chemistry, and pregna ncy tests) and note Not Clinically Significant 
(NCS) or Clinically Significant (CS) for each out of range laboratory value.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be a clinically  significant result for that subject, this may be 
considered an AE to be assessed according to severity. Refer to Section 6.2 for further 
information. 
 
 
 
6.2 Adverse Events 
6.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Events:   
Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
of this protocol. 
AEs will be evaluated at the Injection visi t post-treatment, follow-up Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12,16, 20, 
24, 28, 32 and 36/EOS, if applicable.  
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_19489] “21CRF p art 312.32 and 
Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Require ments.”  The Investigator will 
report any serious adverse events (SAEs) to the IRB. 
Subjects should be told to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any abnormal 
symptoms after investigational product administration, especially: 
x Generalized loss of strength and muscle weakness 
x Difficulty swallowing, breathing or speaking 
x Extreme tiredness 
x Loss of bladder control  
x Symptoms of allergic reaction (rash, itching, etc.)  

Protocol 1820203 Amendment 2 xx June 2020 
Revance Therapeutics, Inc  Confidential 52 6.2.2  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Definition of Adverse Events 
For this protocol, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, 
symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury or accident) that emerges or worsens following administration of investigational product and until the end of trial participation that may not necessarily have a causal relationship 
to the administration of the investigational p roduct. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and/or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory result), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is one that 
occurs after any period of exposure to treatment. 
Pre-existing conditions, which increase in freque ncy or severity or a change in nature as a 
consequence of an investigational product use will also be considered an adverse event. 
An unexpected AE is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summa ry of product characteristics for an approved 
product). Any clinically significant change in the study safety evaluations, (e.g., vital signs, 
laboratory results, ECG, injection site evaluati on, physical/neurological examinations, etc.) post-
treatment must be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]     Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
x Death 
x Life-threatening, (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe) 
x Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the subject’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions 
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450288] (i.e., a prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78613]/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134]) 
x Congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an a dverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to the molecule or investigational product before conception or during pregnancy) 
x Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but based upon appropriate medical 
judgement may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one (1) of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is a significant or important medical 
event)  

Relationship of an AE to investigational product will be assessed as follows: 
x Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time se quence between the onset of the AE and 
the administration of investigational product; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product and/or recurs with re-administration of investigational product 
x Probable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the administration of investigational product; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_95330]/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures 
x Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset 
of the AE and the administration of investig ational product and a cause cannot be ruled 
out 
x Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to investigational product 
administration  
The investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event. 
Severity will be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definition: 
x Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually 
does not require intervention 
x Moderate:  Event may be of sufficient severity to make a subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed 
x Severe: Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; 
subject may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually 
needed 
Expectedness  
The Sponsor medical monitor will be responsible f or determining whether an adverse event (AE) 
is expected or unexpected. An AE will be cons idered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study intervention . Expectedness is further defined in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) under 
Anticipated Risks and Side Effects. The list of AEs found in the IB can be considered to be expected AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Time Period and Frequency fo r Event Assessment and Follow-Up 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured 
on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s assessmen t of severity, relationship to study product 
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of 

appropriately regardless of relationship. The investigat or will assess subject post-treatment and at 
each subsequent study visit for the occurrence of AEs. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the stud y participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be doc umented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be per formed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The investigator should follow the SAE until it resolves or is determined by [CONTACT_450296], or the subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator should continue to report any 
significant follow-up information to the sponsor or the authorized representative, and the IRB, up 
to the point the event has resolved, or is determined to be stable. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, and stable means the investigator does not expect any 
further improvement or worsening of the subject’s cond ition.  
Any new SAEs reported by [CONTACT_450297], and the IRB, as required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]    Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator will assess subjects for post-treat ment AEs at each subsequent trial visit. In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects sh ould be asked the following non-leading question: 
“How have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_450298]. Adverse events related to COVID19 should be documented.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An Investigator must report an SAE to Revanc e or the designated CRO representative within 
24 hours  of their awareness of the event:  
 
1. Complete and return an SAE Form with all information known to date; including the 
Investigator’s assessment of causality.  
2. A fatal or life-threatening SAE must be  telephoned to Revance or the authorized 
representative as soon as the Investigator learns of the event. 
3. All pertinent medical records (discharge summary, autopsy report, etc.) should be 
obtained and judgments of all medical personnel who assisted in subject’s treatment and 
follow-up. 
4. Provide follow-up information to Revance or the authorized representative. 
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Investigator deems the event 
to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be

Revance will disclose clinical trial data to i ndividuals, to investigators at clinical sites, and 
publicly as aggregate summaries, in accordanc e to Regulatory and local legal requirements.  
Follow-up of Non-Serious Adverse Events 
Non-serious AEs that are identified during the las t scheduled trial visit (or early discontinuation, 
if applicable) must be recorded on the AE CRF as ongoing. 
Any clinically significant abnormal test results, e.g., laboratory findings, at the Week 12/Early 
Termination visit should be followed to resolution  or until determined by [CONTACT_235807]. Repeat tests may be indicated to establish this. If a subject has any clinically significant, trial-related abnormalities at the e nd of the trial, the Medical Monitor should be 
notified, and every effort made by [CONTACT_450299]. 
Follow-up of Post-Trial Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact (or early discontinuation, if applicable) 
must be recorded on the AE CRF page and reported to the CRO and Revance according to the reporting procedures outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . This may include unresolved previously 
reported SAEs, or new SAEs. The Investigator should follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator should continue to report any significant follow-up information to the Medical Monitor, Revance, and the IRB up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of 
health, or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition.

unscheduled ones. Both the Baseline/Screening and Since Last Visit versions will be utilized. All 
assessors will receive formal training in the use of this tool. 
A subject who endorses “suicidal ideation” must be refe rred to a mental health professional for 
further assessment and/or treatment. 
7 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Events 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or fre quency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such  as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-
approved research protocol and inf ormed consent document; and (b) the

Investigator commits to adhere to applicable sections of the US 21 CFR parts 50 “Protection of 
Human Subjects”, 54 “Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230]”, 56 “ Institutional Review 
Boards”, and 312 subpart D “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators” . All Investigators 
will ensure adherence to ICH guidelines for GCP and Clinical Safety Data Management. 
10.[ADDRESS_573867]/Ethics Committee Approval 
The institution’s IRB, or other committee functioning in a similar capacity, will review and 
approve the protocol and any protocol amendmen ts, initial and any revised IC documents, 
protocol amendments, and safety items. After approval by [CONTACT_1201], documentation of approval 
and the approved Informed Consent document will  be sent to Revance/ designee before any 
subject is enrolled into this study. 
10.3   Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated pri or to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the indi vidual’s study participation. Written info rmed 
consent will be obtained from all subjects before any study-related procedures (including any 
pre-treatment screening procedures) are performed. The investigator may discuss the study and the possibility for entry with a potential subj ect without first obtaining consent. However, a 
subject wishing to participate must give written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures being conducted, including those perf ormed solely for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for study participation, and including withdrawal from current medication (if required prior to study entry). The investigator has both the ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in this study has been given a full explanation of the procedures and expectations for study participation. 
When applicable, the site-specific informed consent must be forwarded to the sponsor for 
approval prior to submission to an IRB that is registered with appropriate local or federal 
agencies as required. Each subject will sign the consent form that has been approved by [CONTACT_450304]. Each informed consent document must adhere to 
the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of  Helsinki and will include the elements required 
by [CONTACT_235794] 21 CFR Part 50, Health Canada’s Food and Drug Regulations, Division 5, 
European Medicines Agency (EMA), as well  as the elements required by [CONTACT_11580]-GCP 
guideline, and applicable national and local regu latory requirements. The consent form must also 
include a statement that the sponsor, their designees, and auditing regulatory agencies will have 
direct access to the subject’s records and medical history for study related purposes.  

and Institutional Review Board regulations [US 21CFR, Part 56.103]). Access to all records, 
both during the trial and after trial completion, shoul d be made available to the sponsor at any 
time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data. The investigator must notify sponsor 
immediately if the responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading to 
disqualification have begun. 
The investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines; applicable informed consent regulations (US 21CFR, Part 50); and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subjec t at the specified times. If data is not recorded 
per protocol, the reasons must be clearly documented on the eCRF/records. 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the investigator(s), a 
representative from the sponsor will review the protocol and study eCRFs with the 
investigator(s) and their staff. During the study, the study monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that consent is being sought 
and obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigational product is 
being stored, dispensed and accounted for according  to specifications. The investigator and key 
trial personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits. 
The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893], to confirm 
their consistency with the eCRF entries. No information in these records about the identity of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitori ng standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
SAEs, and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. Additional checks of the 
consistency of the source data with the eCRFs will  be performed according to the study-specific 
monitoring plan. 
The investigator must promptly complete the eCRF s after the subject’s visit. The monitor is 
responsible for reviewing them a nd clarifying and resolving any data queries. A copy of the 
eCRFs will be retained by [CONTACT_397070] a secure place with other study documents, such as the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, and any protocol amendments.

investigator will sign a statement indicating that all pages of the subject’s case report have been 
reviewed. Signature [CONTACT_78670] “per signatures” are not ac ceptable.  
It is sponsor’s policy that the study data be verifiable with the source data that necessitates access 
to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and other records for each subject. The investigator must therefore agree to allow access to s ubjects’ records, and source data must be made available 
for all study data. Subjects (or their legal represe ntatives) must also allow access to their medical 

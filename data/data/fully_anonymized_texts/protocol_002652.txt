Covance Study: 8419666 Protocol Reference: LOXO-BTK-[ADDRESS_266556] of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor (Itraconazole) and CYP3A4 Ind ucer (Rifampin) on the 
Pharmacokinetics of LOXO-305 in Healthy Adult Subjects 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study are: 
 to assess the impact of multiple oral doses of itraconazole (a strong cytochrome P450 
[CYP]3A4 and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]  inhibitor) on the single ora l dose 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of LOXO- 305 in healthy adult subjects; 
 to assess the effect of multiple oral doses of rifampin (strong  CYP3A4 inducer) on the 
single oral dose PK of LOXO-305 i n healthy adult subjects; 
 to assess the effect of a single oral dose of rifampin on the s ingle oral dose PK of 
LOXO-305 in healthy adult subjects. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
 to assess the safety and tolerab ility of a single oral dose of LOXO-305 when 
administered alone and co-administered with multiple oral doses  of itraconazole; 
 to assess the safety and tolerab ility of a single oral dose of LOXO-[ADDRESS_266557] 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after dosing. 
Blood samples for PK analysis  of LOXO-305 alone will be taken u p to 168 hours postdose on 
Day 1. In Period 2, multiple oral  doses of 200 mg itraconazole will be administered twice 
daily (BID) on Day 8, and once daily (QD) from Day 9 until Day 18 inclusive (for a total of 
11 consecutive days). and co-administered with a single oral do se of 200 mg LOXO-305 on 
Day 12 under fasted conditions. On Day 8, when itraconazole is administered BID, the 
morning dose will be administered alone at the actual time of t he Day 1 LOXO-305 dose 
(± 1 hour), approximately [ADDRESS_266558], and the evening dose 
will be administered approximate ly 10 (±1) hours after the morn ing dose, approximately 
[ADDRESS_266559] ual time of the Day 1 LOXO-305 dos e (± 1 hour), approximately 
[ADDRESS_266560], which shoul d be entirely consumed within 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8419666 Protocol Reference: LOXO-BTK-[ADDRESS_266561] 10 hours prior to and 4 hours afte r dosing. Blood samples for PK 
analysis of LOXO-305 alone wil l be taken up to 168 hours postdo se on Day 1. In Period 2, 
multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin will be administered QD from Day 8 until Day 23 
inclusive (for a total of 16 consecutive days). On Days [ADDRESS_266562] ual time of the Day 1 LOXO-305 dos e (± 1 hour), following a 
fast of at least 8 hours prior to and 2 hours after dosing. Blo od samples for PK analysis of 
LOXO-305 in the presence of r ifampin will be taken up to 24 hou rs after the LOXO-305 dose 
on Day 8 and up to 168 hours after the LOXO-305 dose on Day 17. 
Urine samples will be collected on Days 8, 11, 15, and 17 of Part 2 (and may be stored for 
future potential assessment of 6β-hydroxycortisol and free cort isol concentrations to evaluate 
the level of CYP3A enzyme induc tion and/or for further exploratory analysis). 
In Part 1, there will be a washout period of 7 days between the  dose of LOXO-305 on Day 1 
(Period 1) and the first dose  of itraconazole on Day 8 (Period 2). 
In Part 2, there will be a washout period of 7 days between the  dose of LOXO-305 on Day 1 
(Period 1) and the first dose of rifampin and dose of LOXO-305 on Day 8 (Period 2). 
To assess their elig ibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screen ed within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted t o the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check-in). 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check-in (Day -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day 19 in Par t 1 or Day 24 in Part 2, following completion of all PK and 
safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if the subject dis continues. A follow-up phone 
call will occur for all subjects who received at least 1 dose o f study drug (including subjects 
who are terminated early) 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET. 
Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary b y the Sponsor. 
In this study, physical examinati ons, 12-lead electrocardiogram s (ECGs), vital signs, How Do 
You Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clini cal chemistry panel, coagulat ion parameters, CK, 
complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2) and concomitant medication 
recording will be perf ormed at Screening and at specified times during the study (for specific 
timepoints and details on each study variable, refer to Appendix 4). Adverse events (AEs) 
and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be collected beginning a t informed consent. Adverse 
events will be reported thr oughout the study (ie, from signing of the Informed Consent Form 
[ICF] until End of Study [EOS], or  until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and 
does not complete a follow-up phone  call), either as subject me dical history (if the event is 
reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the eve nt occurs prior to study drug

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 10 of 60 Criteria for Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics: 
In Part 1, serial PK blood samples  for the analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 
will be collected from predose through 168 hours postdose follo wing administration of 
LOXO-305 alone on Day 1 (Period 1)  and with itraconazole on Day  12 (Period 2). In Part 2, 
serial PK blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentratio ns of LOXO-305 will be 
collected from predose thr ough 24 hours postdose following admi nistration of LOXO-305 
and rifampin on Day 8 (Period 2) and from predose through 168 hours postdose following 
administration of LOXO-305 al one on Day 1 (Period 1) and with r ifampin on Day 17 
(Period 2). 
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possibl e, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO-305 (as app ropriate): area under the con centration-time curve from 
Hour 0 to 24 hours postdose, as calculated by [CONTACT_221877] (for Day 1 and 
Day 8 of Part 2 PK only [AUC 0-24]), area under the concentration-time curve from Hour [ADDRESS_266568] measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), area under the concentration-time curve 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf), extrapolation for area under  the concentration-time curve 
(%AUC extrap), maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum observed 
concentration (t max), apparent terminal elim ination rate constant (λ Z), apparent systemic 
clearance (CL/F), apparent first order terminal elimination rat e constant (Kel) calculated from 
a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_221878] s regression ana lysis using th e maximum number of points in 
the terminal log linear phase (eg, 3 or more non-zero plasma co ncentrations [Kel]), and 
apparent terminal elimination half-life (t ½). 
No value for Kel, AUC 0-inf, CL/F, or t ½ will be reported for cas es that do not exhibit a 
terminal log linear phase in the  concentration- time profile. Th e PK sampling to 24 hours on 
Day 8 in Part 2 may not be sufficient for calculation of severa l Kel-dependent PK parameters. 
No PK parameters will be calcu lated for subjects with 2 or fewe r consecutive timepoints with 
quantifiable concentrations. 
Individual and mean plasma concen tration-time curves (both line ar and log linear) will be 
included in the final report. 
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466], performing physical examinations 
and clinical laboratory tests , measuring vital signs, and 12-le ad ECGs. 
Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetics: 
A mixed effect model including tr eatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect will 
be used to analyze the natural l og (ln)-transformed PK paramete rs (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and 
Cmax). The ratios and their 90% confid ence intervals (CIs) of the P K parameter for each

Safety: All safety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital signs mea surements, clinical 
laboratory results, physical examination results, concomitant m edications, and 12-lead ECGs 
will be tabulated and summarize d where possible, using descript ive methodology, as needed, 
by [CONTACT_11191]. Unless otherwise specified, baseline value is def ined as the last non-missing 
measurement before administr ation of LOXO-[ADDRESS_266570]. 
Additional details on the analyse s will be included in the Stat istical Analysis Plan (SAP).

Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed informat ion concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, an d adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product (IMP).1 
1.1. Background 
LOXO-305 (also known as LY3527727) is a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) being developed by [CONTACT_132189]. In enzyme and ce llular assays, 
LOXO-305 potently inhibits wildtype BTK and the BTK C481S-acquired resistance mutation 
which results from a serine  substitution at position 481. This inhibitory activity correlated 
with significant inhibition of gr owth of BTK-dependent human ly mphoma cell lines. C481S 
mutations (and other substitutions of this cysteine residue) are clinically important because they may explain more than half the cases of acquired resistance to commercially available covalent BTK inhibitors in patien ts with chronic lymphocytic le ukemia (CLL), and have also 
been identified in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), and ma ntle cell lymphoma 
(MCL) patients.
2–[ADDRESS_266578] 300-fold more selective for BTK than for  98% of 
[ADDRESS_266579] 70-fold more selective for BTK 
than for 98% of 180 non-BTK kinases screened in live human peri pheral blood mononuclear 
cells. 
Irreversible BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib and acalabrutinib ha ve transformed the treatment 
landscape of several BTK-depende nt B-cell malignancies, includi ng CLL, WM, MCL, and 
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). H owever, the efficacy of these ag ents in the long-term is 
limited by [CONTACT_221879], most commonly t hrough BTK C481 
substitution mutations that prev ent covalent binding and inactivation of BTK by [CONTACT_221880]. Additionally, half of  patients who discontinue ibru tinib therapy have adverse 
events which are attributed to o ff-target effects and limit lon g-term use of ibrutinib. 
Therefore, a more potent and sel ective inhibitor of BTK with ac tivity against BTK-wildtype 
and C481 mutant BTK may provide c linical benefit to patients wi th B-cell malignancies 
where treatment with irreversib le BTK inhibitors has failed. 
LOXO-305 is a small molecule tha t was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
binding site of the BTK kinase co mpetitively and has single dig it nanomolar activity against 
BTK-wildtype and C481S. There is no evidence of covalent or irr eversible binding. Loxo 
Oncology is initiating the clini cal development of LOXO-305 for  the treatment of patients 
with previously treated CLL/sma ll lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), W M, MCL, MZL, and 
other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 
1.2. Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics 
In non-clinical studies, LOXO-[ADDRESS_266580] low clear ance in humans. In vitro data with cloned expressed 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and human liver microsomes indica te that CYP3A4 is the 
primary enzyme that metabolizes LOXO-305.

effective inhibitor of P-gp in t he gut when admin istered as an acute single dose. 
1.6. Benefit-risk Assessment 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benef it (beyond that of an assessment 
of their medical status) from  participating in the study. The risks of participation are 
primarily those associated with a dverse reactions  to the study treatments, although there may 
also be some discomfort fro m collection of blood samples and other study procedures. The 
dose of LOXO-[ADDRESS_266595] in human studies.1 More information about the known and 
expected benefits, risks, and reas onably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO-305 may be 
found in the IB.1 
The doses of itraconazole and rif ampin administered in this stu dy are not anticipated to 
induce any potential risk or bene fit to subjects  participating in this study, as they are multiple 
doses administered according to the dosing recommendations in the full prescribing information for itraconazole and rifampin.
7,8 
The potential risk of participati ng in this study is well managed by [CONTACT_221881]-up and is 
considered negligible. The saf ety monitoring practices employed will include AE reporting, 
vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laborato ry evaluations, and physical 
examinations, and are considered adequate to protect the subjec ts’ safety. 
As this is the first time L OXO-305 is to be administered with a  CYP3A4 inhibitor in healthy 
adult males and females of non-ch ildbearing poten tial, Part 1 w ill include a sentinel group for 
safety purposes. This sentinel group will be composed of 3 subj ects. Following completion of 
the sentinel cohort, the Investigator and Sponsor will review a ll pertinent safety and 
tolerability data (and PK data, if available) from the sentinel  cohort before proceeding to dose 
the remaining 9 subjects in the  second cohort in Part 1 and sub jects in Part 2. 
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
2.1. Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study are: 
 to assess the impact of multiple oral doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibitor) on the single oral  dose PK of LOXO-305 in healthy ad ult subjects; 
 to assess the effect of multiple oral doses of rifampin (strong  CYP3A4 inducer) on the 
single oral dose PK of LOXO-305 i n healthy adult subjects; 
 to assess the effect of a single oral dose of rifampin on the s ingle oral dose PK of 
LOXO-305 in healthy adult subjects. 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8419666 Protocol Reference: LOXO-BTK-[ZIP_CODE] 
Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 21 of 60 The secondary objectives of the study are: 
 to assess the safety and tolerab ility of a single oral dose of LOXO-305 when 
administered alone and co-administered with multiple oral doses  of itraconazole; 
 to assess the safety and tolerab ility of a single oral dose of LOXO-305 when 
administered alone and co-administered with single and multiple  oral doses of 
rifampin. 
2.2. Endpoints 
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possibl e, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO- 305 (as appropriate): 
 area under the concentration-tim e curve from Hour 0 to 24 hours  postdose, as 
calculated by [CONTACT_221882] (for Day 1 and Day 8 of Part 2 PK only 
[AUC 0-24]) 
 area under the concentration-time curve from Hour [ADDRESS_266596] measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t) 
 area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
 extrapolation for area under the concentration-time curve (%AUC extrap) 
 maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) 
 time to maximum observed concentration (t max) 
 apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z) 
 apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) 
 apparent first order terminal e limination rate constant (Kel) 
 apparent terminal elimination half-life (t ½). 
A mixed effect model including tr eatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect will 
be used to analyze the natural l og (ln)-transformed PK paramete rs (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and 
Cmax), using the appropriate st atistical procedure. 
No value for Kel, AUC 0-inf, CL/F, or t ½ will be reported for cas es that do not exhibit a 
terminal log linear phase in the  concentration- time profile. Th e PK sampling to 24 hours on 
Day 8 in Part 2 may not be sufficient for calculation of severa l Kel-dependent PK parameters. 
No PK parameters will be calcu lated for subjects with 2 or fewe r consecutive timepoints with 
quantifiable concentrations. 
Individual and mean plasma concen tration-time curves (both line ar and log linear) will be 
included in the final report. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466], performing physical examinations 
and clinical laboratory tests , measuring vital signs, and 12-le ad ECGs.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 1, 2-part study. Each part will be conducted as  an open-label, 2-period, 
fixed-sequence study. Following completion of the sentinel subjects in Part 1, the study parts 
may be conducted concurrently. 
3.1.1. Part 1 – Itraconazole (CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitor) 
In Part 1, Period 1, a single  oral dose of [ADDRESS_266597] 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after dosing with 
LOXO-305. Blood samples for PK analysis of LOXO-305 in the abse nce of itraconazole will 
be taken up to 168 hours postdose of LOXO-305 on Day 1. 
In Part 1, Period 2, multiple oral doses of 200 mg itraconazole will be administered twice 
daily (BID) on Day 8, and QD from Day 9 until Day 18 inclusive (for a total of 
11 consecutive days) and co-administered with a single oral dos e of 200 mg LOXO-305 on 
Day 12 under fasted conditions. On Day 8, when itraconazole is administered BID, the 
morning dose will be administered alone at the actual time of t he Day 1 LOXO-305 dose 
(± 1 hour), approximately [ADDRESS_266598], and the evening dose 
will be administered approximate ly 10 (±1) hours after the morn ing dose, approximately 
[ADDRESS_266599] ual time of the Day 1 LOXO-305 dos e (± 1 hour), approximately 
[ADDRESS_266600] 
10 hours prior to and 4 hours af ter dosing with LOXO-305 and it raconazole. Blood samples 
for PK analysis of LOXO-305 in t he presence of itraconazole will be taken up to 168 hours 
postdose of the LOXO-305 dose on Day 12. 
There will be a washout peri od of 7 days between the dose of LO XO-305 on Day 1 (Period 1) 
and the first dose of itr aconazole on Day 8 (Period 2). 
Part 1 will be divided into 2 cohorts; a sentinel cohort will comprise 3 subjects and the 
second cohort will comprise 9 sub jects, for a total of 12 subjects. 
Following completion of the sen tinel cohort, the Investigator a nd Sponsor will review all 
pertinent safety and tolerability data (and PK data, if availab le) from the sentinel cohort 
before proceeding to dose the re maining 9 subjects in the second cohort in Part 1 of subjects 
in Part 2. 
To assess their elig ibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screen ed within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted t o the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check-in). 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check-in (Day -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day 19 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early 
Termination (ET) if the subject  discontinues. A follow-up phone  call will occur for all

Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary b y the Sponsor. 
3.1.2. Part 2 – Rifampin (CYP3A4 Inducer) 
In Part 2, Period 1, a single  oral dose of [ADDRESS_266601] 10 hours prior to and 4 hours afte r dosing with LOXO-305. Blood 
samples for PK analysis of LOXO-305 in the absen ce of rifampin will be taken up to 
168 hours postdose of LOXO-305 on Day 1. 
In Part 2, Period 2, multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin will be administered QD from 
Day 8 until Day 23 inclusive (for a total of 16 consecutive day s) and co-administered with a 
single oral dose of [ADDRESS_266602] 10 hours prior to and 4 hours after 
dosing with LOXO-305 and rifampin. On Days 9 to 16 and Days 18 to 23, the dose of rifampin will be administered al one at the actual time of the D ay 1 LOXO-305 dose 
(± 1 hour), following a fast of at least [ADDRESS_266603] dose of LOXO-305 on 
Day 17. 
Urine samples will be collected on Days 8, 11, 15, and 17 of Part 2 only (and may be stored 
for future potential assessment of 6β-hydroxycortisol and free cortisol concentrations to 
evaluate the level of CYP3A enz yme induction and/or for further  exploratory analysis). 
There will be a washout peri od of 7 days between the dose of LO XO-305 on Day 1 (Period 1) 
and the first dose of rifam pin and dose of LOXO-305 on Day 8 (Period 2). 
To assess their elig ibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screen ed within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (Check-in). Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].

beginning at informed consent. Adve rse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, 
from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues 
from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call), either as subject medical 
history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing  of the ICF or if the event occurs

prior to study drug administrat ion on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by 
[CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). Fr om EOT or ET through EOS, 
only AEs assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be 
reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing un til EOS (or ET, if the subject 
discontinues from the study and doe s not complete a follow-up p hone call) are to be reported. 
In Part 1, blood samples for LOX O-305 PK analysis will be obtai ned from predose through 
168 hours postdose after LOXO-305 is administered alone on Day 1 (Period 1) and with 
itraconazole on Day 12 (Period 2). In Part 2, blood samples for  LOXO-305 PK analysis will 
be obtained from predose through 168 hours postdose after LOXO- 305 is administered on 
alone on Day 1 (Period 1) and with  rifampin Day 17 (Period 2), and through 24 hours after 
LOXO-305 is administered with r ifampin on Day 8 (Period 2). A s tudy flow chart is 
presented in Appendix 4. Study completion is defined as th e time of the last subject’s  
follow-up phone call. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design 
Overall 
Data from in vitro studies with c loned expressed CYP enzymes an d human liver microsomes 
indicate that CYP3A4 is the prim ary enzyme that metabolizes LOX O-305. Furthermore, 
LOXO-305 is a substrate for P- gp, thus rendering LOXO-305 susce ptible to DDI when 
co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P- gp. 
The fixed single-sequence desi gn used in this study is typi[INVESTIGATOR_221864] a 
relatively small number of subjects are required, because it allows intra-subject comparisons. 
This study will be open-label because the study endpoints are n ot considered subjective. 
Multiple doses of itraconazole and rifampin will allow the DDI effect(s) of both study drugs 
on LOXO-[ADDRESS_266605] on CYP3A4 and P-gp will be achieved. 
Conducting the study in healthy adult subjects mitigates the po tential confounding effects of 
the disease state and concomitant medications. 
Part 1 – Itraconazole (CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitor) 
In Part 1, the effects of multip le oral doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibitor) on the PK of LOXO-305 w ill be investigated. Itracona zole is a well-characterized, 
competitive, strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a potent inhibitor of P-gp; thus it was selected 
for this study as per recomme ndations in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 
for Drug Interaction Studies.

Itraconazole The clinical dose of itraconazo le is 200 mg administered once B ID and then QD. In this 
study, itraconazole will be dose d BID for 1 day (Day 8) and the n QD for 10 days (ie, Days 9 
to 18), with LOXO-305 co-administe red on the fifth day after th e start of itraconazole dosing

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 26 of 60 (ie, Day 12). Although itraconazole  reaches steady-state at app roximately 15 days QD 
dosing, BID dosing on Day 8 (ie, a l oading dose on the first da y of dosing) helps to achieve 
steady-state within [ADDRESS_266613] demonstrated su fficient inhibition of CYP3A enzymes with 5 days of QD 
dosing.10 To maintain the same level of inhibition, itraconazole will be  administered until 
Day 18. 
As itraconazole capsules should be  administered with a full mea l to maximize its absorption, 
on Days 9 to 11 and 13 to 18, the dose of  itraconazole will be administered alone at the actual 
time of the Day 1 LOXO-305 dose (± 1 hour), approximately [ADDRESS_266614] to maximize the inhibition potential. On Day  8, when itraconazole is 
administered BID, the morning dos e will be administered alone a t the actual time of the 
Day 1 LOXO-305 dose (± 1 hour), approxi mately [ADDRESS_266615], and the evening dose will be administered approximately 10 (±1) hours after the 
morning dose, approximately [ADDRESS_266616] 
sensitive conditions, both itr aconazole and LOXO-305 will be ad ministered in the fasted state 
(ie, following a fast of at least 10 hours prior to and 4 hours  after dosing with itraconazole 
and LOXO-305). 
Rifampin 
The dose of rifampin selected for  this study is 600 mg QD, whic h is the commonly used 
clinical dose level . Rifampin will be dosed QD for 16 days (ie, Days 8 to 23), with 
LOXO-[ADDRESS_266617] and tenth day after the s tart of rifampin dosing (ie, 
Days 8 and 17, respectively). As pe r literature, an acute dose of rifampin inhibits 
P-gp-mediated transport while  chronic dosing strongly induces C YP3A enzymes and P-gp.11 
Therefore, the acute (transporter) effect of a single dose of r ifampin on the single-dose PK of 
LOXO-305 will be assessed to maximize the ability to observe small differences in PK. 
Sampling up to 24 hours will be sufficient to evaluate the inhi bitory effects as P-gp acts 
mostly in the gut (absorption/di stribution phases). Rifampin do sing alone will then be 
continued QD to assess its i nduction potential on LOXO-305. The half-life of rifampin is 
approximately 3 hours following a 600-mg oral dose;[ADDRESS_266618] 
8 hours prior to and 2 hours af ter dosing with rifampin.

6. CONCOMITANT THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_42431] 
6.1. Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221867]/acetaminophen (maximum of 2 g/day for up to 3 conse cutive days) is an 
acceptable concomitant medication. 
Subjects will refrain from use of any prescription or nonprescription medications/products 
during the study until EOT or ET, unless the Investigator (or d esignee) and/or Sponsor have 
given their prior consent. 
Subjects will refrain from participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which 
receipt of any investigational  drug occurs within  5 half-lives (if known) or 30 days, 
whichever is longer, prior t o dose administration (Day 1). 
All prescription and over-the-counter medications (including HR T, herbal products, natural 
or herbal supplements, except for paracetamol/acetaminophen as referenced above) are 
prohibited for 14 days prior to dose administration (Day 1) and  through EOT or ET, unless 
deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and Sponsor . This includes but is not 
limited to: moderate or strong CYP 3A4 and/or CYP3A5 inhibitors or inducers (with the 
exception of itraconazole and rifam pin administered for the pur poses of this study/in 
accordance with the protocol), strong P-gp inhibitors, proton p ump inhibitors, antacids, 
H2-receptor antagonists, and drugs that prolong QT/QTc interval.

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 37 of 60 necessary in a medical emergenc y. In this case, the use of the concomitant medication will be 
reported as soon as is practical. 
6.2. Diet, Fluid, and Activity Control 
Subjects are required to refrain from use of tobacco, smoking c essation products, and 
nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Screening  through EOT or ET. 
Consumption of foods or beverage s containing grapefruit/grapefr uit juice or Seville oranges 
or its juice within 7 days prior to Check-in (Day -1) and throu gh EOT or ET will not be 
allowed unless deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_737] (or design ee) and Sponsor. 
Consumption of alcohol- or caffe ine-containing foods or beverag es within 72 hours prior to 
Check-in (Day -1) and through EOT or ET will not be allowed unless deemed acceptable by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) and Sponsor. 
Subjects will refrain from st renuous exercise from 5 days prior  to Check-in (Day -1) and 
during the period of confinement at the CRU and will otherwise maintain their normal level 
of physical activity through EOT or ET (ie, should not begin a new exercise program or 
participate in any unusually str enuous physical exertion). 
While confined at the CRU, subjects will receive a standard die t at scheduled times that do 
not conflict with other study-related activities. Dietary requirement in relat ion to dosing are described in Section 3.[ADDRESS_266641] asma (Part 1 and Part 2) and po tentially 
6β-hydroxycortisol and free cort isol concentrations (Part 2 onl y) in urine to evaluate the level 
of CYP3A enzyme induction (if  determined to be necessary) will be determined using a 
validated bioanalytical method. Spe cifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a 
separate document. Urine samples may be stored for f uture potential assessment of 6β-hydroxycortisol and free 
cortisol concentrations to evaluat e the level of CYP3A enzyme i nduction and/or for further 
exploratory analysis.

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 38 of 60 7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments 
Safety evaluations may be repea ted at the discretion of the Inv estigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor. 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedure s in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving consideratio ns to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and any other procedures to be perf ormed at the same timepoint.  The order of priority for 
scheduling procedures around a tim epoint is (in descending orde r of priority): 
 dosing 
 PK blood sampling 
 vital signs assessments 
 12-lead ECGs 
 blood and urine samples for clinical laboratories 
 physical examination. 
7.2.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse event definitions; assi gnment of severity, causality, a ction taken, and outcome; and 
procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a non-l eading HDYF? question such as “Ha ve there been any changes 
in your health status since Scr eening/since you were last asked ?” at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4 (ie, at Screening [after the IC F is signed], at Check-in [Day -1], at each 
postdose vital signs assessment, and at an appropriate time for  all other days). Subjects will 
also be encouraged to voluntarily  report AEs occurring at any o ther time through the EOS. 
Adverse events, whether voluntee red, identifie d by [CONTACT_423]’s responses to HDYF? 
inquiries, or noted on physical e xamination, ECG, vital signs a ssessments, or laboratory tests, 
will be recorded throughout the s tudy (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if the 
subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call]), either as 
subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if 
the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 an d is assessed as not related to 
study procedures by [CONTACT_737]  [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after 
signing of the ICF but prior to s tudy drug administration on Da y 1 and is assessed as related 
to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if th e event occurs after study drug 
administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relatio nship to study drug). From 
EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study dr ug by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the ti me of ICF signing until EOS 
(or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not  complete a follow-up phone 
call) are to be reported. 
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the stu dy and does not complete the 
follow-up phone call, all subjects must be follo
wed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or desig nee) which are ongoing at EOS 
may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) retu rn to normal, or acceptable

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 39 of 60 levels, as judged by [CONTACT_221890]. The 
Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in o rdering additional tests as 
necessary to monitor the resolu tion of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety 
tests be performed. 
Subjects will receive a follo w-up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug-related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit. 
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU fo r longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee). Any event that meets the criter ia of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB )/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) according to CRU policy by [CONTACT_737] (or  designee) and to regulatory 
authorities by [CONTACT_1034] (or  Sponsor designee) according to r egulatory authority 
requirements. Refer to Reference Safety Information in the curr ent IB
1 for LOXO-305 for 
expected adverse reactions. 
7.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations  (clinical chemistry panel [fasted at least 8 hour s], coagulation 
parameters, CK, CBC, TSH, HbA1c  [Screening only], and UA) will be collected at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 4 . 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, and HIV antibody will be perfo rmed at Screening. A 
urine drug screen for selected d rugs of abuse (including cotini ne) and an alcohol breath test 
will be performed at Screening and repeated at Check-in (Day -1 ) for all subjects. A serum 
qualitative pregnancy test (fe male subjects only [serum quantit ative may be used for 
confirmation if needed]) and an FSH test (post-menopausal femal e subjects only) will be 
performed at the timepoints specified in  Appendix [ADDRESS_266642] of the specific evaluations is in  Appendix 2 . 
7.2.3. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (including oral tempe rature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991], and pulse rate) will 
be obtained at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be performed using the same arm for 
each reading and measurements shoul d be taken after the subject  has been resting in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes. 
When vital signs assessments are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws 
will be obtained at the schedule d timepoint, and the vital sign s will be obtained prior to and 
as close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 41 of 60 8.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
In Part 1, serial PK blood samples  for the analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 
will be collected from predose through 168 hours postdose follo wing administration of 
LOXO-305 alone on Day 1 (Period 1)  and with itraconazole on Day  12 (Period 2). In Part 2, 
serial PK blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentratio ns of LOXO-305 will be 
collected from predose thr ough 24 hours postdose following admi nistration of LOXO-305 
and rifampin on Day 8 (Period 2) and from predose through 168 hours postdose following 
administration of LOXO-305 al one on Day 1 (Period 1) and with r ifampin on Day 17 
(Period 2). 
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be calculat ed for each subject, based on 
the plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 (as appropriate): AUC
0-24 area under the concentration- time curve from Hour 0 to 24 hour s postdose, as 
calculated by [CONTACT_221882] (for Day 1 and Day 8 of Part 2 PK 
only) 
AUC 0-t area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from Hour [ADDRESS_266644]

where C t is the last measurable concentration and λ Z is the apparent terminal 
elimination rate constant 
%AUC extrap percentage extrapolation for AUC 
Cmax  maximum observed plasma concentration 
tmax  time to maximum observed concentration 
λZ apparent terminal elimination rate constant, where Z is the magnitude of the 
slope of the linear regression of the log concentration versus time profile 
during the terminal phase

Adverse Events 
Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE; or advers e experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or heal thy adult subject, whether or n ot considered drug-related by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee). A  treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that is 
reported after a dose of study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
 unfavorable changes in general condition; 
 subjective or objective signs/symptoms; 
 concomitant diseases or accidents; 
 clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters ob served in a subject 
during a clinical study. 
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health stat us, subjective and objective 
disease symptoms (including lab oratory abnormalities that are d eemed clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_18370]), and accidents observed in the  context of a clinical trial, 
irrespective of a possible causa l relationship with the adminis tration of the trial substance. 
Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National C ancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows: 
 Grade 1 Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; inter vention not indicated 
 Grade 2 Moderate: Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting  
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)* 
 Grade 3 Severe or medically signi ficant but not immediately lif e-threatening:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; d isabling; limiting 
self-care ADL** 
 Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences: An event that puts the patient at 
immediate risk of death 
 Grade 5  Death related to AE. 
Note: Not all grades are appropr iate for all AEs. Therefore, so me AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade s election. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and ther efore is not an option. 
* Instrumental ADL refer to prep aring meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221872], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feed ing self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 49 of 60 The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the  relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2-category system according to the following  guidelines: 
 NOT RELATED  = The time course between the a dministration of investigationa l 
product and the occurrence or wor sening of the AE rules out a c ausal relationship 
and another cause (eg, concomitant  drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
is suspected. 
 RELATED = The time course between admin istration of investigational pr oduct 
and the occurrence or worsening of  the AE is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
can be identified. 
An AE is associated with the use  of the drug if there is a reas onable possibility that the 
experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. 
Pregnancy 
As information is available, a  pregnancy (including pregnancy i n female partners of male 
subjects) diagnosed through End of  Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET; if the subject 
discontinues from the study and doe s not complete a follow-up p hone call)  and for up to 
90 days after study drug admini stration should be reported by t he Investigator (or designee) 
via email to Covance or the Spons or’s Clinical Safety Represent ative within 24 hours of 
being notified. Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Repres entative will then forward the 
Pregnancy Form to the Investigator for completion. 
email: [EMAIL_2654] 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediatel y be withdrawn from the 
study and ET study procedures will be performed. The subject or  partner should be followed 
by [CONTACT_221905]. If the pregnancy ends for any reason 
before the anticipated date, t he Investigator should notify Cov ance or the Sponsor’s Clinical 
Safety Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document 
the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy m eets the criteria for 
immediate classification as a serious adverse event (SAE; ie, p ostpartum complication, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirt h, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator 
should follow the procedur es for reporting an SAE. 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover their 
sexual partner is pregnant. In thi s instance, the partner must provide written consent before 
pregnancy information can be col lected. When a Clinical Researc h Unit (CRU) becomes 
aware that the female partner of  a male subject is pregnant, th ey are to contact [CONTACT_86120] (with in 24 hours of the CRU staff beco ming aware of the event) in 
addition to notifying Covance or t he Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative via email. 
All pregnancies should be record ed on the AE electronic Case Re port Form (eCRF; as 
appropriate), in addition to com pletion of the required pregnan cy forms. If the Investigator 
suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction between the study treatment and the 
contraceptive method, in addition to the pregnancy the drug interaction should also be captured as a separate AE.

Protocol Version 1, 14 January 2020 Page 50 of 60 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE (by [CONTACT_221906] [FDA] definition) is an y adverse drug experience 
occurring at any dose that res ults in any of the following outc omes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse drug e xperience (ie, on e that places  the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or de signee], at immediate risk of de ath); 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005]; 
 A persistent or significan t disability/incapacity; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 An important medical event that may require medical or surgical  intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1329] d SAEs when, based on appropria te medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or s ubject and may require medical o r surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcome s listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is consi dered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed 
in the Reference Safety Infor mation section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or if it is not 
listed at the specificity or seve rity that has been observed fo r an unapproved investigational 
medicinal product (IMP). 
Reporting 
Food and Drug Administration-reporta ble AEs are AEs that are as sociated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that a re assessed as serious, related , and unexpected. Food and 
Drug Administration-reportable  AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_221907] (IRB). Final determinati on of whether an event 
represents a suspected unexpected  serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be the 
responsibility of the Sponsor. Within [ADDRESS_266648] recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of a ny SAE (regardless of whether  the event is assessed as 
related or unrelate d to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Repre sentative will be notified by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator or  designee in 
writing using the following email address: 
email: [EMAIL_2654] 
To report the SAE, the complet ed report form should be sent by [CONTACT_132221]’s Clinical Safety Repre sentative within 24 hours of awa reness. Incoming reports are 
reviewed during normal business hours. Additional reporting ins tructions and the SAE Report 
Form are provided in the Study Manual.

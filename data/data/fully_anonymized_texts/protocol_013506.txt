A randomized study of ibuprofen + oxycodone/acetaminophen versus ibuprofen 
+ acetaminophen for ED patients with insufficient relief of acute musculoskeletal 
pain after treatment with prescription strength ibuprofen. 060420191Background
It is clear that many patients with acute musculoskeletal injury continue to suffer 
substantial amounts of pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_301036]-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and even with NSAIDS combined with 
acetaminophen.(1) In head-to-head studies conducted among patients with acute 
musculoskeletal injury, oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_301037].(2, 3) Similarly, studies of opi[INVESTIGATOR_301038].(4, 5) However, these results belie our clinical experience, in which 
oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_301039] a select group of patients. Indeed, 
one critique of the studies mentioned above is that they generally enrolled a broad 
population of patients with acute musculoskeletal injury, rather than the population 
most likely to benefit from oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]: the population of patients with substantial 
persistent pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_301040]. Because of the risks 
now recognized to be associated with oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], it is imperative to identify 
specific populations likely to benefit from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], so that risk/ benefit assessments 
among these patients can be evidence based. With this is mind, we propose a clinical 
trial in which the combination of an oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_301041] (ED) patients most 
likely to benefit from the combination: those patients who report inadequate relief 
of pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_301042]-strength NSAID. We hypothesize that, among an 
enriched population of ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain who request 
additional analgesia after treatment in the ED with an NSAID, oxycodone/ 
acetaminophen will provide superior analgesia than acetaminophen alone, as 
measured by [CONTACT_301045] [ADDRESS_367677] additional analgesia after sufficient time has elapsed after ingestion of the 
ibuprofen will be randomized to oxycodone 10mg/ acetaminophen 650mg or 
acetaminophen 650mg alone.

Population of interest:
--Acute musculoskeletal pain: Any pain attributable to muscles, bones, joints, 
tendons, ligaments or supporting structures, as determined by [CONTACT_6098], of 
[ADDRESS_367678] 
experienced pain in the same body region during the prior six months
--Pain has to be described as moderate or severe, when the patient is asked if the 
pain is mild, moderate or severe in intensity
Exclusion criteria are as follows:
--Contraindication to NSAID
--Contraindication to acetaminophen
--Contraindication to oxycodone
--Use of an NSAID within the previous six hours
--Use of acetaminophen within the previous six hours
--Use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_301043]
--Chronic pain, defined as any pain on >50% of days for at least 3 months prior to 
onset of acute pain
--Gout (a musculoskeletal pain that often requires disease-specific therapy)

A randomized study of ibuprofen + oxycodone/acetaminophen versus ibuprofen 
+ acetaminophen for ED patients with insufficient relief of acute musculoskeletal 
pain after treatment with prescription strength ibuprofen. 060420193Investigational medications
In stage one, all patients will receive ibuprofen 600mg PO.
Patients eligible for stage 2 will be randomized to oxycodone 10mg/ acetaminophen 
650mg or acetaminophen 650mg alone.
The ibuprofen will not be blinded. The research pharmacist will mask the 
medication for stage 2 by [CONTACT_301046]. Randomization will occur 
using a sequence generated at http://randomization.com. Research personnel will 
be presented with consecutive medication packets, which are to be dispensed to 
consecutive patients in sequential order.
The study will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885].
Measures.
--Pain scales. We will use two complementary pain scales. The primary scale will be 
an 11-point numerical scale, on which patients assign their pain an integer between 
0 and 10. This scale, the numerical rating scale for pain, is commonly used in ED 
acute pain research We will also assess pain using a four-item ordinal scale, on 
which patients describe their pain using the descriptors severe, moderate, mild, or 
none. 
--Adequacy of analgesia. 
Patients will be asked the following questions: 
1) Did the medication we gave you control your pain? Answer choices: Yes (it did); 
No (It did not); and Not sure. 
2) The next time you have the same type of pain, do you want a stronger 
medication? Answer choices: Yes (I want a stronger medication); No ( I do not want 
a stronger medication); and Not sure
--Medication induced side effects. Patients will be asked if they developed any new 
symptoms they believe were caused by [CONTACT_301047]. An 
affirmative response will trigger an open-ended follow-up question eliciting details
--Satisfaction with medication. Patients will be asked if they would want to take the 
same medication during a subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_212787].
If study participants are discharged from the ED prior to completion of the study, 
they will be followed by [CONTACT_756].
Outcomes.
This study will be conducted in two stages, the first stage will be non-randomized 
and open label. The second stage will be randomized and blinded. Each stage will 
have a primary outcome. Stage one will commence at the time of enrollment and 
conclude when the patient determines whether or not he or she has experienced 
sufficient analgesia.

+ acetaminophen for ED patients with insufficient relief of acute musculoskeletal 
pain after treatment with prescription strength ibuprofen. 060420194The second stage will commence after the patient has determined whether or not he 
or she has experienced sufficient analgesia and conclude two hours later.
The primary outcome of the open-label stage is the patient’s determination of 
whether or not they have experienced adequate analgesia. This will be assessed [ADDRESS_367679] whether or not the patient will opt for 
second stage treatment.
Analysis.
For the open-label stage, outcomes will be reported as n/N (%) with 95%CI.
Similarly for the blinded stage, outcomes will be reported as mean improvement 
between baseline and two hour with 95%CI. Between group differences will be 
reported as mean difference with 95%CI. The results will be considered statistically 
significant if the 95%CI of the between group difference does not cross 0. Missing 
primary outcome data will be managed by [CONTACT_301048], which we anticipate will bias the results slightly towards the 
null hypothesis.
Sample size calculation.
We calculated a sample size of 146 (73 per group) based on the following 
parameters:  alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, minimum clinically important difference of 
1.3 numerical rating scale (NRS) units, and standard deviation of 2.8 NRS units. We 
wish to enroll an additional 8 subjects (approximately 5%) in order to account for 
potential protocol violations and missing data. Thus, our final sample size for stage [ADDRESS_367680] additional analgesia after 
completing stage 1 will be between 20 and 33%. Therefore, we may need to enroll 
770 patients in stage 1 to obtain a sufficient number of patients for stage 2, although

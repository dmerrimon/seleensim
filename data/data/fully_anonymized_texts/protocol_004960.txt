PROTOCOL CHANGE HISTORY
Protocol Version 10.1, 12 October 2018 (revised from 10 .0, 02 October 2018)
The following is a summary of the changes made to this version of the protocol.
Location of 
ChangeChange/Modification in Version 10 .1
Protocol T itle 
on Title page 
and Synopsis The title of the study has been reverted to the original title from Version 9.0by 
[CONTACT_1121] “group -sequential”. Version 10.1 is otherwise identical to 
Version 10.
Rationale :Protocol RSV -M-301 was originally designed as a group -sequential 
study and all subjects were enrolled under prior versions of the protocol (Version 
9 or earlier) in which the study design was specified as group -sequential. Version 
[ADDRESS_275287] analysis with the ~[ADDRESS_275288] 3000 active subjects has been met 
and the Sponsor believes the trial has adequate power to make a statistically sound 
conclusion based on the aggregate number of blinded primary endpoint cases 
accrued and the projected placebo attack rate of 3-4%. To ensure continued 
traceability between the current protocol and the numerous study- related 
documents which include the protocol title, “group -sequential” will be retained in 
the protocol title . 
Protocol Version 10.0, 02 October 2018 (revised from 9 .0, 21 July 2017)
The following is a summary of the changes made to this version of the protocol.
Note: A complete tabular summary of changes made to previous versions of the protocol has 
been provided in Appendix 5. 
Location of 
ChangeChange/Modification in Version 10 .0
Study Title The title of the study has been updated by [CONTACT_88256] “group -sequential”. 
Rationale :As a group -sequential design with multiple interim analyses is no 
longer planned, the reference to the phrase has been deleted from the study title. 
Section 1.7 , 
SynopsisThe sentence, “Two recent reports of prospective studies have confirmed the 
existence of a symptomatic RSV disease burden in mothers [Hause 2018, 
Madhi 2018] .”, has been added and referenced.
Rationale: This statement updates the current knowledge of the burden of RSV 
illness in pregnancy based on recent publications.

ChangeChange/Modification in Version 10 .0
Section 2.1, 
Synopsis The words “through the first” have been added before the enumeration of the 
120, 150, and 180 day intervals.
The sentence “ Success will be demonstrated under the primary hypothesis 
that the event ratio (RSV F Vaccine/Placebo is ≤ 0.70 (i.e., vaccine efficacy is 
≥ 30%” has been modified to : “Success under the primary hypothesis will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_228928] a lower bound of a two -sided 97.52% 
confidence interval for the Day 90 analysis (lower bound of a 95% confidence 
interval for later time points) for the estimate of vaccine efficacy whi ch 
equals or exceeds target values agr eed with regulatory authorities .”
Rationale: The words “through the first” were added to clarify that the successive 
120, 150, and [ADDRESS_275290] now been specified in Section 10.4.3.
Section 2.2, 
Synopsis “in infants” has been added to the closed bullet sentence “to determine the 
efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine in reducing the 
incidence in infants of”.
Rationale: These words were added toclarify the precise subject population being 
referenced in the objective. 
The two open bullet objectives: 
“RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia (SpO 2< 92% at sea level or < 87% at 
altitudes > 1800 meters) or the need for high flow nasal cannula, or 
mechanic al ventilatory support” 
and 
“RSV LRTI leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
have been modified as(shown in bold ): 
RSV LRTI with EITHER severe hypoxemia (SpO 2< 92% at sea level or 
< 87% at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR the documented use of oxygen by 
[CONTACT_228929] a requirement for continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) 
OR Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR intubation with 
subsequent mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR extracorporeal 
membrane oxyge nation (ECMO) , through the first [ADDRESS_275291] 90 days of life, a 
hierarchical sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine 
efficacy through 120, 150, and 180 days of life.

ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275293] 90 days of life, a 
hierarchical sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine 
efficacy through 120, 150, and 180 days of life.
Rationale: The wording of these two important secondary endpoints was altered 
to: a) provide more specific enumeration of methodologies used for respi[INVESTIGATOR_228709]-rate nasal cann ula and imply greater compromise and b) to clarify 
that, as in the case of the primary endpoint, successive analyses consider the 
intervals from delivery through 90, 120, 150, and 180 days of life, inclusive.
The following sentence has been added : 
“The two secondary efficacy objectives will be evaluated in term infants ( ≥ 37 
weeks gestational age at delivery) born to maternal subjects who received a 
study injection ≥ 2 weeks (14 days) prior to delivery. Infants with multiple RSV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228710] a given criterion will be counted only once, using data from 
the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Success under the secondary efficacy hypotheses will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_228928] a lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the estimate of vaccine efficacy which exc eeds 0%. ”
Rationale: The above sentence has been added to clarify the population to be used 
to support the analysis of the secondary endpoints.  This is a clarification, not a 
change of the protocol.
The following open bullet secondary objective has been recategorized as 
exploratory : 
“RSV LRTI resulting in death”
Rationale: This endpoint has been downgraded to exploratory status, based on the 
very low incidence rate of RSV -related death in populations with access to 
adequate supportive care –which preclud es statistically robust conclusions. 
The following two secondary objectives have been recategorized as 
exploratory : 
“Todetermine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F 
vaccine in reducing the incidence of all RSV LRTI through the first [ADDRESS_275294] 90 days of 
life, a hierarchical sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out to 
examine efficacy at 120, 150, and 180 days of life.” 
and
“To determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F 
vaccine in reducing the incidence of healthcare interventions associated

ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275296] year of life in infants of maternal RSV F 
vaccinees as compared to placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .” 
Rationale: The first of these objectives was downgraded to exploratory status 
because the endpoint, while potentially medically meaningful is very 
heterogeneous and unsupported by [CONTACT_228930].  The second was 
downgraded to exploratory status because of the uncertain reliability of parental 
reports of wheezing as a driver for medical intervention.
Section 2.3, 
Synopsis The following exploratory objectives have been added : 
oTo describe the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine 
in reducing the incidence in infants of medically- significant RSV LRTI 
defined as per the primary objective but with the inclusion of data 
concerning documentation of RSV infection, LRTI symptoms and signs, 
hypoxemia and/or tachypnea obtained from the observations of the clinical 
site staff OR review and abstraction of medical records for infants 
undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711]. 
oTo describe the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine 
in reducing the incidence of RSV LRTI with EITHER severe hypoxemia 
(SpO2 < 92% at sea level or < 87% at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR the 
documented use of oxygen by [CONTACT_228931] (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway pressure 
(BiPAP) OR Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR intubation with 
subsequent mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) defined as per the first seconda ry 
objective but with the inclusion of data concerning documentation of RSV 
infection, LRTI symptoms and signs, and hypoxemia obtained from the 
observations of the clinical site staff OR review and abstraction of medical 
records for infants undergoing hosp italization for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228712]. 
oTo describe the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine 
in reducing the incidence of RSV LRTI requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228713], LRTI symptoms and signs 
obtained from the observations of the clinical site staff OR review and 
abstraction of medical records for infants undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_228714] e vent. 
oTo describe the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine 
in reducing the incidence in infants of RSV LRTI associated with EITHER 
hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO2] < 95% at sea level or < 
92% at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR tachypnea (≥ 60 bpm for infants 0 to 
59 days of age or ≥ 50 bpm for infants ≥ 60 days of age [WHO Handbook, 
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness criteria for tachypnea]) with 
the inclusion of data concerning documentation of RSV infection, LRTI 
symptoms and signs, hypoxemia and/or tachypnea obtained from the 
observations of the clinical site staff OR review and abstraction of medical

ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275298] year of life in infants of maternal RSV F 
vaccinees as compared to placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .
The following note has also been added 
“For all of the above exploratory analyses infants, if efficacy is 
shown through the first 90 days of life, a hierarchical sequence of 
hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy through 
120, 150, and 180 days of life. ”
Rationale: The first three of these objectives mirror the primary and two secondary 
objectives, but allow for the inclusion of data derived from the adequately 
documented medical observations of non-study medical personnel, using pulse 
oximeters and/or diagnostic tests not supplied by [CONTACT_228932]/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  While these do not have the standardization or validation 
of the protocol -mandated primary or secondary efficacy endpoint parameters, they 
allow for the inclusion of many observations concerning infants transported 
directly to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228715] -important 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711], as well as infants first evaluated at the clinical sites, who then 
subsequently deteriorated and fulfilled the endpoint criteria while inaccessible to 
the investigators in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228716].  This broader definition 
allows for capture of RSV LRTI cases which may have evaded direct observation 
by [CONTACT_8786].
The fourth new exploratory objective has been added to capture medically-
significant RSV LRTI characterized by [CONTACT_228933] a level of tachypnea 
approximately 10 breaths per minute lower than that used to define the primary 
endpoint.  This lower level of tachypnea is specified by [CONTACT_228934], and may represent illness of 
sufficient severity to trigger (potentially inappropriate) therapy and/or 
consideration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; thus imposing a he althcare resources burden.
Three of these exploratory objectives have been shifted from the secondary 
objective list for the reasons listed above under Section 2.2.
Section 3.1, 
Synopsis The first paragraph of the study design description has been modified as 
follows:
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275299] ober 2018 Page 8

ChangeChange/Modification in Version 10 .0
The total number of enrolled maternal subjects has been updated from 
approximately 8 ,618 to approximately 4 ,600. 
The following sentence has been added :
“Randomization will be configured to provide approximately 3,[ADDRESS_275300] article.” 
The following sentence has been deleted : 
“Although the trial is projected to enroll an estimated 8,[ADDRESS_275301] -trimester 
pregnant subjects, numbers may be smaller based on the operation of the 
group -sequential d esign (see details in Section 3.2), the incidence rate of the 
primary clinical endpoint events, and the efficacy of the intervention.”
Rationale: It has been determined to terminate the trial at a total enrollment of 
approximately 4,[ADDRESS_275302] conclusion concerning the primary endpoint 
likely, which is congruent with the provisions of Section 6.6. In addition, the 
enrolled number of approximately 4,600 pregnant women, in co njunction with the 
1:1 randomization in season one and 2:1 subsequently, is sufficient to yield ≥3,000 
pregnant women in the active treatment group, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a safety database 
sufficient to observe, with 95% confidence, at least one instance of aunique 
vaccine -related event. Because the protocol will no longer follow a group -
sequential design, mention of the operation of such a design is deleted.
Table 1 has been updated to provide approximate number of subjects in 
treatment groups, i.e., Group A~ 1,562 (originally 2,930) and Group B ~ 3,038 
(originally 5 ,688). 
Rationale: Table 1 has been modified the approximate number of subjects to be 
included in the two treatment groups based on the new final enrollment target and 
the randomization scheme.
The last sentence “A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
supervise enrollment and monitoring of subject safety throughout the trial” has 
been extended to include the following : 
“A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will supervise enrollment 
and monitor subject safety throughout the trial (see Section 8.10).  In order 
to ensure that mothers and infants are not placed at risk with scant 
possibility of success, repeated futility analyses will be performed 
twice per year during the period of the study .  Due to the seasonal nature 
of RSV disease and the occurrence of RSV seasons in a roughly sequential 
manner across the Northern and Southern hemispheres, futility analyses, 
for detecting situations in which the existing efficacy data is not consistent 
with a predefined minimal clinical benefit, will occur at the approximate 
end of each Northern hemisphere season (data as ofapproximately 
30May) and each global RSV season (data as ofapproximately

30September, comprising a Northern hemisphere season and the 
following Southern hemisphere season); and subject to constraint (appl ied 
by [CONTACT_228935]) that at least [ADDRESS_275304] 90 days of life. If successful outcomes are obtai ned 
through 90 days of life, then additional analyses for efficacy will be 
performed in a closed hierarchical sequence considering data from 
delivery through 120, 150, and 180 days of life (with each sequential 
analysis being enabled by a significant resul t at the preceding shorter 
interval).  Multiple secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses will 
also address other infant and maternal RSV disease outcomes.
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, as well as exploratory 
efficacy endpoints in infants concerning RSV -associated illness, will be 
reviewed and validated by [CONTACT_228936] (CEAC) prior to unblinding (see Section 
10.4.2 ).  Only endpoints validated by [CONTACT_228937]. Section 10.4.3 provides details of the futility and 
efficacy analyses .”
Rationale: The above additions to the final paragraph of Section 3.[ADDRESS_275305] 
closely similar or identical text in the prior Section 3.2 of protocol version 9.0, 
which described the operation of the group -sequential design and has now been 
deleted.  The added text describes the rationale for repeated futility analyses (which 
have occurred throughout the life of the trial), the timing of those analyses as driven 
by [CONTACT_228938], and the planned DSMB response to a 
determination of futility.  The section concludes with a general description of the 
primary efficacy analysis concerning medically- significant RSV LRTI from 
delivery through 90 days of life, followed by a closed hierarchical sequence of tests 
through 120, 150, and 180 days of life.  This description is unchanged from the 
prior Section 3.2.  In addition, reference is made to the introduction of a Clinical 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC), a group of pediatricians who will 
examine the data content, and temporal sequencing of that content, of each primary, 
secondary, and infant RSV illness exploratory endpoint to ensure that these fulfill 
the relevant definitions in a clinically reasonable temporal sequence.
Section 3.2, 
Synopsis The section “Group Sequential Design Strategy” has been deleted in its 
entirety. 
Rationale: As a group -sequential design with multiple interim analyses is no 
longer planned, the prior Section 3.2 has been deleted in toto.   Information that 
remains relevant concerning the DSMB, futility analysis strategy, and overarching 
efficacy analysis plan are incorporated into Section 3.1 (see above).  Note that this 
change alters the subsection numbering within Section 3, with the description of 
endpoints (prior Section 3.3) now forming Section 3.2.

Section 3.2.1, 
Synopsis The language to describe the primary efficacy endpoint has been clarified from 
“incidence of medically- significant RSV LRTI” to “Percentages of infants 
with medically -significant RSV LRTI through 90, 120, 150, and 180 days of 
life.”
Rationale:   The description of all efficacy endpoints has been amended to more 
specifically state that the endpoints are in fact Percentages of subjects with a given 
clinical disease state.  These counts will be used to calculate incidence rates and 
perform statistical contrasts.  This is a change for clarity and consistency only, it 
does not affect the execution of the trial or the efficacy analyses.
The following sentences have been deleted :
“The primary analysis will consider term infants (≥ 37 weeks of gestation 
at delivery) of mothers who received test article ≥ 2 weeks prior to delivery.  
Analyses at 120, 150, and 180 days of life will be performed dependent on 
successf ul outcomes at the prior, shorter intervals.”  
“Note that, where it appears as a component of secondary or exploratory 
endpoints, the term “RSV LRTI” will be defined by [CONTACT_228939], with the additional characteristic specified in that 
particular endpoint, e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].”   
Rationale: The first sentence, specifying the primary analysis population, 
has been relocated to the primary objective description (Section 2.1).  The 
second sentence has been removed as unnecessary; all conditions required 
for any given endpoint are now described within the endpoint.  Neither of 
these changes affect the execution of the trial or the efficacy analyses.
The following sentences have been added : 
“Data elements supporting the three (3)criteria for a primary endpoint case 
will be present within the start and stop dates of a continuous illness 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228717] (LRTI signs and symptoms 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651]) made by [CONTACT_228940], pulse 
oximetry performed by [CONTACT_781] a Masimo RAD -[ADDRESS_275307] at the central laboratory (Marshfield Clinic Resea rch Institute , 
Marshfield, Wisconsin) .”
  
“A Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) composed of 
expert pediatricians (see Section 10.4.2) will carry out a blinded review of 
all potential primary endpoint cases to determine if they fulfill the primary 
endpoint criteria in a temporally plausible relationship consistent with RSV 
disease as observed in clinical practice.  Only CEAC -confirmed cases will 
be used for the primary endpoint. ”

Rationale: The first sentence above specifies the exact source of the data 
supporting the primary endpoint events. This sentence is a clarification and 
represents no change in the execution or analysis of the trial. The second sentence 
indicates that the primary endpoint events will be subject to review and validation 
by [CONTACT_10981], blinded committee of pediatricians prior to inclusion in the 
primary efficacy analysis. This Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee has 
been added to ensure that temporally or clinically implausible events are not 
included in the analyses.
Section 3.2.2, 
Synopsis The two secondary efficacy endpoints have been modified as follows: 
Percentages of infants with RSV LRTI with EITHER severe hypoxemia 
(SpO 2< 92% at sea level or <87% at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR the 
documented use of oxygen by [CONTACT_228929] a requirement 
for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway 
pressure (BiPAP) OR Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR 
intubation with subsequent mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from delivery through 90, 
120, 150 and 180 days of life. An event is considered RSV LRTI with 
severe hypoxemia if all parameters outlined below are present during a 
continuous symptomatic illness epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]: 
oRSV infection as confirmed by [CONTACT_228941]-PCR, AND
oAt least one manifestation of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] 
(LRTI) from among the following: cough, nasal flaring, lower 
chest wall indrawing, subcostal retractions, stridor, rales, rhonchi, 
wheezing, crackles/crepi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or observed apnea, AND
oEvidence of severe hypoxemia or the requirement for respi[INVESTIGATOR_228718]:
-EITHER severe hypoxemia (peripheral ox ygen saturation 
[SpO 2] < 92% at sea level or < 87% at altitudes > 1800

-The documented use of oxygen by [CONTACT_228942] a
OR continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) OR bilevel

wheezing, crackles/crepi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or observed apnea, AND
oDocumented hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Rationale: The endpoints described correspond to the secondary 
objectives.  The description of the endpoints has been modified for clarity
to utilize the terminology of “Percentages” and include all of the elements 
necessary for each endpoint. The endpoint relating to severe hypoxemia 
has been modified to provide specific enumeration of methodologies used 
for respi[INVESTIGATOR_228721]-rate nasal cannula and imply 
greater compromise . The endpoint relating to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228722].
The following sentences have been added :
“Data elements supporting the criteria for secondary endpoint cases will be 
present within the start and stop dates of a continuous illness epi[INVESTIGATOR_228723] (LRTI signs and symptoms and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651]) made by [CONTACT_228940], pulse oximetry 
performed by [CONTACT_781] a Masimo RAD -[ADDRESS_275311] at the 
central labora tory (Marshfield Clinic Research Institute , Marshfield,

nasal cannula , CPAP, BiPAP, bubble PAP, intubation ,ormechanical 
ventilation or ECM Owill be supported by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_228725]. ”
“A Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) composed of 
expert pediatricians (see Section 10.4.2) will carry out a blinded review of 
all potential secondary endpoint cases to determine if they fulfill the 
relev ant endpoint criteria in a temporally plausible relationship consistent 
with RSV disease as observed in clinical practice.  Only CEAC- confirmed 
cases will be used for secondary endpoints. ”
Rationale: As above for the primary endpoints, the first sentence above specifies 
the exact source of the data supporting the secondary endpoint events. This sentence 
is a clarification and represents no change in the execution or analysis of the trial.  
The second sentence indicates that the secondary endpoint events will be subject to

to inclusion in the secondary efficacy analysis. This Clinical Endpoint Adjudication 
Committee has been added to ensure that temporally or clinically implaus ible 
events are not included in the analyses.

The following original secondary endpoints have been removed as secondary 
endpoints and placed under exploratory endpoints: 
“Incidence of RSV LRTI resulting in death in infants through 90 days of 
life,”
“Incidence of RSV LRTI (all severities) in infants through 90 days of life.
“Incidence of healthcare interventions associated with wheezing through 
the first year of life. ”
Rationale: In parallel with changes in the secondary objectives, these three 
endpoints have been downgraded to exploratory endpoints.
Section 3.2.3 “seroconversion rate, SCR [maternal subjects only] ”has been added to the first 
bullet of the immunogenicity endpoint s.
It has been specified that micronuetralization titers “may be generated for a 
subset of the population”. The following sentence has been added: “An external 
laboratory, whose personnel are blinded to study treatment, will perform 
RSV/A and B MN testing during study conduct and after Day 180 unblinding.  
Final MN results, because of their time -consuming nature, may be provided as 
one o r more sequential addenda to the main study report .”
Rationale:  Rationale:  These changes correct the omission of the term “seroconversion rate” 
from prior versions (the analyses were planned and were represented as “2 -and 4 -
fold rises) and provide an expectation for the schedule of completion of 
microneutralization.
Section 3.2.4 The language used to describe the safety endpoints has been changed from 
“counts and percentages” to “percentages” for all safety endpoints. 
Rationale:  To be more specific in describing how the safety endpoints will be 
described.
Section 3.2.5, 
Synopsis The following seven exploratory endpoints have been added : 
oPercentages of infants with medically- significant RSV LRTI from delivery 
through 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of life defined as per the primary 
efficacy endpoint with the exception that evidence ofRSV infection, LRTI, 
hypoxemia, and/or tachypnea may be based on either or both of the 
observations of the clinical site staff using sponsor -supplied devices and 
diagnostic tests OR review and abstraction of medical records for infants 
undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711]. 
oPercentages of infants with RSV LRTI with EITHER severe hypoxemia 
(SpO2 < 92% at sea level or < 87% at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR the 
documented use of oxygen by [CONTACT_228943] (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway pressure

(BiPAP) OR Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR intubation with 
subsequent mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from delivery through 90, 120, 150, and 
180 days of life defined as per the corresponding secondary efficacy 
endpoint with the exception that evidence of RSV infection, LRTI, severe 
hypoxemia, and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_228726] -supplied devices 
and diagnostic tests OR review and abstraction of medical records for 
infants undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711]. 
oPercentages of infants with RSV LRTI requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228727] 90, 120, 150, and 180 days of life defined as per the 
corresponding secondary efficacy endpoint with the exception that 
evidence of RSV infection and LRTI may be based on either or both of the 
observations of the clinical site staff using sponsor-supplied devices and 
diagnostic tests OR review and abstraction of medical records for infants 
undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711]. 
oPercentages of infants with RSV LRTI associated with EITHER 
hypoxemia (peripheral oxyge n saturation [SpO2]  <  95% at sea level or 
<92% at altitudes >1800 meters) OR tachypnea (≥ 60 bpm for infants 0 
to 59 days of age or ≥ 50 bpm for infants ≥ 60 days of age [WHO 
Handbook, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness criteria for 
tachypnea] ) from delivery through 90, 120, 150, and 180 days of life. Data 
concerning documentation of RSV infection, LRTI symptoms and signs, 
hypoxemia and/or tachypnea may be obtained from the observations of the 
clinical site staff OR review and abstraction of medic al records for infants 
undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711]. 
oPercentages of infants with RSV LRTI resulting in death from delivery 
through 90, 120, 150, and 180 days of life. Evidence of RSV infection and 
LRTI may be based oneither or both of the observations of the clinical site 
staff using sponsor -supplied devices and diagnostic tests OR review and 
abstraction of medical records for infants undergoing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a

oPercentages of infants with RSV LRTI (all severities) from delivery 
through 90, 120, 150, and [ADDRESS_275314] year of life.
Rationale: In parallel with the first three new exploratory objectives, these changes 
to the exploratory endpoints mirror the primary and secondary endpoints, but allow 
for the inclusion of data derived from the adequately documented medical 
observations of non-study medical personnel, using pulse oximeters and/or 
diagnostic tests not supplied by [CONTACT_228944]/or

Location of 
ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275316] data in the ascertainment of RSV LRTI.  
oThe following text has been added : 
“A Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) composed of 
expert pediatricians (see Section 10.4.2) will carry out a blinded review of 
all potential exploratory endpoint cases involving RSV LRTI in infants to 
determine if they fulfill the relevant endp oint criteria in a temporally 
plausible relationship consistent with RSV disease as observed in clinical 
practice. Only CEAC- confirmed cases will be used for exploratory 
endpoints. ”
Rationale: This summary paragraph indicates the introduction of a committ ee of 
expert pediatric ians to adjudicate all endpoint cases involving RSV disease in 
infant subjects to ensure that these endpoints fulfill the requisite criteria and are 
temporally and clinically plausible before their use in efficacy analyses.
The endpo int: “ Percentages of maternal subjects with RSV -related respi[INVESTIGATOR_228728] , and detected by [CONTACT_228945], 
overall and by [CONTACT_209058](s)”, has been modified by [CONTACT_228946]. 
Rationale: To clarify the source of data for the referenced endpoin t. 
Section 3.3 The second sentence of Section 3.3 has been modified to delete mention of the 
group -sequential design as a determinant of study duration.
Rationale: As the trial will no longer be governed by a group -sequential design, 
this reference is now irrelevant. The estimated total duration remains

ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275318] infant 
born.
Section 3.5 The first sentence of Section 3.5 has been modified to specify a total enrollment 
of approximately 4,600 women and their infants .
Rationale:   With the decision to terminate enrollment and delete the group -
sequential design, the final enrollment target of approximate ly 4,600 pregnant 
wom en can be specified; the additional specification of their infants is a 
clarification.
Section 7.2 The first sentence of this section has been modified to indicate that 
immunologic testing will be performed on subjects’ sera “at proto col-specified 
time- points.”  In addition, the following sentence has been added:
“Com pletion of microneutralization testing may be staged, due to its 
cumbersome nature, and results may be reported in addenda to the primary 
clinical study report. ”  
Rationale:   Sera that are collected outside protocol -defined windows may not be 
contributory to the overall analysis of immunogenicity and may not undergo 
testing. Micronuetralization testing requires substantially greater time and 
technician/supervisor hours per assay than anti-F IgG or PCA ELISA, and may 
therefore impede progress to the initial report of study results.  Therefore, the option 
to complete microneutralization testing in a staged manner with reporting in 
addenda to the final study report is provided.
Section 8.6 The following sentence has been added to the end of the first paragraph. 
“Since there are multiple potential sources to determine the gestational age 
(GA)at birth, the study defined EDD and the birth date will be used to 
determine the GA at birth for the summary of the preterm birth categories 
(Very preterm and Moderate to late preterm). ”
Rationale:   The sentence provides clarity on how the GA at birth will be 
determined. 
Section 8.10 The phrase “or for demonstration of efficacy” has been deleted. 
The sentence “ the DSMB may elect, based on a vote of the members, to meet 
less frequently (e.g. quarterly), after the first year of the study” has been added.
Rationale:   The changes have been applied to provide clarity on the functioning of 
the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). 
Section 10.1 A separate definition of the infant safety population has been added to 
distinguish it from the maternal safety population. The infant safety population 
(Safety- I) has been defined as all infants born live to maternal subjects who 
received any test article . 
“and post-partum, respectively” has been added to the intent -to-treat efficacy 
population definition. 
Phrases “post -treatment” and “and have no major protocol deviations affecting 
the primary efficacy outcomes as determined and documented by [CONTACT_228947] F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275319] ober 2018 Page 17

prior to database lock and unblinding” have been added to the definition of the 
per-protocol efficacy population for maternal subjects.
Phrases “between birth and Day 180 after delivery” and “and e) have no major 
protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy outcomes as determined and 
documented by [CONTACT_228948]” have been 
added to the definition of the per -protocol population for infant subjects.
Rationale: These additions are intended to add clarity to the population definitions; 
they do not alter the underlying analysis plan.
Section 
[IP_ADDRESS], 
Synopsis The definition of symptomatic RSV infection in maternal subjects has been 
modified with the addition of the text in bold. 
An acute, clinical study site -observed RSV infection, manifesting as one 
or more of cough, stuffy nose, runny nose, dyspnea, sore throat, fever, new 
or increasing wheezing, or new or increasing sputum production; with 
detection of RSV in respi[INVESTIGATOR_228729] -PCR.
Rationale : To clarify the source of data for the referenced endpoint.
Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] The definition of RSV LRTI with severe hypoxemia has been changed from  
“An RSV LRTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_56170] a resting SpO 2< 92% at sea level or SpO 2< 87% 
at altitudes >1800 meters by [CONTACT_228949]” to “An RSV LRTI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_56170] a resting SpO 2<92% at sea level or SpO 2<87% at altitudes 
>[ADDRESS_275320] pressure (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) OR 
Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR intubation with subsequent 
mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO).”
Rationale :This altered definition reflects the specific enumeration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_228730].
Section 10.4.2 This section has been added to present information about the CEAC. The 
following text has been added: 
“A clinical endpoint adjudication committee (CEA C) comprising an odd 
number of three or more clinically -experienced voting pediatricians, a non-
voting chair who will oversee meetings of the CEAC, and a non-voting 
coordinator for administrative support will beempaneled to review all 
primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy endpoints relative to infant 
subjects.  The operations of the CEAC will be carried out according to a 
charter which will be collaboratively drafted by [CONTACT_228950], 
and will be adopted prior to any review CEAC activities.  The CEAC will 
review each potential infant efficacy endpoint event to determine whether 
the protocol -specified criteria have been fulfilled in a plausible temporal 
relationship. All deliberations of the CEAC will be carried out in blinded 
manner with regard to treatment assignment and the determination of the 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275321] ober 2018 Page 18
Location of 
ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275322] to each endpoint event will be final and binding on the 
sponsor. ”
Rationale: This paragraph describes the projected membership and operations of 
the Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEA C) of expert pediatricians 
which has been empaneled to adjudicate all endpoint cases involving RSV disease 
in infant subjects .The goal of this is to ensure that these endpoints fulfill the 
requisite criteria and are temporally and clinically plausible before their use in 
efficacy analyses.
Section 10.4.3 The section has been updated to reflect aforementioned changes to the study 
objectives and endpoints and the decision to eliminate the group -sequential 
design strategy. The section has been updated to include the following new 
text: 
“The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the ITT-EFF-I and PP-
EFF-I (infant) Populations. Conclusions concerning stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], 
the informationa l analysis, or declaration of attainment of the primary 
efficacy endpoint at the completion of the study, will only be based on the 
PP-EFF-I Population. In addition, supportive analyses based on the ITT-
EFF-I Population will also be performed. 
The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) is defined as VE (%) = (1 –RR) x 100, where 
RR = Relative Risk of incidence rates between the two treatment groups 
(RSV F Vaccine / Placebo). The final analysis will be carried out at one-
sided Type I error rate of 0.0124 (i.e., the lower bound of 2-sided 97.52% 
confidence interval). An estimate of vaccine efficacy will be reported using 
a two-sided 95% confidence interval. This conservative Type I error rate 
was determined as a part of the original group sequential design (GSD) 
approach and will be retained to guard against a potential Type I error 
inflation resulting from the decision to stop the study at ~4,[ADDRESS_275323] to Type 
I error rate was finalized in consultation with the US -FDA. 
For the original design using the GSD , a simulation of 5,000 trials was 
performed under a range of scenarios (including both varying placebo rates 
of medically -significant RSV LRTI and endpoint event ratios in infants of 
active vaccinees relative to placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). A summary of the 
simulation results is provided in the adap tive design report as Appedix [ADDRESS_275324] 
error variance [Zou 2004] . The general ized linear model with unstructured 
correlation matrix (Robust error variances) will be used. The explanatory 
variables in the model will include the treatment group. The dependent 
variable will be the incidence rate of the endpoint of interest. The Robust 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol

ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275326] 
identifier. Poisson dis tribution will be used with a link function logarithm.  
Hypothesis testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be carried out 
sequentially for H0: VE ≤0% and H0: VE <30%. Rejection of the first null 
hypothesis, H0: VE ≤0% demonstrates a statistically significant vaccine 
effect. Rejection of the second null hypothesis, H0: VE <30% at Type I 
error rate of 1-sided 0.0124 is required to meet the statistical success 
criterion pre-specified for the US-FDA. Should success be declared for the 
primary endpoint through 0 -90 days of age, the hierarchical sequential 
analyses of 0 -120, 0 -150, and 0 -180 days of age will be carried out 
using the Type I error rate of 1 -sided 0.025 and the same null hypothesis. 
Two types of analyses concerning the primary efficacy endpoint will be 
performed prior to the final analysis: recurring futility analyses 
approximately twice per year after the Northern and Southern hemisphere 
winter virus season, and an informational analysis with approximately 1/[ADDRESS_275327] 90 days.   
For the futility analyses and the informational analysis, a Bayesian 
approach will be used and the analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_228951] (IBG) as originally designed .
The null hypothesis, H0: VE ≤0%, using the 1-sided Type I error rate (i.e., 
lower bound of 2 -sided 95% CI) will be used for analyses of all secondary 
efficacy endpoints in infants. For each endpoint, in the event that efficacy  
is shown through the first 90 da ys of life, a hierarchical sequence of 
hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy through 120, 150, 
and 180 days of life.
Additional efficacy analyses may describe the incidence of symptoms used 
to define RSV LRTI. Percentages of infant subjects with any RSV -
confirmed respi[INVESTIGATOR_228731]/complaints will be presented by [CONTACT_228952]: cough, nasal flaring, difficulty breathing, manifesting in any 
of the following clinical signs or symptoms as lower chest wall indrawing, 
subcostal retractions, abnormal breath sounds (inclusive of stridor, rales, 
rhonchi, wheezing, and crackles/crepi[INVESTIGATOR_814]), and/or observed apnea. 
Time to the first RSV -associated event referenced above will also be 
analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods for each event category and by 
[CONTACT_1570]. ”
Rationale: This text introduces the plan to eliminate the group -sequential design, 
convert the primary analysis to a frequentist approach, avoid Type 1 error inflation 
due to the decision to stop the study early at ~4600 maternal subjects , and 
summarizes the three different analytical uses of the primary efficacy data. The 
section then continues as originally worded to describe the Bayesian methods 
already used in the futility and informational analyses to date.

Section 10.5 The phases “(2-and 4-fold seroconversion rates [SCR] )” have been added to 
numbered items 1 and 2.
Rationale: To be consistence within the document. 
Section 10.6 The phrase “Counts and percentages” for the assessment of safety endpoints 
has been replaced with “percentages” 
Rationale: To provide precision on how the safety endpoints will be described. 
Section 10.7 The following text has been added:
“The relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI will be estimated using Poisson 
regression with robust error variance [Zou 2004]. A general ized linear 
model with unstructured correlation matrix (robust error variances) will be 
used. The explanatory variables in the mode l will include the treatment 
group. The dependent variable will be the incidence rate. The Robust error 
variances will be estimated using repeated statement and the subject 
identifier. Poisson distribution will be used with a link function logarithm.
The vaccine efficacy, and the corresponding two-sided 95% CI will be 
calculated . 
For each endpoint, in the event that efficacy is shown through the first 90 
days of life, a hierarchical sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out 
to examine efficacy through 120, 150, and 180 days of life. ”
Rationale : The original text has been modified and new text has been added to 
better describe the analyses regarding the updated proposed exploratory objectives 
of the study. 
Section 10.8 The original text has been deleted entirely and replaced with the following:
“This study is designed to enroll approximately 4,600 total subjects that 
include a minimum of 3,000 RSV F vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228732] 4 global RSV 
seasons.  
Assuming a medically- significant RSV LRTI incident rate of 4% in the 
placebo group and a vaccine efficacy of 65%, then the power of the design 
to claim success is 87%.  Table 3 summarizes the power for different 
placebo attack rates and vaccine efficacies. Power calculations were 
performed using the normal approximation (NCSS PASS 14). An 
estimated PP population size of 4,218 total evaluable infant subjects (2,786 
in the RSV F vaccine group and 1,432 in the placebo group to account for 
1:1 and 2:1 randomization ratios in Year 1 and the subsequent years, 
respectively) was used for all calculations.  
The target sample size of the safety and efficacy database in third trimester 
pregnancy that will be required for licensure is at least 3,000 actively -
immunized maternal subjects and their infants. There fore, the final analysis 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275329] ober 2018 Page 21
Location of 
ChangeChange/Modification in Version [ADDRESS_275330] been 
enrolled in the active treatment arm. If no events of a given class are 
observed among the 3,000 subjects receiving the RSV F vaccine, an 
approximation to the one-sided upper 95% confidence bound on the rate of 
SAE occurrence would be 0.1%. ”
Rationale: Because of the conversion from a Bayesian analysis of a group -
sequential design to a single final analysis based on frequentist methodology, the 
prior Bayesian simulation -based summary of operating characteristics for 
implementation of the group -sequential design have been replaced by a frequentist 
power calculation for a range of placebo attack rates consistent with the literature 
and a panel of potential vaccin e efficacies and considering the single target 
enrollment and known randomization ratio.
Section 10.9 It has been clarified that “interim” analyses refer to futility and informational 
analyses. 
Section 10.10.1 The original text has been deleted entirely and replaced with the following: 
“The sequencing of RSV seasons in the Northern and Southern 
hemispheres lends a natural periodicity which will be reflected in the 
futility analyses.  Futility analyses will be conducted based on data 
available 30 May (for convenience called “Northern hemisphere,” 
although a small number of Southern hemisphere subjects may also meet 
the criteria for inclusion) and on approximately 30 September (for 
convenience called “Southern hemisphere” or “global season”); and 
subject to the constraint (applied by [CONTACT_228935]) that at least [ADDRESS_275331] accrued in the active treatment arm. The DSMB will 
communicate to the Sponsor after each futility analysis its recommendation 
that the trial is either: a) futile and should be discontinued, or b) should 
continue enrollment.

declared, or when all live-born infants of all enrolled pregnant mothers 
have completed [ADDRESS_275332] infant D+[ADDRESS_275333]

posterior probability that the event ratio is less than or equal to 1.00 (i.e. 
Vaccine Efficacy ≥0%) is greater than or equal to 0.90. This analysis will 
be performed by [CONTACT_228953] a manner entirely 
analogous to the analyses for efficacy and futility. The DSMB will 
communicate the results of the analysis to the Sponsor only in terms of 
fulfillment or non -fulfillment of the target criterion.   Novavax will remain 
blinded and the outcome will not result in any change in the conduct of the 
study or the primary efficacy objectives and endpoints. 
Results of the unblinded analysis of efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety
through Day 180 may be pre sented by [CONTACT_1034], and may be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities as needed.   
Modifications or additions to the analyses described above will be included 
in the SAP. Any decisions to deviate from the planned analyses described 
in the protocol and in the statistical analysis plan will be described in detail 
in the final study report .”
Rationale:   In parallel with Sections 10.4.[ADDRESS_275338] completed Day+180 follow -up.
Section 10.10.3 The following text has been deleted: 
“Modifications or additions to the analyses described above will be

Protocol Number:  RSV -M-301
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Observer -Blind, Placebo -Controlled , Group -Sequential
Study to Determine the Immunogenicity and Safety of a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250] (RSV) F 
Nanoparticle Vaccine with Aluminum in Healthy Third -trimester Pregnant Women; and Safety and 
Efficacy of Maternally Transferred Antibodies in Preventing RSV Disease in their Infants
Clinical Development Program: Maternal Immunization for Prevention of RSV Lower Respi[INVESTIGATOR_228737] (LRTI) in Infants
Sponsor: Novavax, Inc., [ADDRESS_275361], Gaithersburg MD [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]
Investigational Material: RSV Recombinant F Nanoparticle Vaccine (Spodoptera frugiperda [Sf9] 
cells with recombinant Baculovirus expression) with aluminum 
Reference Material: Formulation buffer (placebo) 
Regimen and Dosing:  Maternal subjects will receive a single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection 
with the assigned test article, either a 120 µg dose of RSV F protein adsorbed to a 0.4 mg dose of 
aluminum as the phosphate salt (herein referred to as RSV F vaccine) or placebo, on Study Day 0.
Phase of Development:  Phase 3
Rationale:  
The goal of this clinical development program is to establish efficacy of the RSV F vaccine in 
providing protection against RSV disease in infants during the first three to six months of life via 
active immunization of pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Passive immunization of 
infants will be achieved through transplacental transfer of maternal IgG antibodies from the pregnant 
mother who has received the RSV F vaccine in the third trimester of her pregnancy. Maternally -
derived, transplacent ally-mediated immunity is a physiologic, effective, and established means for 
protecting infants against infectious diseases during the first months of life. Active Fc-gamma 
receptor -mediated transport of maternal IgG begins early in gestation, but reaches significant levels 
at 28 weeks gestational age [Palmeira 2012 ].  By ≥ 36 weeks gestational age, antibody levels in the 
fetus are generally in excess of levels found in the mother [Lindsey 2013 ]. Maternal immunization 
programs addressing tetanus, pertussis, and influenza have all shown benefits to infants. Albeit less 
well-recognized than influenz a, anecdotal observations suggest that significant RSV disease may also 
occur in pregnant women themselves, and thus an additional benefit to the mother may also be 
obtained by [CONTACT_228954] [Wheeler 2015 ]. Two recent reports of prospective 
studies have confirmed the existence of a symptomatic RSV disease burden in mothers [ Hause 2018 , 
Madhi 2018 ].
For this global clinical trial of the RSV F vaccine in pregnant women, a [ADDRESS_275362]-vaccination when 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275363] binding of immu noglobulin G (IgG) to the antigenic site II linear peptide 
encompassing amino acid residues 254-278. Levels of these antibodies may exceed the trough levels 
of palivizumab associated with clinical protection of infants by 10-fold.  This in turn, suggests that 
with active placental transfer and possible concentration of these antibodies, infant protection 
extending through at least [ADDRESS_275364]- in-pregnant women study (RSV -M-203, N=50) with the RSV F vaccine conducted 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US) showed the vaccine was well-tolerated, posing no significant safety risk to 
pregnant women or their infants that was apparent in this limited dataset; and was immunogenic, 
eliciting antibody responses that were analogous in kinetics and magnitude to levels observed in non -
pregnant women of childbearing age. Results indicated the antibody profile achieved with a single 
dose of theRSV F vaccine in pregnant subjects immu nized at [ADDRESS_275365]-vaccination; and diverse, eliciting antibodies 
with binding activity to the antigenic sites I and IV neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_228738] F protein in addition 
to antigenic site II. Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies with specificity to the RSV F protein 
in delivered infants averaged 90 to 100% of the actively -treated matched mother, but averaged 110 to 
120% when im munization preceded delivery by ≥ [ADDRESS_275366] trimester is not expected to result in increased safety risk 
to the woman or fetus [Madhi 2014 , Munoz 2014 ], and may increase the potential for higher vaccine -
specific antibody titers in the delivered infant due to extended transplacental transfer [ Abu Raya 2014 , 
Eberhardt 2016 , Naidu 2016 ].
The objectives of the Phase [ADDRESS_275367] any signal suggestive of “vaccine -enhanced 
disease” in infants over their first RSV transmission season. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure

Study Objectives:
Primary :
The primary objective of this study is: 
To determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine against 
medically- significant RSV lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (LRTI) with EITHER hypoxemia 
(peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO 2] < 95% at sea level or < 92% at altitudes > 1800 meters) 
OR tachypnea ( ≥ 70 bpm for infants 0 to 59 days of age or ≥ 60 bpm for infants ≥ 60 days of 
age) through the first [ADDRESS_275370] 120, 150, and 180 days of life.
The prima ry efficacy objective will be evaluated in term infants (≥ 37 weeks gestational age at 
delivery) born to maternal subjects who received a study injection ≥ 2 weeks (14 days) prior to 
delivery. Infants with multiple RSV epi[INVESTIGATOR_228742], using data from the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228743] -significant RSV LRTI.  Success under the primary hypothesis will be achieved 
by [CONTACT_228928] a lower bound of a two-sided 97.52% confidence interval for the Day 90 analysis 
(lower bound of a 95% confidence interval for later time points) for the estimate ofvaccine efficacy 
which equals or exceeds target values agreed with regulatory authorities .
Secondary: 
The secondary objectives of this study are: 
To determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine in reducing the 
incidence in infants of:
oRSV LRTI with EITHER severe hypoxemia (SpO 2< 92% at sea level or < 87% at 
altitudes >1800 meters) OR documented use of oxygen by [CONTACT_228929] a 
requirement for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) OR bilevel positive airway 
pressure (BiPAP) OR Bubble CPAP OR bag-mask ventilation OR intubation with 
subsequent mechanical (or manual) ventilation OR extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO), through the first [ADDRESS_275371] 90 days of life in infants of maternal

A Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) composed of expert pediatricians (see 
Section 10.4.2 ) will carry out a blinded review of all potential secondary endpoint cases to determine 
if they fulfill the relevant endpoint criteria in a temporally plausible relationship consistent with RSV 
disease as observed in clinical practice.  Only CEAC- confirmed cases will be used for secondary 
endpoints.
Immunogenicity Endpoints (In Maternal and Infant Subjects as Stated):
Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody concentrations specific for the F protein antigen 
measured by [CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum concentrations of 
antibodies competitive with palivizumab for binding to the RSV F protein.  
Derived/calculated endpoints based on these data will include geometric mean concentrations 
as ELISA Units (GMEU) or µg/m L as appropriate, geometric mean fold-rise (GMFR),
proportion of subjects with ≥ 2-fold and ≥ 4-fold increases in concentration from baseline 
(seroconversion rate, SCR [maternal subjects only] ),and seroresponse rate (SRR). Analyses 
will be used to evaluat e:
oImmunogenicity through six months post -delivery in maternal subjects.
oTransplacental transfer of maternal antibodies specific for RSV described as a ratio of 
levels in maternal and cord blood at delivery.
oInfant RSV -specific antibody decay during the first six months of life relative to cord 
blood levels. 
oImmune correlates of risk of RSV LRTI in infants based on anti-RSV F protein IgG or 
palivizumab- competitive antibody responses in the infant and/or cord blood, and maternal 
subjects at delivery.

Study Design:  
This is a randomized, observer- blind, placebo -controlled trial enrolling up to approximately 4,[ADDRESS_275381] trimester of a singleton uncomplicated pregnancy, at low risk of obstetrical 
complications, and ≥18 to ≤40 years of age (lower limit of 18 years and 0 days and an upper limit of 
40 years and 0 days) will be enrolled and randomized, initially in a 1:[ADDRESS_275382] global season of enrollment, the randomization scheme will be 
changed to a 2:1 (active / placebo) ratio to enable more efficient accrual of the safety database. Due 
to the importance of infant RSV exposure in order to demonstrate efficacy of the maternal 
immunization strategy, investigators will be instructed to base maternal enrollment on a projected date 
of delivery for each maternal subject. The estimated date of the earliest delivery (EDD -E) will be
approximately [ADDRESS_275383] delivery (EDD -L)will be calculated based on the historic 
average end date of RSV transmission at each study site,such that participating infants are likely to 
have a minimum [ADDRESS_275384] available site-specific, local, 
state/provincial ,or national surveillance data to the extent available.  Please refer to the Study 
Operations Manual for further details .

[1]The target number of subjects that may be enrolled over multiple global RSV seasons, based on a 1:[ADDRESS_275386] season and 2:1 (active / placebo) randomization for all subsequent seasons . 
Randomization of maternal subjects will be done at the site level and will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (i.e., 18 
to < 29 years and 29 to ≤ 40 years). No specific proportion in either age group will be sought, rather 
the intent of stratification will be to distrib ute the proportion of maternal subjects presenting for 
enrollment in each age group equally across the two treatment arms. In addition, infant subjects born 
to randomized maternal subjects will be prospectively and randomly assigned to one of three 
postpar tum phlebotomy cohorts, which will differ only in the timing of blood sampling (see Infant 
Subject Study Visit ). It is anticipated tha t a percentage of the randomized maternal subjects and their 
delivered infant may not complete the study; subjects (maternal and infant) who withdraw or are 
discontinued will not be replaced.
All maternal subjects will receive a single IM injection on Day [ADDRESS_275387] article, either 
the RSV F vaccine or placebo (see Treatment Assignments table). The procedures to be performed in
the study are described in detail in this protocol and are summarized in the Maternal Subject Study 
Visit and Infant Subject Study Visit Procedures sectio ns. Maternal subjects will be monitored for 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_228757], clinical laboratory impacts, and specified adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
as well as general AEs and SAEs. In addition, because the maternal illness and obstetrical risk burden 
due toRSV is largely unknown, the occurrence of RSV disease in maternal subjects will be monitored 
before and after delivery. 
Vaccine impacts on m arkers of infant development and well -being at birth will be monitored, as will 
growth and development through thefirst year of life.  Infant blood samples will be taken to asses s 
the decay half-life of maternally- derived RSV antibodies. Symptomatic infant and maternal RSV 
infections will be monitored through the first RSV season using both active and passive surveil lance 
mechanisms ; and will be etiologically -confirmed using RSV RT -PCR. Infant RSV infections will be 
characterized based on their sym ptom atology, associated degree of hypoxemia as measured by [CONTACT_3347], respi[INVESTIGATOR_228758]1 minute, and required medical 
interventions. 
For each maternal subject, study participation will span approximately nine (9) months from the first 
dose, ending six (6) months post-delivery. Study follow -up for infant subjects who are consented will 
span approximately one (1) year post -delivery.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will supervise enrollment and monitor subject safety  
throughout the trial (see Section 8.10).  In order to ensure that mothers and infants are not placed at 
risk with scant possibility of success, repeated futility analyses will be performed twice per year during 
the period of the study.  Due to the seasonal nature of RSV disease and the occurrence of RSV seasons 
in a roughly sequential manner across the Northern and Southern hemispheres, futility analyses, for 
detecting situations in which the existing efficacy data is not consisten t with a predefined minimal 
clinical benefit, will occur at the approximate end of each Northern hemisphere season (data as of 
approximately 30 May) and each global RSV season (data as of approximately 30 September, 
comprising a Northern hemisphere season and the following Southern hemisphere season); and 
subject to constraint (applied by [CONTACT_228935]) that at least [ADDRESS_275388] accrued in the 
active treatment arm. A determination of futility at any futility analysis, will lead to a DSMB 
recommendation to terminate the trial, and stop further enrollment.

Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275389] 90 days of life. If successful outcomes are obtained through 90 days of life, then additional 
analyses for efficacy will be performed in a closed hierarchical sequence considering data from 
delivery through 120, 150, and 180 days of life (with each sequential analysis being enabled by a 
significant result at the preceding shorter interval).   Multiple secondary and exploratory efficacy 
analyses will also address other infant and maternal RSV disease outcomes.
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in infants 
concerning RSV -associated illness, will be reviewed and validated by [CONTACT_228966] (CEAC) prior to unblinding (see Section 10.4.2 ).  Only endpoints 
validated by [CONTACT_228967]. Section 10.4.3 provides details 
of the futility and efficacy analyses. (see Section 8.10). 
Eligibility Criteria: 
Inclusion:
Pregnant women must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for participation in the study:
1)≥ 18 and ≤ 40 years -of-age(which connotes a lower limit of 18 years and 0 days and an upper 
limit of 40 years and 0 days) .  
2)Singleton pregnancy of 28 to 360/7weeks gestation onthe day of planned vaccination. 
Documentation of gestational age will be based on one of the following composite criteria (Note: 
The investigator should use the earliest ultrasound data available to establish the study -specific 
gestational age dating) :
(a)Gestational Age Dating Based on First Trimester Data (data obtained ≤ 136/7weeks):
The date of the first day of the reported last menstrual period (LMP) may be used to establish 
the gestational age if corroborated by a first trimester ultrasound. If the gestational age 
estimation derived using the LMP and the first trimester ultrasound are discrepant by > 7 days, 
the ul trasound will be used to establish the gestational age. 
If LMP is uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound -established gestational age estimation will be 
used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy . 
(b)Gestational Age Dating Based on Early Second Trimester Data (data obtained 140/7to 216/7): 
The date of the first day of the reported LMP may be used to establish the gestational age if 
corroborated by [CONTACT_228968] (that estimates the gestational age 
between 140/7and 216/7weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and 
the early second trimester ultrasound are discrepant by > 10 days, the ultrasound will be used 
to establish the gestational age. 
If LMP is uncertain of unknown, the ultrasound -established gestational age estimation will be 
used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy . 
(c)Gestational Age Dating Based on Later Second Trimester Data (data obtained 220/7 to 276/7
weeks by [CONTACT_228969]): 
The date of the first day of the reported LMP may be used to establish the gestational age if 
corroborated by a later second trimester ultrasound (that estimates the gestational age between 
220/7to 276/7weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and the later 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275390] ober 2018 Page 45
second trimester ultrasound are discrepant by > 14 days, the ultrasound will be used to 
establish the gestational age. 
If LMP is uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound -establishe d gestational age estimation will be 
used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.
(d)Gestational Age Dating When the LMP is Uncertain or Unknown AND No Prior First or 
Second Trimester Ultrasound Has Been Performed:
An ultrasound performed at screening within the second trimester (≤276/7weeks) will be used 
to establish the gestational age dating. 
3)Documentation of a second or third trimester (between 180/7weeks and prior to randomization) 
ultrasound with no major fetal anomalies identified. 
4)Good general maternal health as demonstrated by:

pulmonary, gastrointestinal (abdominal), musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and dermatologic organ 
systems; and documentation of fetal heart tones. Note that abnormal vital signs may be 
repeated at the investigator’s discretion since these measures may be labile. Vital signs should 
be assessed in the context of normal values for the third trimester of pregnancy (see the Study 
Operations Manual ).
oClinical laboratory parameters that include:
-For the first year of study conduct in any country, normal/clinically insignificant blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate

blood count, and platelet count. Note that normal ranges for clinical laboratory 
parameters will be based on reference ranges appropriate for the third trimester of 
pregnancy, specified in the toxicity grading scale (TGS) provided in the Study 
Operations Manual ) and should be referenced to assess for any abnormalities. This 
testing should be performed by [CONTACT_2237].
-For all subjects, serologic exclusion of infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) 
viruses, syphilis, and HIV as docum ented by [CONTACT_6310] (performed at thecentral or local

Maternal Subject Study Visit Procedures:
Up to Two (2) Months Prior to Study Start – Pre- Screening 
Obstetrical investigators may, at their discretion, introduce the concept of participation in a third -
trimester RSV vaccine trial to wom en who they regard as potentially fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. If required by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/I ndependent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
having authority, interested women may be asked to provide informed consent in order for the 
investigator to collect information regarding their general health history, obstetrical history, and 
results of screening testing performed for the current pregnancy. The screening consent will be for 
collection of existing data only, and will not provide for any invasive procedure (including 
phlebotomy). Screening consent may be withdrawn at any time, and will not bind the prospect ive 
subject to enroll in the clinical trial or the investigator to offer enrollment.

pulmonary, gastrointesti nal (abdominal), musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and dermatologic; and 
confirmation of fetal heart tones.  
Blood draw :
oFor RSV baseline serology (20 mL)
oFor subjects participating in the first year of any country: Clinical laboratory assessments 
(10 mL) for select serum chemistry (i.e., blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST] , alkaline phosphatase [ALP] , 
total bilirubin) and hematology (i.e., hemoglobin, white blood cell [WBC], and platelet 
counts) parameters as applicable by [CONTACT_228974] ; AND HIV, syphilis, HBV, 
and HCV antigen tests/serologies as required by [CONTACT_228975] (i.e., 
if screening results are not available in prior data collected during the course of the 
current pregnancy). Since results of the clinical laboratory testing are needed to confirm 
subject eligibility, it is recommended this phlebotomy be performed at least two days
before the planned Day 0 vaccinatio n.
oFor subjects participating inall other years in any country: HIV, syphilis, HBV, and 
HCV antigen tests/serologies (10 mL, as required) by [CONTACT_228976] .
Medication history, including concomitant medications. 
Query for any AE experienced since informed consent was obtained. 
Note that further procedures may be performed at the Investigator’s discretion in order to adequately 
screen subjects against eligibility criter ia and/or to confirm medical history. Potential subjects who 
meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (see Eligibility Criteria ) may  be enrolled. 
Day 0 –Vaccination (gestational week 28 to 360/7)
All subjects who have vital signs taken, fetal heart tones checked, and eligibility reconfirmed will be 
randomized to a treatment group and infant serology cohort. Information concerning the occurrence 
of any AE (and SAE specifically) experienced by [CONTACT_228977] F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275396] locator information and the delivery center to be utilized will be ver ified. Vital 
signs and a fetal heart tone check will be performed approximately 30 minutes (permissive range: 30 
-60 minutes) post -vaccination.
A diary will be distributed to subjects before release from the clinic. Starting on vaccination day and 
for 6 days thereafter (Day 0 to Day 6 inclusive), subjects will record their oral temperature using a 
supplied oral thermometer, and any adverse event experienced in their diary, daily. The following 
local and systemic reactions will be solicited by [CONTACT_155668]: inject ion site (local) events –pain, bruising 
(ecchymosis), redness (erythema), and swelling (edema); systemic events –oral temperature 
(collected as a continuous variable), chills, muscle pain or aching remote from the injection site 
(myalgia), joint pain or aching (arthralgia), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. Subjects 
will also be asked to record any concomitant medications taken, and to document any unscheduled 
physician visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228760]6 (inclusive). 
Subjects will be instructed to notify the study staff promptly using the 24-hour telephone contact 
[CONTACT_6227](s) provided in the diary in the event of any severe (grade 3) solicited or unsolicited AE, new 
obstetrical complications, or symptom s suggestive of an RSV infection. A separate Study  
Identification Card will also be issued that indicates the maternal subject is part of an investigational 
vaccine trial and provides the contact [CONTACT_6227](s) of obstetrical investigator’s study staff. The 
identification card will also include a list of the clinical signs and symptoms of an RSV infection in 
adults and infants. In the event the maternal subject experiences symptoms suggestive of an RSV 
infection, she will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_228978], if warranted, may be asked to 
provide a sampling of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_228761]. (Please refer to 
the RSV Surveillance section for further details.) The next visit will be scheduled before subjects are 
released from the clinic. 
Day 7 (+ 2 days) –In-clinic or Home Follow -up Visit
Subjects will retur n to the clinic or participate in a home visit for vital sign collection, to review and 
return their symptom diaries, and to report any unsolicited AEs, MAEs, SNMCs, and SAEs they have 
experienced and concomitant medications taken for these events. Subject s will also be queried 
regarding symptoms suggestive of an RSV infection (see Signs and (Trigger) Symptoms of RSV -
suspect edIllness in Infant and Maternal Subjects table) and, in the event onset is within seven (7) 
days, will undergo a samp ling of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_228761]. In 
addition to normal obstetrical follow -up, including confirmation of fetal heart tones , a physical exam 
may also be performed to evaluate any adverse event reported. Before release from the clinic, a 
replacement Study Identification Card will be offered to subjects, if needed, along with a memo ry aid 
for them to record any medical events experienced in between extended clinic visits. (Note that the 
memory aid is considered a tool that subjects may or may not choose to use, and as such is NOT 
considered a source document and WILL NOT be collected.) The next visit will also be scheduled 
before subjects are released from the clinic. 
Day 14 (± 2 days) –In-clinic or Home Follow -up Visit
Subjects will return to the clinic or participate in a home visit for vital sign collection and to report 
any unsolicited AEs, MAEs, SNMCs, and SAEs they have ex perienced and concomitant medications 
taken for these events. Subjects will also be queried regarding symptoms suggestive of an RSV 
infection (see Signs and (Trigger) Symptoms of RSV -suspect edIllness in Infant and Maternal 
Subjects table) and, in the event onset is within seven (7) days, will undergo a sampling of upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_228761]. In addition to normal obstetrical follow -up, 
including confirmation of fetal heart tones, a physical exa m may also be performed to evaluate any

adverse event reported. A blood sample will be obtained for RSV serology (20 mL) and (if applicable) 
clinical laboratory safety (10 mL). If a subject has delivered prior to the Day 14 visit, then the visit 
will be considered closed and no missed visit protocol deviation will be captured. The single exception 
is the blood draw for the clinical safety laboratory assessment [which only applies to subjects enrolled 
in the first year of study conduct in any country]  that s hould be obtained at the Delivery visit.
Before subjects are released from the clinic, a replacement Study Identification Card will be offered 
to subjects, if needed, and the next visit will be scheduled. Subjects will also be reminded to contact 
[CONTACT_228979], any severe or serious AE, any obstetrical complication, or 
symptom(s) suggestive of an RSV infection. The next visit will also be scheduled before subjects are 
released from the clinic. 
Day 28 (± 2 days) –Telephone/ Short Message Service (SMS )Contact, In-clinic, or Home Visit 
Safety Follow -up 
Subjects who have not yet delivered will have a safety follow -up performed as either a telephone/SMS 
contact [CONTACT_228980]/IEC -approved script (if applicable), an in-clinic visit, or a home visit. At 
this visit, whether conducted in in-clinic or at a home visit, study staff will assess the general health 
of the subject and query for any severe unsolicited AE, SAE, SNMC, MAE, clinical symptoms or 
signs of a suspected RSV illness, or any new obstetrical complication occurring since the last visit, 
and any concomitant medications taken for these events. Subjects participating in this visit via 
telephone or SMS and who report any severe or serious adverse event or symptoms suggestive of an 
RSV infection, may be asked to return to the clinic or schedule a home visit for evaluation of the 
event(s) to assess any effect(s) it may have on the pregnancy, and to potentially undergo a sampling 
of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_228762] 
(7) days. The same procedures will be performed for subjects participating in this follow -up as an in -
clinic or home visit, with the addition that a replacement Study Identification Card will be offered to 
all subjects (if needed) at the completion of this visit. 
Delivery (D) –Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228735] -up Visit
Subjects will be counselled to notify the obstetrician of the start of labor and will go to the registered 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228763]. A venous blood sample (20 mL) for RSV serology should be 
obtained from the mother any time after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228764] [ADDRESS_275398]-delivery, 
which in extenuating circumstances (such as a delivery on a holiday or weekend), may be obtained up 
to [ADDRESS_275399]-delivery. For applicable subjects (i.e., those enrolled in the first year of study conduct 
in any country) who deliver prior to the Day 14 visit, a venous blood sample (10 mL) for the clinical 
safety laboratory assessment should also be obtained. A cord blood sample (at least 5 mL) for RSV 
serology should be obtained by [CONTACT_228981]. If 
cord blood is not obtained, then this information should be conveyed to the study staff responsible for 
the infant, so that infant sera may be collected in lieu of the cord blood (see Infant Subject Study Visit
at the Delivery Day visit for details).  The obstetrician or designee will also collect vital sign data at 
admission from the subje ct’s medical chart and record all unsolicited adverse events experienced, and 
concomitant medications taken by, or administered to, the subject since the last visit. (Note that routine 
medications for the management of labor and delivery do not need to be recorded.) In addition, study 
staff will docum ent the presence of perinatal management (including antibiotic therapy and any 
medical or surgical interventions for cause) and of any GBS screening result and treatment. Study 
staff will inform the infant’s primary healthcare provider/pediatrician of the child’s anticipated 
participation in the study before or immediately after delivery. A replacement Study Identification 
Card will be offered to all maternal subjects (as needed), and subjects will be reminded to contact 
[CONTACT_228982].

Delivery (D) –Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228735] -up Visit
All procedures, including routine vaccinations that are considered standard of care for the newborn 
infant may be performed at any study visit which coincides with the usual timing for such procedures . 
Before any study-specific procedures are performed, informed consent for the infant subject and 
release of medical records will be reviewed with the maternal subject (i.e., the mother will not be re -
consented) or will be obtained from the other parent or guardian if notalready captured under the 
institution’s policy. If cord blood is not obtained at the time of delivery (see delivery procedures for 
maternal subjects), an infant blood draw will be obtained within 72 hours of birth. (Note that cord 
blood is markedly prefe rred and all efforts should be directed to obtaining this specimen.  A 
phlebotomy/heel stick within 72 hours is a fall back procedure only.  The volume of a postpartum 
phlebotomy/heel stick must be accounted for within the phlebotomy limits as per the inve stigator’s 
institution [whereas a cord blood sample need not]). The investigator (or trained designee) will collect 
results of the physical exam, weight, length, frontal -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_228767] (FOC), and APGAR 
measurements performed following birth and used to assess the overall health of the infant. The results 
of questions pertaining to the exposure of the infant to certain environments or behaviors, such as the 
mode of infant feeding (e.g., exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula fed, breast milk and
supplemented with formula, expressed breast milk, wet nurse, receiving solids), if a smoker or one or 
more children < 5 years of age will reside in the same household, and whether the infant or another 
child in the household (< 5 years of age) will be/is cared for in a group setting with other children 
(e.g., daycare) for ≥ 3 days per week, will also be documented.
Parents and/or guardians will be issued a Study Identification Card for their infant that indicates he/she 
is part of an investigational vaccin e trial and provides the contact [CONTACT_228985] -related follow -up of the infant. The Study Identification Card will also 
include details of the signs and symptoms of RSV infection in adults and infants. If the infant subject 
develops an “RSV -suspect illness” characterized by [CONTACT_228986] (Trigger) 
Symptoms of RSV -suspect edIllness in Infant and Maternal Subjects table, parents/guardians are to 
contact [CONTACT_3452], but will be instructed to seek appropriate medical care for the infant first. This 
is especially important in instances when the initial evaluating physician provi ding care to the infant 
is not affiliated with the study. 
D+14 (± 3 days) –In-clinic or Home Post -delivery Follow -up Visit
At approximately [ADDRESS_275410]-delivery, all infants will participate in a study visit at home or in-clinic 
for evaluation of any AEs, MAEs, SNMCs, or SAEs experienced since delivery and concomitant 
medications taken for these events. The parent or guardian of the infant will also be asked to report 
any healthcare provider -confirmed epi[INVESTIGATOR_228768]; and the mode of infant feeding, if a smoker 
or one or more children < 5 years of age reside in the same household, and whether the infant or

Note: It is not intended that these triggers for reporting be specific, or diagnostic of RSV, or LRTI; rather the goal is to 
capture acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_228774]. Physician (or qualified clinical designee) evaluation, (including an 
assessment of the infant’s oxygen saturation level via pulse oximetry readings and respi[INVESTIGATOR_228775] 1 minute at the time of presentati on of the acute illness) will capture those features which characterize LRTI , 
tachypnea, andhypoxemia or severe hypoxemia : molecular diagnosis by [CONTACT_4465]- polymerase chain 
reaction (RT -PCR) will detect RSV. These symptoms are intended to be a sensitive, rather than specific, trigger 
for further evaluation.
Clinical Study Site Response to Reports of Initial Trigger Symptoms
In response to a report via active or passive surveillance of Initial Trigger Symptoms , the study site 
staff will:
Arrange for an in-clinic or home visit as soon as possible, but not later than 7days after 
symptom onset ,for evaluation by [CONTACT_5989]/qualified clinical designee of the subject 
(infant or mother) displaying the symptom/s and/or findings in the Signs and (Trigger) 
Symptoms of RSV -suspect edIllness in Infant and Maternal Subjects table.
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275435] ober 2018 Page 59
Arrange for an in-clinic or home visit by a study phys ician/qualified clinical designee for 
evaluation as soon as possible within 7 days of symptom(s) onset for maternal or infant 
subjects who received care for trigger symptoms at a non-study, affiliated medical facility. 
Note that this visit would only be applicable to subjects who are receiving outpatient care or 
have been released from inpatient care. 
Procedures to Occur During the Visit
Specific for Symptomatic Infants :
Measure the respi[INVESTIGATOR_228776] (if possible) for all symptomatic infants . The 
measurement should be performed first, on a calm, infant, and should be performed by 
[CONTACT_228995] (i.e., without stethoscope auscultation) for a full, timed one minute period. 
oIf the result is ≥ 60 bpm in an infant 0 to 59 days age or ≥ 50 bpm i n an infant ≥60 days 
of age, a second timed one minute count should be obtained. 
oIf a second count is obtained, the lower of the two observations should be recorded. 
Measure the SpO 2via pulse oximetry (using study-specific pulse oximeter) , for all 
symp tomatic infants, which is to be performed when the infant is calm and not crying, and 
before administration of oxygen supplementation. The lowest stable SpO 2observed during a 
one minute measure should be recorded. Note that the oxygen should not be remove d to 
measure SpO 2in infants already receiving oxygen supplementation at the time of assessment.
Please refer to the Pulse Oximeter Manual for more details. 
For AllSymptomatic Subjects (Maternal and Infant ):
Review and confirm the history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], including the approximate date of first 
symptom onset. 
Perform an exam ination of the symptomatic infant subject to ascertain, by [CONTACT_228996], the presence of the LRTI manifestations listedin the Clinical Signs/Symptoms 
to be Clinically Evaluated during an RSV -suspected Illness table.
Collect a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228777].
oSymptomatic maternal subject swill have a nasal and throat specimen collected. The 
nasal secretion will be collected by [CONTACT_20169] -turbinate swabbing .
oSymptomatic infant subject swill have amid-turbinate nasal swab collect ed. 
oRT-PCR testing for RSV and other viruses by [CONTACT_228997], and not for clinical care. 
oRespi[INVESTIGATOR_228778] a 
qualified local laboratory supporting clinical care if the atten ding physician would 
ordinarily regard testing for bacterial and/or viral pathogens as warranted.
Collect vital signs other than respi[INVESTIGATOR_697](heart rate, blood pressure [if available for the 
infant ], and axillary body temperature) for the symptomatic subject. 
Ascertain any medically -attended visit by [CONTACT_228998][INVESTIGATOR_4375].
Ascertain any new concomitant medications resulting from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]. 
Notify the infant’s primary healthcare provider of the RSV surveillance visit and outcome, as 
necessary.

Follow -up of RSV -suspect Illnesses 
Following the evaluation of an RSV -suspect illness outlined in Section Clinical Study Site Response 
to Reports of Initial Trigger Symptoms , the clinical site: 
For symptomatic infant subjects, schedule a follow -up visit in2 to 3 days to ascertain whether 
the illness is worsening. 
oThe follow -up visit will include the same procedures outlined in Section Clinical Study 
Site Response to Reports of Initial Trigger Symptoms .
oParents/guardians will be strongly encouraged to report any worsening after the follow -
up visit, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which may trigger any number of additional follow-
up visits at the investigator’s discretion. 
oIn the event than an infant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], site staff are encouraged to perform a follow -
up visit in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], if permissible under local administrative and ethical review 
procedures. 
For symptomatic maternal subjects , and for symptomatic infant subjects after the first follow -
up visit described above, a weekly contact [CONTACT_107461] /SMS will be performed to ascertain 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_228780] D+[ADDRESS_275437] returned to baseline if after the D+180 
visit.
In the event new and/or worsening symptoms are reported during active or passive follow -up, 
an in-clinic or home RSV surveillance visit may be scheduled at the in vestigator’s discretion
for an evaluation to occur as soon as possible; a re-evaluation as per Section Clinical Study 
Site Response to Reports of Initial Trigger Symptoms may be performed.
oAt the investigator’s discretion, collection of ONE more respi[INVESTIGATOR_228781]. Note that no more than 3respi[INVESTIGATOR_228782] .

Definitions and Rules for RSV Surveillance
If possible, study staff should collect symptom data for any RSV -suspected illness for 
mater nal and infant subject pairs during the same weekly telephone call or SMS contact. In 
the event the maternal and infant subject pairhave independent clinic visits for assessment of 
an RSV -suspected illness within a given surveillance period, the subsequent weekly telephone 
or SMS contact [CONTACT_228999] . For example, if a m aternal subject had a clinic visit to evaluate an illness on 
Monday of surveillance week (SW) -1, this would trigger the next contact [CONTACT_229000]-2. If the infant subject of the same mother had a clinic visit to evaluate an 
illness on Thursday of SW1, his/her next weekly contact [CONTACT_229001]-2. (The intent of this provision is to 
relieve the need for mother/infant pairs to make multiple follow -up visits in a one-week 
period.)
A newrespi[INVESTIGATOR_228784] a one week (7 day) interval elapses 
during which the subject is free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. When a subject is determined to 
have a new respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], the subject should be evaluated at an in -clinic or home visit by 
[CONTACT_229002][INVESTIGATOR_1865].
A medically- attended visit will be deemed to have occurred whenever the subject or a 
parent/guardian of the infant subject precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a visit or home encounter with a physician 
or other healthcare provider for the purpose of evaluation or treatment of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]. 
Note that at-home and in-clinic visits undertaken specifically to fulfill the requirements of this 
protocol, for illnesses which would not otherwise cause the parent/guardian to present the 
infant for care, are NOT “medically -attended visits,” with the exception noted immediately 
below.
In the event that the investigator is also the subject’s primary care physician (PCP)/general 
practitioner (GP), any RSV surveillance visit will be counted as a “medically -attended visit.” 
Note that the intent of the evaluation of subjects with Trigger Symptoms is fulfillment of the 
objectives of this protocol. The investigator or study site staff should use their best 
professional judgment to ensure that subjects receive prompt medical care appropriate to their 
clinical condition , ifnecessary either by [CONTACT_229003], or providing care if the investigator is the subject’s primary physician 
or if the case is emergent. The collection of the study data to support the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints are key objectives of this trial, but when necessary, appropriate 
medical care should supersede this goal.

maternal and infant subjects (separately) in the Safety Population, as well as the number and 
description of protocol deviations. Summary statistics at birth for infant length, weight, FOC, APGAR

Analyses of the Efficacy Endpoints :
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the ITT -EFF-IandPP-EFF-I(infant) Populations . 
Conclusions concerning stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], the informational analysis, or declaration of attainment 
of the primary efficacy endpoint at the completion of the study , will only be based on the PP-EFF-I 
Population . In addition, supportive analyses based on the ITT -EFF-I Population will also be 
performed. 
The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) is defined as VE (%) = (1 –RR) x 100, where RR = Relative Risk of 
incidence rates between the two treatment groups (RSV F Vaccine / Placebo). The final analysis will 
be carried out at one-sided Type I error rate of 0.0124 (i.e., the lower bound of 2-sided 97.52% 
confidence interval). This conservative Type I error rate was determined as a part of the original group 
sequential design (GSD) approach and will be retained to guard against a potential Type I error 
inflation resulting from the decision to stop the study at ~ 4,[ADDRESS_275443] to Type I 
error rate was finalized in consultation with the US -FDA. 
For the original design using the GSD , a simulation of 5,000 trials was performed under a range of 
scenarios (including both varying placebo rates of medically- significant RSV LRTI and endpoint 
event ratiosin infants of active vaccine esrelative to placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). A summary of the simulation 
results is provided in the adaptive design report as Appe ndix [ADDRESS_275444] error variance [ Zou2004 ]. 
The general ized linear model with unstructured correlation matrix (Robust error varianc es) will be 
used. The explanatory variables in the model will include the treatment group. The dependent variable 
will be the incidence rate of the endpoint of interest. The Robust error variances will be estim ated 
using repeated statement and the subject identifier. Poisson distribution will be used with a link 
function logarithm.  
Hypothesis testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be carried out sequentially for H0: VE ≤0% 
and H0: VE <30%. Rejection of the first null hypothesis, H0: VE ≤0% demon strates a statistically 
significant vaccine effect. Rejection of the second null hypothesis, H 0: VE < 30% at Type I error rate 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275445] ober 2018 Page 64
of 1-sided 0.0124 is required to meet the statistical success criterion pre-specified for the US-FDA.
Should success be declared for the primary endpoint through 0 -90 days of age, the hierarchical 
sequential analyses of 0 -120, 0 -150, and 0 -180 days of age will be carried outusing the Type I 
error rate of 1 -sided 0.025 and the same null hypothesis.
Two types of analyses concerning the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed prior to the final 
analysis: recurring futility analyses approximately twice per year after the Northern and Southern 
hemisphere winter virus season, and an informational analysis with approximately 1/[ADDRESS_275446] 90 days.   
For the futility analyses and the informational analysis, a Bayesian approach will be used and the 
analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_21963] (IBG) as origi nally designed. An 
assumption is made that the distribution of the number of events under the vaccine, xv, and the number 
of events under placebo, xp, are binomial:
		xv~ Bin (v,nv)
xp~ Bin (p,np)
where πvand nv, respectively, are the probability of an RSV event and the total number of subjects in 
the vaccine group and πpand np, respectively, are the probability of an event and the total number of 
subjects in the placebo group.  
Furthermore, we assume prior distributions for πvand πpthat are flat, non-informative beta 
distributions:
	v	~Beta (1,1)
p	~Beta (1,1).
Futility will be demonstrated under the primary hypothesis based on the posterior probability that the 
event ratio, r = π v/ πp, is less than or equal to 0.60.
Given xvevents out of nvtotal subjects in the vaccine group and xpevents out of nptotal subjects in the 
placebo group, the posterior distributions of πvand πpare:
	v|xv	~Beta (1xv,1(nvxv))
p|xp	~Beta (1xp,1(npxp)).
Sampling from the posterior probability distribut ion for the event ratio is generated by:
1.Sampling 10 million independent values from the posteriors of πvand πp
2.Calculating the event ratio, r = π v/ πpunder each pair -wise sample from the posterior of πv
and πp. 
Futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_228788] 0.60 is less than or equal to 0.05. Furthermore, an additional constraint governing the ability 
to stop the trial early for futility requires that a minimum of 10 events be observed in the vaccine arm.

Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275447] medically- significant RSV LRTI event will be analyzed by [CONTACT_229011]-M eier methods. Sub-analyses will be performed to evaluate vaccine effects on all 
infections in which RSV is confirmed by [CONTACT_937]-PCR, and also infections in which only RSV is found 
(i.e., no co-infections). The incidence rate of medically -significant RSV LRTI may be generated by 
[CONTACT_229012] -morbidities present, if sufficient event numbers are available.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed to investigate the impact of 
missing specimens for suspected -RSV illnesses, includi ng RSV -negative specimens collected outside 
the specified collection window, and clinical assessments, including clinical signs/symptoms, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651], and pulse oximetry measurements, obtained by [CONTACT_105]-study healthcare providers (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685]). Further details regarding the sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.
The null hypothesis, H0: VE ≤0%, using the 1-sided Type I error rate (i.e., lower bound of 2-sided 
95% CI) will be used for analyses of all secondary efficacy endpo ints in infants. For each endpoint, in 
the event that efficacy is shown through the first 90 days of life, a hierarchical sequence of hypothesis 
tests will be carried out to examine efficacy through 120, 150, and 180 days of life.
Additional efficacy analyses may describe the incidence of symptoms used to define RSV LRTI. 
Percentages of infant subjects with any RSV -confirmed respi[INVESTIGATOR_228789] /complaints will be presented by [CONTACT_229013]: 
cough , nasal flaring ,difficulty breathing, manifesting in any of the following clinical signs or 
symptoms as lower chest wall indrawing, subcostal retractions, abnormal breath sounds (inclusive of 
stridor, rales, rhonchi, wheezing, and crackles/cr epi[INVESTIGATOR_814]), and/or observed apnea. Time to the first 
RSV -associated event referenced above will also be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier methods for each 
event categor yand by [CONTACT_1570] .
Analyses of Safety and Immunogenicity Objectives:
All safety endpo ints will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_229014].  Clinical laboratory 
data summaries for maternal subjects will include (by [CONTACT_229015]) toxicity grade 
shift summaries; absolute means and standard deviations with minima and maxima values, and 
tabulations of changes from baseline. 
For infant subjects, summary statistics will be provided for infant length, weight, FOC, and respons es 
to environmental and behavioral queries, through one year post-delivery overall, and by [CONTACT_6490]. Results of developmental testing will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], and Percentages of 
infants above normal, normal, at -risk at 6 or 12 months, and at -risk at both 6 and12 months.
Immunogenicity analyses will be descriptive and include tabulations by [CONTACT_229016]-F IgG, PCA, and RSV/A and RSV/B MN. The transplacental 
transfer of anti-F IgG, PCA, and RSV/A and RSV/B MN antibodies will be examined; first order 
modeling of their decay in infants will be performed for half -life estimations. 
Exploratory Analyses:
Exploratory analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_229017]-by-two cross tabulations of all 
RSV respi[INVESTIGATOR_228790]/passive surveillance in infant and 
maternal subjects from immunization through six months after delivery and by [CONTACT_1570]. The 
relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI will be estimated using Poisson regression with robust error variance

Percentages of infants and maternal subjects presenting with respi[INVESTIGATOR_228791]-RSV 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_228747] -PCR will be summarized.
All exploratory efficacy analyses will be conducted against the null hypothesis of VE ≤0% (i.e.,the 
RR ≤1.00). For each endpoint, in the event that efficacy is shown through the first 90 days of life, a 
hierarchical sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy through 120, 150, 
and 1 80 days of life.
Sample Size Calculations:
This study is designed to enroll approximately 4,600 total maternal subjects that include a minimum 
of 3,000 RSV F vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228732] 4 global RSV seasons.  
Assuming a medically- significant RSV LRTI incident rate of 4% in the placebo group and a vaccine 
efficacy of 65%, then the power of the design to claim success is 87%. The table below summarizes 
the power for different placebo attack rates and vaccine efficacies. Power calculations were performed 
using the normal approximation (NCSS PASS 14).  An estimated PP population size of 4,218 total 
evaluable infant subjects (2,786 in the RSV F vaccine group and 1,432 in the placebo group to account 
for 1:1 and 2:1 randomization ratios in Year 1 and the subsequent years, respectively) was used for all 
calculations.  
The target sample size of the safety and efficacy database in third -trimester pregnancy thatwill be 
required for licensure is at least 3,[ADDRESS_275449] been 
enrolled in the active treatment arm. If no events of a given class are observed among the 3,000 
subjects receiving the RSV F vaccine, an approximation to the one-sided upper 95% confidence bound 
on the rate of SAE occurrence would be 0.1 %.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250] (RSV) Background
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_228792]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
estimated that the global annual burden of infections and mortality due to human RSV are 
64million and 160,000, respectively [WHO 2009 ].  In industrialized countries, nearly all 
children have been infected with RSV by [ADDRESS_275452] 
disease characterized by [CONTACT_229019], hyperinflation, crackles, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_228793] (i.e., 
bronchiolitis and pneumonia).  The most severe disease occurs within the first [ADDRESS_275453] susceptible to severe disease in the adult population.  It is estimated that 
between 11,000 to 17,000 elderly adults die of RSV infection or its complications annually in 
the US, with approximately ten-fold more admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228794] 
[Walsh 2012 ]. Actua l attack rates may be higher still, as an RSV diagnosis is often not made in 
adults unless highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tests (i.e., RT-PCR) are performed. Acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_228795] (e.g., military recruits), although the clinical severity of infection or subsequent 
re-infection is typi[INVESTIGATOR_228796] [O'Shea 2007 ].
RSV is a pleomorphic virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, and comprises two major 
subtypes, A and B, that co-circulate. The two major surface glycoproteins of RSV, F and G, are 
the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies, which are associated with protection 
[Graham 2011 ]The F protein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane 
and syncytium formation, while the G protein is essential for viral attachment. There is a high 
degree of genetic and antigenic homology in the F proteins across RSV/A and B viruses, and 
among individual isolates, whereas the G protein is much more variable [Johnson 1987 ]. 
Immunization with vaccinia virus containing the F gene protected animals against homologous 
and heterologous subtype A and B viral challenge; whereas, animals immunized with the G 
gene expressed in the same system were only protected against the homologous virus 
[Olmsted1986 ,Stott 1987 ]. These data demonstrate the ability of anti-F neutralizing antibodies 
to generate immunity across RSV/A and B subtypes.
1.2 Summary of RSV Disease in Various Geographies
1.2.1 High -resource Countries in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
Data from the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Australia suggest that 1.7to 2.6% of infants are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228797] 1 year of age [Hall 2009, Iwane 2004 , 
Ranmuthugala 2011 ]. Annually in the US, RSV infection is associated with an estimated 57,527 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 2.1 million outpatient visits among children < 5 years of age 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275454] ober 2018 Page 69
[Centers forDisease Contro l and Prevention (update May 05 2015) , Hall 2009 ]. In the US, 
Native Ame rican children are at increased risk for RSV infection. In 2000 -2001, the rate of 
RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228798] <[ADDRESS_275455] US was 
48 per 1000, nearly double the rate of similarly aged children in the general US population 
(27per 1000) [Holman 2004 ]. Among Native American infants in the southwest US, 11% of 
healthy babies were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228799]. [O’Brien 2015 ] The 
elevated risk of admission -roughly six-fold that of infants in the general US population -is 
probably related to socioeconomic and geographic conditions [ Bockova 2002 ].
In the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]), over the winter seasons from 1989 to 2000, the average annual 
RSV -associated mortality in infants 1 to 12 months of age was 8.4 per 100,000 population 
[Flem ing 2005 ]. The clinical manifestations and morbidity of RSV are similar among infants 
and young children worldwide, regardless of the country of residence. However, the majority 
of deaths due to RSV still occur in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], where burden and risk factors for life-
threatening illness remain the greatest. In fact, mortality rates due to RSV are difficult to 
ascertain in m any settings, because children in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], where 99% of fatal cases 
occur [Nair 2010 ], often die at home [Moisi 2011 ].
1.2.[ADDRESS_275456] infections, in which RSV is a frequent pathogen in children under 
2years of age [Marguet 2009 ], are the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years 
of age in Argentina [Marconi 2010 ]. A recent publication by [CONTACT_229020] a major burden of respi[INVESTIGATOR_228800] [Ferolla 2013 ], in agreement with similar studies [Moisi 2011 , Nair 2010 ], 
and stressed the central role of RSV on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228801] 
2years. Specifically, this study revealed that over 60% of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_93283] 1,[ADDRESS_275457] 20% of these children had life-threatening disease (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_229021] 87%), a finding that helps explain the high morta lity rates associated 
with RSV in many underdeveloped areas of the world, where access to care is suboptimal. The 
mortality rate attributable to RSV was estimated to be 7% in this study sample. The gravity of 
the RSV disease burden in Argentinean children is exemplified by [CONTACT_229022], the burden of RSV illness in 2011 outweighed that of 2009 H1N1 
influenza A virus during the pandemic year: 14-fold in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 4-fold in virus -
confirmed deaths [Libster 2010 ].
1.2.[ADDRESS_275458] infections due to RSV in South Africa remain a predominant cause of 
morbidity and mortality in young children [Tempia 2014 ]. A recent surveillance study in South 
Africa by [CONTACT_229023]., revealed that acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], in which RSV is a 
frequent pathogen, are the cause of approximately 8% of all deaths in children under the age of 
5 years [Moyes 2013 ]. Results from this study confirm the findings of similar studies 
[Madhi 2006 , Moisi 2011 , Nair 2010 ], stressing the central role of RSV on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228802] 2 years. The published hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based incidence of RSV infection 
in South Africa is estimated at 3 to 18%, with a mortality rate between 12% and 43% in 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275459] ober 2018 Page 70
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552] d cases [ Moisi 2011 ]. An additional challenge in South Africa is that although a 
seasonal peak in RSV cases is established, with the majority of cases occurring in the winter 
(February -July), a low–level circulation of the virus has been identified outside of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_228803] [Moisi 2011 ]. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_275460] infections are a major cause of mortality
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228804] , accounting for an average of 
approximately 29% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228805] (ALRI) in children [ADDRESS_275461] Asia, and the Philippi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] [Shi 2017 ].  
Estimates of RSV -associated illness incidence rates for India, Bangladesh, Vietnam , Cambodia, 
and the Philippi[INVESTIGATOR_228806], and range from 35.3 to 59.8 events per 1,000 
children per year [Shi 2017 ]. Inmultiple studies from India, r espi[INVESTIGATOR_228807] [ADDRESS_275462] infections, where it appears in cases of both bronchi olitis and 
bronchopneumonia, but especially the former [Chattopadhya 1992 ,Mishra 2016 ,Singh 2014 ,
Kamigaki 2017 ] estimated incidence rates for severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_228808] 44.0 to 64.4 events per year per 1,000 children < [ADDRESS_275463] been indicated for prophylaxis of RSV infection: one, a 
polyclonal human anti-RSV IgG (RSV -IVIG, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_228809] [Groothuis 1995, 1993 ]), was 
discontinued in 2004; and the other, a humanized monoclonal antibody (palivizumab, Synagis®
[MedImmune, Gaithersburg MD]) therapy, is currently approved for use in high- risk infants in 
the US and worldwide. Palivizumab binds to a neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_228810] F protein at 
amino acids 254-278, termed antigenic site II [Johnson 1997 ].  Although the clinical benefits 
of palivizumab have been demonstrated, the monthly administration and high expense make 
this product less -than-ideal for use except in premature infants at highest risk. 
Vaccination is considered a potentially cost-effective approach to limit RSV infection in infants, 
elderly adults, and other high-risk populations, but safety remains a major concern in the field 
of RSV vaccine development. In the 1960s, a formalin -inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine 
produced by [CONTACT_4618] (i.e., Lot 100 vaccine), although immunogenic, unexpectedly caused 
exacerbation of pulmonary disease in children who subsequently acquired an RSV infect ion 
[Kim 1969 ]. This vaccine -enhanced disease phenotype has been attributed in part to an 
imbalanced T helper cell type 2 biased T cell response [Waris 1996 ]. Other studies have 
suggested disease exacerbation was due to the development of anti-F antibodies deficient in 
fusion- inhibiting and virus -neutralizing activity post-vaccination [Murphy 1988 ]. Although the 
precise mechanisms underlying these findings remain open to debate [Blanco 2010 ], the 
phenomenon of vaccine -enhanced RSV disease has been limited to RSV -naïve infants 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275464] ober 2018 Page 71
immunized with FI -RSV. Vaccine -enhanced disease has not been observed either with passive 
antibody prophylaxis (monoclonal or polyclonal) in animal models or humans or in clinical 
trials of various F protein -targeted vaccines in adults or older RSV -seropositive children 
[Groothuis 1998 , Munoz 2003 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29422] 2003a ].  
1.[ADDRESS_275465] anti-F neutralizing titers in infants to “protective” levels that 
persist over the vulnerable first months of infancy. 
Maternal immunization has been successfully implemen ted by [CONTACT_229024] 92% since the 
program’s inception [Khan 2013 ]; and influenza immunization of pregnant women has been 
shown to have efficacy against influenza disease in both the woman and her infant and to lack 
adverse impacts on either the course of the pregnancy or the neonate [Pasternak 2012 ,
Richards 2013 ,Steinhoff 2012 ,Zaman 2008 ]. A recent published report in an in vivo mouse 
model provides further evidence that maternally -derived antibodies in the offspring of pregnant 
females immunized with FI-RSV are safe and have protective activity. The pups display a 
marked reduction in lung viral loads after RSV challenge, relative to controls pups of 
unimmunized pregnant females, and show no histopathological characteristics of vaccine -
enhanced disease [Kwon 2014 ].
In humans, matern al immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are transplacentally transferred to the 
fetus by [CONTACT_229025].  Indeed, 
the active transport of IgG antibodies can result in enhanced antibody concentrati ons in cord 
blood that accumulate to substantial excess of maternal levels in some instances [Gendrel 1990 ].  
Accordingly, it is a reasonable expectation that raising anti-F neutralizing titers in a pregnant 
woman will increase titers in infants [Simister 2003 ], and that such an increase will reduce the 
risks of serious RSV disease in the first months of life. 
1.5 RSV F Vaccine
Novavax’ response to the unmet need for RSV prophylaxis is the development of an RSV F 
vaccine, based on a purified, recombinant near full-length RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein. The 
RSV F is produced using the baculovirus/ Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell system, and 
assembles into trimers, which further associate via hydrophobic interactions into nanoparticles 
resembling the previously -described 40 nm protein -protein micelles of isolated RSV F protein 
[Calder 2000 ].  The purified F protein is adsorbed to aluminum pho sphate and contains 120 µg 
of RSV F protein and 0.4 mg of alum inum  per 0.5 mL injection.  The vaccine contains no viable 
viruses.

1.6 Safety and Immunogenicity of RSV F Vaccine in Animals and 
Humans
A detailed review of the nonclinical and clinical experienc e with the RSV F vaccine is provided 
in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  A brief summary is provided here.
1.6.1 Nonclinical Experience
Results from a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) three repeat -dose toxicology study in New 
Zealand White rabbits indicated the No-Observed -Adverse -Effect -Level (NOAEL) of the 
RSV F vaccine was ≥ 30 µg (irrespective of adjuvantation with aluminum), a dose that is 
approximately 2.5 to 4.2-fold in excess (on a weight -adjusted basis) of a 120 µg antigen dose 
(the highest proposed huma n exposure) in a [ADDRESS_275467] of four (4) doses of RSV F vaccine (120 µg) formulated with aluminum phosphate 
(0.8mg Al content) in contrast to a saline placebo. Two doses were administered 
intramuscularly at a 21-day interval prior to mating, and two further doses at approximate 
Days [ADDRESS_275468] on mean weights or weight gain before mating, during gestation, or during 
lactation.  Mating occurred in 100% of control animals and 98% of vaccine -treated animals, 
and pregnancy occurred in 98 and 94%, respectively.  One doe in each of the control and 
treatment groups aborted.  In general, there were no clear effects on ovarian/uterine or litter 
observations.  The percentage of pre-implantation losses was slightly, but significantly higher 
in the vaccine group, but there were no significant differences in litter sizes or counts of live 
fetuses.  There were non-statistically significant increases in the number of litters with 
reversible delays in skeletal development (incomplete ossification of the sterna or pubes) in the 
active vaccine group, but these occurred in the smallest fetuses of pregnant animals with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228811], an association known in the literature. Pre-weanin g and post-
weaning mortality, clinical signs, weight gain, food consumption, and a functional 
observational battery assessing behaviors in post-weaning animals showed no impact of RSV F 
vaccine treatment on the F1 kits.  Immune responses to the vaccine in the F0 does, and placental 
transfer of RSV F-specific maternal antibodies to the fetuses, were documented. It was 
concluded by [CONTACT_229026] F vaccine treatment had no apparent adverse F0

maternal effects on mating or fertility and reproducti on, and no adverse effects on postnatal 
growth and development of F1 kits of either sex.
In nonclinical studies of immunogenicity, the aluminum -adjuvanted vaccine has proven to be 
immunologically active in all animal models tested (including mice, cotton rats, rabbits, guinea 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and baboons) and generally superior to unadjuvanted RSV F protein, as indicated by [CONTACT_229027]-F IgG antibody titers, and also the induction of antibodies capable of both 
competing with palivizumab for its binding site on the F protein and binding to an antigenic site 
II linear peptide. When challenged with intranasal RSV, F protein -immunized mice and cotton 
rats were protected from infection (as evidenced by [CONTACT_229028]), and failed to exhibit any evidence of the enhanced pulmonary disease which can 
be elicited in anima ls vaccinated with FI-RSV and subsequently challenged. In addition, passive 
transfer of sera from cotton rats immunized with RSV F vaccine was able to protect naïve cotton 
rats against RSV challenge in a manner similar to passive palivizumab treatment, indicating that 
a cellular immune response was not required to mediate at least short -term protection. Both 
rabbits and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], the latter having placental architecture similar to humans, demonstrate 
vigorous anti-F immune responses after immunization during pregnancy and transplacental 
transfer of vaccine -induced antibodies to their pups. Preliminary data in baboon infants of 
vaccinated mothers indicate that these offspring acquire antibodies to RSV F protein in utero
and show clinically relevant protect ion against RSV challenge, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_229029], reduced tachypnea, and reduced work of breathing relative to infants of 
unimmunized mothers.
1.6.2 Clinical Experience
Novavax’ clinical experience with the RSV F vaccine in young adults andchildren is based 
upon accumulated data in five randomized, blinded and placebo -controlled clinical trials which 
are complete to date. These completed trials include 1,069 subjects exposed to active vaccine, 
of which 1,022 were healthy young adults ≤ 49 years of age, and 973 were young women of 
child -bearing age.  Additional active vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228812] 22 pregnant 
women between 18 and 40 years of age and 25 children , 2 to 5 years of age. In addition , 
Novavax has treated a total of approximately 6,879 adults 60 years of age and over with a 
different formulation of the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine.  This older adult population has a 
different baseline co-morbidity status than healthy young adults, and a different 
immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile than young adults; therefore it will not be detailed 
further. However, the older adult population has revealed no unusual safety concerns.
Overall, the completed trials in young adults and children have shown that all RSV F vaccine 
formulations tested have produced an acceptable safety profile and were well-tolerated, with no 
significant dose -related toxicities observed. There have been n o deaths, serious adverse events
deemed related to the RSV F vaccine by [CONTACT_1034], or subject withdrawals due to an AE 
reported in any of these completed studies. The majority of complaints have been mild to 
moderate solicited injection site events of tenderness/pain and systemic events of headache, 
muscle pain, and fatigue, which have resolved without sequelae during study conduct. The 
active vaccine reactogenicity profile was clearly differentiable from placebo in all studies, but 
did not demonstrate either a strong dose-related increase in the frequency or severity of 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275470] seven days after placebo by 
[CONTACT_3450] 1%. A small increase in injection site complaints of pain, swelling, and redness, 
and muscle pain and joint pain was attributable to the addition of alum inum adjuvant. A review 
of the clinical laboratory assessments did not indicate any systematic toxicity to the renal or 
hepatobiliary systems, or to the bone marrow or circulating formed elements of the blood. 
The predominant local reactogenicity profile observed across studies in adjuvanted vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228813]/tenderness reported in approximately 
70% of all aluminum -adjuvanted vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228814] 20% of placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Swelling, redness, and bruising at the injection site occurred at substantially lower 
rates by [CONTACT_2163], reported by 10 to 20% of adjuvanted vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228815] 1 to 
3% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Injection site reactogenicity did not increase notably in frequency or 
severity among subjects who received a second dose.  Additionally, 10% of subjects may report 
residual mild injection site discomfort lasting outside the 7-day active solicitation interval. 
Systemic reactogenicity reports were generally mild to moderate in severity. The predominant 
systemic complaints in adjuvanted vaccine and placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228816] 
(33and 16%, respectively), headache (36 and 32%), fatigue (30 and 26%); followed by [CONTACT_229030] (17 and 19%), chills (12 and 10%), joint pain (12 versus 7%), 
diarrhea (12% in both active and placebo), vomiting (3 and 5%), and fever (2 and 1%). 
Unsolicited adverse event reports of cough, oropharyngeal p ain, nasal congestion, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], anemia, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, contusion, decreased 
hemoglobin, rhinorrhea, toothache, rhinitis, viral infection, and pain in extremity were 
commonly reported (>1 to 10% of subjects) in adjuv anted vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. For comparison, 
all except the nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, contusion, and pain in extremity were also commonly 
reported in placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Considering the [ADDRESS_275471] trimester 
(concurrently with 28 who received placebo), a review of safety data showed the RSV F 
Vaccine candidate was well-tolerated with no significant risks to overall health identified. Four 
maternal subjects reported a total of 5 serious adverse events (SAEs), but none of the SAEs 
were considered related to treatment and all were judged by [CONTACT_229031]. No maternal deaths or subject withdrawals due to an adverse event (AE) were reported. 
Medical treatment for AEs (ie, medically -attended events or MAEs) was sought by [CONTACT_229032][INVESTIGATOR_840]. Most MAEs were related to labor and 
delivery, including labor pain (54.5% active and46.4% placebo), obstructed labor (31.8% and 
39.3%, respectively), postpartum hemorrhage (22.7% and 28.6%, respectively), and afterbirth 
pain (13.6 and 21.4%, respectively).  
More active vaccinees among the pregnant women reported solicited AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_228817] (68 vs 36%, 
respectively). This difference was primarily driven by [CONTACT_229033] (59% vs 0%, 
respectively). The local pain was entirely mild or moderate in severity and transient; all events 
resolved within the 7-day solicited period in the active group. The incidence of solicited 
systemic AEs was similar in the active and placebo groups (27% vs 36%, respectively) with 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275472] commonly reported event among both groups (18 and 25%, 
respectively). None of the active vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s reported instances of fever. None of the 
solicited AEs were severe.
There was no difference in the incidence rates of unsolicited AEs through 6 months after 
delivery between the placebo and active vaccine groups , or the proportion that were deemed 
related to the treatment (11 and 9%, respectively), or severe (14% each) .None of the severe 
AEs were considered related to treatment. The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs among 
placebo and active subjects (>10% of subjects) pertained to labor and delivery events, 
hemorrhoids, observed decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], hypotension, and perineal injury. Lastly, 
administration of the vaccine was not clearly associated with any systemic toxicity pertaining 
to renal or hepatic injury, ability to regulate glucose systemically, or abnormal changes in 
hematological parameters such as hemoglobin, white blood cells, or platelet counts. 
Considering the infants born to mothers treated with vaccine or placebo, there was no evidence 
that administration of the RSV F vaccine to pregnant women posed any safety risk to their 
infants that was apparent in this limited data set.  No clear differences were noted in the pattern 
of adverse events reported among infants born to moth ers that received the RSV F vaccine as 
compared to infants of mothers that received placebo . The subject incidence rates of unsolici ted 
AE reports in infant s were comparable in both groups (93% placebo vs 91% active). 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], acute otitis media, and 
vomiting were the most commonly (>10%) reported unsolicited events in the placebo group. 
Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], acute otitis, acute, contusion s, eczema, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease, conjunctivitis, decreased appetite, and dry skin were the most commonly 
reported unsolicited events in the active group. All events reported in infants in the active group 
were deemed mild or moderate in severity by [CONTACT_093] (compared with 3 severe events 
reported in the placebo group), and none were considered related to treatment in either group. 
The proportions of infant subjects who reported MAEs were similar in both groups (89% 
placebo vs 82% active) with no systematic association or trend within a particular class of AEs 
noted in infants in the active group. No de aths were reported among the infants in the study. A 
total of 19 SAEs were reported in 11 infant subjects , which included 8 infants (14 SAEs) in the 
placebo group and 3 infants (5 SAEs) in the active vaccine group. All SAEs reported were 
considered unrelated to the test article administered to the maternal subject , and only a single 
event term (failure to thrive in two infants of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) was reported more than once.
Health outcomes in both groups of delivered infants were also unremarkable, as mean 
gestational age (~39 weeks), weights (~3.4 kg), heights (~51 cm), FOC (~34 cm), and 1 and 5 
minute APGAR scores (~8-9) were all comparable . All changes in length, weight, FOC, and 
Bayley III developmental screening results for both groups of infants through Day [ADDRESS_275473]-
delivery during the 1stRSV season; a third infant was diagnosed with RSV at [ADDRESS_275474]-
delivery, which was during the infant’s 2ndRSV season.  In addition, in the placebo group, one 
maternal subject and one infant subject at [ADDRESS_275475] was identified as severe or serious or required 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275476] months of life. Active Fc-gamma receptor mediated transport of maternal IgG begins early 
in gestation, but reaches significant levels at 28 weeks gestational age [Palmeira 2012 ].  By 
≥36 weeks gestational age, antibody levels in the fetus are generally in excess of levels found 
in the mother [Lindsey 2013 ].  Maternal immunization programs addressing tetanus, pertussis, 
and influenza have all shown benefits to infants. Albeit less well-recognized than influenza, 
anecdotal observations suggest that significant RSV disease may also occur in pregnant women 
themselves, and thus an additional benefit to the mother may also be obtained by [CONTACT_229034] [Wheeler 2015 ].Two recent reports of prospective studies have confirmed 
the existence of a symptomatic RSV disease burden in mothers [ Hause 2018 , Madhi 2018 ].
For this global clinical trial of the RSV F vaccine in pregnant women, a [ADDRESS_275477]-in-pregnant women study (RSV -M-203, N=50) with the RSV F vaccine 
conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US) showed the vaccine was well-tolerated, posing no 
significant safety risk to pregnant women or their infants that was apparent in this limited 
dataset; and was immunogenic, eliciting antibody responses that were analogous in kinetics and 
magnitude to levels observed in non-pregnant women of childbearing age. Results indicated the 
antibody profile achieved with a single dose of the RSV F vaccine in pregnant subjects 
immunized at [ADDRESS_275478]-vaccination; and diverse, eliciting antibodies with binding activity to the antigenic 
sites I and IV neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_228738] F protein in addition to antigenic site II.

month post-second dose and one year post-first dose safety follow -ups) reactogenicity; and 
most short -term reactogenicity events were mild or moderate inseverity. Most symptoms were 
transient, resolved without sequelae during study conduct, and did not require medical 
intervention. Adjuvanted -RSV F vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228818] a mild solicited adverse event at the injection site relative to their counterparts 
receiving unadjuvanted vaccines or placebo, with pain/tenderness at the injection site observed 
as the most frequent local complaint. Up to 10% of adjuvanted vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228819] [ADDRESS_275484] frequently reported systemic solicited adverse events, followed by 
[CONTACT_229035], chills, joint pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, which all occurred at lower 
frequencies. Of the solicited systemic events reported, only muscle pain and joint pain occurred 
at notably higher rates in adjuvanted vaccinees than placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The vaccine -attributable

RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275485] numbers, it is not yet possible to evaluate whether 
the adverse events described here are, or are not, causally -related to the RSV F vaccine (with 
or without adjuvant), and other adverse effects may exist which have not yet been detected. In 
common with all vaccines produced in cell culture or other systems, the RSV F vaccine contains 
residual non-vaccine proteins derived from the production system, and sensitization to these 
may theoretically occur. Safety monitoring for hypersensitivity and/or allergic reactions has 
been conducted routinely during study conduct through clinical evaluations and direct 
observations up to [ADDRESS_275486] never resulted in this 
complication. With a mean exposure within the RSV transmission season of 54.5 days among 
infants of actively- immunized women in the RSV -M-203 trial, there were no safety signals 
suggestive of enhanced RSV disease in the infants of actively immunized mothers in the phas e 
II trial. While that trial represents a small experience, the signal of enhanced disease noted in 
the Kim (1969) experience was so large that the currently available dataset is inconsistent with 
a finding of similar, or substantially smaller, magnitude.
This study isthe second to evaluate the RSV F vaccine in third -trimester pregnant women. 
Currently, there may be adverse effects that may exist that cannot be predicted to occur. Thus, 
the safety of maternal and infant subjects is being carefully monitore d throughout the study.

obstetrical complications, and ≥ 18 to ≤40 years of age (lower limit of 18 years and 0 days and 
an upper limit of 40 years and 0 days) will be enrolled and randomized ,initially in a 1:[ADDRESS_275494] global season of enrollment, the 
randomization scheme will be changed to a 2:1 (active / placebo) ratio to enable more efficient 
accrual of the safety database. Due to the importance of infant RSV exposure in order to 
demonstrate efficacy of the maternal immunization strategy, investigators will be instructed to 
base maternal enrollment on a projected date of delivery for each maternal subject. The 
estimated date of the earliest delivery (EDD -E) will beapproximately [ADDRESS_275495] delivery (EDD -L)will be calculated based on the historic average end date of RSV 
transmission at each study site,such that participating infants are likely to have a minimum [ADDRESS_275496] available site-specific, local, state/provincial ,

Randomization of maternal subjects will be done at the site level and will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(i.e., 18 to < 29 years and 29 to ≤ 40 years). No specific proportion in either age group will be 
sought, rather the intent of stratification will be to distrib ute the proportion of maternal subjects 
presenting for enrollment in each age group equally across the two treatment arms. In addition, 
infant subjects born to randomized maternal subjects will be prospectively and randomly 
assigned to one of three postpar tum phlebotomy cohorts, which will differ only in the timing of 
blood sampling (see Appendix 1). It is anticipated that a percentage of the randomized maternal 
subjects and their delivered infant may not complete the study; subjects (maternal and infant) 
who withdraw or are discontinued will not be replaced.
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275498] ober 2018 Page 84
All maternal subjects will receive a single intramuscular (IM)injection on Day [ADDRESS_275499] article, either the RSV F vaccine or placebo (see Table 1).The procedures to be 
performed in the study are described in detail in Section 6.1of this protocol. Maternal subjects 
will be monitored for typi[INVESTIGATOR_228757], clinical laboratory impacts, and specified 
adverse pregnancy outcomes , as well as general AEs and SAEs.  In addition, because the 
maternal illness and obstetrical risk burden due to RSV is largely unknown, the occurrence of 
RSV disease in maternal subjects will be monitored before and after delivery. Vaccine impacts 
on mark ers of infant development and well -being at birth will be monitored, as will growth and 
development through the first year of life.  Infant blood samples will be taken to assess the 
decay half-life of maternally -derived RSV antibodies. Symptomatic infant and maternal RSV 
infections will be monitored through the first RSV season using both active and passive 
surveillance mechanisms ;and will be etiologically -confirmed using RSV RT-PCR. Infant RSV 
infections will be characterized based on their symptomatology , associated degree of 
hypoxemia as measured by [CONTACT_229041], respi[INVESTIGATOR_228758] 
1minute, and r equired medical interventions.
For each maternal subject, study participation will span approximately nine (9) months from 
the first dose, ending six (6) months post -delivery. Study follow -up for infant subjects who are 
consented will span approximately one (1) year post- delivery. 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will supervise enrollment and monitor subject 
safety throug hout the trial (see Section 8.10).  In order to ensure that mothers and infants are 
not placed at risk with scant possibility of success, repeated futility analyses will be performed 
twice per year during the period of the study.  Due to the seasonal nature of RSV disease and 
the occurrenc e of RSV seasons in a roughly sequential manner across the Northern and Southern 
hemispheres, futility analyses, for detecting situations in which the existing efficacy data is not 
consistent with a predefined minimal clinical benefit, will occur at the ap proximate end of each 
Northern hemisphere season (data as of approximately 30 May) and each global RSV season 
(data as of approximately 30 September, comprising a Northern hemisphere season and the 
following Southern hemisphere season); and subject to constraint (applied by [CONTACT_229042]) that at least [ADDRESS_275500] 90 days of life. If successful outcome s are obtained through 90 days 
of life, then additional analyses for efficacy will be performed in a closed hierarchical sequence
considering data from delivery through 120, 150, and 180 days of life (with each sequential 
analysis being enabled by a signif icant result at the preceding shorter interval).   Multiple 
secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses will also address other infant and maternal RSV 
disease outcomes.
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in 
infants concerning RSV -associated illness, will be reviewed and validated by [CONTACT_229043] (CEAC) prior to unblinding (see Section 10.4.2 ).

A Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC) composed of expert pediatricians 
(see Section 10.4.2 )will carry out a blinded review of all potential exploratory endpoint 
cases involving RSV LRTI in infants to determine if they fulfill the relevant endpoint
criteria in a temporally plausible relationship consistent with RSV disease as observed in 
clinical practice.  Only CEAC-confirmed cases will be used for exploratory endpoints.
3.[ADDRESS_275509]’s participation in the study conduct 
is nine months. The maximum duration of the infant subject’s participation in the study conduct 
is approximately one year. The duration of the entire study is estimated to be approximately 
four years .   
3.4 Study Population
Mate rnal subjects for the study will be healthy (as determined by [CONTACT_5292], medical 
history, and clinical laboratory parameters), third -trimester pregnant subjects deemed to be at 
low-risk for obstetrical complications, between the ages of ≥ 18 to ≤40 years ,who meet all of 
the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 5). 
3.[ADDRESS_275510] -trimester pregnant subjects in 
the Northern and Southern hemispheres and their infants . Randomization of maternal subjects 
will be done at the site level and will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (i.e., 18 to <29 years and 29 to ≤ 40 
years). No specific proportion in either age group will be sought, rather the intent of 
stratification will be to distribute the proportion of maternal subjects presenting for enrollment 
in each age group equally across the two treatment arms. Infant subjects born to randomized 
maternal subjects will be prospectively and randomly assigned to one of three postpartum 
phlebotomy cohorts, which will differ only in the timing of blood sampling (see Appendix 1).
3.[ADDRESS_275511] randomization will be conducted using an Interactive Web Randomization 
System (IWRS). The system will ensure proper distrib ution of maternal subjects across group 
assignments. Stratification will be based on study site and age (18 to < 29 years and 29 to 40 
years), in order to distribute the proportion of such subjects in each age group equally across 
treatment groups. At mate rnal randomization, the infant of that mother -infant pair will also be 
randomized to one of three phlebotomy cohorts.
Preparation and administration of the RSV F vaccine and placebo will be performed by [CONTACT_229049](s), with masking of the syringe content. Administration of the 
RSV F vaccine and placebo will be performed by [CONTACT_16795].
Maternal subjects and the main study team clinical staff will remain blinded as to treatment 
assignment for the duration of the study unless emergency unblinding is necessary. Refer to 
Section 3.7for information regarding the process for emergency unblinding. However, 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275512] to the infant’s phlebotomy cohort will be transmitted immediately to 
site personnel. 
All treatment assignments, vaccine and placebo storage and accountability, and/or dosing 
related matters, will be monitored by a designated “unblinded monitor.” Any deviations will be 
discussed, documented and resolved by [CONTACT_155688]. 
The unblinded monitor will be responsible for escalating issues to the clinical project team in a 
blinded manner. The Clinical Supplies Manager at Novavax will be responsible for determining 
whether the team will be unblinded in order to adequately resolve issues.  Any unblinding of 
the project team will be clearly documented in the Trial Master File (TMF). No reports from 
the unblinded monit or will be released to the TMF until database lock for the final analysis and 
official declaration of unblinding is given by [CONTACT_155717].  
3.[ADDRESS_275513]’s treatment 
assignment may influence her or her infant’s clinical care, the investigator or designee may 
request that the blind be broken for the maternal subject- infant subject pair experiencing the 
emergency. If feasible, the invest igator is asked to notify the Medical Monitor or designee prior 
to unblinding; however, the investigator may unblind without consulting the Medical Monitor ,
if it is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject. The investigator will be expected to 
provide a rationale for the necessity of unblinding, based on a meaningful change to the 
maternal or infant subject’s immediate and short -term medical care which will result from 
knowledge of the treatment assignment. Novavax also retains the right to initiat e the unblinding 
of treatment allocation for serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unexpected and are suspected 
to be causally related to the test article and that potentially require expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities.
If unblinding is deemed necessary, the unblinded vaccine administrator will utilize information 
from IWRS to obtain treatment details for the maternal subject -infant subject pair. The date and 
time of breaking the blind as well as the reason must be documented and placed in the Study 
Pharmacy Manual by [CONTACT_229050]. The investigator should not otherwise divulge the 
treatment assignment of the maternal subject -infant subject pair to site staff, and should provide 
the information only to those individuals involved in the direct care of the subject. The date and 
reasons for breaking the blind must be submitted to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_275514] pair is unblinded, both subjects 
should remain in the study and continue the protocol-specified follow -up evaluations if 
possible.
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275515] and Manufacturing Process for Clinical Tri al 
Material
The RSV F vaccine candidate is based on a purified, recombinant near full-length RSV F 
glycoprotein that self -assembles into protein -protein nanoparticle structures of approximately 
30 to 60 nm. The baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system was used to clone and express the 
recombinant human RSV F gene. In the vaccine construct, one of two subtilisin -like protease 
cleavage sites in the RSV F sequence is deleted, as well as approximately half of the fusion 
domain, to mitigate toxicity of the protein to the expression system. In Sf9insect cells, 
recombinant F is produced as a precursor (F0) that is modified by N-linked glycans and, like 
the native F fusion protein, assembles into homo -oligomers as trimers [Collins 1991 ]. The F0 
precursor is processed into F2 and F1 chains that remain predominantly covalently linked by 
[CONTACT_229051](s) in the prod uct.
4.1.1 Production and Purification of RSV F Protein
The recombinant human RSV F gene was cloned via Escherichia coli (E. coli ) into a FlashBac 
GOLD expression vector baculovirus DNA with v-acth and chitinase genes deleted (Oxford 
Expression Technologies) . TheF gene is under transcriptional control of the baculovirus 
Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) polyhedrin promoter 
at the 5' end and includes a poly (A) sequence at the 3' end.  A single recombinant baculovirus 
expressing the F gene was identified, plaque -purified ,and amplified for use in the manufacture 
of the bulk RSV F antigen.
Manufacture of the RSV F protein antigen is initiated by [CONTACT_229052]9 cells in exponential 
growth with baculovirus containing the RSV F gene. After infection, cells are collected by 
[CONTACT_7891], washed with sterile buffer , and then lysed in the presence of detergent to release 
membrane-bound RSV F protein.  Leupeptin hemi -sulfate salt is added to the lysis buffer to 
protect the RSV F protein from cellular protease s, which are also inactivated by [CONTACT_229053] . The supernatant containing the RSV F protein is separated from cell debris by 
[CONTACT_229054]. The flow-through fraction is first 
nanofilte red through a virus removal filter and then loaded on an affinity chromatography 
column, which binds theRSV F protein . After washing, the RSV F protein is eluted from the 
column with buffer containing methyl -α-D-mannopyranoside (MMP) and Polysorbate (PS)-80, 
and exposed to a second low pH treatment. Eluted fractions are further purified with acation 
exchange chromatography step that removes MMP and transfers the product into a sodium 
phosphate buffer with sodium chloride and PS-80. The product is then filtered through a 
sterilizing filter (0.20 μm) to produce the bulk drug substance that is clear and colorless, and 
contains no preservatives.  The bulk drug substance is stored at -70°C until it is adsorbed onto 
aluminum phosphate and filled as drug product. 
4.1.2 Aluminum Adjuvant
The aluminum phosphate salt is supplied as a sterile suspension in unbuffered isotonic saline 
(4.8 mg/mL of aluminum as a phosphate salt in 0.15 M NaCl without buffer) by [CONTACT_229055] (Frederikssund, Denmark).  
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275516]
The F protein conte nt in the purified drug substance is determined by [CONTACT_1629] F protein -specific 
binding ELISA. To produce the adjuvanted vaccine, the bulk RSV F protein and aluminum 
phosphate are diluted to a specified concentration and then combined to yield a final 
concentrati on of 240 μg/mL RSV F and 0.8 mg/mL alum inum , in a final buffer of 18 mM 
sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.8% histidine, 0.03% PS-80. The RSV F vaccine 
is filled into single -use glass vials. The final product appears as a white opalescent suspe nsion. 
No antibiotics or preservatives are present. 
4.1.4 Formulation Buffer Placebo
The placebo treatment is comprised of 22 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, with 150 mM NaCl, 
1.0% histidine, and 0.03% PS-80; is manufactured by [CONTACT_229056] (San Diego, 
[LOCATION_004]); and is supplied in single- use [ADDRESS_275517] will be labeled with the following information: manufacturer’s name [CONTACT_3816], 
product name, manufacture date, storage requirements (2- 8°C), directions for use, and any 
other investigational product labeling appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the trial is 
conducted. 
The RSV F vaccine and placebo will be stored at 2 -8°C in a temperature monitored refrigerator.  
Access to this refrigerator will be limited to designated site personnel.  
Additional information on the packaging, storage, and handling procedures for the RSV F 
vaccine and placebo is provided in the Study Pharmacy Manual .
4.[ADDRESS_275518] articles (RSV F 
vaccine and placebo) received at the site are inventoried and tracked throughout the study and 
the result recorded on the product accountability form maintained in the Study Pharmacy 
Manual . 
All quantities of the test articles must be reconcil ed at the termination of the study and a written 
explanation provided for any discrepancies.  Unless specific written instructions to the contrary 
are provided by [CONTACT_155717] (or designee) , all unused vials containing the RSV F vaccine and 
placebo, and packagi ng materials, will be inventoried and maintained at the clinical siteuntil 
further notice by [CONTACT_229057] (designee) . The site is not permitted to return or destroy used or 
unused test articles or packaging materials unless specifically authorized by [CONTACT_229058] x (or

upper limit of 40 years and 0 days) . 
2)Singleton pregnancy of 28 to 360/7weeks gestation on the day of planned vaccination.
Documentation of gestational age will be based on one of the following composite criteria
(Note: The investigator should usethe earliest ultrasound data available to establish the 
study -specific gestational age dating) :
(a)Gestational Age Dating Based on First Trimester Data (data obtained ≤ 136/7weeks ):
The date of thefirst day of the reported last menstrual period (LMP ) may be used to 
establish the gestational age if corroborated by a first trimester ultrasound. If the 
gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and the first trimester ultrasound are 
discrepan t by> 7 days , the ultrasound will be used to establish the gestational age. 
If LMP is uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound -established gestational age estimation
will be used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy. 
(b)Gestational Age Dating Based on Early Second Trimester Data (data obtained 140/7to 
216/7weeks) :  
The date of the first day of the reported LMP may be used to establish the gestational 
age if corroborated by [CONTACT_228968] (that estimates the 
gestational age between 140/7and 216/7weeks) . If thegestational age estimation derived 
using the LMP and the early second trimester ultrasound are discrepan t by> 10 days, 
the ultrasound will be used to establish the gestational age. 
If LMP is uncertain of unknown, the ultrasound -established gestational a ge estimation 
will be used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy. 
(c)Gestational Age Dating Based on Later Second Trimester Data (data obtained 220/7to 
276/7weeks)
The date of the first day of the reported LMP may be used to establish the gesta tional 
age if corroborated by a later second trimester ultrasound (that estimates the gestational 
age between 220/7to 276/7weeks) . If thegestational age estimation derived using the 
LMP and the later second trimester ultrasound are discrepan t by> 14 days, the 
ultrasound will be used to establish the gestational age. 
IfLMP is uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound -established gestational age estimation 
will be used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

All procedures, including routine vaccinations that are considered standard of care for the 
newborn infant may be performed at any study visit which coincides with the usual timing for 
such procedures . Before any of the following study -specific procedures are performed, 
informed consent for the infant subject and release of medical records will be review ed with the 
maternal subject (i.e., mothers will not be re-consented) or will be obtained from the other 
parent or guardian if not captured under the institution’s policy.
If cord blood is not collected at the time of delivery (see delivery procedures for 
maternal subjects in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), a blood sample from the infant (2 mL by 
[CONTACT_229073]; 1 mL by[CONTACT_229074] ) should be obtained within 72 
hours of birth for RSV serology. (Note: Cord blood is markedly preferred and all efforts 
should be directed to obtaining this specimen.  A phlebotomy/heel stick within 72 hours 
is a fall back procedure only.  The volume of a postpartum phleb otomy/heel stick must 
be accounted for within the phlebotomy limits as per the investigator’s institution, 
whereas a cord blood sample need not.)
The investigator or a trained designee will perform the following procedures: collection 
of results from the physical exam, weight, length, frontal -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_228767] 
(FOC), and APGAR measurements performed following birth and used to assess the 
overa ll health of the infant; and documentation of the mode of infant feeding (e.g.,   
exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula fed, breast milk and supplemented with 
formula, expressed breast milk, wet nurse, receiving solids), if a smoker or one or more 
children < 5 years of age will reside in the same household, and whether the infant or

6.2.3 Clinical Stud y Site Response to Reports of Initial Trigger Sy mptoms
In response to a report via active or passive surveillance of Initial Trigger Symptoms , the 
study site staff will:
Arrange for an in-clinic or home visit as soon as possible, but not later than 7days after
symptom onset ,for evaluation by [CONTACT_5989]/qualified clinical designee of the 
subject (infant or mother) displaying the symptom/s and/or findings listed in Table 2. 
Arrange for an in-clinic or home visit by a study physician/qualified clinical designee 
for evaluation as soon as possible within 7 days of symptom (s)onset for maternal or 
infant subjects who received care for trigger sympto ms at a non-study, affiliated medical 
facility. Note that this visit would only be applicable to subjects who are receiving 
outpatient care or have been released from inpatient care.
Procedures to Occur During the Visit :
Specific for Symptomatic Infants :Measure the respi[INVESTIGATOR_228776] (if possible) 
for all symptomatic infants. This measurement should be performed first, on a calm 
infant, and should be performed by [CONTACT_228995] (i.e., without stethoscope 
auscultation) for a full, timed one min ute period.  
oIf the result is ≥ 60 bpm in an infant 0to 59 days of age or ≥ 50 bpm in an infant 
≥60 days of age, a second timed one minute count should be obtained.
oIf a second count is obtained, the lower of the two observations should be recorded.
Measure the SpO 2 via pulse oximetry (using study -specific pulse oximeter) for all 
symptomatic infants, which is to be performed when the infant is calm and not crying, 
and before administration of oxygen supplementation. The lowest stable SpO 2observed 
during a one minute measure should be recorded. Note that the oxygen should notbe 
removed to measure SpO 2 in infants already receiving oxygen supplementation at the 
time of assessment. Please refer to the Pulse Oximeter Manual for more details. 
For a ll Symp tomatic Subjects (Maternal and Infant) :
Review and confirm the history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], including the approximate date of 
first symptom onset. 
Perform an examination of the symptomatic infant subject to ascertain, by [CONTACT_229082], the presence of the LRTI manifestations listed in Table 3below .
Collect a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228777].
oSymptomatic maternal subjects will have a nasal and throat specimen collected. The 
nasal secretion will be collected by [CONTACT_20169]- turbinate swabbing.
oSymptomatic infant subjects will have a mid- turbinate nasal swab collected. 
oRT-PCR testing for RSV and other viruses by [CONTACT_228997], and not for clinical care. 
oRespi[INVESTIGATOR_228850] F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275554] testing for bacterial and/or viral pathogens as warranted.
Collect vital signs other than respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (heart rate, blood pressure [if available for 
the infant ], and axillary body temperature) for the symptomatic subject. 
Ascertain any medically -attended visit by [CONTACT_228998][INVESTIGATOR_228851].
Ascertain any new concomitant medications resulting from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375].
Notify the infant’s primary healthcare provider of the RSV surveillance visit and 
outcome, as necessary.

For symptomatic infant subjects, schedule a follow -up visit in 2 to 3 days to ascertain 
whether the illness is worsening.
oThe follow -up visit will include the same procedures outlined in 6.2.3 .
oParents/guardians will be strongly encouraged to report any worsening after the 
follow -up visit, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which may trigger any number of 
additional follow -up visits at the investigator’s discretion.
oIn the event that an infant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], site staff are encouraged to perform a 
follow -up visit in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ,if permissible under local administrative and ethical 
review procedures.
For symptomatic maternal subjects, and for symptomatic infant subjects after the first 
follow -up visit described above, a weekly contact [CONTACT_107461]/SMS will be performed 
to ascertain respi[INVESTIGATOR_228780] D+180 visit, and to monitor the 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275556] returned to 
baseline if after the D+180 visit. 
In the event new and/or worsening symptoms are reported during active or passive 
follow -up, an in-clinic or home RSV -surveillance visit may be scheduled at the 
investigator’s discretion for an evaluation to occur as soon as possible, and a re-
evaluation as per Section 6.2.3 may be performed.
oAt the investigator’s discretion, collection of ONE more respi[INVESTIGATOR_228853]. Note that no more than 3respi[INVESTIGATOR_228854].   
oIf the new or worsening symptom in the maternal subject is associated with a respi[INVESTIGATOR_228783] a specimen has already been obtained, the investigator may exercise 
his/her judgement as to the utility of an additional swab. 
6.2.5 Definitions and Rules for RSV Surveillance
If possible, study staff should collect symptom data for any RSV -suspected illness for 
maternal and infant subject pairs during the same weekly telephone call or SMS contact. 
In theevent the maternal and infant subject pair have independent clinic visits for 
assessment of an RSV -suspected illness within a given surveillance period, the 
subsequent weekly telephone or SMS contact [CONTACT_229083] . For example, if a maternal 
subject had a clinic visit to evaluate an illness on Monday of surveillance week (SW)-
1, this would trigger the next contact [CONTACT_229084]-2. If the infant 
subject of thesame mother had a clinic visit to evaluate an illness on Thursday of SW1, 
his/her next weekly contact [CONTACT_229085] m aternal subject 
contact [CONTACT_229086]-2. (The intent of this provision is to relieve the need for 
mother/infant pairs to make multiple follow- up visits in a one -week period.)
A new respi[INVESTIGATOR_228784] a one week (7 day) interval 
elapses during which the subject is free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. When a subject is 
determined to have a new respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], the subject should be evaluated at an in-
clinic or home visit by [CONTACT_229002][INVESTIGATOR_1865] (as described in Section 6.2.3 ).
A medically -attended visit will be deemed to have occurred whenever the subject or a 
parent/guardian of the infant subject precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a visit or home encounter with a 
physician or other healthcare provider for the purpose of evaluation or treatment of a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]. Note that at -home or in -clinic visits undertaken specifically to fulfill 
the requirements of this protocol, for illnesses which would not otherwise cause the 
parent/guardian to present the infant for care, are NOT “medically -attended visits,” 
with the exception noted immediately below.
In the event that the investigator is also the subject’s primary care physician 
(PCP)/general practitioner (GP), any RSV surveillan ce visit will be counted as a 
“medically -attended visit.” 
Note that the intent of the evaluation of subjects with Trigger Symptoms is fulfillment 
of the objectives of this protocol. The investigator or study site staff should use their 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275557]’s primary physician or if the case is emergent. The collection of the study data 
to support the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are key objectives of this trial, 
but when necessary, appropriate medical care should supersede this goal. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_110636] s captured as efficacy endpoints will NOT be recorded in the AE
electronic case report form (eCRF) or AE eSource page , with the exception of those that 
fulfill the definition of an SAE. Full particulars of the SAE(s) will also be captured in 
the SAE report form.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_228786] [ADDRESS_275558]-delivery visit (D+180) will be followed 
by [CONTACT_229004].
6.3 Concomitant Therapy
Maternal and infant subjects may receive all concomitant medications and procedures deemed 
necessary to provide adequate healthcare during the study, with the exception of those specified 
in the exclusion criteria. Routine medical standards of care are permitted, including vaccines 
needed for emergent indications (e.g., tetanus booster in response to a penetrating injury and 
palivizumab prophylaxis during RSV season of infants born prior to 35 weeks). Routine 
vaccination is permitted at all times for the infant (e.g., well -baby [CONTACT_229087]) . 
Concomitant medication s, procedures, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228855] (ICF) is signed through the 
end of study follow -up. All new or changed concomitant medications taken through the entire 
study period for both maternal and infant subjects will be recorded (excluding routine 
medications administered for the management of labor and delivery ). The investigator will 
document whether the concomitant medication was provided for either a solicited syste mic or 
an injection site adverse event.
6.[ADDRESS_275559] and parents/guardians of the infant subject have the right to decline study 
treatment or other study procedures for themselves or their infants for any reason at any time 
during the study. If a maternal subject declines study procedures subsequent to receipt of a 
treatment dose or if a parent/guardian of the infant declines study procedures at any time during 
the study, it should be recorded as a protocol deviation and the reason should be clearly 
documented in the source document. The maternal subject and/or parent/guardian of the infant 
will be asked to complete all other study procedures for herself and infant, as applicable. If the 
maternal subject or parent/guardian of the infant does not wish for herself or the infant to remain 
in the study, either can choose to withdraw consent and discontinue at any time as outlined in 
Section 6.5.
The investigator may, at his/her discretion, restrict a maternal or infant subject from receiving 
a specific study procedure if he or she consider it to be in the maternal or infant subject’s best 
interest to do so, but can suggest that both remain in the study to be followed for safety if the 
maternal subject has received a test article. In this situation, the reason for not performing the 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275560] ober 2018 Page 114
study treatment and/or procedure should also be recorded as a protocol deviation and clearly 
documented in the source document. 
6.[ADDRESS_275561] participation in the study is strictly voluntary. Maternal subjects 
and/or parents/guardians of infants have the right to withdraw themselves and/or the infant from 
the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty. The investigator may, at his/her 
discretion, discontinue subjects from the study if he/she considers it to be in the participants' 
best interest to do so, or if the maternal subject or the infant’s parent or guardian is not willing 
or able to comply with the study requirements. Novavax will be notified immediately by [CONTACT_216435] a subject prematurely ends study participation. The reason for early 
discontinuation will be clearly documented in the electr onic Case Report Form (eCRF) or 
eSource . A withdrawal due to an AE will initiate additional reporting requirements as outlined 
in Section 8.7. 
In the event of early termination, investigators will make every reasonable effort to perform 
study completion procedures. Study completion procedures will include a query for any MAEs, 
SNMCs, or SAEs occurring since the last study visit, and any concomitant medications taken 
to treat these events, as well as:
For maternal subjects: a blood draw for serology testing (20 mL) at any time and for 
clinical laboratory safety assessments (10 mL) in applicable subjects (i.e., those subjects 
with safety labs performed at screening) if before the Day 14 visit. 
For infant subjects: a blood draw for serology testing (1 to 2 mL by [CONTACT_229088], but not within two weeks of a prior 
phlebotomy) if prior to the:
oDay 90 visit for Cohort 1 subjects, 
oDay 1 20visit for Cohort 2 subjects, and
oDay 180 visit for Cohort 3 subjects. 
Additionally any SNMC or SAE that continues beyond the duration of the study is to be 
followed to resolution or until the event becomes stable.  Maternal and infant subjects who 
terminate from the study early will not be replaced.
6.6 Study Termination
Novavax reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. When the study is 
terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the investigator will notify the IRB/IEC for the 
study, and other authorities as required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
The scheduled end of the study will be the completion of the last post -delivery Day [ADDRESS_275562] infant enrolled in t he study.

7 LABORATORY REQUIREME NTS
Appendix 3specifies the maximum amount of blood that will be drawn from maternal (120 mL) 
and infant (from 3 to 6 mL, depending on the collection method) subjects, and from the cord 
blood at delivery (a minimum of 5 mL) for clinical safety and/or immunogenicity laboratory 
procedures to be completed throughout the study. This amount may increase for maternal 
subjects if repeat laboratory safety assessments are performed (see Section 8.2.3 for more 
details).   
Specific information regarding the central or local laboratories that will perform clinical 
laboratory safety testing, RSV serology testing, and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_228856] .
7.1 Clinical Laboratory Testing
The following laboratory tests will be performed by a qualified central laboratory (unless 
otherwise stated) designated by [CONTACT_229089] (Days -28 to 0) 
and on Day 14 (unless the subject delivers prior to this visit at which time the blood sample will 
be obtained at delivery):
Serum chemistry – alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatin ine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 
Hematology – hemoglobin, platelet count, and white blood cell (WBC) count. 
Additional clinical laboratory antigen tests/serologies for HIV, syphilis, HBV, and HCV 
detection will be performed by a central or local labor atory at the screening visit, if results are 
not available in prior data collected during the course of the current pregnancy.
A urine pregnancy test will be administered to all maternal subjects at the D+180 visit; a positive 
result will trigger additiona l follow -up to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.
7.2 Assessments of Immunogenicity
Anti- F IgG antibody levels in EU,PCA concentrations, and neutralizing antibody titers to 
RSV/A and RSV/B will be determined at protocol- specified time points for all subjects. 
Completion of microneutralization testing may be staged, due to its cumbersome nature, and 
results may be reported in addenda to the primary clinical study report. Serological 
immunogenicity parameters will include GMEU, geometric mean concentration (GMC), or 
GMT (as appropriate); GMFR, SCR, and SRR by [CONTACT_229090]. 
Comparisons across groups will be performed as described in the statistical analysis plan and 
briefly in Section 10.5. Blood samples from maternal subjects will be drawn for RSV serology 
testing at screening (Day -28 to 0) and on Day [ADDRESS_275564] blood is not collected at delivery. 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275565] sera are added starting minimally at 1:10. Serial three- fold dilutions of an anti -F IgG 
reference standard as well asnegative and positive controls are also included. After incubation, 
wells are washed extensively and an anti-human IgG peroxidase conjugated antibody is added 
to detect the presence of anti -RSV F IgG specific antibodies in the wells. Following second ary 
antibody incubation and extensive washing, substrate is added to the plates, color is allowed to 
develop, and the plate is read at an optical density (OD) of 450nmwith subtraction at 630 nm 
to account for background. A four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve fit is applied to the reference 
standard and the reported titer is determined from the mean calculated from serial dilutions, 
interpolated from the reference standard concentrations. A full description of the validated 
method can be found in Novavax stand ard operating procedure (SOP) numbered 
P_SOP_00659.
7.2.2 Palivizumab -Competitive Antibody  (PCA) ELISA 
In the PCA ELISA, 96-well microtiter plates are coated overnight with the RSV F antigen, then 
blocked with an irrelevant protein to reduce non-specific bindin g.  Serial dilutions of test sera,
diluted minimally at 1:4,are incubated with a fixed amount of biotin -labeled palivizumab in the 
RSV F-coated plates . Reference standards as well as negative and positive controls are also 
included. After incubation to reach binding equilibrium, the plates are washed and then 
incubated with avidin -conjugated horseradish peroxidase. After additional washing, substrate 
is added to the plates, color is allowed to develop, and the plate is read at OD 450with subtraction 
at [ADDRESS_275566] serum are 
quantitated based on OD values corresponding to 50% binding of unlabeled palivizumab. The 
final concentration is obtained by [CONTACT_229091] /extrapolation of the referen ce curve 
adjusted by [CONTACT_229092] a 4-PL curve fit analysis. The binding of biotinylated 
palivizumab to the antigen on the plate reflects the competition of palivizumab -like antibodies 
from human serum.  A full description of the validated method can be found in Novavax SOP 
numbered P_SOP_01066.
7.2.3 RSV/A and B Microneutralization (MN)
Tests for serum neutralizing antibodies against a minimum of one RSV/A and B group viruses 
are performed using a MN assay developed by P.A. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_228857]. This assay is well -controlled and has been extensively test ed for over 20 years, in 
both seroepi[INVESTIGATOR_228858], and has been used to estimate potential protective 
titers [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29422] 2003b ].  The RSV/A and B MN assay is qualified.
In brief, RSV/A and RSV/B stocks are prepared in HEp-2 monolayers, divided into aliquots, 
and stored at -70ºC as previously described [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29422] 2003b , Suara 1996 ]. Duplicate serial two-
fold dilutions of sera are added to a constant virus inoculum in a 96 -well microtiter plate. HEp-
2 cells are then added to each well and plates are incubated for 6 to 7 days. Positive (no test 
serum) and negative (no virus) controls are included. Multiple stand ard control sera with 
established titers across the dynamic range of the assay are included in each assay run, and their 
titers must conform to pre-specified acceptance criteria in order for results of that run to be

Instructions on how to obtain the respi[INVESTIGATOR_228859] . Note that the testing described in this section will be for research purposes and the 
protocol does not contemplate use of these data for clinical care; which will be the 
responsibility of the subjects’ primary physicians and their local laboratory services.
7.[ADDRESS_275569], may be 
used for repetition of the assays listed above ( Section 7.2) using different RSV antigens, or for 
other exploratory assays of RSV immunity in development. Archived sera may also be used for 
clinical laboratory testing for safety if needed to evaluate an adverse event, provided that a) 
sample storage falls within conditions previously validated by [CONTACT_229093] (or an appropriate control strategy can be used to evaluate potential storage 
impacts), and b) such testing will not include either assays to detect HIV infect ion, or any 
genetic testing.  Archived samples may also be used to create positive or negative panels for 
quality control or for assay development related to other infectious diseases (excluding HIV), 
in which case they will be anonymized. The above uses will be outlined in the Informed Consent 
document.
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275570], as well as an extended unsolicited AE profile through six (6) 
months after delivery. Additionally, vaccine safety will include measures that assess for 
potential pregnancy/labor and delivery complications for the maternal subject, and for potential 
safety concerns for the infant exposed to anti-F antibodies inutero via transplacental 
immunization. The infant’s health status will be assessed for any adverse events including 
physical and/or developmental impairments, as well as increased severity of RSV illness upon 
natural exposure. Because safety outcomes are different based on the subject population (i.e., 
maternal subjects vs. infant subjects) under evaluation, AE assessments specific to the maternal 
or infant subject are indicated in this section. 
8.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any unfav orable or unintended change in the physical, 
psychological, or biochemical condition of the subject. An AE temporally related to 
participation in the study or due to a procedure performed in the trial will be documented 
whether or not considered related tothe test article. This definition includes intercurrent 
illnesses and injuries, and exacerbations of pre-existing conditions. Stable pre-existing 
conditions which do not change in nature or severity during the study are not considered AEs; 
however, these should be collected as part of the medical history. AEs will be considered 
treatment emergent from the date and time of the first administration of the investigational 
product. 
Data concerning ALL adverse events will be collected at all scheduled visits for the entire study 
period for maternal subjects (i.e., from the time inform ed consent is obtained though post-
delivery study Day 180) and through one year of life for infant subjects. 
In addition to the scheduled visits, maternal subjects will be encoura ged to return to the 
clinic or notify the investigator if any severe (grade 3) local or systemic solicited AE 
occurs during the 7-day post-immunization period, or if a severe AE, a serious AE, or 
any other AE worrisome to the subject occurs at any time fol lowing vaccination. 
Parents/guardians will also be encouraged to report, or ask the infant’s primary 
healthcare provider/pediatrician to report at any time, any other type of severe, serious, 
or otherwise concerning AE. 
If at a scheduled or unscheduled visit, symptoms are presented that would require a 
physical exam to adequately assess potential AEs, the exam should be performed and 
vital signs collected.  
Adverse events will be recorded as observed by [CONTACT_093], designated personnel, or as 
provi ded by [CONTACT_229094] a face-to-face visit with the 
maternal subject or the infant’s parent/guardian.  Full details of the AE (i.e., nature, date of 
onset and recovery as well as an assessment of severity, relationship to study agent, seriousness, 
treatment and outcome) will be recorded in the source documentation and captured in the eCRF
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275571] ober 2018 Page 119
or entered into the eSource directly , and will generally require the investigator(s) causality 
assessment, except as discussed in subsequent sections.
8.[ADDRESS_275572] Diary  
Maternal subjects will be provided with a diary for the documentation of solicited and 
unsolicited AEs, daily recording of their oral temperature, and concomitant medications and 
procedures starting on vaccination day and for six days following vaccination (i.e., from Day 0 
to Day 6, inclusive, or 7 days total).  A series of local injection site and systemic reactions that 
are reasonably likely to occur in vaccine pr ograms ( Table 4) will be solicited daily in the diary 
and standardized severity grades offered to the subject. A standard tool for the measurement of 
visible local reactions will be provided (see example provided in Appendix 4) as will a digital 
oral thermometer. Maternal subjects will also be asked to record any physician visits or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and any unsolicited AEs experienced during Day [ADDRESS_275573] an ad hoc
clinic visit at his/her judgment, and should enter anygrade 3 solicited adverse events reported 
by [CONTACT_229095], even if the balance of 
diary data is not yet available.
Table 4:Listing of Diary Solicited Events  
Injection Site (Local) Events Systemic Events
Pain Body temperature (oral)     Nausea
Bruising Chills Vom iting
Redness Muscle pain Headache
Swelling Joint pain Fatigue
Diarrhea
Note: All events listed will be solicited by [CONTACT_229096] (i.e., from Day 0 to Day 6, inclusive) 
and will be categorized as solicited events.  Events reported outside this window will be categorized and reported as 
unsolicited AEs.
Standard severity grading definitions will be provided in the diary. Grading of visible, 
measurable injection site reactions will be based on the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) 
Guidance for Industry, Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (Septem ber 2007). Definitions are summarized 
in Table 6. Body temperature (for assessment of fever) during pregnancy will be collected as a 
continuous variable and graded by [CONTACT_229097] -trimester values published in 
Sheffield et al. [2013 ](see Table 7) and also provided in the Toxicity Grading Scale (TGS) 
located in the Study Operations Manual .  
Investigators will not be required to assess causality of solicited adverse events specifically 
named in the diary if onset is during the solicitation period (these will be presumed to be 
treatment -related). Advers e events consistent with the solicited adverse events listed in the 
diary, but with onset after the solicitation period (i.e., post-Day 6), will be captured as 
unsolicited AEs and are subject to all procedures for unsolicited AE data.
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275574] diary, which continue after the collection period (i.e., 
post-Day 6) will be followed to resolution. The continuing, solicited AE will be captured by 
[CONTACT_229098], on the AE eCRF or AE eSource page. Investigators will be required to assess 
severity of the continuing solicited adverse event(s) starting from the day after the last diary 
entry until resolution.
8.2.2 Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Any AEs reported by [CONTACT_229099] y for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT). Solicited events with an onset after the solicitation period will also be 
classified as unsolicited AEs. Unsolicited events that occur within [ADDRESS_275575] an ad hoc clinic visit at his/her judgment, and should enter any 
grade [ADDRESS_275576] s will be assessed for severity (as defined in 
Section 8.8) and for causality (as discussed in Section 8.9), and will be documented in the source 
documents an d captured in the eCRFs or entered into the eSource directly.  
8.2.3 Clinical Laboratory  Findings as Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory parameters will be tabulated in study reports by [CONTACT_229100] (TGS) provided in the Study Operati ons Manual , which is based on third -
trimester values published in Sheffield et al.[2013 ]. Note that normal ranges for these 
parameters are based on reference ranges appropriate for women in the third trimester of a 
pregnancy . 
Laboratory values that show an increase in the toxicity grade relative to baseline values in the 
same subject, and attain at least grade 2 (e.g., normal or grade 1 to grade 2 or higher) will be 
reported as AEs (along with the severity grade). Repeat testing will be conducted as defined 
below until the laboratory parameter returns to baseline, becomes stable, or an explanatory 
diagnosis is available: 
Grade 2 events - weekly, from the time the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal 
laboratory parameter.
Grade [ADDRESS_275577] to report less severe abnormalities as AEs (e.g., grade 1 events), 
at his/her discretion, if the abnormality is of sufficient concern to trigger, or should have 
triggered, a diagnostic evaluation (including repeat testing). 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275578] -trimester values in Sheffield et al.
[2013 ], and are summarized in Table 7for fever. The toxicity grade range for a fetal heart tone 
abnormality is also provided in Table 7. For the purposes of reporting vital sign abnor malities 
as AEs, those values that show an increase in the toxicity grade relative to the baseline values 
(in the same subject) and attain at least a grade 2 (e.g., normal or grade 1 to grade 2, or grade 2 
to grade 3) must be reported as an AE. Investigato rs may report lesser abnormalities as AEs if 
indicated based on clinical judgment. Abnormal vital signs may be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion, and because these measures are highly labile, they should only be reported as AEs 
when the investigato r believes there is a meaningful physiologic change. An exception is made 
for the fetal heart tone s measure , which may be repeated, but should also be reported as an AE 
if anabnormality is consistently observed (i.e., present on more than one observation) with 
repeat testing .   
8.[ADDRESS_275579] Safety Assessments
Any AEs reported in infants will be categorized as unsolicited events and MedDRA coded by 
[CONTACT_3592].  These can include, but are not limited to, abnormalities in vital signs, metabolic 
screening and developmental tests, neonatal hearing, congenital anomalies, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
perinatal infections, neonatal death, complications that result in extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; as 
well as any other SAE (as defined in Section 8.5), MAE, or SNMC (as defined in Section 8.4). 
All unsolicited AEs will be assessed for severity (as defined in Section 8.8) and for causality 
(as discussed in Section 8.9), and will be documented in the source documents and captured in 
the eCRFs or entered into the eSource directly . Severity for all unsolicited events, including 
those for which numerical value s may be available (e.g., vital signs or clinical laboratory 
parameters) will be based on interference with daily -activities and/or whether medical 
intervention/therapy is required, according to the investigator’s medical judgment. 
Events that meet the threshold for SAEs (as discussed in Section 8.5), will be designated as 
such, and are associated with enhanced reporting requirements (see Section 8.7). 
8.3.1 Ages and Stages Questionnaire
The Ages & Stages Questionnaires®, Third Edition (ASQ -3™) consists of a brief (10-15 
minute) parent questionnair e that is then scored by [CONTACT_201329]. It is designed as a 
screening tool to pi[INVESTIGATOR_228860] 5 ½ years. One of the strengths of the ASQ is that it employs a parent -centric approach, 
altho ugh assistance by [CONTACT_229101] ( http://agesandstages.com/ ). Developmental 
assessments will be performed at 6 and 12 months (assessment for infants born prematurely 
may use age-appropriate adjusted scoring ) of age for all infant subjects. For purposes of 
reporting the developmental screening as AEs, only abnormalities observed at both 6 and 12 
months of age will be reported as an AE. Parents/guardians of infant subjects with a positive 
screen detected at both [ADDRESS_275580] appearing at 12 months of age, will be 
offered repeat ASQ screening of their infant at 15 and 18 months of age as a follow -up 
procedure . In addition, appropriate referrals for diagnostic pediatric developmental testing 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275581] ober 2018 Page 122
(according to the local standards of care) will also be advised for infants with a positive screen 
identified.
As a guidance, and solely for the purposes of consistency within this protocol , it is suggested 
that investigators report ASQ abnormalities which persist at 6 and 12 months in a given infant 
as an AE that is “moderate” in severity. If diagnostic developmental testing is undertaken, the
event should be further classified as a medically-a ttended event (MAE, see Section 8.4). If 
diagnostic evaluation, during the trial or afterward, leads to the diagnosis of a persistent 
developmental disability, the event then also becomes a serious adverse e vent (SAE , see 
Section 8.5) and should be reported as such.
8.4 Medically -Attended Events and Significant New Medical Conditions
Medically -attended events (MAEs) are adverse events which result in an unscheduled visit to a 
healthcare provider (e.g., physician, midwife, or other provider as per local standards of care) 
due to symptomatic illness or injury.  These may include office visits, clinic visits, home 
consultations, emergency room evaluations for non-life-threatenin g events, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Significant new medical conditions (SNMCs) are adverse events that are new (that is, not 
present at baseline), clinically significant (meaning that they im ply an important change in the 
subject’s long-term health status), and typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650] (requiring an ongoing change in the 
subject’s medical management). This category is not meant to include minor or transient 
diagnoses or age-related changes.  For example, while new diagnoses of presby[CONTACT_229102], they are not SNMCs because no significant change in health 
status is implied. Similarly, adverse events which are isolated, treatable events that resolve and 
do not require chronic therapy are also not SNMCs (examples could include an uncom plicated 
acute urinary tract infection or a simple fracture resolved with conservative treatment and with 
no residual disability). In contrast, new diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis or coronary artery 
disease are SNMCs because they imply a long-term change in health status and require ongoing 
medical management.   
The eCRF /eSource will provide a field in which the investigator may designate AEs as MAEs, 
SNMCs, or both. Because of the significance of the designation for the subject’s health, long-
term medic al management, and for evaluation of vaccine safety, SNMCs are expected to be 
substantiated diagnoses, not isolated symptoms which might or might not be an SNMC, and the 
Investigator should record sufficient data in the source document to support the diagn osis.
Full details of MAEs and SNMCs (i.e., nature, date of onset and recovery (if applicable) as well 
as an assessment of severity, relationship to study agent, seriousness, treatment, and outcome) 
will be recorded in the source documentation and captured in the eCRF or entered into the 
eSource directly , and will require the Investigator(s) causality assessment.

8.5 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is defined as an AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death,
An immediate threat to life, 
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_228861], not a 24-hour stay or emergency 
room visit. 
oAdmissions for elective surgeries, undertaken for conditions present prior to receipt 
of study drug and without complication, should not be considered SAEs, 
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_228862].
A persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity (substantial disruption of an ability to 
conduct normal life functions), or 
A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home, and 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Events which 
could have led to the above outcomes had they occurred with greater severity are not SAEs, but 
should be reported as AEs, MAEs, or SNMCs, as appropriate. 
The eCRF or eSource will provide a field for designating an AE as an SAE. SAEs are associated 
with enhanced reporting requirements (see Section 8.7).   
8.6 Maternal/Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Events of Special Interest
Table 5summarizes and defines a series of maternal , fetal,and neonatal adverse events that are 
of special interest in the evaluation of maternal immunization strategies.  The majority of these 
events will fulfill one or more of the criteria listed above for SAEs.  In the event that one of 
these events does not meet the criteria for an SAE (e.g., “Small for Gestational Age” might not), 
it will nonetheless be reported as an SAE using the same reporting requirements as an SAE.  
The majority of these terms and definitions are derived from the Brighton Collaboration 
Definitions of Key Terms (WHO meeting July 2014).  Investigators should strive to collect the 
same level of data as for any SAE, and are encouraged to use the exact terms in Table 5to report 
events meeting these definitions (see Table 5footer for exceptions for reporting of neonatal and 
infant death) .  Note that the SAE eCRF /eSource will provide a field for designating an SAE 
report as a Maternal/Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Even t of Special Interest (MFNAESI).  Some 
MFNAESIs are open to interpretation as to which subject should be recorded as sustaining the 
event. Table 5also designates to which subject each class of event should be assigned; solely 
as a uniform data collection convention .Since there are multiple potential sources to determine 
the GA at birth, the study defined EDD and the birth date will be used to determin e the

specified in Table 6. For the purposes of reporting during the solicitation period (i.e., Days 0 to 
6), the maternal subjects’ observations will form the primary data. During clinic visits, 
investigators may measure any persistent local AEs with a ruler, documenting the size of the 
reaction at its widest diameter and use the numeric scale provided in Table 6to assess for 
severity.
Non-visible local AEs (e.g., pain), solicited systemic AEs (except for those listed in Table 7), 
and unsolicited AEs will be assigned a severity based primarily on interference with daily 
activities (Table 6). Medical care-seeking is typi[INVESTIGATOR_228863] 1 (mild) and often present 
for grade 3 (severe) events, but is not the primary determinant, since individuals behave 
differently in this regard.
Severity of clinical laboratory and vital sign abnormalities (including oral or axillary body 
temperature, which is captured as a continuous variable) will be graded based on established 
ranges provided in the TGS, located in Study Operations Manual .

8.9 Relationship (Causality)
The relationship of all unsol icited AEs to the test article must be assessed and documented by 
[CONTACT_1720] a qualified sub-investigator, and classified according to the categories shown 
in Table 9.  The investigator should use his/her best medical judgment to consider whether the 
temporal sequencing of treatment and event, the existence (or lack thereof) of a biologically 
plausible mechanism (which is consistent with the temporal sequence), and the existence (or 
lack thereof) of likely alternative explanations support the causality assessment given. (Note 
that Investigators will not be required to assess causality for solicited AEs reported during the 
solicitation period as t hese are presumed to be treatment -related.)

A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assembled for this study to perform 
ongoing asses sments of the risks of vaccination in pregnant women through delivery, and in the 
delivered infant through the first year of life. In addition, the DSMB will review all 
recommendations from the unblinded statistician to stop enrollment in the trial for futility.  The 
DSMB will consist of at least five clinicians to include not less than two obstetricians (at least 
one with expertise in high-risk obstetrics or maternal -fetal medicine), and not less than two 
pediatricians (at least one neonatologist), and the unblinded DSMB statistician. These 
individuals will not be employees of the Sponsor; and will operate under a charter agreed prior 
to study start which will define responsibilities and authority (including authority to halt 
enrollment or require changes in safety assessments), frequency of meetings, triggers of ad hoc
meetings, access to data and treatment codes, and  communication pathways. The Novavax Sr. 
Director of Pharmacovigilance and Product Safety, or designee, will serve as the sponsor’s 
liaison to the Project Manager of the DSMB. The Study Physician will serve as the medical 
liaison to the DSMB and will be responsible for all presentations to the DSMB during the open 
sessions of the DSMB meeti ngs. 
In general, the DSMB will meet not less than monthly during periods of active maternal 
enrollment and every two months outside these periods, or as required by [CONTACT_229109]. The DSMB may elect, based on a vote of the

10.4.2 Clinica l Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC )
A clinical endpoint adjudication committee (CEAC ) comprising an odd number of three or more 
clinically -experienced voting pediatricians, a non-voting chair who will oversee meetings of the 
CEAC ,and a non-voting coordinator for administrative support will be empaneled to review all 
primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy endpoints relative to infant subjects. The 
operations of the CEAC will be carried out according to a charter which will be collaboratively 
drafted by [CONTACT_228950], and will be adopted prior to any review CEAC activities.  
The CEAC will review each potential infant efficacy endpoint event to determine whether the 
protocol-specified criteria have been fulfilled in a plausible temporal relationship. All 
deliberations of the CEAC will be carried out in blinded manner with regard to treatment 
assignment and the determination of the CEAC with regard to each endpoint event will be final 
and binding on the sponsor.

10.4.3 Analysis of Primary  and Seco ndary  Efficacy  Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed on the ITT-EFF-Iand PP-EFF-I(infant)
Populations . Conclusions concerning stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], the informational analysis, or 
declaration of attainment of the primary efficacy endpoint at the completion of the study , will 
only be based on the PP-EFF-I Population . In addition, supportive analyses based on the ITT-
EFF-I Population will also be performed.
The Vaccine Efficacy (VE) is defined as VE (%) = (1 –RR) x 100, where RR = Relative Risk 
of incidence rates between the two treatment groups (RSV F Vaccine / Placebo). The final 
analysis will be carried out at one -sided Type I error rate of 0.0124 (i.e., the lower bound of 2 -
sided 97.52% confidence interval). An estimate of vacci ne efficacy will be reported using a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval. This conservative Type I error rate was determined as a 
part of the original group sequential design (GSD) approach and will be retained to guard 
against a potential Type I error infla tion resulting from the decision to stop the study at ~ 4,[ADDRESS_275605] to Type I error rate was finali zed in consultation with 
the US -FDA . 
For the original design using the GSD approach , a simulation of 5,000 trials was performed 
under a range of scenarios (including both varying placebo ratesof medically -significant RSV 
LRTI and endpoint event ratio sin infants of active vaccine esrelative to placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). A 
summary of the simulation results is provided in the adaptive design report as Appe ndix [ADDRESS_275606] error variance 
[Zou2004 ]. The general ized linear model with unstructured correlation matrix (Robust error 
variances) will be used. The explanatory variables in the model will include the treatment group. 
The dependent variable will be the incidence rate of the endpoint of interest. The Robust error 
variances will be estimated using repeated statement and the subject identifier. Poisson 
distribution will be used with a link function logarithm.  
Hypothes is testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be carried out sequentially for H 0: VE 
≤0% and H0: VE <30%. Rejection of the first null hypothesis, H0: VE ≤0% demonstrates a 
statistically significant vaccine effect. Rejection of the second null hypothesis, H0: VE < 30%
at Type I error rate of 1-sided 0.0124is required to meet the statistical success criterion pre-
specified for the US-FDA. Should success be declared for the primary endpoint through 0 -90 
days of age, the hierarchical sequential analyses of 0 - 120, 0 - 150, and 0 - 180 days of age will 
be carried out using the Type I error rate of 1- sided 0.025 and the same null hypothesis.
Two types of analyses concerning the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed prior to the 
final analys is: recurring futility analyses approximately twice per year after the Northern and 
Southern hemisphere winter virus season, and an informational analysis with approximately 1/[ADDRESS_275607] 90 days.

designed. An assumption is made that the distribution of the number of even ts under the vaccine, 
xv, and the number of events under placebo, xp, are binomial:
		xv~ Bin (v,nv)
xp~ Bin (p,np)
where πvand nv, respectively, are the probability of an RSV event and the total number of 
subjects in the vaccine group and πpand np, respectively, are the probability of an event and the 
total number of subjects in the placebo group .  
Furthermore, we assume prior distributions for πvand πpthat are flat, non-informative beta 
distributions:
	v	~Beta (1,1)
p	~Beta (1,1).
Futility will bedemonstrated under the primary hypothesis based on the posterior probability 
that the event ratio, r = π v/ πp, is less than or equal to 0.60.

healthcare providers (e.g.,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140098] s). Further details regarding the sensitivity 
analyses will be described in the SAP.
The null hypothesis , H 0: VE ≤0%, using the 1-sided Type I error rate (i.e.,lower bound of 
2-sided 95% CI) will be used for analyses of all secondary efficacy endpoints in infants. For 
each endpoint, in the event that efficacy is shown through the first 90 days of life, a hiera rchical 
sequence of hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy through 120, 150, and 
180days of life.
Additional efficacy analyses may describe the incidence of symptom s used to define RSV 
LRTI. Percentages of infant subjects with any RSV -confirmed respi[INVESTIGATOR_228868] /complaints will be presented by [CONTACT_228952] : cough ,nasal flaring ,difficulty breathing, manifesting in any of the following 
clinical signs or symptoms as lower chest wall indrawing, subcostal retractions, abnormal breath

10.6 Safety Analyses
The primary variable for evaluation of the safety profile will be the number and percentage 
(95% CI) of maternal subjects with solicited and unsolicited AEs recorded post -vaccination and 
the number and percentage (95% CI) of infants with unsolicited AEs occurring since birth. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population as defined in Section 10.1. 
Safety will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_229121]:
Solicited seven day reactogenicity events by [CONTACT_926];
Clinical laboratory safety abnormalities by [CONTACT_926];
Caesarean, vaginal, and instrument- assisted vaginal modes of del ivery;
Specified third -trimester pregnancy complications (i.e., stillbirth, placental abruption, 
preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy, third -trimester hemorrhage, and gestational diabetes) and labor anddelivery 
complications (i.e., emergency Caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, 
chorioamnionitis, and maternal fever or infection ); and 
Unsolicited adverse events through [ADDRESS_275615]-delivery by [CONTACT_229122] 
(possibly, probably, or defini tely), including SAEs, MAEs, and SNMCs through [ADDRESS_275616] -delivery. 
Clinical laboratory data summaries will include (by [CONTACT_58280]) toxicity 
grade shift summaries; absolute means and standard deviations with minima and maxima 
values, and tabulations of changes from baseline. 
Safety analyses for infant subjects will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570], and will 
be based on percentages of infants with:
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275617] ober 2018 Page 140
Congenital anomalies ; respi[INVESTIGATOR_228753] -associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]; 
neonatal death; infant death; sudden infant death syndrome; asphyxia; neonatal or 
hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy; or other adverse events or complications of adverse 
events that necessitate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228869]; 
All other unsolicited/unspecified adverse events by [CONTACT_926], relatedness, and 
seriousness, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_228870]- PCR. 
Summary statistics will also be provided for infant length, weight, FOC , and responses to 
environmental and behavioral queries, through one year post-delivery overall, and by [CONTACT_6490]. Results of developmental testing will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], and 
percentages of infants above normal, normal, at-risk at [ADDRESS_275618] infection endpoints detected by [CONTACT_208869]/passive surveillance in infant 
and maternal subjects from immunization through six months after delivery and by [CONTACT_6490]. The relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI will be estimated using Poisson regression with 
robust error variance [Zou 2004 ]. A general ized linear model with unstructured correlation 
matrix (robust error variances) will be used. The explanatory variables in the model will include 
the treatment group. The dependent variable will be the incidence rate. The Robust error 
variances will be estimated using repeated statement and the subject identifier. Poisson 
distribution will be used with a link function logarithm. The vaccine efficacy, and the 
corresponding two- sided 95% CI will be calculated .
Similar analysis will be conducted to assess the incidence of non -RSV LRTI in infant subjects 
as detected by [CONTACT_229123]. Percentages of infants and maternal subjects presenting with respi[INVESTIGATOR_228871]-RSV respi[INVESTIGATOR_228747]- PCR wi ll be summarized.
All exploratory efficacy analyses will be conducted against the null hypothesis of VE ≤0% 
(i.e.,the RR≤ 1.00). For each endpoint, i n the event that efficacy is shown through the first 90 
days of life, a hierarchical sequence of hypothe sis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy 
through 120, 150, and 180 days of life.
10.8 Sample Size and Power
This study is designed to enroll approximately 4,600 total maternal subjects that include a 
minimum of 3,000 RSV F vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228732] 4 global RSV seasons.  
Assuming a medically -significant RSV LRTI incident rate of 4% in the placebo group and a 
vaccine efficacy of 65%, then the power of the design to claim success is 87%. Table 10
summarizes the power for different placebo attack rates and vaccine efficacies. Power 
calculations were performed using the normal approximation (NCSS PASS 14).  An estimated 
PP population size of 4,218 total evaluable infant subjects (2,786 in the RSV F vaccine group

and 1,432 in the placebo group to account for 1:1 and 2:1 randomization ratios in Year 1 and 
the subsequent years, respectively) was used for all calculations.  
The target sampl e size of the safety and efficacy database in third -trimester pregnancy that will 
be required for licensure is at least 3,[ADDRESS_275620] been enrolled in the active treatment arm. If no events of a given class are 
observed among the 3,000 subjects receiving the RSV F vaccine, an approximation to the one -
sided upper 95% confidence bound on the rate of SAE occurrence would be 0.1 %.

The IBG and the DSMB: Following the analyses for futility, informational, and/or 
efficacy , the IBG will provide the DSMB with a summary of the analyses and 
recommendations. If a protocol- defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_228872], the IBG will inform the DSMB PM, who will then inform the Sponsor
Contact . 
Sponsor Biostatistician: The Sponsor Biostatistician will be unblinded following 
success or futility, after all data from all enrolled mother -infant pairs through the infant 
D+180 visit and the maternal postpartum Day 180 visit are completed, all queries are 
resolved, and the database is locked. The Sponsor Bios tatistician will perform the final 
analysis after all data through the infant D+364 visit are completed, all queries are 
resolved, all immunogenicity testing are completed , and the database is locked. 
10.10 Plan for Analyses and Reporting of Data 
10.10.1 Unblinded Ana lysis of Efficacy, Immunogenicity , and Safety  
The sequencing of RSV seasons in the Northern and Southern hemispheres lends a natural 
periodicity which will be reflected in the futility analyses.  Futility analyses will be conducted 
based on data available 30 May (for convenience called “Northern hemisphere,” although a 
small number of Southern hemisphere subjects may also meet the criteria for inclusion) and on 
approximately 30 September (for convenience called “Southern hemisphere” or “global 
season”) ; and subject to the constraint (applied by [CONTACT_228935]) that at least [ADDRESS_275624] accrued in the active treatment arm. The DSMB will communicate to the Sponsor 
after each futility analysis its recommendation that the trial is either: a) futile and should be 
discontinued, or b) should continue enrollment. 
When futility (with no requirement for further subject enrollment) has been declared, or when 
all live-born infants of all enrolled pregnant mothers have completed [ADDRESS_275625] infant D+[ADDRESS_275626] maternal 
postpartum Day 180 visit for all enrolled subjects . This unblinded analysis of efficacy, 
immunogenicity, and safety will include all available efficacy, immunogenicity and safety 
(inclusive of clinical assessments and concomitant medications) data through the infant D+[ADDRESS_275627] treatment level will be involved in follow -up safety monitoring. Specifically, 
personnel at the clinical study site including, investigators and study staff, research site, and 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol
Novavax, Inc. Version 10.1 –[ADDRESS_275628] -delivery study D +364. 
In addition, an informational analysis of efficacy as specified in Section 10.10.[ADDRESS_275629] accrued. The success criterion is 
defined as the posterior probability that the event ratio is less than or equal to 1.00 (i.e., Vaccine 
Efficacy ≥0%) is greater than or equal to 0.90. This analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_229129] a manner entirely analogous to the analyses for efficacy and 
futility. The DSMB will communicate the results of the analysis to the Sponsor only in terms 
of fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the target criterion . Novavax will remain blinded and the 
outcome will not result in any change in the conduct of the study or the primary efficacy 
objectives and endpoints. 
Results of the unblinded a nalysis of efficacy, i mmunogenicity, and safety through Day 180 may 
be presented by [CONTACT_19457], and may be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities as 
needed.
Modifications or additions to the analyses described above will be included in the SAP. Any 
decisions to deviate from the planned analyses described in the protocol and in the statistical 
analysis plan will be described in detail in the final study report.
10.10.2 Informational Analy sis
The Sponsor may trigger the performance of an informational analysis of efficacy as defined in 
the SAP. This analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_228953] a manner 
entirely analogous to the analyses for efficacy and futility, and will address a success criterion 
to be specified in the SAP. The DSMB will communicate the results of the analysis to the 
Sponsor only in terms of fulfill ment or non -fulfillment of the target criterion.

Appendix 4 –RSV -M-[ADDRESS_275665] Measurement Tool
(Do not use this page in clinic, as it may not be to exact scale)
The Subject Measurement Tool consists of a transparent set of concentric circles with diameters 
that correspond to the ranges in the toxicity grading scale (2.5, 5, and 10cm in diameter). 
Maternal subjects are instructed to overlay the template over the injection site for any reaction 
that can be visually observed (e.g., redness, swelling , bruising).  An assessment of severity is 
then made by [CONTACT_155731]: reactions that 
are smaller than Circle A (2.5 cm) are considered grade 0; reactions larger than Circle A but 
equal to or smaller than Circle B (5cm) are considered grade 1; reactions larger than Circle B 
but equal to or smaller than Circle C (10cm) are considered grade 2; reactions larger than Circle 
C are considered grade 3. The table below summarizes the severity grading for visib le injection 
site reactions based on size.

Appendix 5 –RSV -M-301 Protocol Change History 
Following is a complete tabular summary of changes made to previous versions of the protocol. 
Protocol Version 9.0, 21 July 2017 (revised from [ADDRESS_275667] 2016)
The following is a summary of the changes made to this version of the protocol.
Location of 
ChangeChange/Modifica tion in Version 9.[ADDRESS_275668] the updated endpoint of medically- significant RSV 
LRTI. The updated obje ctive is presented below:  
To determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine against 
medically -significant RSV lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (LRTI) with EITHER 
hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO 2] <95% at sea level or < 92% at 
altitudes > 1800 meters) ORtachypnea (≥ 70 bpm for infants 0 to 59 days of age 
or ≥ 60 bpm for infants ≥ 60 days of age) through the first [ADDRESS_275669] 90 days of life, a hierarchical sequence of 
hypothesis tests will be carried out to examine efficacy at 120, 150, and 180 days 
of life.
Justification: Several recent publications have shown that thepresence of 
tachypnea (based on WHO definitions) is an independent predictor of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228906] (Atwell et al. J Infect. 
Dis. [2016] ; Modjarrad et al. Vaccine [2016] ).  Infants with severe disease may 
maintain their oxygenation through rapid breathing, becoming hypoxemic only 
when they tire and decompensate.  A threshold value for tachypnea 10 breaths per 
minute higher than the WHO definition (which is ≥ 60 bpm for infants 0 to 59 days 
of age and ≥ 50 bpm for infants ≥ 60 days of age) has thus been added to the 
medically- significant RSV LRTI definition.

Synopsis, 
Sections 2.3, 
3.3.3 The 2ndexploratory objective has been updated to include tachypnea. The changed 
objective is as follows: 
To describe the incidence of all -cause LRTI, with and without tachypnea, 
hypoxemia, or severe hypoxemia, in infant subjects as detected by [CONTACT_228945], and the 
efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F vaccine in reducing the incidence 
of these endpoints.
The 2ndcorresponding endpoint to the above -stated objective has also been updated 
to include tachypnea. The changed endpoint is as follows: 
Percentages of infant subjects with all-cause LRTI, with or without tachypnea, 
hypoxemia or severe hypoxemia, as detected by [CONTACT_229040], overall and by [CONTACT_209058](s).
Synopsis, 
Table [ADDRESS_275670] the randomization switch to 2:1 (Active / 
Placebo) after global year 1
Synopsis, 
Section 3.1The description of the study design has been updated to remove the projected 
number of RSV seasons that the trial could span. The sentence “continuing for up 
to 4 consecutive RSV seasons in each hemisphere” has been removed. 
The word “inclusive” has been removed when specifying the target age range for 
study maternal subjects, ie, 18 to 40 years of ag e.  
Justification:  The study duration is now specified in terms of enrollment rather 
than time, to allow adjustment of duration if needed based on enrollment rate.  The 
removal of “inclusive” is intended to clarify the intended inclusion of wom en 18 to 
40 years and zero (0) days, the upper breakpoint co-inciding with identified cut-
offs for higher risk rates in pregnancy.
Synopsis, 
Section 3.2The description of the group -sequential design strategy has been updated to reflect 
the updated primary objecti ve of efficacy. 
Details of the proposed formal interim analyses for efficacy to evaluate success in 
the primary objective have been added, which will now occur: 
after 1) approximately 4,[ADDRESS_275671]-partum follow -up; and 2) if necessary, after an additional 2,[ADDRESS_275672] -partum follow -up.
Synopsis, 
Section 3.3.1 The primary efficacy endpoint in infant subjects has been changed to accommodate 
the updated definition of medically- significant RSV LRTI. The changed endpoint 
is as follows:  
oThe presence of RSV infection confirmed by [CONTACT_229135]-PCR on respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919] (obtained within the continuous illness 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228828] ); AND

oEvidence of medical significance as defin ed by [CONTACT_46917]: 
-EITHER hypoxemia (peripheral  oxygen saturation [SpO 2] < 95%  at sea level 
or < 92%  at altitudes > 1800 meters) OR 
-Tachypnea (≥ 70 bpm in infants 0 to 59 days of age and ≥ 60 bpm in infants 
≥60 days of age). 
Section 3.4 It has been specified that the duration of the entire study is estimated to be 
approximately four years, but will be determined by [CONTACT_229136] -
sequential design and the actual enrollment rates. 
Synopsis, 
Section 5.1 Inclusion criterion defining the age at which subjects are eligible to enroll (ie, ≥ 18 
and ≤ 40 years -of-age) has been qualified with the following statement: 
connotes a lower limit of [ADDRESS_275674] illnesses will cease 
after D+180, and that respi[INVESTIGATOR_228907]/guardians 
after this time point will be captured as AEs.
Synopsis, 
Section 6.2RSV surveillance r ules have been updated with the  following:
The language describing the window for the study staff to re-evaluate all infant 
subjects with RSV-suspect illnesses has been modified from “24 to 48 hours” to 
“between 2 and 3 days” of any initial RSV surveillan ce visit.  
The following additional rules have been added: 
Newly -discovered RSV-suspect illnesses as assessed by [CONTACT_46917] “trigger 
symptoms” will precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a home or clinic visit for evaluation. 
Study staff will re-evaluate (at home or in the clinic) all infant subjects with RSV-
suspect illnesses between [ADDRESS_275675] illness reported during passive surveillance 
but after D+180 days will be captured as AEs and not on the RSV Surveillance 
page. 
It has been clarified that whenever symptoms of a new respi[INVESTIGATOR_228908], 
or ongoing symptoms worsen, for both infant and maternal subjects, study staff 
should be contact[CONTACT_11252] 3 days of symptom onset/worsening. 
Justification:  It has been noted over the first two years of the study that a number 
of cases of medically- significant RSV L RTI are being evaluated by [CONTACT_229137], but then are being admitted to 
RSV F Vaccine Confidential RSV -M-301 Protocol

Location of 
ChangeChange/Modifica tion in Version 9.0
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 2-3 days later – at which time study assessments are not completed. In 
order to rectify this situation, a follow -up evaluati on of subjects who present with 
RSV -suspect illnesses will be added, and parents will further be encouraged to 
report worsening illnesses to the study sites.   
Synopsis, 
Section 6.2.3Additional procedures have been outlined for the study staff to increa se efficiency 
and completeness in capturing study endpoints, including tachypnea, during RSV 
surveillance. The study staff are instructed to perform the following procedures 
during a surveillance visit , specifically for symptomatic infants : 
Measure the respi[INVESTIGATOR_228776] (if possible) for all symptomatic infants. 
The measurement should be performed first, on a calm, infant, and should be 
performed by [CONTACT_228995] (i.e., without stethoscope auscultation) for a full, 
timed one min ute period. 
-If the result is ≥ 60 bpm in an infant 0 to 59 days age or ≥ 50 bpm in an infant 
≥ 60 days of age, a second timed one minute count should be obtained. 
-If a second count is obtained, the lower of the two observations should be 
recorded. 
Measu re the SpO 2 via pulse oximetry (using study -specific pulse oximeter) for all 
symptomatic infants, which is to be performed when the infant is calm and not 
crying, and before administration of oxygen supplementation. The lowest stable 
SpO 2observed during a one minute measure should be recorded. 
The study staff will perform the following additional procedures for all 
symptomatic subjects (including maternal and infant): 
Review and confirm the history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], including the approximate 
date of first symptom onset. 
Perform an examination of the symptomatic infant subject to ascertain, by 
[CONTACT_229138], the presence of the LRTI manifestations listed in 
Table 3of the protocol .
Collect vital signs other than respi [INVESTIGATOR_697] (heart rate, blood pressure [if 
available for the infant ], and axillary body temperature) for the symptomatic 
subject.
In addition, the section specifies collection of a mid-turbinate swab for RSV 
detection by [CONTACT_937]-PCR and completion of vital signs. The section has been 
reorganized to maintain relevance to RSV illness trigger symptoms; and also to 
conform to new instructional materials concerning the evaluation which will be 
distributed to site staff. Guidelines pertaining to follow up of subjects with RSV 
suspect illness have been presented in a new section numbered 6.2.[ADDRESS_275676] for tachypnea.  Measurement 
of tachypnea has been removed from Table 3, which describes features of LRTI, 
and is now captured within the body text of Section 6.2.3; consistent with the 
revised role of tachypnea in the primary endpoint case definition.

been added: 
For symptomatic infant subjects, schedule a follow -up visit in 2 to 3 days to 
ascertain whether the illness is worsening.
The follow -up visit will include the same procedures outlined in
Section 6.2.3 .
Parents/guardians will be strongly encouraged to report any worsening 
after the follow -up visit, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which may trigger any 
number of additional follow -up visits at the investigator’s discretion. 
In the event than an infant is hospi [INVESTIGATOR_057], site staff are encouraged to 
perform a follow -up visit in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], if permissible under local 
adiministrative and ethical review procedures. 
For symptomatic maternal subjects, and for symptomatic infant subjects after the 
first follow -up visit d escribed above, a weekly contact [CONTACT_107461]/SMS will be 
performed to ascertain respi[INVESTIGATOR_228780] D+[ADDRESS_275678] returned to baseline if after t he D+180 visit. 
In the event new and/or worsening symptoms are reported during active or passive 
follow -up, an in-clinic or home RSV-surveillance visit may be scheduled at the 
investigator’s discretion for an evaluation to occur as soon as possible and a re-
evaluation as per Section 6.2.3, may be performed.
At the investigator’s discretion, collection of ONE more respi[INVESTIGATOR_228909]. Note that no more than [ADDRESS_275679] is associated with a

Section 8.3.1The following guidance regarding the safety reporting of ASQ abnormalities has 
been added:
As a guidance, and solely for the purposes of consistency within this protocol, it is 
suggested that investigators report ASQ abnormalities which persist at 6 and 12
months in a given infant as an AE that is “moderate” in severity.  If diagnostic 
developmental testing is undertaken, the event should be further classified as a 
medically -attended event (MAE, see 8.4).  If diagnostic evaluation, during the trial 
or after ward, leads to the diagnosis of a persistent developmental disability, the

event then also becomes a serious adverse event (SAE, see Section 8.5) as should 
be reported as such. 
It has been specified that assessment for infants born prematurely may use age-
appropriate adjusted scoring.
Section 8.[ADDRESS_275680] five clinicians to include 
not less than 2 obstetricians (with at least one with expertise in high -risk obstetrics 
or maternal -fetal medicine) and not less than 2 pediatricians (at least one 
neon atologist), and the unblinded DBMB statistician. 
Synopsis, 
Section 10.1When defining the intent -to-treat efficacy and intent -to-treat immunogenicity study 
populations, the statements “subjects will be analyzed according to treatment as 
actually receive” have been deleted. 
Synopsis , 
Section 10.4.1 Study definition for RSV LRTI has been changed throughout the protocol by 
[CONTACT_229139] “tachypnea at rest” and of the “presence of an acute RSV infection of 
the lower airways and/or lungs manifesting as one or more of cough, nasal flaring, 
or difficulty breathing.” The updated definition of RSV LRTI is presented below: 
Confirmed RSV LRTI will feature a detection of RSV in respi[INVESTIGATOR_228866]-PCR and at least one of the following clinical manifestations observed and 
documented by [CONTACT_228955] -trained study staff: cough, nasal flaring, lower chest 
wall indrawing, subcostal retractions, abnormal breath sounds (inclusive of 
stridor, rales, rhonchi, wheezing, and crackles/crepi[INVESTIGATOR_814]); and/or observed 
apnea.
“RSV LRTI with hypoxemia” has been replaced with “medically -significant RSV -
LRTI,” which now is defined by [CONTACT_229140] -significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_228912]. The new definition 
of me dically -significant RSV -LRTI is presented below: 
An RSV LRTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_228740] a resting peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2)
< 95% at sea level or < 92% at altitudes > 1800 meters by [CONTACT_229141] ≥ 70 breaths per minute [bpm ] in an infant 0 to 59 
days of age, or ≥ 60 bpm in infant ≥ 60 days of age.

The trial may stop for success after one of two formal interim analyses occurring: 
-After 3,000 cumulati ve actively -immunized maternal subjects immunized with 
investigational vaccine (approximately 4,600 total maternal subjects in both 
study arms) and their infants have completed at least [ADDRESS_275682]-partum 
follow -up, or 
-After approximately 2,000 additional maternal subjects and their infants 
(approximately 6,600 maternal- infant pairs total) have completed at least 
6months of post -partum follow -up.  
Alternatively, the trial may achieve success after a final analysis undertaken when 
the projected total of approximately 8,[ADDRESS_275683] 90 days of life of the infant subjects and will be 
based on the posterior probability of success. Should success be declared, the 
sequential analyses of the co-primary endpoints concerning efficacy through 120, 
150, and 180 days, as well as all secondary and exploratory analyses, will be 
performed on the final dataset.
In view of differing global regulatory requirements, the final analysis (whenever 
this occurs) will be carried out sequentially while maintaining Type I Error rate at 
no more than 1-sided 2.5% level, to address primary hypotheses concerning the 
posterior probability that the event ratio, r= πv / πp, is less than 1.0, and based on 
success in that test, the posterior probability that the event ratio, r= πv / πp, is less 
than or equal to 0.70.

immunized maternal subjects and their infants (approximately 4,600 mother -infant 
pairs in total) be included in the first formal interim. 
Further specifications have been provided for the conduct of formal interim 
analyses. 
Section 10.10.2The section has been inserted to indicate that the Sponsor may trigger the 
performance of an informational analysis of efficacy as defined in the SAP. This 
analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_228953] a manner 
entirely analogous to the analyses for efficacy and futility, and will address a 
success criterion to be specified in the SAP. The DSMB will communicate the 
results of the analysis to the Sponsor only in terms of fulfillment or non-fulfillment 
of the target criterion.

The following is a summary of the changes made to this protocol.
Location of Change Change/Modification in Version 8.0
Synopsis (Study Design); 
Section 3.1Further clarified the permissive timing of ma ternal subject enrollment 
and immunization, and how this will be consistently determined for 
each maternal subject based on their estimated date of delivery and in 
consideration of the historic average onset and end date of increased 
RSV transmission at each study site.  The reader is referred to the 
Study Operations Manual for further details.
Section 3.[ADDRESS_275688] treatment 
assignment in the event of a medical emergency. The revised text now 
states, “If feasible, the investigator is asked to notify the Medical 
Monitor or designee prior to unblinding; however, the investigator 
may unblind without consulting the Medical Monitor, if it is deemed 
to be in the best interest of the subject. ”
Synopsis (Inclusio n 
Criteria); Section 5.1Inclusion criterion #2 now contains the gestational age dating

IC#2 sub-bullets (a) through (d), which already reflected current 
guidelines established by [CONTACT_229143] (ACOG) for gestational age dating [Committee on 
Obstetric Practice 2014 ], were modified to provide further clarity.  
The requirement to enroll and immunize maternal subjects with an 
estimated date of delivery between approximately six (6) weeks before 
and approximately four (4) weeks after the historic average date of 
onset of increased RSV transmission at the clinical site was removed 
as an inclusion criterion .
Synopsis (Exclusion 
Criteria); Section 5.2Removed the text, “including know n sickle trait or thalassemias” from 
exclusion criterion ( EC)#7.

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  A Prospective, Multi-Center, Single -Arm, Real World  Study Assessing the 
Clinical Use of the Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device for Arterial 
Embolization in the Peripheral Vasculature  
Sponsor:  Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  
[ADDRESS_554147]  
Tempe, AZ [ZIP_CODE] , [LOCATION_003]  
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the performance and 
safety  of the Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device when used for 
arterial embolization in the peripheral vasculature in a real world, on- label 
application . 
Design:  The post-market  study is a prospective, multi -center, single -arm, real world  
study of the Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization D evice . Follow -up for all 
treated subjects will be performed at  [ADDRESS_554148]-Index Procedure . 
Study Device : The Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device  (Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Micro  and 
Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™) is a self-expanding arterial  occlusion plug, intended for arterial 
embolization in the peripheral vasculature. The device is  intended to be a 
permanent implant and consist s of the following com ponents : a cobalt -
chrome stem, nickel -titanium fibers, platinum -iridium radiopaque marker 
bands and a  polyurethane and polyethylene occlusion membrane.  
  
The Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device  is packaged as a single unit 
with the implant, loader, di spenser hoop , detachable delivery  wire and 
torque tool. The device  is intended for single -use only within a specific 
arterial vessel size range and does  not require over sizing . The available 
sizes, product characteristics, intended arterial vessel diameter range and 
required delivery catheter size (inner diameter  (ID)) are provided in the 
Instructions for Use ( IFU).   
Enrollment:  Enrollment will continue until up to fifty (50)  subjects have been treated with 
the Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device.  
Study Sites: Up to 20  investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Study 
Population:  Male or non -pregnant female subjects ≥18 years of age who require arterial 
embolization in the peripheral vasculature.  
Primary  
Endpoints:  Primary Performance Endpoint : 
Technical Success  
Successful  occlusion  of the target embolization  site(s) as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_437321]. Technical success will be reported for each target 
embolization site.   
Primary Safety Endpoint:  
Freedom from Device- Related Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Freedom  from device -related serious adverse events (SAE) through 
30-day follow- up.

Secondary 
Endpoints:  Time Point of Occlusion

≤4, ≤5, ≤10 and >[ADDRESS_554150]-treatment.  
Freedom from Recanalization  
Freedom from clinically relevant recanalization of the target embolization  
site(s) through 30-days, 6 and 12-months  follow- up as confirmed by [CONTACT_3786]. Clinically relevant recanalization is defined as rec analization 
through the study device that requires a re- intervention. Freedom from 
recanalization will be reported for each target embolization site. 
 
Freedom from Migration 
Freedom from Migration will be reported for each study device as follows:  
• Freedom from clinically relevant acute migration of the study 
device(s) as confirmed by [CONTACT_437322]. Clinically relevant 
migration is defined as migration of the study device from the target 
embol ization  site that requires intervention.  
• Freedom from clinically relevant migration of the study device(s) through 30-days, 6 and 12-months  follow- up as confirmed by [CONTACT_3786]. Clinically relevant migration is defined as migration of the study devic e from the target embolization site that requires a re-
intervention.  
 
Freedom from Device and/or Procedure- Related Adverse Events  
Freedom from device and/or procedure- related adverse events (AE) 
through 30-days, 6 and 12- months  follow- up. 
 
Accuracy of Delivery  
Accurate delivery of the study device  to the target embolization site as 
assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
 
Ease of Trackability/Deliverability  
Ease of study device  trackability  and deliverability  as assessed by [CONTACT_3786].  
 
Ease of Detachment  
Ease of study device detachment as assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
 
Acceptability  of Visibility  
Acceptability of study device visibility under fluoroscopy  as assessed by 
[CONTACT_737].

Inclusion 
Criteria:  Clinical Inclusion Criteria  
1. Subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must voluntarily 
sign and date the approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to 
collection of study -specific data or performance of study -specific  
procedures.  
2. Subject must be either male or non -pregnant female ≥[ADDRESS_554152] require peripheral vascular occlusion  at an arterial  
target embolization  site(s) that can be treated with the Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ 
Arterial  Embolization Device according to the Instructions for Use 
(IFU). Note: Per Investigator discretion, up to five (5) Target 
Embolization Sites may be treated with up to ten (10) study devices  
per subject . 
Angiographic Inclusion Criteria  
5. The target embolization site(s) must be located in a native arterial 
vessel(s) with the intended arterial vessel diameter ranges shown in 
the IFU, as assessed by [CONTACT_737] (via visual estimate).  
6. The target embolization  site(s) must have a landing zone sufficient to 
accommodate the device implant lengths shown in the IFU.

thoracic inlet/outlet ).  
5. The subject’s target embolization site(s) is located in  a high -flow

disorder, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], woul d clinically 
interfere with the study endpoints.  
13. The subject has another medical condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], may cause him/her to be non -compliant with the 
protocol, may confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the 
collection of primary 
endpoint data . 
14. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or 
another device study that has not completed the study treatment or 
that clinically interferes with the stud y endpoints. Note: Studies 
requiring extended follow -up visits for products that were 
investigational, but have since become commercially available, are 
not considered investigational studies.  
Procedures:  All subjects will undergo an in- office clinical evaluation at the Screening 
Visit (prior to Index Procedure). Subjects that meet Eligibility Criteria will  
undergo additional in- office clinical evaluations and will be treated with the 
Caterpi[INVESTIGATOR_5778]™ Arterial  Embolization Device at the Index Procedure visit. An

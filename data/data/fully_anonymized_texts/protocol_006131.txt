Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated5 INTRODUCTION
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affec ts an estimate d 70,[ADDRESS_529264]  in the gene encoding the CF 
transmembrane conductance regula tor protein (CFTR), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_419677] (Clí)
channel activated by [CONTACT_419722] a denosine monophosphate-dependent p rotein kinase A that is 
responsible for aiding in the r egulation of salt and water abso rption and secretion in various 
tissues.2This function is defective in pa tients with CF due to a loss of  either cell surface 
expression and/or function. 
More than [ADDRESS_529265] the quantity of 
functional cell surface CFTR protein include defects that reduc e CFTR protein synthesis and 
defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFT R proteins to the cell surface.
CFTR gene mutations ass ociated with minimal CFTR function include
xmutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR  channel to open and 
close, known as defective channel gating or “gating mutations”;  
xsevere defects in the cellular  processing of CFTR and its deliv ery to the cell surface;
xno (or minimal) CFT R synthesis; and
xsevere defects in c hannel conductance.
The most prevalent mutation i s an in-frame deletion in the CFTR  gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the  CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR ).10In the [LOCATION_002] 
(US), almost 87% of patien ts with CF have at least 1 copy of th e F508del-CFTR mutation 
and about 47% have 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].11 In the European Union (EU), a pproximately 83% of patients 
with CF have 1 or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] F508del-CFTR mutation, and approx imately 38.7% of 
patients with CF in the U nited Kingdom have [ADDRESS_529266] been studied.9One approach is to treat wit h a compound that will modify the 
cellular processing and traffickin g of the CFTR protein to incr ease the amount of functional 
CFTR at the cell surface. Thi s kind of compound has been termed  a CFTR corrector. Another 
approach is to treat with a com pound that increases the channel  gating activity of protein 
kinase A-activated CFTR at the  cell surface to enhance ion tran sport. This kind of compound 
has been termed a potentiator. D epending on the amount of resid ual CFTR channel activity 
in the membrane and the pathophys iology of that activity (refle cting the CFTR genotype of 
the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be  required to ameliorate lung 
disease in patients with CF . A modest restoration of Clí secretion through the action of a 
potentiator and/or corrector coul d prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the api[INVESTIGATOR_419678], allo wing proper maintenance of air way hydration. Adequate

VX-661 is a compound developed by [CONTACT_419723] (Vertex) that has 
been shown to have CFTR corrector  properties. Several lines of in vitro evidence suggest that 
VX-661 works by [CONTACT_419724] a fraction of 
the F508del-CFTR protein during its biogenesis and processing i n the endoplasmic 
reticulum, allowing it to exit the endoplasmic r eticulum and tr affic the cell surface.16 When

(i.e., plasma membrane) F508del-CF TR was observed. The increase d trafficking of

The Safety Follow-up Visit a ssessments are listed in Table 3-2 . There will be  an outpatient 
Safety Follow-up Visit 28 days ±  [ADDRESS_529277] dose of s tudy drug for subjects who 
complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely dis continue study drug dosing. 
If the Early Treatment Termina tion (ETT) Visit occurs [ADDRESS_529278]  decides to terminate study t reatment. Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue treatme nt will also be required to comp lete the Safety Follow-up 
Visit, approximately 28 (± 7) days  after their last dose of stu dy drug. The assessments 
performed at the Safety Follow-up Visit are listed in  Table 3-[ADDRESS_529279] udy.
8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration
The dose regimen of VX-661 chose n for continued development in Phase 3 was studied in 
Study 101 in 2 CF populations: F508del-CFTR  homozygous subjects (Group 4) and 
F508del-CFTR  heterozygous subjects who had G551D-CFTR  on the other alle le (Group 7). 
The dose regimen of VX-661 100 mg qd in combination with ivacaf tor 150 mg q12h 
provided clinically meaningful a nd statistically significant im provements in percent predicted 
FEV 1 in both populations, as well as a s ignal of CFTR modulation as  assessed by [CONTACT_139375].
The dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (150 mg q1 2h) is the current approved 
dose regimen for patients with C F with gating mutations who are  aged [ADDRESS_529280] 
that is clinically demonstrate d to be ivacaftor responsive. Bas ed on the results from 
Study 101 ( Section 8.2.1 ), subjects with the F508del-CFTR  mutation on only 1 allele may 
respond to VX-661/ivacaftor combin ation therapy when the second  allele is also responsive 
to potentiator modulation. 
Patients with CF who have CFTR alleles that qualify them for  inclusion in this study may 
live in a region where ivacaftor (Kalydeco) is already approved  for patients with their 
mutations and is available for us e by [CONTACT_50246]. Because of this, it is anticipated that this 
study will enroll both subjects who have been exposed to ivacaf tor within [ADDRESS_529281] not. The intent of this s tudy is to determine if 
VX-661/ivacaftor combination thera py has additiona l benefit ove r ivacaftor monotherapy in 
this population. Subjects who have be en exposed to ivacaftor wi thin [ADDRESS_529282] an FEV 1DQG 90% of predicted normal for age, sex, and 
height at the Screening Visit . Those who have not been exposed to ivacaftor within [ADDRESS_529283] an FEV 1DQGRISUHGLFW HGQRUPDOIRUDJH
sex, and height at the Screening Visit.
The inclusion of subjects with C F who are 12 to 17 years of age  is justified based on severity 
of disease and allometric scalin g. The overall disease status f or the adolescent and adult 
populations to be enrolled in this study is anticipated to be s imilar based on the identical 
enrollment criteria, particularly the FEV 1and the requirement for c linical stability. Both 
VX-661 and ivacaftor are predominan tly eliminated by [CONTACT_419729] P450 
(CYP) 3A4 enzymatic pathway. The m aturity of the CYP enzymes in  adolescents is expected 
to be similar to adults.21 Therefore, the low likeliho od of differences in PK of VX-661 a nd 
ivacaftor between adolescents a nd adults further supports the i nclusion of adolescents in this 
study. The dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (15 0 mg q12h) is the current 
labeled dose regimen for  patients with CF with gating mutations  who are aged [ADDRESS_529284] radiogra ph abnormalities (e.g., bronchiectasis , atelectasis, infiltrates,

Sweat Chloride Data Blinding
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_419688], knowledge of the s weat chloride dat a has the potential to suggest 
whether a subject has been admin istered active study treatment or corresponding active 
control. Therefore, during the c onduct of the study, the Vertex  study team will not have 
access to the postdose sweat chl oride data; dummy data will be used to develop statistical 
programs. During the process of  locking the clin ical database a nd after all study visits have 
been completed, treatment-blinde d access to the sweat chloride data will be provided to a 
small group of individuals who are  not involved in the study. T his group, which will consist 
of a biostatistician, a  statistical programme r, a validation st atistical prog rammer, and a 
clinical reviewer, will review the sweat chloride data to ensur e there are no significant data 
issues and will use the blinded da ta set to refine the statisti cal programs.

Medications used in this study w ill be coded by [CONTACT_419741]-Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categ orized as the following:  
xPrior medication: any medication that started bef ore initial dosing of study drug  in the 
Ivacaftor Run-in Period, re gardless of when it ended. 
xConcomitant medication durin g the Ivacaftor Run-in Period : medication continued 
or newly received at or after in itial dosing of the study drug through the end of the TE 
Period for the Ivacaftor Run-in Period.  
xConcomitant medication during the  Active Comparator Treatment P eriod:
medication continued or newly rec eived at or after initial dosi ng of study drug through 
the end of the TE Period of the Ac tive Comparator Treatment Per iod. 
xPost-treatment medication:  medication continued or newl y received beyond the TE 
Period of the Active Compar ator Treatment Period.
A given medication can be classi fied as a prior medication, a c oncomitant medication 
(concomitant medication during th e Ivacaftor Run-in Period and/ or a concomitant medication 
during the Active Comparator Tr eatment Period), or a post-treat ment medication; both prior 
and concomitant; both c oncomitant and post-treatment; or prior,  concomitant, and post-
treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing sta rt/end date or time and cannot 
be determined whether  it was taken before i nitial dosing, conco mitantly, or beyond the TE 
Period, it will be considered a s prior, concomitant, and post-t reatment.
Prior medications and c oncomitant medications in the Ivacaftor Run-in Period will be

Post-treatment medications will be listed for each subject.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure and Compliance
Study drug exposure and complia nce will be summarized separatel y for the Ivacaftor Run-in 
Period and Active Comparator Trea tment Period. Exposure to stud y drug (i.e., duration of 
treatment) will be su mmarized for the Safety Set for the Ivacaf tor Run-in Per iod and the FAS 
for the Active Comparator Trea tment Period in terms of duration  of treatment a subject 
received (in days), defined as th e last day minus the first day  of study drug in the 
corresponding treatment period pl us 1, regardless of any interr uptions in dosing. Dosing 
compliance is calculated as the actual number of dosing occasio ns at which study drug was 
administered, as a percentage of  the planned number of dosing o ccasions, for the 
corresponding treatment period. D osing compliance will be summa rized for the Safety Set 
for the Ivacaftor Run-in Peri od and for the FAS f or the Active Comparator Treatment Period.

CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting
13.1.1 Adverse Events13.1.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a subjec t during the study; the 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any 
newly occurring event or worse ning of a preexisting condition ( e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious i f it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments
Study assessments including la boratory tests, ECGs, PEs, pulse oximetry, and vital signs, 
will be assessed and thos e deemed a clinical ly significant wors ening from baseline 
documented as an AE. When possibl e, a clinical diagnosis for th e study assessment will be 
provided, rather than the abnorma l test result alone (e.g., uri nary tract infection, anemia). In 
the absence of a diagnosis, the  abnormal study assessment itsel f will be listed as the AE (e.g., 
bacteria in urine or de creased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study asse ssment is considered clinically significa nt if the subject has 1 or more 
of the following: 
xConcomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study ass essment
xFurther diagnostic testing or med ical/surgical intervention
xA change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whe ther the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant crite ria. The determination of 
whether the study assessment results are clinically significant  will be made by [CONTACT_1275].
A laboratory value that is Grad e [ADDRESS_529361] indic ates a life-threatening AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the  following time points:
xFor subjects who do not enroll: un til time of screen failure (e .g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
xFor enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: throug h the Safety Follow-up 
Visit
Protocol VX14-661-109, Version 4.[ADDRESS_529362] a Safety Follow-up Visit:  the earliest of

oThe ETT Visit, if that visit is [ADDRESS_529363] dose of study drug 
(Section 8.1.5 )
oprior to the first dose of stu dy drug in the extension study  
All subjects will be queried, us ing non-leading questions, abou t the occurrence of AEs at 
each study visit. When possible , a constellation of signs and/o r symptoms will be identified 
as [ADDRESS_529364]'s source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE: 
xDescription of the event 
xClassification of “seri ous” or “nonserious” 
xDate of first occurrence and date  of resolution (if applicable)  
xSeverity
xCausal relationship to study drug(s)  
xAction taken  
xOutcome 
xConcomitant medication or  other treatment given
xIndication of dose limiting toxicity
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. 
The guidance available at the f ollowing website will be consult ed: Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy  Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm (Accessed 
August 2012). AEs of CTCAE Grade s 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” In 
considering the severity of an A E in a pediatric subject, the i nvestigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric c linical laboratory parameters m ay differ from those given in 
the CTCAE. The severity of an A E that does not appear in the CT CAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1 .

investigator, at immediate risk of death
AE: adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Causality
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_419753], if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality w ill be classified using the categ ories presented in Table 13-2.
Table 13-[ADDRESS_529365] been ruled out, and/or the event re-appeared on re-ex posure to the 
investigational study drug.
Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administratio n of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism f or the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be al ternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the s ubject’s clinical status or und erlying disease.
Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational stud y drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug. 
Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigatio nal study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).
AE: adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with  regard to the AE. The action 
taken will be classified accordin g to the categories shown in Table 13-[ADDRESS_529366] to an AE

disruption of a person's abilit y to conduct normal life functio ns) 
xCongenital anomaly or birth defect 
xImportant medical event that , based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medi cal or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an a llergic bronchospasm requiring intensiv e treatment in an 
emergency room or at home) 
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g. surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject si gned the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419712], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419713], unless an A E caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419714] d relative to what was planned. In addi tion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419715] (e.g ., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419716]) should not 
be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be m ade between the terms  “serious” and “sev ere,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the int ensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or s evere myocardial infarction. T he event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical s ignificance, such as a severe h eadache. This is not the same 
as “serious,” which is based on s ubject/event outcome or action  described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject' s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining exped ited regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs that occur after obtai ning informed c onsent and assent  (where applicable) through 
the Safety Follow-up Visit, reg ardless of causality, will be re ported by [CONTACT_139409]. In addition, all SAEs t hat occur after the Safety F ollow-up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug (s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours .
SAEs will be recorded on the Verte x Organized Safety Informatio n Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE  Form”) using a recognized me dical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. S AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_419754]14-661-109, Version 4.[ADDRESS_529367] (if applicable), befo re study participation. The me thod of obtaining and 
documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and  the contents of the consent 
will comply with ICH GCP and all a pplicable laws and regulation s and will be subject to 
approval by [CONTACT_139411]. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_529368] the safety of the  subjects, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific  quality of the study (i.e., ef ficacy assessments) will require 
IRB/IEC notification before imple mentation, except where the mo dification is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate  hazard to human subjects. Verte x will submit all protocol 
modifications to the required regulatory authorities.
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedur es set forth in the 
protocol, the investigator will c ontact Vertex to discuss the p lanned course of action. If 
possible, contact [CONTACT_419755]. Any departures 
from protocol will be fully doc umented in the source documentat ion and in a protocol 
deviation log. 
13.2.4 Access to Records
The investigator will make the o ffice and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] o f subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_419756]. The records will also be available for direct i nspection, verification, and 
copying, as required by [CONTACT_774], by [CONTACT_419757] (FDA and others). The  investigator will comply with  applicable privacy and 
security laws for use and disc losure of informa tion related to the research set forth in this 
protocol. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_529369] confidentialit y, all electronic case report  forms (eCRFs), study reports, 
and communications relating to t he study will identify subjects  by [CONTACT_776]. 
As required by [CONTACT_17926], the investigator will allow  Vertex and/or its 
representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allo w for the verification of data 
gathered in the eCRFs/SAE Forms and the review of the data coll ection process. The FDA 
(or other regulatory authority) may also request access to all study records, including source 
documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance wit h the Health Insurance Portabil ity and Accountability Act 
and associated privacy regulati ons, a subject authorization to use personally identifiable 
health information may be requi red from each subject before res earch activities begin. This 
authorization document will clear ly specify which parties will have access to a subject's
personal health infor mation, for what purpos e, and for how long . 
13.2.[ADDRESS_529370] Retention
The investigator will maintain all study records according to IC H GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requi rement(s), whichever is longes t, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the respons ibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_419717]14-661-109, Version 4.0 Page 73 of 81

investigation is conducted accordin g to the protocol design and  regulatory requirements. 
13.[ADDRESS_529372]. It is the investigator's responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness o f the data reported in the 
subject's eCRFs. Source documen tation supporting the eCRF data will indicate the subject's 
participation in the study and w ill document the dates and deta ils of study procedures, AEs, 
other observations, and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated r epresentative, will complete t he eCRFs as soon as possible 
after information is collected. 
The audit trail entry will show  the user's identification infor mation and the da te and time of 
any correction. The investigator m ust provide for mal approval o f all the information in the 
eCRFs, including any changes ma de to the eCRFs , to endorse the final submitted da ta for the 
subjects for whom the inves tigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the eCRF da ta and corresponding audit trails . A copy of the final archival 
eCRFs in the form of a compact  disc or other electronic media w ill be placed in the

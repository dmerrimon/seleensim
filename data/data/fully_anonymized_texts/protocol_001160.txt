RESEARCH SCHEMA  
 
PHASE IV  CLINICAL ACTIVITY/SAFETY  
1. Patients will be screened, and influenza polymerase chain reaction positive patients  ages [ADDRESS_36858] (SambucolR) or Pl acebo [ADDRESS_36859] of care oseltamivir or baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza ) treatment.  
3. Daily telephone questionnaires documenting compliance, symptoms, and side effects will be 
obtained until patients are  completely  recovered from influenza  for [ADDRESS_36860] been prescribed  or offered a pr escription 
for oseltamivir  or baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) . 
A recent evidence -based systematic review by [CONTACT_36960] e relief for 
the symptoms of influenza.(1-4)  The fact all previously published elderberry extract  supplementation  
studies have been small, did not have intent -to-treat analysis, and were not published in high impact 
journals  probably helps explain why th eir findings have not been generally recognized by [CONTACT_36961] -public.  
The “CDC estimates that influenza in the [LOCATION_002] has resulted in between 9.2 million and 60.8 
million illnesses, between 140,000 and 710,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36948] 12,000 and 56 ,000 deaths 
annually since 2010 . (5)   If elderberry extract  supplementation  is shown  to be associated with 
improvement of symptoms of influenza there could be a  beneficial impact on health in the [LOCATION_002] 
and the world.

Part 4.pdf  
1.3 Preclinical data  
A recent review of elderberry describes its potential mechanisms of action.   Elderberry has been reported 
“to modulate the inflammatory cytokines IL -1 and TNF -alpha in vitro, increase human basophil secretion 
of IL -4, IL -13, and histamine, inhibit macrophage release of proinflammatory cytokines, and contain 
flavonoids reported to p ossess antioxidant activity.(1)” Sambucol ® inhibits influenza A and B , HIV,  and 
herpes simplex in vitro and in a randomized, placebo -controlled trial was associated with increased 
hemagglutination inhibition titers to i nfluenza B infections in vivo.(1,2,6)   
A small study showed chimpanzees supplemented with prophylactic Sambucol ® 10 ml once daily for 
approximately six months had less than 1/3 the days of flu -like symptoms compared with a placebo 
supplemented group. (7) When symptoms occurred the dosage was  increased to 15 ml twice daily, and the 
duration of illnesses were twice as long in the placebo group compared to the Sambucol ® supplemented 
group.(7)  
Another review of the antiviral properties of black elder products states, Sambucus nigra  (black elder)  
flowers have been approved by [CONTACT_36963] E of the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical 
Devices for the treatment of viral infections, but other parts of the plant have not.  While the fruit is not 
on the FDA GRAS (generally recognized as safe, a s the flowers are) list or approved by [CONTACT_36964] E, analysis of flowers and cooked fruit have consistently indicated safety; other parts of the 
plant are less suitable for use.”(6)  Sambucol ® uses only cooked fruit from the black elderberry pla nt. 
 
 
Elderberry Extract in Patients with Influenza v.[ADDRESS_36861] supplementation versus 
placebo (p<0.001 in both studies)(2,3)   
Another trial evaluated 64 patients with three or more of the following “flu -like symptoms”: fever, 
headache, muscle aches, coughing, na sal mucus discharge, and nasal congestion. (4) By 48 hours of 
supplementation, “9 patients (28%) in the elderberry extract supplemented group were void of all 
symptoms, 19 patients (60%) showed complete relief from some symptoms, and had only one or two mi ld 
symptoms” (1/10 on a visual analogue scale).  No patient in the placebo group achieved complete 
recovery , and only 5 patients (16%) showed improvement in one or two symptoms (p<0.001 for all 
symptoms).  Most patients in the placebo group remained the sa me or worsened over the [ADDRESS_36862] evaluated supplementation before, during and after air -travel in 312 
passengers.(8)  More cold epi[INVESTIGATOR_36949] (17 vs. 12) but that did not r each 
statistical significance (p=0.4).  “Placebo group participants had a significantly longer duration of cold 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_36950] 117 vs.57, p=0.02) and the average symptom score over these days was also significantly 
higher (583 vs. 247, p=0.05).”  
A fifth stud y, by A. Rao and L. Vitetta, entitled “A prospective, double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a complementary medicine formulation, to help 
reduce duration and severity of cold and flu symptoms in otherwise  healthy adults”, with a goal of 
enrolling 120 cold and 80 flu epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], completed enrollment in Australia on 5/22/2017.  Preliminary 
results shared by [CONTACT_36965], Ph.D. of PharmaCare®  in Australia were, “Cold and Influenza relief: 
cold and influenza duration reduced by 30% (3 day equiv). Symptom severity 35% reduction (participants 
felt better, faster) using 15mL 4x daily.”    
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
The route of administratio n, dosage, dosage regimen, and dosage period rationale is based upon two 
previous studies using Sambucol®  supplementation for influenza . (2, 3). Sambucol®  supplementation 
decreased duration of symptoms by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_36863] been twenty -six years of cl inical experience 
with Sambucol®  as an over -the-counter supplement now available on six continents, with 21 years 
availability in the [LOCATION_002].  There are no reported serious adverse e ffects, and dosage 
recommendations outside the [LOCATION_002] are available for ages 2 and above 
(http://www.cpginteractive.com/sam/faqs.html ) and for ages 5 and above in the [LOCATION_002].  Subjec ts’ risks 
under this protocol are minimal, and the potential benefits to the subjects and society are great.

3.2 Study Endpoints  
Baseline data will be obtained at time of presentation including eligibility criteria, medical history, and 
current influenza symptoms.   
Symptoms will be recorded using the scoring system described in a meta -analysis of “all published and 
unpublished Roch e-sponsored randomized placebo -controlled, double -blind trials of oseltamivir treatment 
in adult influenza” (9).  “The primary outcome will be time to alleviation of all symptoms.  Seven 
influenza symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches and p ains, fatigue, headaches, and chills 
or sweats)” will be graded by [CONTACT_36966] “absent” (0), “mild” (1), “moderate” (2), or “severe” (3).  
Alleviation will be defined to arise when all symptoms scored as absent or mild, and remain so for at least 
21.5 hour s.”  The secondary endpoints will be the time to alleviation and to complete resolution of 
individual and all symptoms.   Patients will be followed daily until all symptoms have completely 
resolved and fever has remained less than 100 ° F for [ADDRESS_36866] not yet completely resolved for 24 hours.  
3.3 Primary Safety Endpoints   
The conditions or  symptoms  that will be  recorded  from day of presentation until influenza symptoms are 
resolved  includ e; dry mouth,  bad taste, nausea, vomiting  diarrhea,  constipation,  abdominal pain ,, rash, 
difficulty breathing, decreased drinking , dizziness  and any  other symptoms not previously recorded  under 
study endpoints as outlined above .  Patient symptoms  and severity of illness will be monitored daily using 
the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult  and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE 
GRADING TABLE).  See appendix one for all case report forms.  Study patients will be asked to call for 
any worsening influenz a symptoms or new condit ions or symptoms  reaching Grade [ADDRESS_36867] SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL

6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Pre-registration and Screening  
If patients are eligible and interested in partic ipating we will review the informed consent with them, and 
their families if necessary, and obtain written informed consent or assent, depending upon patients’ ages.  
6.2 Visit 1  
Visit 1 will be completed at the same visit for registration and screening.   A nasopharyngeal swab will be 
obtained for [COMPANY_002]R cobasR LiatR PCR assays for influenza A&B prior to enrollment in study to confirm 
all study patients have documented influenza .  
Informed consent, and assent when indicated, will be obtained prior to completing any study related 
assessments. Eligibility for the study will be confirmed and baseline data will be obtained.   
All women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnan cy test before starting and upon completion 
of the study.  Pregnancy tests will be done following standard Cleveland Clinic operating procedures and 
documented in the electronic medical record, the case report forms and REDCap Cloud.  The result of the 
pregnancy test (s) will be disc losed to the minor subject and  their parent(s)/legal guardian.  
Patients will be instructed on how to return unused study medication in the provided stamped envelope 
addressed to the study coordinator , and for women  of childbearin g potential  how to obtain an end of study 
pregnancy test  at the most convenient Cleveland Clinic laboratory.  
Patients will be given their randomly assigned study medication and instructed to give [ADDRESS_36877] dose of study medication prior to 
leaving the emergency room.  
Patients will be asked to please avoid taking any additional cold  or influenza medications if possible.  
They will be told they may take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain or fever. They will be asked to 
report daily all medications taken not reported on their day 1 visit.  Taking additional medications will not 
disqua lify patients from the study  other than taking prescription antibiotics or antivirals prior to the start 
of the study . 
Patients will receive daily phone calls to remind them to take each dose of their study medication and to 
answer their daily surveys  (see Appendix 1) .  All patients who do not answer their daily surveys on the 
first call, will receive two additional phone call attempts to have the survey answered.

[ADDRESS_36882] is responsible to assess changes in risk to ensure  safety protections of human 
subjects.  
An Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Participants or Others  is any event  that (1) is 
unforeseen, (2) caused harm or placed a person at i ncreased risk of harm, and  (3) is related to the research 
procedures.  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence, including  any abnormal 
sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding),  symptoms, or disease. Adverse events 
can encompass both physical and psychological  harms.  
An Internal Adverse Event (AE) is an untoward medical occurrence, which occurs to  participants in 
research conducted by [CONTACT_36979]/or Cleveland Clinic is the IRB  of record.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse experience that results in any of the  following outcomes:  
o death  
o a life -threatening experience  
o inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
o a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or  
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience  when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize th e patient  or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the  
outcomes listed in this definition.  
An Unexpected Adverse Event means any AE not previously known or included in the  current 
Investigator’s Brochure, consent form o r other risk information.  
Related/Possibly Related means there must be reasonable evidence to suggest the event  was caused by 
[CONTACT_33641], device or investigational intervention.

or 4 side effects (First calling 911 for Grade 4 side effects and contact[CONTACT_36980]) 
Patients will then be triaged as appropriate to their primary medical provider or urgent or emergency care 
facilities.  Information on all adver se events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and 
also in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will also be recorded in the so urce document.  
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study 
treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event will be reported to the study investigator/sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of 
the event.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by [CONTACT_36981], [CONTACT_36995] within 24 hours. The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form 
on file at the study site.  Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_36982]: Michael Macknin 216 -
445-4876, 216 -445-3523 respectively.   
At the time of the i nitial report, the following information will be provided:  
 Study Identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject Number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current Status  
 Whether study supplement was discontinued  
 Reason why the event is classified as serious  
 Investig ator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
 
Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events will be provided promptly to the study 
sponsor . 
8.3.1 IRB Notification by [CONTACT_16473] ( including follow -up information) will be submitted to the CCF IRB 
per the guidelines located in the CCF IRB Standard Operating Procedures under IRB -60 in manual. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_36951].  
The following four types of events will be reported to the Cleveland Clinic IRB:  
 
Elderberry Extract in Patients with Influenza v.11 -8-2018  Page 18 of 31 
 1. Adverse events which are serious, unexpected, and related or possibly related to participation 
in the research.  
2. Serious adverse events that are expected in some subjects, but are determined to be occurring 
at a significantly higher frequency or severity than expected.  
3. Other unexpected adverse events, regardless of severity, that may alter IRB analysis of the 
risk v ersus potential benefit of the research and, as a result, warrant consideration of 
substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document.  
4. Unanticipated Problems  involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing  
noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB.”  
8.3.2 FDA Notification by [CONTACT_2728] (if applicable)  
The study investigator/sponsor shall notify the FDA by [CONTACT_36983] -threatening experience associated with the use of the supplement as soon as 
possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the sponsor’s original receipt of the information.  
If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the criteria for 
reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a written report to the FDA as soon as 
possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_36884]’s safety. If unblinding study supplement on a subject is deemed necessary, 
the study biostatistician will unblind the subject and documentati on of this in the subject’s source 
document will be completed.   In most cases, the unblinding will be part of managing an SAE, and will be 
reported with the SAE, however, in cases where unblinding was not associated with an SAE, such actions 
should be rep orted in a timely manner. We will use the same timeline requirements for investigator 
reporting of SAEs, (notification of sponsor within 24 hours by [CONTACT_36984], followed by a written 
narrative of the event within 48 hours.)  
8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_36952] . 
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_36953]/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted abo ve, as 
well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 
Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the 
number and type of serious adverse events.  
8.[ADDRESS_36885], will be withdrawn from the study with  ongoing follow -up of symptoms until the 
patient’s acute symptoms resolve.  
If patients become too ill to tolerate oral study medication they will be withdrawn from the study with 
ongoing follow -up of symptoms until the patient’s acute symptoms resolve.

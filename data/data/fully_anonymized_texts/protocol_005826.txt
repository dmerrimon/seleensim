Description of Intervention : 
Normothermic EVLP for extended preservation, assessment and transplantation of donor lungs.   
Study  Title : 
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Open -Label Study to Measure the Safety of Extending Preservation and Assessment 
Time of Donor Lungs Using Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion and Ventilation (EVLP) as Administered by 
[CONTACT_282285]:  
PXUS 14 -001 
Study Type :  Traditional Feasibility  
Primary Objective (s):  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving a lung transplant, 
where the lung(s) was perfused by [CONTACT_282286] T oronto EVLP System (T ES). Assessment of Primary 
Graft Dysfunction ( PGD) Grade [ADDRESS_344146] -transplant ( T72) and 30- day mortality will represent the 
outcome measures, and the primary endpoints are the fol lowing two measures:  
• The proportion of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s with PGD  Grade 3 (PGD3) assessed at T72  
• 30-day mortality post -transplant.  
 The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control group to provide 
context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.
 
Secondary Objective (s): 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the short -term safety of subjects receiving a lung transplant 
where the lung(s) has been perfused via the TES performed by [CONTACT_282287]:  
• PGD S core (Grades 0 -3) measured at 0, 24, [ADDRESS_344147] -transplant  
• Time to first extubation  
• Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), measured as total number of days post -transplant in the ICU 
until first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], inclusive of ICU readmissions during that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282206] -transplant  
• Total preservation time (TPT), defined as the elapsed time between first allograft lung removal from cold 
storage  time prior to transplant in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282207]  
• Assessment of the overall safety of TES lung transplants during subject's participation in the study, as 
reported through adverse events (AEs).  
 
The above information will also be collected on patients enrolled in a contemporaneous control group to provide 
context for EVLP results and to inform control measures for future research.  
 
Study Design : 
This is a Phase 2, unblinded, non -randomized, traditional feasibility study to evaluate the safety of subjects 
undergoing lung transplant using lungs after EVLP, and performed exclusively by [CONTACT_282288]’s 
facility using the Toronto EVLP Syst em (TES).  
 
Once the donor lung is accepted following EVLP, the eligible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], who has provided written informed 
consent, and receives the lung transplant, is enrolled into the study. Patients who consent for the current EVLP

Confidential  Page 4 of 89 study (PXUS 14 -001) but receive a conventional (i.e., non -EVLP) lung transplant will be considered for a 
contemporaneous control group matched to the EVLP treatment group ( 66 subjects each). This matching will take 
place on a patient -by-patient basis and only after an  EVLP subjec t has been enrolled  at that Study Center . 
Investigators and their team will be notified by [CONTACT_17190] a real -time basis of the specific matching criteria 
required for a control subject as EVLP subjects are enrolled. In order to be considered for eligib ility, the control 
patient must “match” a priori to at least one EVLP subject who has already been enrolled at that Study Center 
based on the following criteria:  SLT versus DLT  and Lung Allocation Score Disease Diagnosis Group 
(LASDDG) . 
The post -intervent ion phase of the study will then be split into two phases:  1) the Analysis Phase, which includes 
follow -up within one year post -intervention and 2) Long -term Follow -up, which will capture outcome data 
annually from [ADDRESS_344148] has his/her study visit at [ADDRESS_344149]’s PGD Score will be recorded every 24 hrs for the next 72 hrs. The ICU disc harge date will 
be documented. Study visits will occur 30 days (±5), 90 days (±10), 6 months (±2 weeks), and 1 year (±4 weeks) post-transplant. Study assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 , Table 
3). 
 
Long -term Follow -up 
Although the database will be locked and analyses of endpoints performed after the last subject has his/her study 
visit at [ADDRESS_344150] specified outcome parameters that are required to be reported 
by [CONTACT_282289]/ United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Collection will be annually for [ADDRESS_344151] -intervention; outcome collection is outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1, Table 4 ). 
 
Study Population :  
The study will be open to all eligible male and female patients, aged 18 years or older, with end -stage lung 
disease listed for lung transplantation at a participating Study Center. These participants may not be receiving mechanical ventilation, ECMO or ECLS, at the time of initial lung offer prior to EVLP.  
 A sample size of 132  subjects, receiving either SLT or DLT, is planned for this study, where 66 subjects receive 
donor lung(s ) after EVLP (EVLP Group) and 66  subjects are in a contemporaneous control group (Control 
Group). No more than two -thirds of the subjects who are enrolled (4 4 subjects per group) will have received a 
single -lung transplant (SLT) or double -lung transplant (DLT).  
 
Subject (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) Inclusion Criteria  
 
Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male or f emale patients.  
2. All patients, [ADDRESS_344152] for a single or bilateral lung transplant.  
4. Patient or patient’s representative provides informed consent for participation in the study prior to 
participating in any study -related assessments or procedures . 
5. Patient or patient’s representative reconfirms informed consent for the study on the day of lung transplant if 
initial consent is > [ADDRESS_344153] (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) Exclusion Criteria

Confidential  Page 5 of 89 Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:  
1. Patients listed for same -side lung re -transplantation.  
2. Patients listed for multiple organ transplantation including lung and any other organ.  
3. Patients listed for live donor lobar transplant.  
4. Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus, active Hepatitis B or C, or Burkholderia cepacia  
infection.  
5. Patients in the ICU at the time of the initial lung offer requiring venti lation, ECMO or other extracorporeal 
life support (ECLS). [Note: The decision to place the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282208] -transplant 
prophylaxis at time of or immediately prior to transplant is not considered an exclusion]  
6. Patient receives a conv entional (non -EVLP) lung transplant but does NOT match to an EVLP subject based 
on the criteria for control matching outlined above . 
 
Study Intervention :  
EVLP is a novel technology that allows extended assessment of lungs whose suitability for transplant ation is 
initially uncertain. By [CONTACT_206184], EVLP -treated lungs undergo a longer period of total preservation, 
including an initial cold ischemic time (CIT -1), a period of normothermic EVLP assessment, and a final round of 
CIT (CIT -2). The extended do nor lung preservation time may enable better logistical coordination of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282209].  
 
Upon retrieval, donor lungs will be packaged and transported to the Sponsor’s EVLP facility. The EVLP 
procedur e will be performed by  [CONTACT_282290] -trained  Ex Vivo Lung Specialists under remote video supervision by 
[CONTACT_282291]’s Expert Medical Consultants. The Sponsor will perfuse the lung using the TES for up to 6 
hrs, collecting and relaying lung function assessment data hourly,  or as requested by [CONTACT_282292]/team. Additionally, the Study Center surgeon will have access to remote monitoring capabilities at the Sponsor EVLP Center for evaluating lung function data and monitoring the procedure through a dedicated 
audio/video link.  
 The Study Center Investigator/team, together with the Sponsor’s Expert Medical Consultants, will monitor the 
donor lung(s) for EVLP inclusion criteria and collaborate to determine the timing of EVLP termination. However, final decisions reside with the Study Center Investigator/team. Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lu ng by [CONTACT_282293], the single lung or lung block is cooled according to TES methodology to 10°C, and perfusion and ventilation are stopped. This point marks the start of CIT -2. The end of CIT -2 is defined as the time the organ is 
removed from cold sto rage to begin the implantation phase of the transplantation procedure. The time between 
the organ’s removal from cold storage to reperfusion in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282210] (WIT). 
Total preservation time for the first lung transplanted from  donor lung retrieval to the end of CIT -[ADDRESS_344154] not be 
greater than a combined 22 hrs and individual phase limits as follows:  
(≤ 10 hrs CIT -1) + (3 - 6 hrs EVLP)  + (≤ 6 hrs CIT -2) ≤ [ADDRESS_344155] not be 
greater than a combined 26 hrs and individual phase limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hrs CIT -1) + (3 - 6 hrs EVLP)  + (≤ 10 hrs CIT -2) ≤ [ADDRESS_344156] Participation :  
Data will be collected from the organ donor, EVLP procedure  (if applicable) , and each subject from the time of 
lung transplantation and up to one year post -transplant  for the Analysis Phase . In addition, outcome data will be 
collected annually up to [ADDRESS_344157] -transplant.  
 
The study duration  for the Analysis Phase  (from first patient, first visit [FPFV] to last patient, last visit [LPLV]  
prior to database lock ) is expected to be 3  years. The estimated time to complete enrollment is approximately 24 
months.

Confidential  Page 6 of 89 Safety  Assessments : 
Medical History and concomitant medications will be collected for each subject. Physical examinations, including 
specific tests to assess lung function, will be performed at Baseline, Day  30, and Month 6. Vital signs will be 
assessed at each study visit.   
 
The subject’s PGD Score is to be determined by [CONTACT_282294] (Day  0) after transplantation and 
upon admission to the ICU, as well as 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_344158] be 
determined by [CONTACT_737], in orde r to calculate PGD grade. Graft survival will be evaluated by [CONTACT_3786] (or his/her designee) at Day  30, Day  90, Month  6, Year  [ADDRESS_344159] -transplant, and premature termination 
(if applicable).  
 
Subject survival, measured as living or dead, will be recorded Day  30, Day  90, Month  6, and Year  [ADDRESS_344160] -transplant, the date of death and primary cause of 
death will be collected.  
 Evaluation of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS), physical capacit y, and work status will be conducted at 
Day 90, Month 6, Year  [ADDRESS_344161] -transplant, and premature termination (if applicable).  
 
In addition, after completion of the Analysis Phase, survival will be recorded annually until [ADDRESS_344162] will be collected annually, along with BOS, 
physical capacity, work status, graft survival, by [CONTACT_282295]- term Follow -up Phase (Year 2, 3, 4, 
and 5).  
Statistical Methods:   
Statistical analysis will b e performed primarily on data collected during the Analysis Phase ([ADDRESS_344163]-intervention) . The database will be locked for analysis of endpoints after the last subject completes his/her 
study visit at Year 1, and all queries have been resolved.   
 
All su bject s are included in the analyses to the extent data are available.  
 The primary endpoint of PGD3 T72 will be calculated from PGD T72 as follows:  PGD T72 = {0, 1, & 2} will be 
coded to PGD3 T72 = 0 and PGD T72 = {3} will be coded to PGD3 T72 = 1. The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with PGD3 T72 by [CONTACT_282296] (EVLP and Control). A one -sided 
95% CI will be calculated around the proportion. A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
 
The primary endpoint of 30- Day mortality will be derived as follows:  Living at Day 30 will be coded to 0, and 
Dead before or on Day 30 will be coded to 1. The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with 30- Day mortality, summarized by [CONTACT_282296]. A o ne-sided 95% CI will be calculated around 
the proportion. A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
 
All secondary endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics along with two sided 95% CIs by [CONTACT_282297]. Other supportive endpoints may b e provided to supplement the secondary analyses.  
Results may be displayed graphically. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
 
All exploratory endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics along with two sided 95% CIs by 
[CONTACT_282298]. There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
 
A contemporaneous Control group will be entered into this study. This Control group will provide context of the 
EVLP results and estimation of Control group parameters for design of future studies. All analyses of the Control 
group will be descriptive and no formal statistical comparison will be made between the EVLP and Control 
groups.

1.1 Lung Transplantation and E x Vivo Lung Perfusion Background  
Lung transplantation is often the only available therapy for patients suffering end -stage lung 
disease, and the number of patients who can appropriately benefit by  [CONTACT_282299]. Importantly , the mismatch between demand for transplantable 
lungs and the supply of available organs is substantially higher than other solid organs , with the 
lungs being used for transplantation among  only 20% of brain dead donors who are used for 
transplant ing other solid organs.[Munshi 2013; SRTR 2011] T he described reason for declining 
the majority of the available donor lungs by [CONTACT_282300] 
“Poor Organ Function” and “No Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282215].” [SRTR 2011]  
It has been suggested  that over 4 0% of the lungs rejected by [CONTACT_24623] ( US) lung 
transplant programs could have be en transplanted if better information was available at the time 
of procurement , or additional time w as available to meet the complex logistical demands of 
procurement and transplantation. [Ware 2002] Introduction of technologies , such as Ex vivo  Lung 
Perfusion (EVLP ), might facili tate more in- depth assessment of lung condition, thereby [CONTACT_282301].   
Evidence linking the pathophysiology of brain death to early organ dysfunction after transplantation continues to accumulate and seems especially relevant when considering donor lungs. L ung injury begins soon after a catastrophic event  associated with massive brain injury 
with a massive sympathetic outflow , then an associated release of  inflammatory cytokines . These 
mediators of inflammation then  remain within  the donor lung(s), ultimately being released into 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282216], potentially reflecting an important etiology of  early 
graft dysfunction.[ Fisher 2001]   
Also, cerebral edema leading to b rain stem herniation effects  irreversible cessation of brain  
function (e.g., death). This is associated with complete loss of autonomic tone with massive 
vasodilation and hypotension. T his is generally treated  by [CONTACT_282302] t o maintain  adequate circulation and end organ perfusion.[Power 1995; Hayek 1990; 
Tropmann 2008] Together with neurogenic pulmonary edema , another consequence of brain 
death, the overall clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_282217].[Avlonitis  2007]  
Steen et al., described an ex vivo  perfusion technique in 2001, seeking  to better evaluate lungs 
from non- heart beating donors (Donation after Circulatory Death [ DCD]).[Steen 2001]. This 
method demonstrated the proof- of-concept evidence that donor lungs could be assessed ex vivo , 
then successfully transplanted, initially into large animals, and later into humans.  
Keshavjee’s group in Toronto extended those observations , applying a modified, normothermic 
(37°C) EVLP technique,  using an acellular , albumin- based solution (STEEN Sol ution™ ), lower 
perfusion flow rates (40% of normal cardiac output), and a protective ventilation strateg y to 
permit longer perfusion with excellent physiologic function after transplantation .[Cypel 2008a ; 
Cypel 2008b; Cypel 2009] The method, called the Toronto EVLP System (TES) was demonstrated as  technically feasible and safe, permitting  perfus ion of donor lungs for up to

preservation  period, TES extended the time available for  assessment of donor lungs  under 
near-physiologic conditions.  
1.1.1 Toronto Clinical Experience:  Toronto EVLP System  
Human studies were started  during 2008 in Toronto with the Human Ex Vivo  Lung Perfusion 
(HELP) trial. HELP was a prospective, non- randomized, single -center study of outcomes of 
lungs not meeting conventional lung donor criteria, receiving 4  hrs of extended preservation and 
assessme nt using  EVLP . The EVLP treated lungs were compared to all other lungs transplanted  
(Control) during the same time period. In addition to the [ADDRESS_344191] criteria donor 
(SCD) with one lung preserved using  conventional hypothermic cold storage, and the second 
lung using  one hour of TES . After no adverse consequences were identified in this initial 
experience, declined lungs from 23 donors were then assessed using the TES.  Among those 20 
lung transplants (86% utilization), [ADDRESS_344192] for transplantation 
using  conventional donor lung criteria. Donor lungs deemed not appropriate for transplantation 
using  ‘conventional’ criteria were placed on  EVLP the n made available to potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282218] .   
Upon trial completion, Health Canada permitted ongoing access through compassionate use, resulting in 39 additional EVLP transplants (total of 61 EVLP transplants prior to final marketing approval). STEEN Solution™ recei ved full marketing approval by [CONTACT_282304] 
06 Nov  2012 as a stand -alone device (i.e. , could be used with any off -the-shelf perfusion 
equipment).  
The i nitial study results suggested that t ransplantation of donor lungs that were physiologically 
stable during 4 hrs  of EVLP , resulted in  similar outcomes to those obtained with conventionally 
procured and hypothermically -treated  lungs. [Cypel 2011a ]  
By [CONTACT_206184], EVLP -treated lungs underwent a longer period of total prese rvation, 
including an initial cold ischemic time (CIT- 1), a period of normothermic  EVLP assessment , and 
a final round of CIT (CIT -2).[Cypel 2011a ]  
Ethical concerns limited the study design in that it was not possible to randomize the initially rejected donor lungs to ‘EVLP’ or ‘no EVLP’ study groups to determine post -transplantation 
success. However, review was possible from a clinical perspective as to whether the post-transplant outcomes were satisfactory for both groups. After 4 hrs  of EVLP, the donor lung 
was evaluated to determine a number of parameters including the difference in pulmonary venous and arterial oxygen partial pressure (PO
2) (delta PO 2 = pulmonary vein O 2 - pulmonary 
artery O 2), pulmonary vascular resis tance ( PVR ), peak airway pressure (P AwP), and lung

In the first six years after the HELP study  began, the overall lung utilization rate in Toronto 
increased to 36% [S Keshavjee, personal communication ] without significant changes to lung 
transplant volumes in surrounding regions .[Tiwari  2014] Therefore , it seems reasonable to infer 
that EVLP played a relevant role in the observed lung transplant volume increase.  Long-term 
outcomes for the lung recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282219] (and compassiona te extension) trial , suggest that 
the lu ngs transplanted after EVLP had  similar long -term outcomes compared to conventionally 
procured lungs .[Cypel 2012] 
Taken together , more than [ADDRESS_344194] been evaluated by [CONTACT_282305] a 
consistent increase in the lung utilization rate approximating 80% .[C Jaynes , personal 
communication ]. Overa ll, one -, three -, and five -year  outcomes after lung transplantation have 
been similar to results obtained among  lung recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282220] .[Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012;  Munshi 2013;

1.1.2 Sponsor Clinical Experience:  Toronto EVLP System  
In 2015, Lung Bioengineering Inc (the Sponsor) merged with PERFUSIX [LOCATION_003], the previous 
Sponsor of this study , and S tudy PXUS 14 -001 continues under the new sponsorship. The 
Sponsor’s predecessor company, PERFUSIX  [LOCATION_003] , had considerable experience with the TES , in 
that its employees and consultants consis ted of team members who  developed the technology, 
validated the protocols through the HELP clinical trial ,[Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 
2012] and designed the s ingle- use disposable products used in the EVLP procedure. 
Additionally, a  separate Canadian corporation, PERFUSIX Canada, has  been responsible for 
running all of the EVLP lung procedures in Ontario, Canada, as a service for Toronto General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( TGH) since April  2013.

Confidential  Page 18 of 89 1.2.1 Potential Risks  
The specif ic additional risks associated with EVLP  beyond those encountered in lung transplant  
general ly include extend ing ischemia beyond the initial cold ischemic period, increased potential 
for contamination due to additional handling and manipulation of the lung s, and potential lung 
damage that might result from  the perfusion process and associated procedures, such as  
cannulation, bronchoscopy, and repackaging, among others . Specific risks and mitigation 
strategies are addressed in Appendix 3.  
1.2.2 Potential Benefits  
The p otential benefits of extended evaluation provided by [CONTACT_282306]:  
• Evaluation under fixed/ideal hemodynamics outside of the confounding influence of the 
pathophysiology resulting from  brain dea th and accompanying somatic injury , 
• Extended time enabling more careful examination/evaluation of donor organs . 
 Assessment  of lung and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282221], which varies program -to-program and becomes even more important 
when lungs from unconventional or DCD donors are assessed. Ex vivo  assessment at the 
Sponsor’s dedicated EVLP facility can therefore add a level of consistency (and therefore safety) 
in lung assessment, removing inherent variability between centers and surgeons. The additional expertise provided by S ponsor’s specifically trained  EVLP Specialists  and Expert Medical 
Consultants  can help the transplant  surgeon make the most accurate judgment when  evaluating 
the risk profile of an EVLP lung as compared to the risk profile of a potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Increased Donor Lung Utilization  
Strategies which increase the use of lungs from currently available donors provide the best 
opportunity to meaningfully increase the availability of lungs for end stage patients currently waiting for transplantation. In 2012, there were 8144 eligible donors recorded in the US and a total of 1634 lung transplants, resulting in a donor utilization rate of 20.1% [SRTR 2012]. E VLP 
is anticipated to increase the number of donor lungs used for transplantation by [CONTACT_282307]. Based on the experience at TGH, the lung utilization rate from deceased donors has increased to 36% following the introduction of EVLP in the form of the TES (cf. section 1.1.1). In the event that these results were extended to the US, an additional 1298 lung transplants might be expected to result from the introduction of EVLP (for a total of 2932 transplants). Importantly, to achieve a similar increase in lung transplants by [CONTACT_282308], [ADDRESS_344196] to be identified, a 79% increase over the current pool. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_282222], the annual number of donors has remained static. Thus, the low likelihood of 
significantly increasing the number of lungs available to patients with end -stage lung disease 
through currently available approaches argues that novel  technologies to increase donor lung 
utilization such as the TES are needed.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is an unblinded, non- randomized, traditional feasibility study to evaluate the safety of 
subjects undergoing lung transplant using lungs after EVLP , performed exclusively by [CONTACT_282311]’s facility using the TES . The study will include male and female adult 
lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , requiring a SLT  or DLT  who are  at least 18  years of age, and who are 
not receiving mechanical ventilat ion, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) or other 
Extracorporeal Life S upport (ECLS) at the time of the initial lung offer. Subjects who  have 
signed informed consent  (Section  10.4), match to a donor lung offer through the standard Organ 
Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN ) allocation system, and meet the other 
eligibility criteria ( Section 4 ), including matching with and undergoing  a transplant with a Donor 
Lung , may participate. Patients who consent for this  study (PXU S 14-001) but receive a 
conventional (i.e., non- EVLP) lung transplant will be considered for a contemporaneous control 
group matched to the EVLP treatment group.  The control group will be selected to best match 
the EVLP group with respect to the following criteria:  SLT / DLT, and Lung Allocation Score 
Disease Diagnosis Group  (LASDDG ). LASDDG is assigned according to OPTN Policy 10.1.F.i. 
into one of four groups:  
• Group A:  Obstructive Lung Disease  
• Group B:  Pulmonary Vascular disease  
• Group C:  Cystic Fibrosi s or Immunodeficient Disorders  
• Group D:  Restrictive Lung Disease 
 
The goal is to provide a control group with similar characteristics and risk as the experimental group receiving EVLP. 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_344208] received donor lung(s) after EVLP (EVLP Group) and [ADDRESS_344209] 
received a conventional (i.e., non -EVLP) lung transplant and qualify for a contemporaneous 
control group (Control Group). Further, no more than two- thirds of the subjects enrolled 
(44 subjects per group) will have received a SLT or DLT.   
Acceptance or rejection of donor lungs for EVLP will follow the process outlined in Figure 2 and 
detailed in Section  3.1.1.

Once the donor lung is transplanted  following EVLP (see Section 5.2.3), the eligible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] t, 
who has provided written informed c onsent, is enrolled into the study. Patients who consent for 
the current EVLP study  (PXUS 14 -001) but receive a conventional (i.e. , non- EVLP) lung 
transplant will be considered for a contemporaneous control group matched to the EVLP 
treatment group . This matching will take place on a patient -by-patient basis and only after an  
EVLP subject has been enrolled  at that Study Center . Investigators and their team will be 
notified by [CONTACT_17190] a real -time basis of the specific matching criteria required  for a 
control s ubject as EVLP subjects are enrolled  (see Section  5.3). In order to be considered for 
eligibility, the control subject  must “match” a priori to an EVLP subject who has already been 
enrolled at that Study Center based on the following criteria:

3.1.1 Lung Collection and EVLP Procedure 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lung Referral  
All donor lungs are allocated to transplant centers according to OPTN Policy 10.  Once an acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282232] a potential organ donor, at or near death, the regional OPO is contact[CONTACT_282314]. The OPO enters specific donor demogra phics into a single 
national data base of all persons needing an organ transplant to generate a match run list of patients for each organ to be donated from deceased individuals.  In match run order, the OPO contacts a transplant center to offer the matched organ to a specific patient, and provides details of the donor’s medical history and other relevant information. The transplant center has one hour to accept the lung for the matched patient, otherwise the lung offer continues in match run sequence order for additional patients until a center accepts the lung(s), the match run list is exhausted or there are timing issues which may cause the OPO to suspend subsequent lung offers.  The lung acceptance by a center is based on a number of factors, but primari ly depends 
on the transplant center’s staff decision that a specific donor lung is suitable for the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. If the transplant center accepts, the lung is shipped to the transplant center for a standard of care transplant. 
If the transplant cent er is also a Study Center in this trial, they then have the ability to enroll a 
consented patient into this study.  The lung(s) is sent to the Study Center as normal, and if the 
designated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282233], they may be eligible fo r enrollment in the 
control group.  This eligibility is based on meeting the overall study inclusion criteria, not 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344216] of care transplantation, and meets the inclusion 
criteria for the EVLP group in this study, and does not meet any of the exclusion  criteria, the 
Study Center may refer the lung(s) to the LB-1 facili ty for EVLP.  This decision is based on the 
protocol criteria as well as the medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_282392].  The Sponsor does not make recommendations for referring an organ to the LB- 1 
facility for perfusion. The Sponsor will, however, verify that the inclusion/exclusion criteria for referred lungs are followed by [CONTACT_282315].  The verification process will happen when the OPO contacts the Sponsor facility to notify  them that 
an organ has been referred for EVLP by a Study Center, and to discuss lung transportation logistics and other case details. If it is determined that an error has been made by [CONTACT_282316], the lung(s) will no t be sent to the Sponsor for EVLP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lung Retrieval  
Upon retrieval, donor lungs will be packaged and transported to the Sponsor’s EVLP facility in Silver Spring, MD, according  to standard procedures, following  OPTN Policy  16. Upon arrival  
at the Sponsor’s facility , lungs will  be placed onto the TES  by a specifically -trained  Ex Vivo  
Lung Specialist.  Prior to starting perfusion, the duration of CIT -1 will be confirmed to be less 
than or equal to 10 hrs. 
The EVLP procedure will be performed b y Ex Vivo  Lung Specialists under remote v ideo 
supervision by [CONTACT_282317]’s Expert M edical Consultants :  Drs. Keshavjee, Cypel, or 
Waddell. The Sponsor will perfuse the lung using the TES  for up to [ADDRESS_344217] access to remote monitoring capabilities at the

Ventilation Data Parameters  
Ventilation shall begin when  the lung temperature reaches 32°C measured from the temperature 
probe connected to the heat exchanger. Then, before e ach hourly oxygen challenge, the ventilator 
should be set at a tidal volume of 10  mL/kg (based on donor ideal body weight [IBW]) for 5 min 
at a fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] ( FiO 2) of 100% (1.0) prior to obtaining perfusate gas samples. 
After the perfusate g as sample has been collected, the ventilator tidal volume is set back to the 
maintenance settings of 7  mL/kg and FiO 2 of 21% (0.21). 
The following ventilation parameters will be measured and recorded hourly at the end of each 
oxygen challenge:  
• Mean, peak a nd plateau airway pressure (mAwP, PA wP, platAwP), cm  H2O 
• Static and dynamic compliance (mL/cm H 2O) 
• Perfusate gas analysis  at lung inflow and outflow:  PO 2, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 
(PCO 2), pH , glucose, and lactose. 
 
Other Data Parameters  
Bronchoscopy:   Bronchoscopy is performed with visual assessment observations recorded, 
including a description of secretions, at the one- , three -, and if necessary, five -hour marks of the 
EVLP procedure. A bronchoscopy may be performed following initial ve ntilation to clear the 
airways a s indicated. Additional bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_282234] . All bronchoscopic evaluations will be 
recorded digitally and transmitted to the Study Cente r Investigator for review . 
X-ray:  A digital radiograph of the lung is taken after the first , third, and fifth (if necessary) hour 
marks  to detect edema, consolidations, or other abnormalities; and the resulting image will be 
transmitted digitally to the S tudy Center Investigator and Expert Medical  Consultant  for review .

[IP_ADDRESS] Acceptance of EVLP Lung for Transplant  
The EVLP procedure must  run between 3 and  6 hrs to qualify the lung s for inclusion in to the 
study. The  Expert Medical Consultants , working with the Study Center surgeon/team will 
monitor and evaluate the quality of the perfusion procedure data remotely . Together, they will 
serve as a collaborative team regarding t he EVLP procedure , including the timing of the EVLP 
termination.  The Expert Medical  Consultant (s) will answer questions, provide guidance , and as 
requested offer perspectives based upon their considerable experience with EVLP and lung 
transplantation.  How ever, final decisions reside with the Study Center surgeon/team.  The 
Expert  Medical Consultants will not issue a recommendation regarding transplanting or not 
transplanting  the lung(s). Specifically, i f the donor lung meets EVLP study inclusion criteria 
(Section  5.2), the Study Center Investigator /team  will make the final determination of transplant 
suitability per OPTN Policy  5.7. Study Center Investigators will provide feedback on the utility 
of the da ta parameters assessed for determining transplant suitability via CRF. These data will be 
used solely to inform future study design.  
Upon acceptance of an EVLP donor lung by [CONTACT_282320], the single lung or lung block is cooled according to  TES  method ology  to 10°C. Thereafter, perfusion and ventilation are 
stopped.  
This point marks the start of CIT -2. The lung (s) is prepared for hypothermic storage by [CONTACT_282321] 500 mL cold (4°C) STEEN Solution, maintain ing lung  inflat ion (trachea is clamped). 
Accepted lung(s) will be repackaged by [CONTACT_282322]  16, stored at 4°C 
in low potassium dextran cold storage solution  and transported to the Study Center using 
methods to minimize CIT- 2.  
Total preservation time (TPT) for the first lung transplanted from donor lung retrieval to end of 
CIT-[ADDRESS_344220] not be greater than a combined 2 2 hours and individual phase limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hours CIT -1) +  (3 - 6 hours EVLP)  + (≤ 6 hours CIT -2) ≤  22 hours  
Total preservation time (TPT) for the second lung transplanted in DLT procedures from donor lung retrieval to end of CIT -[ADDRESS_344221] not be greater than a combined 2 6 hours and individual phase 
limits as follows:   
(≤ 10 hours CIT -1) +  (3 - 6 hours EVLP)  + (≤ 10 hours CIT -2) ≤  26 hours  
EVLP lungs that exceed 10  hrs of CIT -1, or are perfused for less than 3 hrs or more than 6 hrs  
will be discarded by [CONTACT_282323]’s directions.  
First lung CIT -[ADDRESS_344222] in 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344223] lung CIT -2 will exceed 6  hrs due to logistical considerations (projected flight 
time and/or surgical s taff schedule, etc.), the lungs shall  not be transported to  the Study Center. 
Similarly, if after leaving the EVLP facility, prolonged transport time or patient logistical or 
other issues compromise the ability to ensure actual first lung CIT -[ADDRESS_344224] lung from cold storage , marking the end of CIT -2. The warm ischemic time (WIT) period then begins, 
which lasts until the lung is reperfused in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. This time period is expected to be no longer than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_282237].  
For DLT procedures, the second lung must remain in cold storage in low potassium dextran 
solution while the first lung implantation is being performed.  T he time of removal of the second 
lung from cold storage  after the first lung is implanted and the second lung WIT should be 
consistent with historical surgical experience for sequential DLT at each Study Ce nter. However, 
if the time between the start of CIT -2 and removal of the second lung from cold storage exceeds 
10 hrs, a protocol deviation shall be documented on a CRF and shall be reported to the Sponsor. The reason for the delay and an assessment of the second lung’s condition prior to transplant shall be recorded in the CRF. These subjects will continue enrollment in the study and will be followed in the EVLP Group.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Request for Reallocation of Lungs After EVLP  
In the event the Study Center initially accepting , declines  the lungs during or after completion of 
the EVLP assessment,  where  the lungs meet the inclusion criteria,  the EVLP Specialist must 
contact [CONTACT_282324] (the “host” OPO) and provide the following information:  
• OPTN/UNOS  donor iden tification number ( ID#); 
• Name [CONTACT_282394];  
• Reason the lungs were declined;  
• Names of all other Study Centers participating in the clinical trial;  
• Current status of the lung (s) (i.e., still on EVLP, p ackaged on ice, in transit); and  
• Contact [CONTACT_282325] S pecialist on call for the specific case.  
 If the lungs meet the trial acceptance criteria (see Section  5.2.3), the Sponsor personnel will 
recommend the host OPO resume lung allocation according to their internal policies and procedures, reminding  the OPO  of the Study Centers participating in Study PXUS [ADDRESS_344225] the i nterested physician

will be in accordance with their internal policies and procedures. The reallocation will be documented in CMX and on the EVLP facility’s CRF. In the event the lungs cannot be 
reallocated, they will be discarded accordi ng to the Sponsor’s procedures for handling 
biomedical waste.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
As described in Section  1, EVLP is a novel technology that allows extended assessment of lungs 
whose suitabi lity for transplantation is initially uncertain.  The extended donor lung preservation 
time may also  enabl e better logistical coordination of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282238].  
This study is an unbli nded, non- randomized, traditional feasibil ity multi -center study to evaluate 
the safety of subjects undergoing lung transplant after EVLP , as performed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor using 
the TES . This study was  built on the single -center experience including  >100 EVLP -treated lung 
transplants  at TGH , where  similar survival to the contemporaneous (non -EVLP) lung transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s was demonstrated .[ Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012; Munshi 
2013; Cypel 2013] Importantly, the contribution of EVLP was associated with  a 36% increase in 
total lungs transplanted at TGH in 2013,[S  Kesha vjee, personal communication ] without 
negatively impacting transplant volumes at surrounding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]  [Tiwari  2014], supporting the 
notion that the adoption of EVLP technology resulted in transplantation of lungs that would have otherwise been discarded. [S Keshavjee, personal communication ; Munshi 2013] 
This study  proposal seeks to evaluate the feasibility  of reproducing the TES  at a central US 
facility  where  the d onor lungs require  an additional travel leg  (after concluding the EVLP 
procedure) compared to standard lung transplant ation. This second period of cold preservation 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_282326] g 
EVLP  and comparing with subjects who have undergone a traditional lung transplant (i.e., 
contemporaneous control group). The p rimary safety endpoint s of PGD [ADDRESS_344227] on short - and long- term recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282239]  [Suzuki 
2013], and 30- day mortality has been included as part of the primary endpoint, given the lesser 
degree of ce rtainty of the prognostic significance of PGD 3 in SLT  (see also Section  6.16). 
Randomization is not possible in this study , as lung transplant is co nsidered a life- saving 
procedure , and donors must match in size and blood type to potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], so withholding a 
potentially -matched lung transplant is not ethical.  Patients not receiving an EVLP lung will be 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344228] to the following criteria:  
• SLT versus DLT  
• LASDDG 
 
In order to be considered for eligibility, the control patient must “match” a priori to an EVLP 
subject who has already been enrolled. Because the ratio of standard lung transplant to EVLP transplant is expected to be approximately 4: 1, it is feasible to obtain a control -EVLP match 
within the anticipated duration of the study.  
At the request of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), long- term post -intervention 
follow -up has been included to assess outcome parameters within the [ADDRESS_344229] or EVLP lung transplant. 
3.3 Study Duration and Dates  
Data will be collected from the organ  donor, EVLP procedure  (if applicable) , and each subject 
from the time of lung transplantation and up to one year post -transplant  for the Analysis Phase. 
In addition, outcome data will be collected annually up to [ADDRESS_344230] -transplant.  
The study duration for the Analysis Phase  (from first patient, first visit [FPFV] to last patient, 
last visit [LPLV]  prior to database lock ) is expected to be 3 years. The estimated time to 
complete enrollment is approximately 24 months.

5.1 Description of Intervention  
The TES  and has been used by [CONTACT_282327] 225 clinical EVLP procedures 
(including at least 176 completed lung transplants). Nearly all of the hardware and disposables 
used in the TES  are 510(k)- cleared by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA ) for human 
clinical use, indicating appropriate and safe manufacturing procedures. The exception to this is 
the organ chamber and the lung cannulas, which are both made from medical -grade materials 
and are currently being used in clinical EVLP under th e Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE) 
#H120003. There are two classifications of system components :  Non-Fluid Path Hardware and 
Single-Use Fluid Path Disposables. A schematic that represents each classification component in relation to the other is shown in Figure  3. 
 
Figure 3.  System Components of the Toronto EVLP System  
The Toronto Ex Vivo  Lung Perfusion System (“Toronto EVLP System”  or TES ) comprises a 
combination of FDA -approved, off- the-shelf hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140325], including: a centrifugal by[CONTACT_282328], heater/cooler, ICU ventilator, and a disposable by[CONTACT_282329]. In addition, the following non- FDA -approved single -use disposables are necessary:  disposable organ chamber, 
disposable lung cannulas, and the perfusate STEEN Solution.  
The proposed TES  indication  is for extending preservation and assessment of donor lungs using 
normothermic lung perfusion and ventilation in a controlled environment outside the body (ex vivo). The device is intended to be used to  perfuse lungs for male and female first -time, SLT  or 
DLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], aged 18  years or older with end- stage lung disease, not requiring ECMO, ECLS, 
or ventilation at the time of initial organ referral  prior to EVLP .

Detailed description s of all system components currently in use can be found in Appendix 4.  
5.2 Lung Transplantation  
Donor lungs are evaluated to assess if they meet the donor lung inclusion criteria (Pre -EVLP; 
Section  5.2.1). If the donor lungs meet criteria, they proceed through EVLP. After EVLP, the 
donor lungs are again evaluated for transplant suitability and must meet the donor lung inclusion  
criteria (Post -EVLP; Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) in order to be transplanted into a subject who meets the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282242].  
5.2.1 Donor Lung Inclusion Criteria (Pre-EVLP) 
Lungs are eligible for use in this study when an OPO documents that without EVLP, the lungs 
would not otherwise be used for transplantation. Data will be collected on the match run, includin g the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ position on the list, the number of refusals prior to and after a study 
center’s acceptance, and the reason(s) for refusal. The OPO will also document the decision to either discontinue further standard allocation, or expedite allocation directly to a Study Center for EVLP if circumstances so dictate either approach to make the organ available for further evaluation and potential transplant via EVLP.  
Examples of such circumstances include:  
• Match run exhausted: Attempts to place the lungs via the match run sequence have yielded 
refusal responses to standard (non- EVLP) offers, and the OPO decides that the remaining 
allocation time supports the decision for EVLP;  
• Logistical challenges: The OPO  does not have time to perform a lung -specific match run; for 
example, if the overall organ donation process is being accelerated due to donor 
deterioration, limited OR availability, donor family request, procurement teams for other organs with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] u rgency, other competing issues requiring donor surgery to be 
scheduled prior to lung placement, or allowing another procurement team to recover the lungs for an accepting center;  
• Donation after circulatory death (DCD): Refusal rates by [CONTACT_282331], and donor expi[INVESTIGATOR_282243], often not occurring within the time limits established by [CONTACT_282332][INVESTIGATOR_600]. Because of the se factors, many transplant centers do 
not entertain DCD offers at all, meaning that they would not normally be used for transplant;  
• OR decline: An unexpected suitability issue is identified at time of procurement resulting in 
the decision that the previou sly designated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282244]; frequently this 
severely limits the available time for the OPO to reallocate the lungs; or

5.2.2 Donor Lung Exclusion Criteria (Pre-EVLP)  
The donor lung is excluded from EVLP if at least one of the following criteria have been met:  
• The donor l ung has confirmed pneumonia and/or persistent purulent secretions identified via 
bronchoscopy  prior to donor lung excision.  
• Any purulent secretions not considered persistent identified in the donor lung  prior to 
excision that do not clear by [CONTACT_282333] 3 as sessment  of EVLP.  
• The donor lung has confirmed evidence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
• The donor lung has significant mechanical lung injury or trauma . 
• The donor has HIV or an active infectious disease such as Hepatitis B or C.  
• The CIT, starting at donor aortic cross clam p/initial flush (CIT -1), required to transport the 
lung from the donor site to start of the EVLP procedure at the Sponsor’s facility was 
> [ADDRESS_344234] -EVLP Assessment  
Throughout each EVLP procedure, the donor lungs are evaluated for t ransplant suitability by [CONTACT_282334] (i.e., transplant surgeon), in consultation with the Expert Medical 
Consultants . The Study Center Investigator will make the final determination of EVLP lung 
transplant suitability based on the same se t of donor lung and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282247].  
In addition to the real -time review of the EVLP procedure by [CONTACT_282335] , the Sponsor will conduct post -EVLP quality reviews of case data to ensure policies 
and procedures are adhered to. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Donor Lung Inclusion Criteria (Post -EVLP)  
The donor lung must meet each of the following conditions post -EVLP for transplant suitability 
consideration by [CONTACT_282320] I nvestigator:  
• Partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (P vO2)/FiO 2 ≥350 mmHg at final EVLP 
evaluation time period  
•  < 15% increase from baseline value (defined as the first hour collection point) to final value 
of PVR, 
• < 15% increase from baseline value to final value of P AwP, 
• < 15% decrease from baseline value to final value of static lung compliance (Cstat) , 
• TPT does not exceed the following:

5.3 Method of Assigning Patient s to Intervention 
A patient who is a potential candidate for this study may be approached by [CONTACT_5657]/her treating 
physician regarding the patient’s interest and desire for study information. This may take place during a Screening Visit up to one year prior to transplant, or during the Baseline visit on the day of transplant. Refer to Section  10.[ADDRESS_344236] provided informed cons ent to participate in this study will be screened and 
eligibility will be assessed according to applicable Inclusion (Section  4.2) and Exclusion Criteria 
(Section  4.3). Each Study Center will maintain a Screening Log where the applicable patient 
information will be captured, including their  LASDDG  and whether he/she is listed for SLT or 
DLT. Screening logs will be provided to the Sponsor on a regular basis so that patient matching criteria can be tracked . This will allow identification of potential control subjects as EVLP 
subjects become activ e in the study upon transplantation.  
When lungs are matched from donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the Study Center will make the determination if the lung qualifies for EVLP or not (Section 5.2). Based on the outcome of that decision and then review of criteria of that lung, either a standard transplant takes place or the lung undergoes EVLP for transplantation.  
After at least one EVLP subject has been enrolled  at a Study Center , that site’s Investigators and 
their team will be notified that  a Control Group slot is available for their Study Center  based on 
the control  matching criteria (SLT / DLT and LASDDG ). Study Centers will be notified again 
once that Control  Group slot is filled at their site pending the next EVLP transplant. In this way, 
each Study Center will provide a matching Control Group subject for each EVLP Group subject enrolled at their site.  
Identification of potential control subjects will be done prospectively. Retrospective matching of 
control patients after standard lung transplantation is prohibited. Study enrollment commences upon lung transplantation, and enrollment will be tracked separately at each participating center 
by [CONTACT_282336] (CRO), using site -specific identification and coding  
assigned per the CRF Instructions . Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282248]#, but will not include patient -identifying information (name, social security  #, 
etc.).  
Each participating lung transplant center will maintain a screening and study participant log, recording whether the subject received an EVLP -treated or non- EVLP -treated lung transplant , as

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
   
 
Confidential  Page 37 of 89 well as SLT or DLT and LASDDG, with subsequent screenin g identification numbers, dates of 
informed consent, and transplant dates. 
In order that no more than two- thirds of the subjects enrolled (44 subjects per group) will have 
received either a SLT or DLT, Study Centers will be kept informed regarding the numbers and 
types of transplants that have taken place and if any one type of transplant (single or double) will 
be limited to enrollment as the proportion reaches two -thirds  in the overall study . 
Furthermore, to ensure the contemporaneous enrollment of Control Group subjects, Study Centers may not enroll more than three EVLP subjects prior to enrolling at least one matching control subject. In this way, at no time should a site have more than three enrolled EVLP subjects without matched control subjects. The Sponsor will notify any Study Center that reaches this three EVLP patient threshold to remind them that a control patient must be enrolled next.

available treatment is lung transplantation.  
6.13.1 Definitions  
Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or i njury , or any 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in a clinical investigation subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship  to the investigational medical

Events Related to Study Endpoints 
Any adverse events  that are also defined within the primary and secondary endpoints do not 
require reporting as AEs since these are reported within the CRF. For example, PGD within the 
first [ADDRESS_344262] death was the outcome of a fatal SAE, 
then that SAE should be captured on the CRF. Additionally, if an AE defined as a primary or 
secondary endpoint meets the UADE criteria, expedited reporting is  required.

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344263] and monitor all AEs throughout the Analysis Phase of the 
study  (1-year post -intervention) , from the time of transplanted lung reperfusion until the end of 
the subject’s study participation. At all study visits, reports of AEs will be elicited by  a verbal 
probe (“How are you feeling?”). Subjects will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_282346]. Appropriate measures, including medical intervention and/or procedures, will be instituted if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator.  
All AEs occurring during the study must be documented , and a ny AEs occurring during the first 
[ADDRESS_344264] be reported in the CRFs for AEs. For each AE, the Investigator will 
evaluate the severity  and seriousness, as well as the relationship  of the AE to the device and 
procedure . Information relating to the AE, such as onset and cessation date and times, 
seriousness, severity , relationship to device/procedure, action taken, and outcome will also be 
documented in the subject’s source documentation for assessment . Where possible, AEs should 
be recorded using standard medical terminology. If several signs or symptoms are clearly related 
to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded, not the individual signs and symptoms.

participation duration ([ADDRESS_344266] -operative). Reporting procedures are  described in 
Section  6.13.7. 
Subjects with AEs that are ongoing at the subject’s last Study Center visit must be followed until 
resolution or for [ADDRESS_344267]’s last Study Center visit, whichever comes first. Adverse event s that are recorded during the [ADDRESS_344268]’s last Study Center visit 
will b e followed until resolution or for up to the [ADDRESS_344269]’s last Study Center 
visit, whichever comes first. All AEs that are ongoing after follow -up for 30 days ’ time will b e 
recorded as ongoing . The  Investigator is expected to provide or arrange appropriate supportive 
care for any subject with ongoing AE(s). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) should be followed until they resolve or the event or their 
sequelae stabilize. Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may be necessary to 
investigate f ully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE. Such supplementary assessments 
may include additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other healthcare professionals. The subject’s source documents and CRFs for AEs should be updated with any new or additional information as appropriate.  
If the subject reports or the Investigator learns of any new SAE that occurs up to [ADDRESS_344270]’s last clinical site visit, the clinical site personnel will ensure that these data are 
report ed on the AE CRF.

• Moderate:  minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention ind icated; moderate impact on ADL  
• Severe:  significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical 
attention, needs major assistance with ADL 
 
6.13.[ADDRESS_344271] be assessed by  [CONTACT_282347]:  
• Related :  The event is associated with the use of the investigational device or with 
procedures beyond a reasonable doubt   
• Possibly Related :  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or procedure is 
weak but cannot be ruled out completely; alternative causes are also possible.  
• Unlikely:  The relationship with the use of the investigational device or procedure seems not 
relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. 
• Not related:   There is no temporal relationship between the investigational device or 
procedure and the event onset, an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
6.13.6 Expectedness  
The S ponsor, Independent Medical Monitor, and the Study P rincipal Investigator  will be 
responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with t he 
risk information previously described for the intervention. Anticipated  adverse events not related 
to EVLP as listed in Section  6.13.1 are for purposes of this study considered to be “expected” 
events and do not require AE reporting. 
6.13.7 Reporting  Procedures  
The S ponsor will report all AE’s  occurring during the first [ADDRESS_344272] -transplant, and al l SAEs 
occurring during the one -year Analysis Phase of the study  to the FDA in the annual  
Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE) report. Each reported AE  will include date of onset , 
actions taken , severity , seriousness of the event , relationship of the event to the EVLP procedure 
or lung transplant , and the outcome of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs , including subject deaths,  are reported to the CRO  within one  working day  after 
awareness  via the Adverse Event CRF. The Sponsor shall review  all SAEs to assess if related or 
anticipated. Any event that meets the serious criteria, is unanticipated, and related to the device 
system is reviewed by [CONTACT_282348]  (21 CFR 812.150). The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representative will report any

Investigators within 10 business days following receipt of notice of the event(s).  
All other SAEs  for the Analysis Phase of the study will be reported to FDA in the annu al IDE 
report. 
In addition to the above, i t is the responsibility of the Study Investigator to abide by [CONTACT_282349].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedure for Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE meeting the specified SAE criteria will be submitted on an AE CRF  to the CRO. This 
report may be sent by [CONTACT_40743]. Once submitted, the CRO will send a confirmation email to 
the Investigator within one business day. The Investigator should contac t the CRO if this 
confirmation is not received. This process applies to both initial and follow -up SAE reports.

6.13.8 Initial Safety Review  
The Sponsor will temporarily paus e the study after the twentieth (#20)  subject  has been enrolled 
to allow time for the FDA to review safety data on the first [ADDRESS_344274], and BOS Grade. The study will be on hold during this review  with the 
exception of Subjects 11 through 20 who are “ongoing”; these subjects will continue to come to the Study Center as specified in the protocol . Upon satisfactory review, the FDA will permit the 
continuation of the study to the full subject enrollment. If the FDA has c oncerns, the Sponsor 
will address these in a satisfactory manner.

participation. Withdrawing from the study will not affect subject’s status/ability to receive a 
standard lung transplant. 
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any tim e upon request. 
The I nvestigator may withdraw a subject  from the study  for any reason, including but not limited 
to, the following:  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such 
that continued participation in  the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
• The subject meets an exclusion criterion (either newly -developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
• A protocol violation occurs.  
• The S ponsor or I nvestigato r terminates the study.  
 
It is unlikely that a subject will discontinue study participation after receiving a lung transplant , 
as a lifetime of required follow -up, immunosuppression monitoring , and infection control is 
required after transplantation to min imize the chance of graft failure and/or death. Every effort 
will be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures to capture AEs, SAEs, 
and UADE s.   
6.15 Premature Termination o r Suspension of the Study  
This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_282351], the  IDE Sponsor, and all 
regul atory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal

• Determination of futility.  
 
6.16 Appropriateness of Measurements  
PGD 3 at T72  and 30- day mortality  are the primary safety endpoint s measured for subjects in this 
study (Section  2.1).  
PGD3 has been shown in the liter ature to be a very good predictor of transplanted organ function 
as it has a significant impact on short - and long- term recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282253]:  
• PGD3 at T72 demonstrated a significantly higher risk of 30- day mortality, accounting for 
50% of all -cause deaths compared to PGD0 at T72.  
• PGD3 at T72 is associated with an increased 90 -day mortality rate of 18% and an increased 
1-year mortality rate of 23%.  
• PGD3 at T72 has the strongest association with long -term mortality compared to PGD scores 
at other time points post -transplant even after 1 year. [Suzuki 2013]  
 
 Over  100 lung transplants using lungs after undergoing EVLP  at TGH and show ed similar 
30-day, 1 -year, and 3-year survival outcomes compared to the contemporaneous (non -EVLP) 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282254].[ Cypel 2011a ; Cypel 2011b; Cypel 2012; Tikkanen 2012; Munshi 2013; 
Cypel 2013] Similarly, in this study, short -term and long -term survival will be documented for 
all subject s.  
While the prognostic value of PGD grading in DLT has gained clinical acceptance, the experience with PGD scores in SLT is more limited. In DLT, the measurement of oxygenation reflects the contribution of both transplanted lungs. In contrast, measured oxygenation reflects contributions from both a diseased, native lung and a transplanted graft when only a single lung is transplanted. The Lung Transplant Outcomes Group found the SLT itself was a risk factor for adverse PGD scores and was associated with worse long -term outcomes [Diamond 2013], 
although the reasons for this association are not understood. Thus , to address the lack of clinical 
clarity, the measurement of 30 -day mortality is included as a co -primary endpoint, and is 
intended to account for the uncertainty provided by [CONTACT_282352]. Both co- primary 
endpoints will be considered t o inform on prediction of long -term survival in SLT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
The contemporaneous control group will be used to provide context for interpreting these results.

Confidential  Page 57 of 89 8 QUALITY CON TROL AND ASSURANCE  
Quality Management is the overall process of establishing and ensuring the quality of processes, 
data, and documentation associated with clinical research activities. It encompasses both quality control (QC), and QA activities. All sites  conducting research under the sponsorship of the 
Spons or are required to have a plan in place for assuring the quality of the research being 
conducted.  
Each site should have standard operating procedures (SOPs) and/or a quality management plan that descr ibe:   
• How data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and for accuracy in relation to source documents.  
• The documents to be reviewed (e.g., CRFs, clinic notes), who is responsible, and the frequency for reviews.   
• Who will be responsible for addressing QA issues (correcting procedures that are not in 
compliance with protocol) and QC issues (correcting errors in data entry).  
• Staff training methods and how such training will be tracked.  
• If applicable, calibration exercises conducted prior to an d during the study to train examiners 
and maintain acceptable intra-  and inter- examiner agreement.  
 
8.1 Sponsor’s Quality Process  
The Sponsor will conduct the EVLP lung assessment procedure exclusively at the Sponsor’s dedicated facility. All post -EVLP procedu res will be reviewed by [CONTACT_28920] -house QA manager for 
compliance with the TES User Manual and clinical trial protocol, as well as for accuracy in 
relation to source documents. 
In addition, the Sponsor will use an independent CRO to oversee its activities. Fin ally, 
Independent Medical Monitors  will review all UADE to verify if they are related to the EVLP 
procedure, the lung transplantation, or other controllable/ uncontrollable event  (Section  10.8). 
8.2 Training for Study Interventionalists  
Training will be completed prior to participation in the clinical trial as outlined in the follow ing 
sections.

8.2.3 Lung Transplant Surgeons  
All Study Center I nvestigators will be experienced practitioners of lung transplantation. Current 
licensure will be maintained in the study records for each participating surgeon.  
8.2.4 EVLP Specialists  
Ex Vivo  Lung Specialists , specifically trained  to perform EVLP by [CONTACT_282355], Canada, will perform all EVLP procedures exclusively at the Sponsor’s dedicated site 
in Silver Spring, MD. Each donor lung, meeting study Inclusion Criteria (Section 5.2 ) and 
offered to the Sponsor by a participating transplant center, will be perfused normothermically b y 
the EVLS for up to 6 hours according to the procedures described in the TES User Manual.  
All EVLP Specialists performing procedures at the Sponsor’s site will have extensive training in the TES  through a 6- month in- residence program at TGH, culminating i n successful completion 
of the Ex Vivo  Lung Specialist Certification and Privileging Exam administered through 
University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario. This training program is the first of its kind, and the most comprehensive for the newly emerging fi eld of EVLP.  
The didactic portion of the EVLS training includes lectures and self -guided reading of applicable 
medical literature in the following areas:  
a. Lung transplantation - history and overview  
b. Lung allograft donation and procurement  
c. Legislative framewo rk 
d. Lung anatomy and physiology 
e. Perfusion concepts  
f. Ventilation strategies  
g. TES 
 The practical, hands -on experience includes observing a minimum of five research (animal) 
EVLP procedures and actively participating in at least 25  research EVLP procedures. 
Addi tionally, a minimum of five clinical (human) EVLP procedures will be observed and at least 
five more clinical cases will be performed with active participation, of which three must be transplanted at the end of the procedure.

Confidential  Page 60 of 89 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL  METHODS  
9.1 General Consideration s 
This section describes the planned statisti cal analyses in general terms. A complete description of 
the methodology will be specified in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized 
prior to database lock. Any changes in the statistical met hods described in this protocol that 
occur prior to database lock will be documented in the statistical analysis plan and will not require a protocol amendment.  
Statistical analysis will be performed primarily on data collected during the Analysis Phase (1-year post -intervention ). The database will be locked for analysis of endpoints after the last 
subject completes his/her study visit at Year 1, and all queries have been resolved. The Long -term Follow -up data will be summarized when the study has completed  in support of long -
term evaluation.   
No statistical hypotheses will be tested in this study. For ease of presentation, contextual review and statistical programming, the descriptive statistics of the contemporaneous Control group will be presented with t hose of the EVLP group. Descriptive statistics will be presented as means, 
standard deviations (SD), medians, and ranges for the continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Tabulations will be used to summarize result s from 
descriptive summaries and statistical analyses. A one-sided 95.0% CI  will be provided, as 
appropriate, for the primary endpoints, and two sided 95.0% CI  will be presented for all 
endpoints , as appropriate . 
9.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
In order to provide a sufficient number of subjects for reliable estimation of the primary endpoints, sample size was calculated based on a primary endpoint of PGD3 at T 72. Estimates of 
PGD3 at T 72 were based on historical data from EVLP transplant studies where EVLP su bjects 
had rates of PGD3 at T72  ranging from 0% to 15% and conventional transplant subjects ranging 
from 16.8% to 30% [XVIXO Perfusion Inc. 2014; Cypel  2012; Cypel  2011a ; Machuca 2014; 
Aigner  2012; Diamond  2013]. Assuming a PGD3 at T72 of 10% and a one -sided 95.0% 
confidence interval (CI) for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation adjusted for a finite population of size 2057 (number of lung transplants performed in the US in 2015 [OPTN  2015]), 66 subjects will be needed for the expected upp er bound of the CI  to not 
exceed a rate of 16% (nQuery Advisor 7.0, 2007). A tot al of [ADDRESS_344301] been low, ranging from 3% to 4%. 
For a sample size of [ADDRESS_344302] on e event will be approximately 
87% to 93% if the true probability of 30 -day mortality is 3% to  4% (nQ uery Advisor 7.0, 2007). 
Subjects will be entered into the study as EVLP transplants occur; however, enrollment to either  
transplant subtype (single -lung, double -lung) will be limited to 44  subjects to provide a 
reasonable number of subjects of both subtypes for subgroup examinations.  
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344303] lung transplant to EVLP transplant is estimated to be 
approximately 4:[ADDRESS_344304] included in the analyses to the extent data are available. Planned  exceptions will be 
noted in the SAP.  
Deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria will be listed  by [CONTACT_1130] . 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic  data  and baseline characteristi cs for all subjects collected prior to transplant will be 
listed and summarized overall , by [CONTACT_282296] (EVLP or Control), as well as  by [CONTACT_282356] (SLT or DLT) using descriptive statistics.  
Medical history (medical conditions ending prior to EVLP transplant) will be coded using the 
WHO -drug dictionary, presented as a listing and summarized overall and by [CONTACT_282357] (SOC). 
9.5 Primary Endpoint(s)  
9.5.[ADDRESS_344305] -transplant (T72), as defined in Section  6.7, will be used as the 
basis for the primary safety endpoint for analysis . The primary endpoint (PGD3 T72) will be 
calculated from PGD T72 as follows:  PGD T72  = {0, 1, & 2} will be coded to PG D3 T72 =  0 
and PGD T72 =  {3} will be coded to PGD3 T72 =  1. 
If a subject dies prior to the T72 measurement,  they will be coded to PGD3 T72  = 1. If the T72 
value is missing (not collected, not reported, not properly documented), then PGD3 will be coded to P GD3 T72 =  1 for the primary safety analysis.   
 
The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects  with PGD3 T72  by 
[CONTACT_282296] (EVLP and Control). A one -sided 95% CI will be calculated around the 
proportion. A two -sided 95% CI wil l also be calculated . 
There will be no inferential testing conducted.  
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PXUS [ADDRESS_344306]-transplant (see Section  6.8). The primary endpoint of 30-Day m ortality will be derived as 
follows:  Living at Day [ADDRESS_344307] is missing ( not collected, not reported, not properly documented), 
then 30- Day Mortality will remain missing for the primary analysis.  
The primary analysis will be descriptive as the proportion of subjects with 30 -Day mortality , 
summarized by [CONTACT_282296]. A one -sided 95% CI will be calculated around the proportion. 
A two -sided 95% CI will also be calculated.  
Other supportive endpoints may be provided to supplement the primary analysis, including, but not limited to, median number of days to death and primary cause of death.  
Results may be displayed graphically. There will be no inferential testing conducted.

Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout study participation. Subjects listed for single or bilateral lung 
transplantation with UNOS may be offered the option to participate in this  study. A legal 
authorized representative may be used to consent for a subject that is unable to sign/ consent for them selves. The Study Center must adhere to IRB and State law requirements as to who is an 
acceptable Legal Authorized Representative. The Study Center will also obtain documentation that person signing consent is authorized to do so. 
Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation will be provided to 
subjects and their families. A consent form describing in detail the study procedures and risks will be given to the subject. Each participating S tudy Center  will be provided with a model 
informed consent form (ICF ). Each institution may revise or add information to comply with 
institution consent templates, but may not remove procedural or risk content from the model form. Consent forms will be IRB- approved, and the subject is required t o read and review the 
document or have the document read to him or her. The I nvestigator or designee will explain the 
research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise.  
The subject will sign the ICF  prior to any study -related assessmen ts or procedures. Study -related 
assessments are defined as any study activities in which data are specifically collected from a potential subject that could later be used for analysis under this protocol. Pre- screening of 
potential subjects based on previo usly known medical histories or other information is not 
considered a study -related assessment. Study -related procedures are any medical procedures 
performed to screen or prepare a subject for lung transplantation under this protocol. Screening 
or other procedures performed for the purposes of general lung transplantation suitability or 
compatibility are not considered study -related procedures.  
If consent is obtained the same day that the subject begins study -related assessments or 
procedures, the subject’s  medical record should document that consent was obtained prior to 
these activities . Subjects will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates 
or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The consent may be signed during an extended 
period of time prior to the transplant. This extended period timeframe shall be determined by [CONTACT_282362] a subject is re- consenting versus reaffirming the 
original consent. The consent obtained prior to the day of transplant shall be reconfirmed at day of transplant by [CONTACT_51889]’s legal representative. This shall be documented in the source

documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], inclu ding but not limited 
to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the study subjects. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
Donor records will be redacted for any identifying donor information and instead will only use a pre-assigned UNOS Donor ID# to connect donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The Sponsor will use the UNOS 
ID# to request baseline donor, 6-  and 12- month recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282251] -transplant reports from 
OPTN/ SRTR to maintain recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282266].  
10.6 Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according to the guidelines summarized below. The S ponsor may 
choose to perform random inspections throughout the study as an element of quality assurance. Investigators shall allow auditing of their clinical investigation procedures and data.  
Data will b e collected from EVLP lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282267] -EVLP lung transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282268] . These data will include basic lung transplant 
information along with primary and secondary endpoints as listed in this protocol.  
The monitor(s) will visit the site soon after the first subject  is enrolled to assist in any questions 
the site might have concerning the study or CRF  completion . Monitoring visits will occur based 
on number of subjects enrolled at a Study Center, duration of the study, level of compliance or a significant change in compliance, or a change in Study Center  staff.

10.6.2 Summary of Monitoring Procedures & Responsibilities  
It is the responsibility of the st udy S ponsor to ensure that proper monitoring of the investigations 
is conducted and that IRB review and approval of the investigation is obtained. Monitoring visits 
will occur based on transplant volume at the center or at least annually. Trained personnel  or 
delegates appointed by [CONTACT_1758] S ponsor will perform study monitoring in order to ensure that 
the investigation is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with: the aforementioned agreements, plans, and regulations. The S ponsor (or designee) m ust be allowed access to the 
subjects’ files as per the informed consent at the investigator’s site when so requested.  
10.6.3 Routine Monitoring  
The following factors will be taken into account when determining the frequency of the monitoring visits: subject accr ual rate at each center, total number of subjects enrolled at each 
center, protocol violations, risk -based assessments for the primary and secondary endpoints and 
study protocol  compliance at each center. Monitors will require direct access to subject medi cal 
records pertinent to the study (and study inclusion criteria), study management documents, regulatory documents and Subject Informed Consent documents, as well as other potential applicable records not listed here.  
Monitors may ensure the Study  Investi gators maintain staff and facilities to conduct the clinical 
investigation safely and effectively. Monitors may conduct the following monitoring activities throughout the study:

10.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Case report forms (CRFs) are used to transmit the information collected in the performance of this study to the Sponsor (or its designee) a nd to governmental agencies. CRFs must be 
completed for each subject enrolled. This study may use paper  or electronic CRFs. All  paper 
CRFs must be legible and completed in black ball point ink. Data entries for paper CRFs may be 
corrected only by [CONTACT_740] a  single line through the incorrect entry and writing in the correct 
entry. Incorrect entries are not to be obliterated by [CONTACT_282365]. All corrections must be initialed and dated.  Systems for electronic CRFs will be p roperly 
designed, validated, and implemented prior to use.   
A selected number of donor and subject variables are required data collected by [CONTACT_282366]. A data sharing agreement may be developed with the OPTN and/or UNOS for electronic transfer of those data elements directly to the Sponsor for each enrolled subject/donor. 
CRF general guidelines will be used to complete all CRFs. Subjects will be given identification 
numbers so that their identity cannot be determined by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor and donor data will be 
identified for use by [CONTACT_282367]. The research coordinator will keep a Master Subject List that will equate the identifiers to the actual donors and subjects that are a part of this study. This  
list will be kept in a secur e location and will not be part of the S ponsor’s regulatory documents. 
This information will only be made available to the S ponsor and/or their designee for routine 
verification of CRFs and also to the FDA if required for regulatory affairs.

Confidential  Page 70 of 89 The Investigator will review the CRFs for completeness and accuracy and sign and date the 
forms where indicated. Q uestions regarding missing or uninterpretable data will be 
communicated to the Principal Investigator/study coordinator for resolution and ent ered into a 
CRF correction form. The CRF correction form(s), after resolution of discrepancies, will be signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_282269] a database. All records which support CRFs of this study or follow -up must be ret ained in the files of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a minimum of two years or until notification by [CONTACT_1034], whichever is earlier.  
10.8 Independent Medical Monitor  
In addition to the Principal Investigator’s responsibility for oversight, study oversight wi ll be 
under the direction of I ndependent Medical Monitor s. The first Independent Medical Monitor is 
[CONTACT_282396], lung transplant pulmonologist at the University of Colorado, who has direct experience taking care of post -EVLP lung recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. He is al so the author of the medical journal 
article Medical Complications of Lung Transplantation. [Lyu 2009] [CONTACT_282397] is considered an 
expert in this area and well qualified to make a determination of unreasonable risk in relation to lung transplantation and EVLP.  
The second Independent Medical Monitor is [CONTACT_282398], cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Washington. [CONTACT_282399] is clinically active with lung transplantation and lung  
volume reduction surgery . 
The I ndependent Medical Monitor s are independent of the study and will be available in real 
time to review and recommend appropriate action regarding AEs and other safety issues.  Their

10.9 Protocol Violations/ Deviations  
A study deviation is defined as an event where the Study Investigator or site personnel did not conduct the study according to the study protocol, applicable laws or regulations or the Investigator agreement.  
Prior approval by [CONTACT_282369], contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to depart from procedures specified in the study protocol, except when necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject 
in an emergency. Prior approval is not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control (e.g., inadvertent mistakes, equipment failure, subject unable to do required testing due to illness).  
All study deviations will be recorded on a  Protocol Deviations form , including a  description of 
the deviation, justification for the deviation, and corrective action for the deviation. Study deviations may be discovered through a variety of sources, such as during the CRF review, telephone conversations, and site monitoring. Study dev iations should be reported to the 
applicable IRB in accordance with IRB policies and/or local laws. When relevant, ethics committees, competent authorities or the appropriate regulatory bodies should be informed. The 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc.

discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational device. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the S ponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the I nvestigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
10.12.2 Future Use of Stored Specimens and Other Identifiable Da ta 
Donor lung biopsies and EVLP perfusate samples will be obtained and stored for potential future use. Donor lung biopsies and perfusate samples will be identified only by [CONTACT_282375]#.  
Donor next of kin will provide authorization for research use of the donor lung tissue and samples taken during the EVLP process. Additionally, subject consent includes a statement that pre-transplant donor lung “biopsies (about the size of your small finger) may be taken using a 
surgical stapler,” and that “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_282272].”

10.14  Publication and Disclosure Policy  
The International Committee of  Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted 
a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or conc urrent comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a 
medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the l ike. Health 
outcomes include any biomedical or health -related measures obtained in patients or participants, 
including pharmacokinetic measures and AEs. The ICMJE policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as Cl inicalTrials.gov , which is sponsored by [CONTACT_38082]. The Sponsor will register this study in ClinicalTrials.gov within 30 days of study start, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJ E does not review specific studies to determine whether registration 
is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journ al in 
which they wish to publish.

Principal Investigator) register and repor t results of certain "applicable clinical trials:"  
The Sponsor will develop subsequent publication policies prior to locking of the study data. 
10.15  Study Closure  
Study closure is defined as a specific date that is determined by [CONTACT_214713]/ or regulatory requirements have been satisfied per the study protocol  and/or by [CONTACT_282376]. Study closure visits will be conducted at all enrolling Study Centers  in order to 
review record retention requirements with site personnel. A telephone contact [CONTACT_214715] a study closure visit if appropriate (e.g., low subject enrollment, recent monitoring visit). Monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_282377]. A detailed  Monitoring

Confidential  Page 82 of 89 Appendix 4  System Components of the Toronto EVLP System  
A schematic of the TES was shown in Figure  3. There are two classifications of system 
components :  Non -Fluid Path Hardware and Single -Use Fluid Path Disposables.  
Non-Fluid Path Hardware  
None of the following perfusion machine hardware used in the TES  touches the fluid path. 
Therefore, each can  be reused  with minimal risk of contamination.  
1. Centrifugal Pump  
The benefit of using a centrifugal pump over a roller pump for ex vivo  lung circulatory support is 
profound. Unlike a roller pump that pumps at a continuous pressure, a cent rifugal pump will 
automatically back down its pressure when the internal resistance of the lungs increases. This is 
critical when warming up a hypothermically -preserved lung which is very cold (4°C) and thus, 
very stiff. A centrifugal pump will allow more flow and pressure to go through the lung only as its vascular resistance decreases during the warm -up phase. A roller pump cannot make these 
adaptations and can only pump a constant pressure through the lung, cold or warm, potentially over-pressurizing it and causing irreparable harm. The Stöckert Centrifugal Pump (“SCP”, 
FDA#  K011838) and the Stöckert Centrifugal Pump Console (“SCPC”, FDA# K020571) are 
used by [CONTACT_282380]. The r eason  this pump was chosen over any other available pump is that the integrated flow 
sensor can be connected close to the pulmonary artery cannula, giving a much more accurate reading of flow rate at the point going into the lung.  
2. Extracorporeal Heater/Coo ler 
The TES requires controlled, step -wise heating to warm up the lung to normothermic 
temperatures (37°C) from the wet ice storage and transportation temperatures. This allows the lung to be assessed at normal physiologic temperature and full metabolic activity. After the lung is determined to be transplantable, it is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282276] -cooled down to 10°C, then placed back into a 
wet ice shippi[INVESTIGATOR_282277]. Thus, the extracorporeal 
heater/cooler must be capable of delivering contr olled liquid temperatures between 10  to 37°C. 
The Stöckert 3T (FDA#  K052601) is a full -sized, compressor -cooled cardiac perfusion 
temperature- control device. It is capable of providing up to 23 L/min of flow into the heat 
exchanger and can deliver water te mperatures from 0 to  50°C to maintain the temperature of an 
entire person during cardiac by[CONTACT_6476]. The 3T is used by [CONTACT_282381]/cooler used in the TES. The advantage that this device gives to the System i s precise, digital control of temperatures and the ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282278], minimizing warm ischemia.  
3. Volume -Controlled ICU Ventilator  
The TES requires an ICU -type ventilator to ventilate the lungs once they are at normal 
temperatures. Th e primary purpose of the ventilator is to allow physiologic respi[INVESTIGATOR_282279] (O
2 in, CO 2 out) in order to measure the lung’s ability to exchange these 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol :  PXUS [ADDRESS_344347] provide the protection. The Maquet Servo -i (FDA#  K010925) is considered the 
gold-standard of volume -control ICU ventilators, allo wing precise control of tidal volumes to 
minimize stretch injuries and pressures to protect against high airway pressures. The Servo -i is 
used by [CONTACT_282382].  
4. ABG Analyzer  
The ability  of the lung to exchange CO 2 with oxygen can be measured using a traditional blood 
gas analyzer (known as “ABG analyzer”). The Siemens Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282250] 500 ABG Analyzer (FDA#  K113216 and calibration cartridge K122398) measures PO
2, PCO 2, pH, glucose, and 
lactose, among other analytes (note:  this device is not directly connected to the TES, and therefore, is not shown in the above perfusion diagram). The Siemens Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282250] 500 Analyzer 
analyzes samples of the STEEN Solution perfusate, measuring dissolved gas levels using a 
disposable sample cartridge that is replaced monthly according to manufacturer’s instructions. The Siemens Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282280].  
Single -Use Fluid Path Disposabl es 
All devices that come into direct contact [CONTACT_282383]- use and pre -sterilized 
by [CONTACT_3455].  
1. Organ Chamber  
The design of the organ container must ensure that the organ is protected in an aseptic environment and allowed to res pi[INVESTIGATOR_282281], creating a slightly humid atmosphere to 
prevent the lung tissue from drying out. Additionally, there should be interfaces through the container to aseptically connect the lung to the perfusion circuit. Finally, as the lung starts  to 
warm -up to normothermic temperatures, the bronchial arteries will start to perfuse and slowly 
trickle the perfusate out into the container, so it must be designed to collect the leaks aseptically and to connect back to the perfusion circuit to recircul ate the captured perfusate. Currently, the 
XVIVO Organ Chamber™ is designed as a sterile, single- use container intended to be used as a 
temporary receptacle for isolated donor lungs in preparation for eventual transplantation into a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and therefore, fits the requirement . If other Organ Chambers become available, they 
may be used if they meet these criteria.  
2. Lung Cannula Set  
There are two required cannulas to connect the lung to the perfusion circuit. The first attaches to the left atrial appendage (also called a ‘cuff’) at the point where the left atrium of the heart typi[INVESTIGATOR_282282]. The objective of this cannula is to connect the soft cuff of tissue to a device that tents (keeps open) the pulmonary veins, allowing the perfusate to fl ow out of the 
veins back into the perfusion circuit. In addition, there is a pressure cannula connected to the inside (lumen) of the cannula to collect accurate left atrial pressures to ensure a slight positive pressure (3- 5 mmHg) in the atrium is maintain ed, preventing the veins from collapsing upon 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol :  PXUS [ADDRESS_344348] cases, the pulmonary artery cannula can be a straight tube going into the pulmonary artery proximal t o the point of bifurcation and therefore, perfuse both the left and 
right lungs simultaneously. However, in some cases when the heart is also procured for transplant, the pulmonary artery may not be long enough for a straight cannula and therefore, would need another flexible cannula (similar to the left atrium cannula) to be customized and anastomosed directly to the available pulmonary artery, ensuring a tight fit.   
Currently, the XVIVO Lung Cannula Pack™ fits this requirement as a sterile, single- use pa ck 
intended to be used to connect isolated donor lungs to the disposable perfusion circuit for ex- vivo 
assessment. There are three cannulas included in the Pack:  one cone- shaped left atrial cannula 
(green tape), one straight pulmonary artery cannula (yell ow tape), and one cone -shaped cannula 
(white tape) to use either as a left atrial or as a pulmonary artery cannula back -up. If other Lung 
Cannula Sets become available, they may be used if they meet these criteria.  
3. Disposable Perfusion Circuit  
The Disposab le Perfusion Circuit is a single- use, pre -sterilized, disposable extracorporeal 
perfusion circuit intended to connect to the perfusion hardware to facilitate perfusion of perfusate 
through isolated donor lungs during EVLP assessment. The components are provided by [CONTACT_282384] a preassembled, sterilized surgical pack.  
Component Overview  
The Disposable Perfusion Circuit is made up of the fluid -path components. Any part that comes 
in direct contact [CONTACT_282385]- use and packaged together as much 
as possible. In EVLP, the disposable circuit acts as the artificial circulatory system, interfacing with the centrifugal pump motor (via magnetic drive), a hollow -fiber oxygenation membrane that 
works in reverse to deoxygenate the perfusat e by [CONTACT_282386], a leukocyte filter to remove activated leukocytes, perfusion tubing, and a hard shell fluid reservoir to hold the excess perfusate. By [CONTACT_282387], a mix of gases enters the lungs in a similar proportion as physiologic venous gas. This allows the lung itself to act as the ‘oxygenator’ in the circuit, and the resulting PO
[ADDRESS_344349], tens of thousands of these procedures using identical perfusion disposables occur each year in the US alone.  
Perfusion Circuit Function  
The perfusion circuit delivers the normothermic, deoxygenated perfusate to the lungs, then returns oxygenated perfusate to the reservoir for sampling and recirculation. The steps are summarized as follows:  
1. STEEN Solution perfusate is added into the disposable circuit through a standard aseptic interface on the hard s hell reservoir. 
Toronto EVLP System   Lung Bioengineering Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol :  PXUS 14 -001, v 6.0  03 November 2017 
 
Confidential  Page 85 of 89 2. The centrifugal pump head draws the Solution out through the reservoir and pumps it through 
the membrane oxygenator, which is connected to a venous gas mix (86% nitrogen, 8% carbon dioxide, 6% oxygen) where the dissolved oxygen in the circuit is displaced to a lower physiologic level prior to entering the lungs. This is also where perfusate is heated/cooled during the EVLP procedure via conduction by [CONTACT_282388]/cooler.  
3. The Solution passes through a leukocyte reduction filter t hat traps activated leukocytes, 
preventing them from circulating back through the lung and from being transplanted into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
4. The (non- disposable) flow sensor monitors flow rate (L/min) going into the lung via interface 
from the centrifugal pump c ontrol.  
5. The deoxygenated Solution enters into the lung through the pulmonary artery.  The pulmonary artery Lung Cannula records pressure at the point of interface between the cannula and lung. This is the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).  
6. The oxygenated So lution exits the lung through the LA. The LA Lung Cannula records 
pressure at the point of interface between the cannula and left atrium. This is the left atrium pressure (LAP). 
7. The Solution drains back into the hard shell reservoir where it can be sampled  for testing of 
pH, glucose, lactose, PO
2 and PCO 2 to assess lung function. 
8. Solution temperature is monitored exiting the lung at the reservoir and entering the lung at the oxygenator. 
9. The cycle repeats until the determination is made to either transplant or turn down the lung. 
 A schematic of the perfusion circuit is shown in Figure  4.

STEEN Solution is a clear, sterile, non- pyrogenic, non- toxic physiological salt solution 
containing HSA and dextran 40. This solution is a low potassium (extracellular) electrolyte 
solution with physiological colloid -osmotic pressure (COP) designed for use as a temporary 
continuous normothermic machine perfusion solution for assessment and extended preservation of isolated donor lungs. 
The composition of STEEN Solution was designed to simulate the COP and crystalloid -osmotic 
properties of human plasma to permit safe, continuous ex- vivo lung perfusion at normothermia 
(37°C) for at least 12 hrs without the development of either tissue edema or dehydration. The 
COP and osmotic pressure of the solution were chosen to maintain optimal water balance between the cellular and the intra-  and e xtra-vascular spaces. The optimal COP is provided by a 
proprietary combination of HSA (FDA -approved source) and dextran 40. The electrolyte 
composition is essentially extra- cellular (low potassium) with a phosphate buffer. The 
composition and physical properties of STEEN Solution are shown in Table 5.

The primary mode of action  for STEEN Solution is its ability to provide optimal COP, 
permitting stable fluid compartment homeostasis for sufficient time to allow meaningful functional evaluation of the lung at 37° C. STEEN Solution, therefore mimics the in vivo  
environment without t he risk of edema formation in the absence of harmful pro- inflammatory 
cytokines and activated leucocytes associated with trauma, stress and brain death. This mode of action is primarily related to the water binding properties of albumin and its distributio ns across 
semi -permeable membranes between the intra-  and extra -vascular spaces within the lung, and is 
not based on any metabolic or pharmacological action of either colloid. Additionally, it has been shown that red blood cells are not required for STEEN Solution to carry oxygen to the lung tissue as oxygen dissolves well in this Solution , and the lung is very efficient at removing 
oxygen from the Solution.[Cypel 2007] Acellular STEEN Solution has been used by [CONTACT_282389]. 
The disposable EVLP perfusion circuit is primed with 1.5 L  of STEEN Solution prior to use. 
STEEN Solution is allowed to warm -up to room temperature d uring the priming procedure 
pre-perfusion. The medications (and dosages) are added to the 1.5 L STEEN Solution prime are

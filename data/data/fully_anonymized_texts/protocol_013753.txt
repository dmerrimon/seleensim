 [ADDRESS_1001291] blood (UCB) is a readily available alternative source of HSCs that is capable of 
reconstituting hematopoiesis after myeloablative therapy.  A recent survey by [CONTACT_732899] 180,[ADDRESS_1001292] decade of life with complications that prove 
debilitating and life threatening.  
 
Primary cellular immunodeficiencies are a group of in herited disorders characterized by [CONTACT_732900], which generally leads to early death from 
infectious complications.  These disorders can be further categorized depending on the primary 
cell lineage affected, i nto two major groups:  SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency 
syndrome) with absent T and/or B lymphocyte function and non -SCID (defective T, B  
lymphocyte , or granulocytes).  The most common non -SCID diseases include: Wiskott -Aldrich 
syndrome (WAS), T cell  deficiencies (Omenn syndrome, HLA -class II deficiency, CD40 ligand 
deficiency), Phagocytic -cell disorders (agranulocytosis, Chronic granulomatous disorders, 
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency), and Hemophagocytic syndromes (Familial 
Lymphohistiocytosis, Chedia k-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome).  While improved 
supportive care has extended the life span of patients affected by [CONTACT_732901] s and recent 
advances in gene therapy hold significant promise, definitive cure is g enerally only achieved by 
[CONTACT_732902]  (HSCT) . 
 
The storage diseases represent a diverse group of lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders.  Single 
gene defects involving a lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme or vital peroxisomal function lead to these 
devastating diseas es and their systemic abnormalities affect multiple organs including the brain.  
Progressive loss of neurodevelopmental milestones and/or neurologic function is common.  
Shortened life -expectancy is often due to cardiopulmonary disease.  Treatment options depend 
upon the stage of disease and rate of progression , and include HSCT, enzyme replacement 
(ERT), substrate depletion and  gene therapy.  The clinical response to ERT is variable, 
depending upon the disease, the organ or tissue  involved  the dose of enzy me, and the schedule of 
 [ADDRESS_1001293] a n 
attractive alternative to ameliorate/cure  the disease , with best results obtained if the procedure is 
performed in the early stages of the disease.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1001294] was performed in an infant with  SCID who remains 
well more than 3 decades following an HLA -matched sibling transplant.  Transplantation of 
unmodified BM from an HLA -identical sibling remains the treatment of choice for infants with 
SCID in wh om overall survival now exceeds 90% if the tr ansplant i s performed early .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 
later median age of transplant due to the time needed to perform a search, some groups report 
good outcomes (OS 63 -67%) with  unrelated donor  transplant s.  Grunebaun et al .23 reported that 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732891] 2 year overall survival ( 81%) 
compared to  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732892] s (53%).  Antoine et al.24 reported 3 -
year survival , with evidence of sustained engraftment and improvement of the immunodeficiency 
disorder , which was significantly better for HLA -identical than for HLA -mismatched 
transplantation (77% vs 54%; p=0.002).  The main causes of death were infections; graft vs host 
disease, toxic effects of the conditioning regimen and rejection24. 
 
In selected  lysosomal and peroxisomal inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) such as Hurlers 
syndrome (MPS I), Maroteaux -Lamy syndrome (MPS IV), α -mannosidosis, childhood onset 
cerebral X -linked adrenoleukodystrophy (COCALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and 
globoid -cell leukodystrophy (GLD), timely HSCT positively modif ies the natural history of the 
disease by [CONTACT_732903].  Some benefit has also been described from engraftment of donor -derived  glial cells in the 
brain.  Stem cell transplant is currently the only method of providing a self -replenishing source of 
enzyme to these patients.  Transplantation of marrow stem cell from a non -deficient donor will 
provide cells of the monocyte /macrophag e system which are of donor origin and therefore 
competent to produce the target enzyme.  These donor derived cells replace the host fixed tissue 
macrophages in the liver, bone, lung, lymph nodes, and skin.  At least for some of the lysosomal 
and peroxisom al storage diseases, enzyme produced in the fixed tissue macrophage system is 
capable of uptake into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_504005], where it is targeted to lysosomes.  By [CONTACT_223810] , 
accumulated storage material can be hydrolyzed, reduc ing  organomegaly and stabiliz ing or 
improv ing organ function.  Since the marrow continuously  replenishes the body with donor fixed 
tissue macrophages, the effects can be expected to be permanent. Over [ADDRESS_1001295] of this experience is with matched related bone marrow transplantation.  
The rates of engraftment and 2 yr OS ranged between 60 -65% and 50%, respectively.  
 
In most of these congenital diseases , the outc omes  of HSCT is affected mainly by (1) age at 
transplantation, (2) stem cell source, with best results using HLA -identical sibling donors, (3) 
timing of HSCT, in which delay can substantially compromise effectiveness of HSCT, (4) type 
of preparative regimen, a nd (5) cell dose.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1001296] blood (UCB) has become an acceptable and sometimes a preferred stem 
cell source b ecause of its availability and lower incidence of graft -vs-host-disease (GvHD).  
Recent studies showed that patients transplanted at a very young age (2 -3 yrs/old) before the 
onset of clinical symptoms can develop neurologically at a normal rate [ADDRESS_1001297] transplantation (UCBT) was performed in 1988, in a child with Fanconi 
Anemia.  Since then, several thousand UCBT has been performed for malignant and non -
malignant disorders.  
 
In a recent report by [CONTACT_732904] , Kutzberg  et al.19, [ADDRESS_1001298] blood transplant.  A total of 97% achieved high (>  90%) donor 
chimerism with normalization of serum enzyme levels.  In a multivariate analysis, patient age of 
2 year s or younger at transplantation, more than 2.1  x 105/kg of infused CD34, and more than 5.7 
x 104/kg of infused CFUs were favorable factors for neutrophil engraftment. Grade III -IV acute 
GvHD occurred in 10.3% of patients.  Extensive cGvHD occurred  in 10.8%  of patients by 1 
year.  Overall survival at 1 and 5 years was 71.8% and 58% in all patients.  8 patients had graft 
failure for an incidence of 12.9% .[ADDRESS_1001299] blood transplant.  In a report by [CONTACT_732905] .14, a graft nucleated cell dose >  
3.7 x 107/kg was associated with shorter time to neutrophil recovery (25  days vs 35 days). 
Similarly, Rubinstein et al .7,16 demonstrated that a step -wise increase in graft nucleated cell dose 
was associated with progressively shorten ed time to neutrophil recovery.  Rubinstein et al .16 
suggested that the threshold was a cryopreserved nucleated cell  dose > 2.5 x 107/kg; while the 
Minnesota group observed a threshold for the infused CD34+ cell dose of > 1.7 x 105/kg5.  Other 
prognostic factors have also been reported but these have not been consistently observed.  As one 
example, Rubinstein et al .7,16 observed a relationship between HLA match and neutrophil 
recovery (23 days for HLA matched vs 28 days for HLA mismatched grafts, p  = 0.0027); this 
association was not observed by [CONTACT_732905] .14 and Wagner et al .5 
 
In larger series the neutrophil engraf tment has been reported as high as 92% .5  The incidence of 
acute GvHD reported in larger series ranges from 33 -44% to 11 -22% for grades II -IV and III -IV 
acute GvHD, respectively9-12.  The incidence of chronic GvHD ranges from 0 -25%.9-[ADDRESS_1001300] for P rimary Immunodeficiency Diseases 
(PID).  Although PI[INVESTIGATOR_29721], make up a small proportion of disorders amenable t o treatment by [CONTACT_59513], 
cord blood is an ideal source for many of these patients , who are often  small , so th at the limited 
stem cell dose in a cord blood unit is often adequate.  Diaz de Heredia et al .21 reported an 
engraftment rate of 100% in 15 p atien ts wit h SCIDs after UCBT.  Of these patients , 33% 
 7 developed Grade III-IV aGvHD and 9% developed cGvHD.  The overall survival reported at 5 
years was 73% with a follow -up post transplant of [ADDRESS_1001301] common causes of 
death included grade IV aGvHD and i nterstitial viral pneumonitis.  Nine of the fifteen patients 
received horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG).  One of those patients died of aGvHD after 
receiving a 4/[ADDRESS_1001302] unit.  Only one patient of 11 patients receiving a unit matched at 
5-6 antig ens developed aGvHD III -IV.21 
 
Bhattacharya et al.22 reported a very low incidence of GvHD after a 6/6 HLA antigen matched 
UCBT for PI[INVESTIGATOR_732893] (2/14).   They reported a median time of 
neutrophil engraftment of 22 days and a media n time of 51 days  to platelet independence .  
Patients with high risk diagnosis and increase risk of graft failure (MHC class II, Reticular 
dysgenesis, Omen syndrome) were successfully transplanted with 100% chimerism in all cell 
lineages after the use of a conditioning regimen.  There was an increase mixed chimerism in 
patients transplanted without a conditioning regimen.  The reported overall survival was 86%.22 
 
Hence, UCB transplants offe r several advantages over adult  bone marrow or peripheral blood 
stem cell transplants, including : 1) rapid availability, 2) absence of donor risk, 3) low risk of 
transmissible infectious diseases, 4) low risk of acute GvHD in the setting of  HLA mismatch  (as 
compared to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732894] b lood) .  UCB is particularly 
beneficial for patients of ethnic and racial minority descent for whom adult marrow and blood 
donors often cannot be identified.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1001303] include non -availability of the donor for  booster stem cell 
infusion , lack of viral specific cytotoxic T cells, slower engraftment and small stem cell dose.  
Infectio n related treatment related mortality is  still of concern after UCBT ; rates of h emopoietic 
recovery ar e slower after UCBT; therefore infectious complications including viral infections  or 
reactivations  occur frequently.   The two major cause s of death after umbilical cord blood 
transplantation for congenital disorders reported in the literature ar e graft fa ilure (20%) and 
infection (15 %). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1001304] suggested .16, 17 
 
We will attempt to decrease the rate of viral infection and reactivation  by [CONTACT_732906] 
(thymoglobulin) from our conditioning regimen and substitut ing mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ). 
We anticipate that the removal of ATG will facilitate immune reconstitution after UCBT .  The 
addition  of fludarabine should compensate for any increase d risk of graft failure due to removal 
of the ATG.

7.0  STUDY DRUGS  
7.1  Busulfan  
7.1.1  Therapeutic Classification:  Bifunctional alkylating agent . 
 
7.1.2  Pharmaceutical Data:  Busulfan (Busulfex Injection® Orphan Medical) is 
supplied as a sterile solution in single -use ampules containing 60 mg at a concentration of 
6 mg/mL.  It is provided as a mixture of demethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethylene 
glycol 400 (PEG400).  
 
7.1.3  Solution Preparation:  Busulfan solution for injection must be diluted with  0.9% 
Sodium Chlor ide Injection (NS) .  The diluent quantity must be 10 times the  volume of 
busulfan, ensuring that the final concentration is 0.5 mg/ mL.  Sample ca lculation for a 50 
kg patient: (50 kg) x (0.8 mg/kg of busulfan)  = 40 mg = 6.7 mL.  6.7 mL of busulfan + 67 
mL of NS = 74 mL total volume.  Final concentration: 0.54 mg/ mL. 
 
7.1.4  Stability and Storage Requirements:   After dilution with NS or D5W, busulfan is 
stable at room temperature (25 degrees Celsius) for [ADDRESS_1001317] be 
completed withi n that t ime.  Prior to mixing: s tore under refrigeration (2 to 8 degrees 
Celsius).  Busulfan for injection is stable at 4 C for at least 12 months.  
 
7.1.5  Route of Administration:  Busulfan should be administered intravenously via a 
central venous catheter as a t wo-hour infusion.  
 
7.1.6  Usual Dosage Range:   0.8-1.1 mg/kg/dose given every 6 hours for a total of 16 
doses.  For patients  12 kg a dose of 1 .1 mg/kg/dose will be used , and for patients > 12 
 17 kg the starting dose will be 0.8 mg/kg/dose.  Doses are based on actual body weight, 
unless the patient’s weight is greater than 30% of ideal body weight, then dosing will be 
based on adjusted weight of ideal plus 25%.  Busulfan pharmacokinetics will be 
performed on all patients with dose adjustment as appropriate.  
 
7.1.7  Pharmacokinetics:   Doses will be adjusted to achieve the desired plasma area 
under  the curve (AUC) of 800 – 1200 µmol/min/L.  Doses will be adjusted as necessary 
pending the results of the first dose pharmacokinetics.  For patients whose AUC values 
are greater than 5% outside the acceptable AUC range, the dose will be adjusted t o 
achieve a target AUC of 1125 µmol/min/L (midpoint of acceptable range) not to exceed a 
maximum dose of 1.6 mg/kg per dose of busulfan.  
 
7.1.8  Side-Effects:   Myelosuppressio n, neurotoxicity (manifesting as seizures), mild to 
moderate nausea and vomiting, mild to moderate tachycardia, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
sterility, and rarely hepatotoxicity (hepatic veno -occlusive disease) and pulmonary 
toxicity (interstitial fibrosis).  
 
7.1.9  Special Precautions:   Increased toxicity in obese patients unless dose is adjusted 
appropriately. Generalized seizures have been reported after use of high dose busulfan.  
Phenytoin /fosphenytoin  will be given in accordance with TCH Formulary  guidelin es. 
 
7.1.10  Mechanism of Action :  Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent in which two 
labile methanesulfonate groups are attached to opposite ends of a four -carbon alkyl chain.  
In aqueous media, busulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate gr oups.  This 
produces reactive carbonium ions that can alkylate DNA.  DNA damage is thought to be 
responsible for much of the cytotoxicity of busulfan.  
 
7.1.11  Human Pharmacology:   Busulfan can be administered orally or intravenously.  
Busulfan achieves le vels in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_732896].  Busulfan is 
predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_43603], both spontaneously and by 
[CONTACT_159441] S -transferase (GST) catalysis.  This conjugate undergoes further extensive 
oxidative metabol ism in the liver.  Approximately 30% of busulfan and metabolites can 
be recovered in the urine within 48 hours after administration.  
 
7.2  CYTOXAN  (CTX, Cyclophosphamide ) - Commercially Available  
7.2.1  Formulation :  Oral drug is supplied as 25 m g and 50 m g tablets. Injectable form is 
available as lyophilized cakes  containing 100 mg, 200 mg, or 500 mg of active drug , and 
75 mg of mannitol per 100 mg of active drug in  single -use vials.  
 
7.2.2  Storage :  Cytoxan  is to be kept dry and at room temperature until  reconstitution 
and use.  
 
7.2.3  Stability :  All preparations are stable at room temperature (not to exceed 30  
degrees Celsius ). Discard reconstituted solutions  after 24 hours at room temperature; 
stable up to 6 days if refrigerated (2 -8 degrees C elsius ). Since there is no  preservative, 
precautions should be taken to insure sterility, or solution should be discarded within 8  
 18 hours. The parenteral form of cytoxan  prepared as a liquid oral preparation diluted to <  2 
mg/mL can be refrigerated (2 -8 degrees Celsius) for up to 14 days.  
 
7.2.4  Administration :  50 mg/kg will be given IV over 2 hours daily for a total of 4 
doses.  It can be given over 1 to 4 hours (as needed and as determined by [CONTACT_30780]).  Cyclophosphamide may be diluted in D5NS 200 m L/m2.

clinical activity is observed in B cell malignancies.  
 
7.3.11  Human Pharmacology :  Fludarabine can only be given via intravenous route.  
Renal excretion accounts for 23%.  Half -life is 10 hours.  
 
8.0  EVALUATION OF TOXICITIES  
The criteria listed in the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Scale will be used in grading toxicity. 
(Version 4.0 located at http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  GVHD will be graded by [CONTACT_732912][INVESTIGATOR_20360] . (see Appendix I) . 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1001320] 
types of patients reduces the incidence of grade II -IV GvHD to about 35% with commonly used 
regimens of today.   Recent reports showed an incidence of aGvHD grade III -IV of 10% (Prasad 
 20 et al. , Blood 2008).  Chronic GvHD is a multio rgan autoimmune disease usually requiring 
therapy with steroids and other  immunosuppressives.  It is seen in about 30% of adults 
undergoing transplant and lower percenta ge of children.  The risk of cGv HD after UCBT for 
congenital pediatric diseases ha s been reported to be as low as 8%  (unpublished data of the 
University of Minnesota ; Martinez , C., Orchard, P.  and Tolar, J.) . 
 
9.3  Additional Risks  
The degree of immune suppression of marrow transplant patients leads to an increased risk of 
opportunistic infe ctions, especially those due to CMV, HSV, EBV, Pneumocystis, and other 
viruses and fungi.  Prophylaxis is given where possible (Acyclovir, Bactrim, Antifungal, and 
antibacterial mouth rinses, etc.), and treatment for suspected agents is initiated very prom ptly, 
usually before the infection is confirmed.  
 
Partial or incomplete T cell function sometimes leads to immune dysregulation and has been 
associated with autoimmune phenomena in patients with primary immune deficiency.  These 
phenomena include but are n ot limited to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia.  These complications may occur as a result of the underlying immune 
deficiency or from incomplete reconstitution following allogeneic SCT.  
 
Patients with SCID or PID may be at ris k for malignancy, in particular lymphoreticular 
malignancies often associated with primary or reactivated EBV infection.  The risk for these 
cancers remains high in patients until immune recovery has been attained.  
 
Other complications of an unexpected nat ure may be seen. In fact, most every patient present s 
with some new or very rare complication during transplant.  There is a chance the patient could 
die from this treatment or from side effects of the treatment such as bleeding or infection.  
Patients are made aware of this possibility.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1001321] 60%. Accrual 
of pediatric patients with congenital diseases who are eligible to receive umbilical cord blood 
transplant is about 3 subjects per year. If we suppose that a true 1 -year overall survival rate of 
40% would not be unac ceptable, then we would need to accrue [ADDRESS_1001322] 80% power to 
detect the deficiency in overall survival (with alpha level 0.05 and one -sided testing). The 
accrual period is [ADDRESS_1001323] 3 years or till death for each patient.  
 
10.2  Monitoring Overall Survival  
The primary outcome of overall survival will be compared to a fixed null hypothesis 1 -year 
survival rate of 40% by a one -sided . Survival data and toxicity data will be summarized and 
monitored every year by [CONTACT_732913].  
 
10.3  Statistical Analysis  
 21 In addition to routine summary statistics for the outcome data, we will compute Kaplan -Meier 
estimates and confidence intervals for time to overall survival, disease -free survival, graft failure  
and length of remission.  Additionally, w e will also calculate incidence rates and 95% confidence 
intervals for engraftment, acute Gv HD, neutrophil and platelet recovery at Day 42. As requested 
by [CONTACT_732914] -DRC, these short -term secondary endpoints will also b e analyzed according to the two 
cohorts defined by [CONTACT_732915] G -CSF (G -CSF starting at Day +7 vs. G -CSF starting after Day 
+7).  It should be noted that these analyses are exploratory, because the timing of G -CSF is not 
the goal of the study, hence not powered.  
 
11.0  RECORDS TO BE KEPT  
 
The CAGT data manager will maintain a database documenting the clinical parameters as well as 
the chemistries and hematologic parameters.  The clinical status and occurrence of any adverse 
events and subsequent intervent ions are to be kept on all patients.  
 
 Imaging reports  
 Surgical summaries  
 Autopsy summaries, where appropriate  
 Informed consent documents  
 
All required clinical evaluation records will be t he responsibility of [CONTACT_329398] , who will also 
be responsible for analysis of the clinical outcome and toxicity.  
 
The laboratory evaluation of immunological efficacy will be t he responsibility of [CONTACT_329398] .

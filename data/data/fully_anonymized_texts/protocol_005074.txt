Overall 
Objective  The objective of this study is to evaluate the Zip Surgical Skin 
Closure device versus conventional steel staple placement when 
utilized for surgical wound closure after bi late ral unicompartmental 
(UNI) or bi lateral total knee replacement (TKA).  
Study Device  ZipLine Medical Inc., Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
Indication for 
Use The Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device is indicated for use during 
and after skin incision procedures to approximate skin and hold 
together the skin edges until healing can take place.  
Study Design  A prospective, non -blinded, randomized, within patient control 
study .  A total of up to 25 subjects ( targeted min. n=22) requiring 
bilateral knee arthroplasty (unicompartmental or total) will be 
enrolled.  Each subject will serve as their own control, since one 
knee closure will be  with staples, and  the other knee closure with 
Zip device. The order of patients will be randomized to receive Zip 
device on one knee and steel staples on the opposing knee.  
Number of 
Subjects  A total of up to 25 patients  (serving as their own control) will be 
enrolled.  There is anticipated patient fall out (screen failures) post 
procedure due to surgeon not knowing which procedure is required 
(total or unicompartmental) until time of surgery.

20.2  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU)  [ADDRESS_308192] is magnified with 
commonly performed elective procedures such as knee arthroplasty [1].  Sutures and staples are most 
commonly used based on surgeon preference and wound location. Staples are frequently used due to their 
deployment speed advantage over sutures.  It has been suggested that the ideal method of wound/incision 
closure should be fast and non -traumatic, be associated with a low incidence  of dehiscence and infection, 
and should yield acceptable cosmetic results; and while sutures and staples are present ly the most co mmon 
method of surgical closure , they do not demonstrate many of these properties  [1,2]. Therefore, developi[INVESTIGATOR_253350].  
ZipLine Medical, Inc. has developed a novel, non -invasive skin closure device  called  “Zip Surgical Skin 
Closure”  to replace sutures, staples a nd glue for closure of the skin layer for surgical incisions or laceration 
repair.  The device is FDA Class I, 510(k) Exempt and began commercial use in the [LOCATION_003] in April 2013.  
The device is designed to provide closure speed superior to sutures, while resu lting in a suture -like cosmetic 
outcome.  Both pre -clinical feasibility study data and feedback from over 2000  human cases during the 
device’s commercial use in the [LOCATION_003] suggest that these design intentions  are correct.  This study will test 
these assertion s in a controlled clinical setting, with the goal of providing results with statistical significance.     
We anticipate this clinical study to be completed within 12 months  from site initiation/training to site 
closure.

H&E staining was performed on representative cross -sections of incisions closed with traditional suture 
techniques vs. the ZipLine device.  The width and depth of the resulting scars as well as the degree of local 
inflammatory response were evaluated by a pathologist  blinded to the closure method .  The degrees of 
scarring and inflammation were deemed to be qualitatively equivalent between the two groups.  
This was an internal feasibility study and the results have not been published.  
  
3.2.[ADDRESS_308198] -market study was recently completed  at Mt. Sinai School of 
Medicine’s Division of Mohs, Reconstructive, and Cosmetic Surgery .  The study compared  suture control to 
an earlier variant of the Zip Surgical Skin Closure device for skin cancer excision .  The manuscript has been 
completed and submitted to a peer -reviewed journal for publication.  
Preliminary clinical study results from this study were presented at the 16th Annual Moun t Sinai Winter 
Symposium on Advances in Medical and Surgical Dermatology which took place Dec. 6 -8, 2013 in New 
York.  
Hooman Khorasani, M.D.,  Chief of the Division of Mohs, Reconstructive, and Cosmetic Surgery at Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine, and princip al investigator for the study presented the preliminary results to an 
audience of over 400 dermatological surgeons.  He is deeply involved in minimal scar wound repair research 
and has done extensive research in this area of scar -less wound healing. He is currently conducting two 
clinical trials addressing improved scarring after surgery.  

   
“In the study, the ZipLine  device produced similar cosmetic outcomes to a traditional suture closure while 
significantly reducing the treatment time, which can in turn reduce the overall cost of the procedure.  In 
addition, since with the ZipLine there are no sutures to remove, thi s limited the need for immediate patient 
return, which can benefit both the patient and clinic.  The patient can instead return later when the wound is 
more healed,” said [CONTACT_253381].  The preliminary data suggested a 57% reduction in wound closure 
proce dure time when using the ZipLine device instead of sutures.   
UC San Diego CIED (Pacemaker) Study  – 
A blinded, controlled and randomized study is currently underway at UC San Diego. Most cases have 
already been completed with promising results. A total of 40 patients underwent pacemaker or defibrillator 
insertions, and skin closure was randomly assigned to either subcuticular sutures or the Zip Surgical Skin 
Closure device. Primary endpoints for the study are closure time and cosmesis.  
The Zip Surgical Skin  Closure Device is an FDA Class I, 510(k) Exempt device, and no clinical studies 
were required  for regulatory clearance.  The aforementioned clinical studies are post -market studies  aimed at 
providing statistically significant performance data regarding th e Zip device.  
3.3 Risks and Benefits  
3.3.1  Risks  
Complications that may occur include:  
• Allergic response  
• Infection  
• Dehiscence requiring intervention  
• Device failure / malfunction  
• Edema  
• Wound site pain / discomfort  
• Excessive scarring  including:  
o Step-off 
o Contour irre gularities  
o Excessive distortion  
o Poor cosmetic appearance  
Previous evaluations have not shown any additional risks in comparison to those associated with existing 
wound closure methods.  
3.3.2  Benefits  
The potential benefits of the Zip Surgical Skin Closure device over staples  include: 
• Improved cosmetic outcome  

 • Equivalent adverse event (e.g., dehiscence, infection) occurrence  
• Greater patient satisfaction  
• Reduced risk of surgical site infection due to the ZIP device’s non-invasive application  
• Reduced number and expertise (MD vs. PA)  of resources required for  closure   
This study is intended to measure the result of some or all of these benefits . 
 
 
4 Device Description  
4.1  Device Overview  
ZipLine Medical, Inc. has developed a novel, non -invasive skin closure device called “Zip  Surgical Skin 
Closure” to replace sutures, staples and glue for closure of the skin layer for surgical incisions or laceration 
repair.  The device is designed to provide closure speed superior to sutures,  while resulting in a suture -like 
cosmetic outcome.  Both pre -clinical feasibility study data and feedback from over 2000  human cases during 
the device’s commercial use in the [LOCATION_003] suggest that these design intentions  are correct.  This study will test 
these assertions in a controlled clinical setting, with the goal of providing results with statistical significance.     
The Zip device is a single use, sterile medical device.  
 
 
Figure 1. Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
 
The Zip Sur gical Skin Closure Device is applied to clean, dry skin after deeper tension -relieving (i.e., 
dermal or subcutaneous) sutures have been applied.  
The device adheres to the skin adjacent to an incision by [CONTACT_253363] -sensitive skin adhesives.  A 
combinat ion of acrylic and hydrocolloid adhesives are used to provide a skin -friendly environment while 
providing the necessary tack to maintain skin adhesion during the recommended wear time of the device (7 -
14 days).  

  
Figure 2. Adjusting Incision Closure Tension  
 
The device remains o n the skin for the recommended 7 -14 days.  During this period, patients may shower 
(but not soak in a tub or pool) with the device on.  The device is removed by [CONTACT_253364], taking care not to apply stress to the incision.  If there is a risk of skin 
strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], an adhesive removal agent may be used during removal.  
 
 
Figure 3. Key Components of  the Zip Surgical Skin Closure Device  
In addition to the pressure -sensitive adhesives, the device’s closure and force distribution components are 
made up of polyurethane monofilm, polyethylene tape, polyester and nylon.

 After application, the surgeon appro ximates the incision edges and tensions the wound by [CONTACT_253365].  Once the desired tension is achieved, the excess strap ends are 
trimmed with scissors, and a conventional absorptive dressing may be applied.   
4.2 Regulatory Status  
The Zip Surgical Skin Closure is a FDA Class I, 510(k) Exempt device.  
In 2010, ZipLine Medical, Inc. submitted a “513(g)” request for product classification to the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  In July 2010, ZipLine Medical re ceived a letter from the FDA indicating that 
FDA reviewers “ believe the ZipLine 1 System falls within Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
880.5240, Medical adhesive tape and adhesive bandage (Product Code - KGX).  A Medical adhesive tape 
and a dhesive bandage is a Class I type device, exempt from the premarket notification [510(k)] 
requirements of the Act, subject to the limitations of the exemption found in 21 CRF 880.9.”  
Quality System Regulations:  The Zip Surgical Skin Closure Devices have b een developed and are 
manufactured in full compliance with FDA Title [ADDRESS_308199] keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], servicing, and statistical 
techniques.  
Origin of Manufacture:  The Zip ® brand Surgical Ski n Closure Devices are manufactured in the [LOCATION_003].  
Company Registration:  ZipLine Medical, Inc. is registered with the FDA in compliance with Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 807, Subparts A -D. 
4.[ADDRESS_308200].  
4.4 Device Labeling  
The Zip Surgical Skin Closure Devices are labeled  in full compliance with FDA Title 21 CF R Part 820 
Quality System Regulations .  Each device label includes the device name, part number, lot number and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (use by) date.  The devices are provided sterile, each in a sealed pouch designed for aseptic 
handoff into a sterile field.  The devices are provided in boxes of 10 individually packaged devices, and a 
copy of the device Instructions For Use (IFU) accompanies each box of 10 devices.    
4.5 Commercial Status and Clinical Experience  
The Zip device has  been commercially available since April 2013, with over 2000  clinical cases conducted 
in the [LOCATION_003], and  approximately 60% of these cases being orthopedic procedures .  Feedback fro m these cases 
includes the following:   
• Orthopedic surgeons generally  close in several layers, including a deep dermal layer.  
• Devices a re typi[INVESTIGATOR_253351] 10 -14 days.   
• Orthopedic surgeons have indicated that they  are impressed with the ease of applicat ion 
at the end of a case; in some cases  surgeo ns delegated  skin closure with the Zip  to an 
assistant, such as a Physician’s Assistant in the sterile field.  They also felt that the 
outcomes were excellent at the time of removal.  
• Orthopedic surgeons  liked t he ability to cut the device to match the incision size  and to 
combine devices for longer incisions . 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_308201] -market study is to evaluate scar appearance / cosmesis 
associated with the use of the Zip Surgical Skin Closure versus conventional staples when utilized 
for surgical wound closure after bilateral knee arthroplasty ( unico mpartmental or total) .  For safety 
analysis, the rate of adverse events up to [ADDRESS_308202] staples.  
5.1 Sample Size  
A total of up to 2 5 subjects  (targeted min. n=22)  requiring bilateral knee arthroplasty 
(unicompartmental or total)  will be enrolled.  There is anticipated patient fall out (screen 
failures) post procedure due to surgeon not knowing exactly which procedure is required 
(total or unicompartmental) until ti me of surgery. Subjects who are initially enrolled in the 
study and surgery results in  a total knee on one side and a unicompartmental on the other 
side will be exited from the study and not included in the final analysis. Each subject will 
serve as their own control since one knee closure will be with staples, and the other knee 
closure with Zip  device .  The order of patients will be randomized to receive Zip device 
on one knee and steel staples on the opposing knee.

There is one primary endpoint  for the study, i.e. Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) for incision 
appearance at the final (6 to 8 week ) follow -up evaluation  for gathering C VAS scores .  The purpose is to 
reveal  superior cosmesis results of Zip device  in comparison to standard staple closure . The sample size 
determined , per Section  7, for this study is up to [ADDRESS_308218] staples  administered .  A 1-sided  paired  “t” test will be performed 
to reject the H0 with >95% confidence . Alpha Error for the [ADDRESS_308219] = 0. 025.   
The assumption (hypothesis)  for CVAS is :    
H0:  Zipline CVAS scores  will not be superior to  CVAS scores for staples.  
HA: Zipline CVAS scores will be superior to CVAS s cores for s taples.  
 Since CVAS scores are measured on a 0 – 10 Likert scale for quality of closure, a distribution analysis will 
also be performed with summary statistics to show that the incisions closed with the Zip devices  result in a 
cosmetically superior  scar as compared to th e incisions closed with staples.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary “Effectiveness” Endpoints Analyses  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints include surgeon and patient closure method satisfaction, scar appearance 
satisfaction and patient pain and comfort surveys. All  results will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  
9.2.3  Safety  
Cumulative adverse events from time of closure to final visit ( [ADDRESS_308220] op)  will be collected, 
analyzed and  summarized by  [CONTACT_253369] .   Separate tables will be constructed for (a) all reported 
adverse events, (b) adverse events reported as closure device related, and /or (d) serious adverse events.   
The primary safety analysis will be the overall comparison between Zip and staple  adverse events.  
 
9.3 Sample Size Justification  
 
Since this is a Bilateral Study, with CVAS scores (Scores:   0 – 10), a paired “t” significant test is the most 
appropriate test as there is only one variable changing with the patients, i.e., type of  closure device.    A 
paired “t” test has more statistical power as well, and is more appropriate since the results will be comparing 
the treatment and control in a paired fashion.  
The targeted  minimum sample size of  n=22 subjects (paired observations) was determined assuming  an 
average difference (∆)  > 1.0, an hypothesized standard deviation of ~1.5, with the Power of Test  set at 
90%.   Alpha Error for the test of differences = 0.025. 
 
10 Data Management – Data Collection and Processing  
Conventional paper -based CRFs will be used.   Investigators are responsible for the accurate completion and 
timely submission of the data collected during the study.  All data from the study will be entered into CRFs.  
Any data issues are to be promptly addressed with the investigator by [CONTACT_253370] .  Investigator 
and staff training will take place prior to subject enrollment  to ensure that complete, accurate and timely data 
are submitted, that protocol requirements are followed and that complications, adverse events and adverse 
device ef fects are correctly reported and investigated, as appropriate.  Investigators are to maintain all source 
documents as required by [CONTACT_760], including laboratory results, supporting medical records, and signed 
Informed Consent forms.  The source documen ts will be used during the regular monitoring visits to verify 
information from the database against data contained on the completed CRFs.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253355] e pre -procedure evaluation.  Data for enrolled subjects will be entered into CRFs provided by [CONTACT_429].  All data should be entered completely, promptly and legibly.  For source documents, corrections 
should be made in a manner that does not obscure or eliminate the original error, by [CONTACT_253371], and initialing and dating the change, along with the reason for the change (if not 
obvious).   
Study Exit CRFs are completed for all enrolled subjects, regardless if they di d or did not complete the study 
(e.g., subject discontinuation, study termination).  
 
 
 11 Monitoring Procedures  
11.1 Monitoring  
Monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made periodically during the study, to ensure that all aspects of 
the current, approved protocol/amendment(s) are followed. Original source documents will be reviewed for 
verification of data in the case repo rt forms . The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original 
source documents by [CONTACT_253372]. personnel  and their designees .  
It is important that the Investigator and relevant study personnel are available during the monitoring visi ts 
and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
Phone contacts and site visits will be conducted to ensure that the protocol is being followed and that any 
protocol deviations are properly documented.  Clinical monitoring will include a verification  that Informed 
Consent was properly obtained for all enrolled study participants, a review of clinical records for accuracy 
and completeness, resolution of missing or inconsistent results and a review of source documents.  The 
clinical monitor will verify that the Case Report Forms (CRFs) are in agreement with the source 
documentation and other records.  The investigator will make available to the clinical monitor for review all 
Informed Consent documents, access to completed CRFs, source documentation, ori ginal laboratory data 
and other relevant records for all enrolled subjects at the site.  It is important that the investigator and other 
relevant site personnel are available for consultation with the clinical monitors during the monitoring visits 
and that  sufficient time is devoted at the site to the monitoring process.  
Additionally, telephone and/or e -mail contact [CONTACT_106192] a regular basis with the investigator and 
the site staff to ensure that the protocol is being followed and to address any issues that may occur during the 
course of the study.  
If a deficiency is noted during an on -site visit (or at any other time during the course of the study), the 
clinical monitor is required to discuss the situation with the investigator and the Sponsor (i f required) to 
secure compliance.  Any protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB within the required timelines.  
 
 
12 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
12.1 Site Training  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representatives will provide instructional 
material to the study sites, as appropriate;  
• Instruct the Investigators and study personnel on the protocol, the completion of the CRFs, 
and stu dy procedures  
• Communicate regularly with site personnel via mail, email, telephone, and/or fax  
• Make periodic visits to the study site.  
During those visits, the Sponsor or its representatives will monitor the subject data recorded in the paper 
CRFs against source documents at the study site.  
   
12.[ADDRESS_308221]’s office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l medical records at 
regular intervals throughout the study.  These inspections are for the purpose of verifying adherence to the 
protocol, and completeness and exactness of the data being transcribed onto the CRF . 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_106146] w ill inform the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee in advance if they 
are to be audited or inspected by [CONTACT_106198].  The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee will also 
inform the site if they are made aware of a pending audit or inspection by a reg ulatory agency.  
 
 
13 Adverse Events   
13.1 General  
 
All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be monitored from the time of treatment 
through [ADDRESS_308222] be rec orded. A description of the event, including the start date, resolution date, 
action taken, and the outcome should be provided, along with the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship between the AE , the study treatment and the study procedure.  
  The following definitions for rating severity of adverse events will be used:  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; 
causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would not require 
medication or a medi cal evaluation; signs or symptoms are transient.  
Moderate  Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires symptomatic 
treatment.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of the subject’s 
usual activity and requires treatment.  
 
The following definitions will be used to rate the relationship of the adverse event to the study treatment and 
the study procedure.  
Not Related  • not associated with device application  
• due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effe ct of another device or drug  
 
Possible  • temporal sequence between device application and event  is such that the 
relationship is not unlikely  or subject’s condition or concomitant therapy 
could have caused the adverse event  
 
Probable  • temporal sequence is relevant or 
• event abates upon device removal  
 
Definitely 
Related  • temporal sequence is relevant and  
• event abates upon device removal or 
 • reappearance of the event on repeat device re -application  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which leads to:   
• Death  due to any cause  
• Life-threatening condition  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266]  
• Necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to 
a body structure  
 
All SAE’s will be reported.  
Device -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is  considered to be device -related when, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, the clinical event has a reasonable time sequence associated with use of the device and is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other procedures or medications.  It i s reasonable to believe 
that the device directly caused or contributed to the adverse event.  
Procedure -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be procedure -related when, in the 
judgment of the Investigator; it is reasonable to believe tha t the event is associated with the assigned study 
procedure and is not specific to the device used.  Other products, surgical techniques, or medications 
required specifically for the procedure are likely to have contributed to the occurrence of the event.  
Concomitant Medication -Related Adverse Event:  an adverse event is considered to be concomitant 
medication related when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is 
associated with concomitant medications used in conju nction with the device and is not otherwise specific to 
the device (e.g. bleeding associated with anticoagulation medication).  
Pre-Existing Condition -Related Adverse Event:  an adverse event is considered to be related to a pre -
existing condition when, in t he judgment of the Investigator, it is reasonable to believe that the event is 
associated with the subject’s pre -existing condition and is not specific to the device or procedure. Pre -
existing conditions that are aggravated or become more severe during or after the procedure should be 
evaluated on a case -by-case basis to determine if the event may be more appropriately classified as device -
related or procedure -related.  
ZipLine  Medical Inc. Inc., or its designee, in cooperation with the Investigator, will as sess all adverse events 
considered to be device -related for potential reportability to the FDA and other regulatory authorities as an 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE).  
The Investigator should follow all unresolved serious adverse events until th e events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, the subject has withdrawn consent, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  
 
13.2 Reporting of Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1  General Reporting Requirements (Serious & Non -Serious Adverse Eve nts) 
All serious and potentially device  related  and/or procedure -related adverse events must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event CRF by [CONTACT_737] (or designee).  The report should include: severity, duration, action 
taken, treatment outcome and relatio nship of the adverse experience to the study device, procedure, 
concomitant medications, pre -existing condition, etc. (i.e., unrelated, related or relationship unknown).   
In the case of serious adverse events, procedure and/or device observations and malf unctions, medical record 
documentation (e.g. procedure notes, operative notes, discharge summary, relevant progress notes, imaging 
or lab studies) must be provided to ZipLine  Medical Inc. or its designee.

YSI YSI Stat [ADDRESS_438675] utilized implanted vagus nerve stimulators (VNS; 
implanted at the cervical vagus position). Several studies have shown promise in using 
the stimulator to modulate signaling along neuro- immune pathways/reflexes. Precli nical 
studies have shown that one such reflex is dependent on a vagus nerve signal that reaches the spleen, alter s concentration of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_352350], and modulates the 
release and production of cytokines by [CONTACT_352412].
1,2 One of the main 
cytokines under regulation by [CONTACT_352413] ( TNF). Interestingly, 
TNF is the target of biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352351] 
([RA] and other chronic inflammatory disease) patients.3 In RA, symptomatic relief can 
be achieved in up to 50%  of patients using anti -TNF  biologics, and recently a first -of-its-
kind study has shown that VNS significantly inhibited TNF production for up to 84 days 
in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_352352] (with a concomitant decrease in disease severity as 
measured by [CONTACT_352414]).3 
 
Based on the initial success of using VNS in a bioelectronic medicine (i.e. , use of nerve 
stimulators to effect specific molecular and/or drug target ); 2,4 several groups are 
targeting other (non- splenic) organs, disease applications, and drug target s. In prior 
literature, the brain -liver connection is well established and includes vagal sensory neural 
innervation.5 The central nervous system (CNS) is known to control glucoregulatory 
response to both hype r- and hypoglycemia.5-[ADDRESS_438676] shown complex and contrary results.9-12 This is in 
part due to the complexity of the innervation of the liver (i.e. , combine d afferent and 
efferent innervation with different function depending on innervation site with the liver), 
and the inability of implants to stimulate specific neurons (having specific function) within nerves.  
 
Recently, GE has published results on the use of focused, pulsed ultrasound to stimulate 
small sub -sets of neurons within organs.
13,14 This data includes stimulation of sub -organ 
sites within the liver (surrounding the porta hepatis and sensory vagal innervation points) 
and prevention or reversal in several models of hyperglycemia (including LPS -induced 
hyperglycemia and Fatty Zucker Diabetes/Obesity models). Unlike VNS studies, the precision stimulus has allowed for stimulation of a specific liver -hypothalamic pathway, 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_352353], and daily stimulation of the liver site for long 
term (weeks -month) prevention of diabetes symptoms in several diabetes and obesity 
models.

4.3 Summary of Pre -Clinical /Clinical Studies  
A clinical  feasibility  study has recently been completed  that observes the biological 
effects of ultrasound insonification of the spleen . It is performed in healthy subjects after 
insonification of the spleen with pulsed ultrasound using the elastography setting within 
the commercial LOGIQ E10 with C1 -[ADDRESS_438679] demonstrated that pulsed ultrasound 
focused on specific locations in the liver (i.e. porta hepatis) modifies glucose regulation 
and insulin sensing and may have beneficial effects in rodent models of diabetes and 
obesity.13,[ADDRESS_438680] on measures of glucose utilization, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and glucoregulat ion, this study may lead to better methods for treat ment.

neonatal cephalic, adul t cephalic, cardiac (pediatric and adult), peripheral vascular, 
musculoskeletal conventional and superficial, urology (including prostate), transrectal, 
transvaginal, transesophageal, and intraoperative (abdominal, thoracic,  and vascular).  
Since the ultras ound device will be used in  this study to achieve organ‐specific biological 
effects, it is  being used off‐label on this study, and therefore, is considered 
investigational. Although its use in this  study is considered investigational, its use is 
considered  to constitute minimal risk given that it will be  operated within the confines of 
its FDA‐cleared equipment parameters and below the guidelines established by [CONTACT_352415]. The FDA guidelines indicate that the  derated global maximum 
acoustic output should not exceed preamendment acoustic output exposure  levels. In the 
case of diagnostic ultrasound, the global maximum derated spatial‐peak temporal‐average  
intensity (ISPTA –  the highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound bea m 
averaged over the pulse repetition period) is ≤  720 mW/cm2 with either the global 
maximum mechanical index being ≤  1.9 or the global maximum derated spatial‐peak 
pulse‐average intensity (ISPPA – the highest intensity  measured at any point in the 
ultrasound beam averaged over the temporal duration of the pulse) being  ≤ 190 W/cm2 
(not including ophthalmic use). These FDA guideline values are significantly higher than 
the maximum spatial‐peak temporal‐average intensity to be delivered on this study.  
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that this clinical study is a 
nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study, because it does not meet the definition of a 
significant risk (SR device under $812.3(m) of the Investigational Device Exemption 
(IDE) regul ation (21 CFR 812).  An NSR study is  subject to the abbreviated requirements 
as described in § 812.2(b) of the IDE regulations . 
4.5 Rationale for Treatment and  Dose  
Insonifications will be performed on three consecutive days (Days 15, 16 and 17) for 15 
minutes of ultrasound push- pulse waveform exposure on each day for a total of 45 
minutes. Fifteen (15)  minutes was chosen as a typi[INVESTIGATOR_352354],

At approximately 22:00 pm on the evening prior to a clampi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], an overnight 
IV insulin infusion to achieve plasma glucose levels of approximately 100 ± 10 mg/dL 
during the last two hours of the overnight  IV infusion prior to the fasting  EGP assessment 
period. Glucose levels will be monitored frequently.   
On the evening prior to the clamp procedure, subjects will receive a standardized dinner, 
which will be followed by [CONTACT_149713] 10- hour overnight fast.  
The aim is to only use insulin to achi eve the target glucose level and to avoid 
simultaneous infusion of glucose. In case blood glucose levels are lower than the target 
level, an IV  glucose infusion may be used and recorded.  
The amount of insulin administered will be recorded and expressed in mU/m2/min for

and continued throughout  the clamp  at various rates . At approximately mid night , 5.5 mg 
[6,6-2H2]glucose/kg body weight will be injected  (priming dose) over  10 minutes, 
followed by a constant infusion of 0.05 mg [6,6-2H2]glucose/kg body weight/min until 
the end of the fasting EGP assessment period, followed by a rate of 0.025 mg [6,6 -2H2] 
glucose/kg body weight/min from beginning to end of the Step 1 insulin infusion.  The 
[6,6-2H2]glucose infusion is discontinued at the end of the Step [ADDRESS_438739] 30 minutes of the fasting, step 1 and step 2 periods 
(see Table 9-3). The glucose enrichment in the plasma  will be measured using gas 
chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC -MS). EGP will be calculated during the last [ADDRESS_438740].  
Subjects will receive an overnight insulin IV infusion to achieve plasma gl ucose levels of 
approximately 100 ± 10 mg/dL during the last two hours of the overnight IV infusion 
prior to the fasting  EGP assessment period.  
Subjects will be connected to the Biostator
 prior to the start of the clamp procedure.  
During step 1 and step 2 of  the clamp procedure, insulin will be infused at two infusion 
rates each lasting approximately 180 minutes  and D20W will be enriched with stable 
isotope labeled glucose to achieve a stable isotope glucose enrichment comparable to that 
of plasma in the fa sting state (e.g., 2.5 to 3% for plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose). Insulin will be 
infused IV by [CONTACT_3553] a precision pump for 180 min at the following rate:  
Step 1:  For the Step 1 insulin infusion of the clamp procedures at Day 2 , an amount of 10 
mU/m2/min will be added to the average insulin infusion rate which was provided per 
algorithm over the last [ADDRESS_438741] receives the 
same insulin infusion rate on Day 17 that he/s he received on Day 2.  
Step 2:  After 180 minutes (end of Step 1), the insulin infusion will be increased to 120 
mU/m2/min for a further 180 minutes (Step 2) of the clamp for all subjects at Day 2 and 
Day 17. This will provide supraphysiological insulin conc entrations that will near -
maximally stimulate glucose disposal. EGP is expected to be near maximally suppressed.  
The glucose infusion rate (GIR; 20% v/v) required to maintain arterialized venous blood 
glucose (glucose oxidase method) at the target level of  100 ± 10 mg/dL will be recorded 
throughout the clamp. The steady- state period for insulin sensitivity measurements is

Clinical Study  Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_438742] 30 minutes 
(steady -state) of each insulin infusion step is used for the determination of insulin 
sensitivity. Blood samples for the determination of plasma glucose will be drawn at 
scheduled time points before and during the clamp.  
 Insulin infusion rates may be adjusted per PI [INVESTIGATOR_352367].  
The clamp procedure will terminate approximately [ADDRESS_438743] blood sample has been collected.  
As a background validation with a second methodology for safety, the standardized 
measurements of the Biostator  will be verified on a regular basis  using the YSI reference

An AD E is any undesi rable and unintended medical event occurring to a subject in a 
clinical study, whether or not related to the study procedures . This includes events from 
the first study related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until 
post treat ment follow -up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be 
recorded as A DEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at 
screening:  
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned 
has worsened from the first study related activity after the subject has signed the 
informed consent  
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  
• Pre-existing events that has not worsened in intensity or frequency from baseline  
10.1.2  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Device Event  
A clinical laboratory A DE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that 
suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, (i.e. more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  
A laboratory re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value is  not considered 
an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, 
evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_438747]  (UADE)  
Any serious adverse effect o n health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (inc luding a supplementary plan or application) or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.

10.1.5  Relationship to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each A DE to the study pr ocedure(s) will be assessed by [CONTACT_9532]  [INVESTIGATOR_54720]- Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the 
following definitions:  
1= Related : 
The A DE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from t he ex posure to the study 
procedures , and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other 
factors (e .g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications).  
 
The A DE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the study procedures , 
and represents a known reaction to the study treatments or procedures, or is predicted by [CONTACT_352434].  
 The A DE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recurs wi th 
rechallenge, if applicable.  
 
2 = Not Related : 
The A DE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the study 
procedures , or can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other factors 
(e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases and concomitant medications).  
10.[ADDRESS_438748] ing of A DEs 
Collection of all ADEs (UADEs and ADEs) will commence from the time the subject 
signs the informed consent to participate in the study until the post -treatment follow -up 
GE Research  
Clinical Study  Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_438749] occurred. In order to avoid 
bias in eliciting A DEs, a non- specific question, such as “How have you been feeling 
since your last visit?” may be asked. Subjects may report A DEs occurring at a ny other 
time during the study.  
All subjects experiencing A DEs must be monitored and given appropriate medical 
treatment at the discr etion and judgement of the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_352368] a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All  ADEs will be 
document ed in the A DE page of the eCRF,  whether or not the Principal Investigator

stop dates , severity, action taken  and outcome, will be documented.  
10.2.2  Collection and Reporting  of UADEs  
When an UADE  occurs , the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_352370]:  
An UADE  form must be completed  immediately or within [ADDRESS_438750]  identification numb er, Principal Investigator ’s name, name

In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all UADEs  
should be reported to the IRB and Sponsor or a designated qualified vendor within 24 
hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event , but in no event later than [ADDRESS_438751]’s follow -up period. An Initial UAD E Form should be 
completed , and a copy should be securely faxed  or e-mailed  to the Sponsor or designated

Possible anticipated, adverse effects or inconveniences for subjects participating in  the 
study procedure are:  
10.3.1  Hypoglycemia  
There is a small risk of severe hypoglycemia (requiring assistance of the study staff) when an exogenous insulin analog is administered. The glucose clamp will be performed 
GE Research

Protocol No. GE -HUI -01 
 
Version 4.0 24Sep2020  
-GE CONFIDENTIAL - under  continuous surveillance and frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels as 
specified. Since there is simultaneous IV infusion of glucose, the occurrence of severe 
hypoglycemia is unlikely. If a blood glucose value < 70 mg/dL is recorded and confirmed 
by Y SI, or the subject has neurogenic symptoms (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tremor, hunger, sweats) or 
symptoms of neuroglycopenia (confusion, lethargy, agitation, reduced level of 
consciousness), the subject must be treated at the discretion of the Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_352371]. Treatment may include ingestion of 
carbohydrates (e .g., apple juice), IV  glucose bolus injections, IV  glucose infusions or 
other methods as required per Principal Investigator . Subjects will be monitored clo sely, 
and it will be a clinical decision made by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_352372], to IV  glucose infusion. Severe hypoglycemia (as defined by [CONTACT_352435]) should be treated at the Principal Investigator ’s discretion according to best 
available medical practice. As a safety precaution, a glucose solution will be available 
near the subject.  
Hypoglycemic events will be recorded as adverse events, if symptoms develop or if blood 
glucose measured is <  70 mg/dL , even if no s ymptoms are present. The subjects will only 
be discharged from the clinic, if deemed safe by [CONTACT_079] . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_438753] s will be given one of the study physician or nurse practitioner’s cell phone 
number to contact [CONTACT_172236], concerns or problems.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_438754] ed, will be below the 
maximum blood collection volume deemed minimal risk (i.e., no more than  550 ml in an 
8‐week period).  
10.3.6  Risk Related to H epatic Insonification  
The General Electric LOG IQ E 10 ultrasound pulsed doppler imaging system and C1‐6‐D 
XDclear abdominal  curvilinear probe are FDA cleared ( K173555) with the indication for 
ultrasound evaluation of fetal,  abdominal, pediatric, small organ (breast, testes, thyroid), 
neonatal cephalic,  adult cephalic, cardiac (pediatric and adult), peripheral vascular, 
musculoskeletal conventional and superficial, urology (including prostate), transrectal, 
transvaginal, transesophageal, and intraoperative (abdominal, thoracic,  and vascular).  
Since the u ltrasound device will be used on this study to test for organ‐specific biological 
effects,  it is being used off‐label on this study, and therefore, is considered 
investigational. Although its  use in this  study is considered investigational, its use is 
considered to constitute minimal risk  given that it will be  operated within the confines of 
its FDA‐cleared equipment parameters and below the guidelines established by [CONTACT_352415]. The FDA guidelines  indicate that the  derated global maxim um 
acoustic output should not exceed preamendment  acoustic output exposure  levels. In the 
case of diagnostic ultrasound, the global maximum  derated spatial‐peak temporal‐average 
intensity (ISPTA –  the highest intensity measured at any point in the ultrasound beam 
averaged over the  pulse repetition period) is ≤  720 mW/cm2 with either the global 
maximum mechanical index being ≤  1.9 or the global maximum derated spatial‐peak 
pulse‐average intensity (ISPPA – the highest intensity  measured at any point i n the 
ultrasound beam averaged over the temporal duration of the pulse) being  ≤ 190 W/cm2 
(not including ophthalmic use).  
10.4 Follow -up of A DEs and UADEs  
All A DEs should be followed up and subjects will be rendered appropriate medical care 
and treatment at the discretion of the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_352373] “further follow -up is not necessary”. If 
the ADE has not resolved by [CONTACT_7620] -treatment follow -up visit, the stop date will be 
recorded as “ongoing.”  
All UADEs  should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or 
until the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1238] S ponsor judge that fur ther f ollow -up is not necessary .

determine fasting EGP  using steady- state equations ( Steele 1959 ). 
Insulin- mediated EGP Suppression 
For each clamp, t he degree of EGP suppression from the fasting EGP value will be 
determined during the  last 30 minutes point during each step of the two- step H -E Clamp 
using the following  equation:  
% EGP suppression = 1 - (EGP clamp/EGP fasting)  
 
Partial suppression of EGP during Step 1 is assessed to determine hepatic insulin 
sensitivity and EGP suppression during S tep 2 will be measured to confirm EGP  was 
(near) fully suppressed to allow  the determination of extrahepatic insulin sensitivity.  
 
Rate of Glucose Disappearance (Rd)  
Under steady state conditions, the Rate of Glucose Disappearance (Rd) is equal to the Rate of Glucose Appearance (Ra) and under these condi tions Ra is calculated from the 
dilution of plasma [6,6-

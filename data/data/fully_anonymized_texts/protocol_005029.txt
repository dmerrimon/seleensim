1.0 Research Design  
 
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims  
 
A.  Objectives  
In the current study  we propose a proof -of-concept experimental test of PTBT and its ability to modify 
stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398701], and in turn, acute smoking reinforcement. Specifically, 
emotionally -distressed daily smokers ( N=88) will be randomized to either PTBT or Control (Sham) 
Training. After the training day, participants will complete a stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398702]. We 
propose the following specific aims:  
Aim 1 (Target Engagement): To evaluate PTBT as a strategy to “engage” (modify) puff 
topography -- a putative biobehavioral target of smoking reinforcement. Following stress -
induction, we hypothesize that PTBT, compared to Control, will result in significant changes in puff 
topography, namely: (a) smaller  average puff volume (mL), (b) shorter average puff duration (sec), 
and (c) longer inter -puff intervals (sec).  
Aim 2 (Acute Clinical Outcomes): To evaluate whether PTBT produces acute clinical changes in 
stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398703]. Following stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398704], w e 
hypothesize that PTBT, compared to Control, will result in significantly less acute smoking 
reinforcement, indexed by: (a) greater reductions in expenditures and consumption of hypothetical 
cigarettes smoked within the same context (e.g., PTBT or ad -lib) and (b) lower self -report cigarette 
satisfaction/reward (self -report) pos t-smoking.    
Aim 3 (Explore Mechanisms of PTBT). To explore cardiac vagal control (CVC) as a biological 
mechanism of PTBT. We will explore whether there are differences in CVC (respi[INVESTIGATOR_398705]) between smokers in PTBT compared to Control. We hypothesize that PTBT (vs Control), 
will produce greater reductions in CVC, as compared to baseline CVC, during stress -precipi [INVESTIGATOR_398706].  
This is the first study to test whether an integrated theoretically -based biobehavioral paradigm can 
modify puff topography and subsequent smoking reinforcement. This addresses the need for 
innovative approaches to decrease acute smoking reinforcement .  If associated with reduced 
smoking reinforcement, this paradigm could inform pre -cessation efforts designed to better prepare 
emotionally -distressed smokers for quitting.  
 
 
 B.  Hypotheses / Research Question(s)  
Smoking among adults with emotional distress is a recognized tobacco health disparity. Smokers with 
emotional distress are particularly vulnerable to smoking reinforcement  due to various 
biopsychological factors that contribute to deficits in emotion regulation and reward processing, which 
undermine cessation efforts. Better preparing smokers for cessation (prior to a quit attempt) is essential 
to improve outcomes in emotio nally-distressed smokers who require additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_398707] -driven smoking.  
A critical driver of smoking reinforcement is HOW a cigarette is smoked (i.e., puff topography). The 
timing and intensity of one’s puffing can titrate or maximize the cigarette’s rewarding effect. Our group 
has identified puff topography as a novel biobehavioral “target” mechanism of smoking 
reinforcement  in emotionally -distressed smokers. We have found that topographical components of 
puffing (e.g., shorter inter -puff intervals, longer puff durations) are linked to heightened smoking 
reinforcement in emoti onally -distressed smokers, but not in control smokers. Emotionally -distressed 
smokers also take larger and more rapid initial puffs  at the start of a cigarette – maximizing immediacy 
and intensity of reward.  
Although largely considered a behavioral phenotype of smoking reinforcement, inherent in puffing 
behavior are corresponding changes in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_108951]  (e.g., cardiac vagal control [CVC])

that may promote self -regulation and reduce craving. We recently proposed an integrated  
psychophysiological model  of emotional distress and smoking, wherein impaired  smoker CVC not only 
implicates  physiological homeostasis, but also influences addiction -relevant processes, including 
impaired higher -order cognitive processes needed for self -regulation and psychological functioning  
(e.g., reduced anxiety and stress). Yet, under certain time -sensitive contexts (e.g., stress), emotionally -
distressed smokers may  puff in a way that enhances  CVC, resulting in acute self -regulatory benefits , 
and in turn paradoxically amplify the reinforcing value of each puff. Thus, a biobehavioral intervention 
that could “engage” (modify) puff topography has the strong potential to reduce the reinforcing value of 
cigarettes in emotionally -distressed smokers . 
Informed by [CONTACT_398735], we developed a Puff Topography Biofeedback Training 
(PTBT) , a modified application of heart rate variability biofeedback to change puff topography. PTBT is 
a 30-min training that teaches smokers to adjust their puffing to a pace that is designed to minimize 
CVC in order to attenuate acute self -regulatory, emotion al, and craving -reductions associated with 
smoking. Thus, PTBT is a theoretically -informed, well -specified paradigm designed to directly target 
puff topograp hy – a mechanism of smoking reinforcement, which directly aligns with the NIH’s Science 
of Behavior Change (SOBC) and experimental therapeutics initiatives.  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_502311] a puff topography biofeedback training (PTBT) . Participants 
will receive real -time feedback regarding puffing (e.g., when to inhale/exhale , breath duration,  and inter -
puff interval). PTBT was designed based on an integrated theoretical behavioral and psychophysiological 
model of smoking reinforcement , and thus aims to address learning -based behavioral aspects of puffing 
(by [CONTACT_398736]/new learning), in addition to altering a physiological mec hanism of puffing 
(CVC). Therefore, PTBT is a promising theoretically -based intervention, that if supported by [CONTACT_398737], would be well -positioned for progressive translation into intervention efficacy testing, 
consistent with NIH in itiatives.49–51   
2. There is increasing recognition that preparing smokers for cessation (prior to a quit attempt) is essential 
to improve outcomes,[ADDRESS_502312] -driven smoking.53 If PTBT is associated with reduced smoking reinforcement, 
this paradigm could inform treatment effects designed to prepare emotionally -distress smokers for 
quitting.52 Notably, existing interventions that successfully attenuate pre-cessation  smoking reinforcement 
are primarily pharmacological in nature (e.g., nicotine replacement,54 varenicline55), while behavioral 
interventions targeting smoking reinforcement are generally used during the post-cessation  period (e.g., 
contingency management,56 behavioral activation/behavioral economic -based approaches57). Thus, the 
current study would address a gap in the provision of evidence -based behavioral interventions that target 
pre-cessation smoking reinforcement, which has the  potential to improve cessation outcomes in 
vulnerable smokers (emotionally -distressed).

See Figure 3  for an overview of the experimental procedures. Participants will complete a 
telephone interview to verify key exclusion/inclusion criteria. Participants who appear to be 
eligible will be scheduled for a  remote  assessment  session . If eligible following the remote 
session, participants will be scheduled for two in -person visits on consecutive days. For 
standardization (internal validity), all  in-person visits will be  scheduled to occur ~4hrs following 
the estimated time of participants’ first cigarette of the day. Participants will be informed that they 
will smoke their second daily cigarette during the lab visit and  instructed to avoid behaviors that 
may confound CVC (e.g., vigorous physical activity or consumption of caffeine within 2 hr; alcohol 
use within 12 hr).  
 
Baseline  Assessment ( Remote Visit ): Staff will obtain written informed consent, after which 
participants will complete an eligibility assessment (see Table 1 ). They will then complete the 
baseline assessment battery  (see Table 1 ).  
Training Visit (V1):  Participants will be screened for final eligibility criteria (e.g., CO level) upon 
arrival. Assessment of  self-reported affective and smoking related variables will be conducted via 
self-report at various times  throughout the session (see the orange stars on Figure 3 ). 
Participants will be attached to physiological recording equipment throughout the session, 
including blood pressure volume, ECG, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. When they smoke (in a ventilated 
smoking room), smoking topographical indices will be recorded using the handheld Clinical 
Research Support System  (CReSS micro; described in C.7).  
Training Conditions:  Eligible participants will then be randomized  to either the PTBT or Control 
(Sham Training) and informed that the training will be used in V2. Block randomization  will be 
used with biological sex (female vs. male) as a blocking variable, as sex is a known factors that 
influences puff topography and reinforcement.36,58,59  Both trainings will be time -matched.  
PTBT : PTBT  is designed to decrease puff topography influences on smoking reward informed by 
[CONTACT_398738].  Participants will be taught how to puff in a way that 
may feel different from their usual puffing behavior . Participants will be hooked up to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_398709], electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, and a blood volume sensor finger cuff (pulse 
plethysmograph) while seated in a ventilated smoking room. Following a 5 -min adaptation period, 
they will be introduced t o a breathing pacer (EZ -Air Plus; Biofeedback Foundation of Europe), 
which is integrated w ith the Thought Technology  biofeedback interface ( Figure 4 ), and taught 
how to use the pacer to guide the pace of their inhalation and exhalation. Participants will be 
taught to breathe steadily as a white 
ball (pacer) proceeds up the incline, 
and exhale as they follow the ball on 
the decline. They will first practice 
breathing normally with the pacer to 
ensure they understand the 
procedures. Then, participants will 
smok e following the pacer while using 
the CReSS micro device for a 5 -min 
phase. To address r einforcement 
immediacy and intensity, the pacer 
will be set to a 2 sec inhalation 
matched with a 2 sec exhalation, for a 
4 sec cycle, such that puffing maps 
onto a respi[INVESTIGATOR_398710] 15 breathes/min. This pace should minimize CVC  (Figure 2, right ). To 
address reinforcement reliability, the inter -puff-interval will vary between [ADDRESS_502314] the participant when to puff . In an adjacent room, the experimenter 
will be able to monitor real -time displays of physiological data and observe the session via video

Stress -Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398711] (V2).  Participants will return to the laboratory on the following 
day, at the same time, and be provided the same pre -visit instructions. Participants will be hooked 
up with physiological monitoring assessment while seated in the smoking lab. Next, a new consent 
will be presented, introducing them to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) , which has been used in 
our prior studies ( R03DA041556; F31DA043934) . The TSST is a well -validated laboratory 
paradigm that reliably induces psychological and physiological stress ,67–[ADDRESS_502317] candidate for a job of their choosing. 
To maximize anticipatory stress, participants will be introduced to a male and female confederate 
who will presumably observe and evaluate the speech.72 After a 2 -min preparation period, they will 
be shown a video example of a speech where a participant receives negative/neutral feedback 
from confederates, which serves to provide participants with additional information regarding the 
stressful nature of t he task. In our studies, this preparation/ anticipatory period produces medium -
large increases in negative affect in smokers (Cohen’s d = 0.60 -1.30). After the preparation period, 
participants are told that the confederates need additional time to trouble -shoot the camera system, 
and as a result they will be able to smoke before delivering the speech. Participants will be 
instructed that they will practice the training they learned (PTBT or Control) while they smoke , and 
will complete the same [ADDRESS_502318] the 
study staff via email or phone (contact [CONTACT_398739] ’s previously provided 
consent form) should they have any additional questions or concerns regarding their participation .  
B. Data Points  
Group differences will be examined between biofeedback puffing vs. shame in response to V2 
stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398712]: (1) puff topography indices (puff volume, 
duration, IPI), (2) self-report assessments and (3) physiological indices of emotional distress 
(cardiac vagal control).  
 
C. Study Duration  
This study comprises one remote session of up to two hours, and two in-person visits over the 
course of two days, with a duration of up to [ADDRESS_502319] completed the experimental design of

1. Smoking among adults with emotional distress is a recognized tobacco health disparity.1–[ADDRESS_502320] fifty years (currently ~15% in US),4,5 smoking 
prevalence in individuals with emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and mood disorders) is disproportionally 
higher (38% -45%)2,6,7 and has remained relatively stable over recent years.2 Smokers with emotional 
distress (vs. those without) are less likely to quit smoking successfully8–13 in large part because of the  
reinforcing effects of cigarettes (i.e., smoking reinforcement).14,15 Incentive sensitization theory30 
proposes three core processes that underlie drug reinforcement: liking, wanting, and learning. Smoking is 
posited to be initially motivated by [CONTACT_398740]/nicotine (i.e., “liking ”: 
pleasure, satisfaction) and  in turn, appetitive and urgency (“ wanting”: craving) motivation for cigarettes 
develops due to the reliable, immediate rewarding effect.16 Over time, smoking is maintained by [CONTACT_398741] (i.e., “ learning ”: relief from aversive states and stress).15,[ADDRESS_502321] processing.18–[ADDRESS_502322].26 We propose that these aspects of smoking reinforcement are particularly valuable to 
emotionally -distressed smokers who rely on cigarettes as a go -to “quick fix” strategy during certain time -
sensitive contexts (e.g. acute distress, or initial smoking abstinence) . For example, modification of WHEN 
they smoke (e.g., when stressed) and HOW they smoke their cigarette provides smokers with the ability to 
easily titrate/maximize the timing and intensity of the cigarette’s rewarding effect. These aspects of smoking 
beha vior are referred to as “ puff topography ”, which can be indexed in many ways including puff volume  
(amount of carbon monox ide [CO] inhaled, mL), puff duration  (length of time for each inhalation, sec), and 
inter-puff interval  (time between inhalations, sec). Indeed, evidence indicates that both trait and state 
distress are related to alterations in smoking behavior. For example, smokers with emotional distress 
(compared to those without) smoke in a way that maximizes intensity  (e.g., larger inhalations while 
puffing).27,28 
3. Puff topography is a novel “target” of smoking reinforcement in emotionally -distressed smokers . 
Although puff topography has been historically studied in the context of tobacco control (i.e., reducing CO 
or nicotine exposure),29–[ADDRESS_502323] found that topographical components of puffing (e.g., shorter inter -puff intervals, 
longer puff durations) are linked to heightened smoking reinforcement (wanting, liking) in emotionally -
distressed smokers but not control  smokers (small -medium effects).[ADDRESS_502324] also identified several 
cognitive -affective aspects of emotional distress (e.g., distress intolerance, negative urgency) that are 
related to alterations in ad -libitum and stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398701].35–[ADDRESS_502325] moved 
beyond the status quo  in our approach to this work by [CONTACT_398742]-to-puff changes (time -varying) during 
smoking rather than relying on the established (normative) methods of examining average puff 
parameters.28,39,40 This method provides precision  in understanding time -sensitive aspects of puff 
topography. For example, we found that emotionally -distressed smokers (vs. non -distressed) take larger 
and more rapid initial puffs at the start of a cigarette (i.e., reward immediacy and intensity) and demo nstrate 
more persistent, stable puffs over the course of the cigarette (i.e., reward reliability).35 Together, our data 
indicate that puff topography is a well -specified, precise, time -sensitive mechanism of smoking 
reinforcement. If puff topography can be “engaged” via intervention (modifiable), it would have the strong 
potential to reduce the reinforci ng value of cigarettes in emotionally -distressed smokers.

4. An integrated psychophysiological framework to understanding puff topography (Figure 1).  
Inherent in puffing behavior are corresponding 
changes in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_108951], such 
as cardiac vagal control (CVC), i.e., vagus 
nerve mediated regulation of the heart rate. 
Changes in heart rate that occur during 
inhalation and exhalation (i.e., respi[INVESTIGATOR_398713] [RSA]) reflect CVC. When breathing 
is slowed to a pace that maximizes oscillations in 
heart rate and blood pressure (increas ed CVC),[ADDRESS_502326], we 
recently proposed an integrated 
psychophysiological model of emotional distress and smoking46 wherein impaired CVC observed in 
smokers is not only implicated in physiological homeostasis, but also in addiction -relevant processes, 
including higher -order cognitive processes needed for self -regulation46 and psychological functioning (e.g., 
distress).43 Although slowed breathing to improve CVC is often leveraged for clinical benefit, we posit that 
under certain time -sensitive contexts (e.g., stress), emotionally -distressed smokers puff in a style that 
mimics slowed breathing – maximizing oscillations in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_398714]-regulatory 
benefits – which in turn, paradoxically enhance smoking reinforcement. Thus, we propose that puff 
topography is not only a behavioral determinant of smoking reinforcement, but is also physiologically -base d 
(CVC), and together drive the reinforcing value of each puff .  
5. Puff Topography Biofeedback Training (PTBT) as a novel strategy for “target engagement”. CVC’s 
effect on self -regulation has been leveraged in biobehavioral interventions, like h eart rate variability 
biofeedback, which has been used to promote reductions in emotional distress43 and substance craving.47 
Heart rate variability biofeedback involves instructing individuals to slow their respi[INVESTIGATOR_398715] 6.0 
breaths/minute,41 by [CONTACT_43638] a breathing pacer and/or viewing real -time respi[INVESTIGATOR_398716], with the goal of achieving wave form synchrony.  See Figure 2  for an illustration of how breathing 
changes can influence CVC (i.e., Min/Max) by [CONTACT_398743]. asynchrony between heart rate (red)

and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (green), and in turn theoretically influence reinforcement. Aligned with our proposed 
framework, we developed Puff Topography Biofeedback Training (PTBT) , a modified application of heart 
rate variability biofeedback, to change puff topography. Specifically, PTBT involves teaching emotionally -
distressed smokers to adjust their puffing to a pace that produces asynchrony  between heart rate and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], in order to attenuate  CVC and self -regulatory, emotional, and craving -reductions associat ed 
with smoking. Aligned with the NIH’s Science of Behavior Change inititiave48 and experimental medicine 
approach,[ADDRESS_502327] whether the identified target (i.e., puff topography) 
can be experimentally engaged  via a well -specified intervention (PTBT).  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_502328] are unclear given that there are no prior data. However, 
our studies of differences in puff topography in the context of acute stress vs. control produce medium -
sized effects ( ds=0.46 -0.54).[ADDRESS_502329] size (f2=.143 [R2 change/1 -cumulative R2) = .143) with 80% power and alpha of 0.05 via 
multiple regression analyses with up to 10% variance explained by [CONTACT_398744] (training group) and 
up to 5 other covariates (e.g.,  sex, number of cigarettes per day, depressive/anxiety symptom  severity, 
corresponding baseline values , and CO boost ) accounting for up to additional 20% of the anticipated 
variance. Without any co variates in the model, a sample size of [ADDRESS_502330] 
size (f2=.11) across training groups (explaining 10% variance). Mediation (Aim 3).  Statistical power for a 
mediation analysis with a single mediator was estimated using Monte Carlo power analysis for indirect 
effects.86 The inclusion of mediation analyses led us to increase our sample size to n=80, which is 
sufficient for detection of indirect effects with a proportion -mediated effect size of 50%87 (correlations 
between predictor, mediators, and outcome,  r =.40-.43) with 80% power and alpha of 0.05.  which we 
deemed sufficient given the exploratory nature of these analyses. Taken together , to ensure analyses are 
adequately powered, we propose a sample of 88 (allowing for ~8 -10% attrition) with a final intended 
sample of 80 completers  (40 per condition).

device for a 5 -min phase. To address reinforcement immediacy and intensity, the pacer will be set to a 2 
sec inhalation matched with a 2 sec exhalation, for a 4 sec cycle, such that puffing maps onto a respi[INVESTIGATOR_398717] 15 breathes/min. This pace should minimize CVC ( Figure 2, right ). To address reinforcement 
reliability, the inter -puff-interval will vary between [ADDRESS_502331] period.  
Control: In the control condition, i.e. sham training, participants will be hooked up to the same physiological 
monitoring equipment and  will complete a [ADDRESS_502332] period.  
2.  Stress -Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398711] (V2).  Participants will return to the laboratory on the following day, 
at the same time, and be provided the same pre -visit instructions. Participants will be hooked up with 
physiological monitoring assessment while seated in the smoking lab. Next, a new consent will be 
presented, introducing them to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) , which has been used in our 
prior/ongoing studies (R03DA041556; F31DA043934). The TSST is a well -validated laboratory paradigm 
that reli ably induces psychological and physiological stress,67–[ADDRESS_502333] candidate for a job of their choosing. To maximize anticipatory stress, 
participants will be introduced to  a male and female confederate who will presumably observe and evaluate 
the speech.72 After a 2 -min preparation period, they will be shown a video example of a speech where a 
participant receives negative/neutral feedback from confederates, which serves to provide participants with 
additional information regarding the stressful nature of t he task. In our studies, this preparation/anticipatory 
period produces medium -large increases in negative affect in smokers (Cohen’s d = 0.60 -1.30). After the 
preparation period, participants are told that the confederates need additional time to trouble -shoot the 
camera system, and as a result they will be able to smoke before delivering the speech. Participants will 
be instructed that they will practice the training they learned (PTBT or Control) while they smoke  and will 
complete the same [ADDRESS_502334] the study staff via email or ph one (contact 
[CONTACT_398739]’s previously provided consent form) should they have any additional 
questions or concerns regarding their participation.

A. Primary  Data Collection  
▪ Location : This project will be conducted at the Rutgers University  Affective and Biological 
Underpi[INVESTIGATOR_398720] (AB[LOCATION_003])  Laboratory  located on the 2nd floor of 
[ADDRESS_502335], New Brunswick, NJ. The lab space is equipped with two rooms for 
psychophysiological assessment with adjacent rooms for monitoring, an in -lab smoking room 
that is ventilated to the outdoors with an adjacent cont rol room for monitoring.  Some eligibility 
and baseline assessments will be conducted remotely, using video -conferencing software 
(e.g., HIPAA compliant Zoom or Teams platforms) and online survey collection software (e.g., 
Qualtrics).  
▪ Process of Data Collection : Data will be collected by [CONTACT_1744] -approved and trained research 
staff from both labs of the Principal Investigators, in accordance with the procedures described 
in detail in section 1.3. In brief, combustible cigarettes smokers with emotional distress (N= 88) 
will be randomized to receive puff topography biofeedback (n = 44, 50%) or sham training (n = 
44, 50%) prior to exposure to a laboratory stressor paradigm. Stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398721], wherein participants will be given the 
instructions to smoke utilizing their assigned puff training. Smoking reinforcement will be 
measured using a multi -method approach, including self -report, psychophysiology, and 
behavioral indices  
▪ Timing and Frequency : After the initial telephone screening, data collection will occur on  one 
remote occasion and  two in-person occasions . The remote session entails  one initial 
assessment to confirm eligibility  and collection of baseline data via interview and self -report. 
For the in -person visits, V1 entails data collection through self -report measures (administered 
at the starred time points in Figure 3 ), as well as  receiv ing their assigned training condition. 
V2 will occur on the following day at the s ame time as V1.  
▪ Procedures for Audio/Visual Recording :  
The diagnostic interview during the remote session will be recorded via HIPAA compliant 
platform (e.g., Zoom, Teams)  to be used for supervision purposes as well as to ensure 
diagnostic fidelity.  
▪ Study In struments :  
Puff topography will be objectively measured with the CReSS micro (Plowshare Technologies, 
Borgwaldt KC, Inc) , a hand -held device that has a sterilized flow meter mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_398722]: Teresa Leyro, Ph.D.; Samantha Farris, Ph.D.

connected to a pressure transducer, which converts pressure into a digital signal that is sampled 
at 1,000Hz. Puff indices will be averaged and examined at puff -to-puff level. To index changes 
in CVC as a function of condition, continuous ECG and respi[INVESTIGATOR_398723] 
1,000Hz, and differences in RSA from the 5 -min adaptation period (V1) to the 5 -min peri -
smoking period (V2) will be derived  and scored using cardiopro in accord with established 
guidelines .73 Smoking reinforcement will be assessed with: (a) the S hort-Cigarette Purchase 
Task  (S-CPT),74 a hypothetical purchase task designed for repeated assessment of cigarette 
(wanting), modified to purchasing of the “last cigarette smoked” to index intensity ( consumption 
when free ), Omax (maximum expenditure on cigarettes ), and breakpoint ( point at which 
consumption is zero)  and (b) the Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire  (mCEQ),75 which 
assesses how respondents feel about the “last cigarette smoked” with subscales that tap liking 
(cigarette satisfaction ), wanting ( craving reduction ), and learning ( psychological reward ). 
 
▪ Subject Identifiers :  
Data will be de -identified with an arbitrary ID number.  Subject identifiers of name, email 
address, address, and phone number will be stored under lock and key and in password -
protected electronic databases, separate from all data.

New Jersey area , and (c) paid advertisements through BUMP Digital Marketing  and Build Clinical , both 
online recruitment service s used in previous research by [CONTACT_125703]. BUMP  and Build Clinical  will target 
daily smokers in the Northern and Central New Jersey areas via targeted advertisements on Facebook , 
Instagram  and other social media sites and websites . Recruitment materials are attached. Any  individuals 
meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be provided the opportunity to participate in this study. Individuals 
interested in participation will undergo a brief phone sc reen to determine presence of inclusion criteria 
and absence of exclusion criteria.  
B. Recruitment Details  
We intend to recruit 180 daily smokers and retain 80 eligible.  The study will be conducted at the 
Affective and Biological Underpi[INVESTIGATOR_398720] (AB[LOCATION_003])  laboratory at Rutgers 
University, in New Brunswick, NJ. The AB[LOCATION_003] laboratory (directed by [CONTACT_79086] [INVESTIGATOR_398724]) has a

Protocol Version Date: [PHONE_8288] v. 21  05/02 /[ADDRESS_502347] s 
(1) Phone Screen and Questionnaire Completion : Potential participants may become 
uncomfortable or distressed when asked certain questions (e.g., regarding illicit 
substance use; current/past mental health and physical health). However, Dr s. Leyro  and 
Farris  have many years of experience administering these questionnaires in various 
study protocols and study personnel will receive extensive training in conducting the 
Phone Screen. Also, participants will be offered an additional layer of protection via a 
Certifica te of Confidentiality.  
(2) PTBT : There are some minimal risks associated with the administration of the 
proposed breathing interventions.  The most often observed risk is discomfort breathing 
at a pace that is much slower than typi[INVESTIGATOR_398726]. 
To address this potential risk, study clinicians will be carefully trained in providing 
participants with a clear rationale for the procedure, clinical management of distress 
associated with the intervention, and appropriate adjustments to ensure part icipants are 
able to adhere to the protocol.  
(3) Physiological Recording : All of our sensors record responses from the surface of the 
body and are hence  noninvasive and should not cause the participants any discomfort or 
physical harm. Patients may experience mild discomfort with the application and removal 
of passive electrodes to monitor their physiological parameters. However, we do not 
anticipate this discomfort to be longstanding. To minimize discomfort, all sensors are 
placed and removed by [CONTACT_398748] p lacement and 
removal.  
 (4) Assessment Procedures : No risks are associated with self -report or behavioral 
assessments other than mild distress due to the sensitive nature of questions or induced 
distress as a function of difficulty or attention demands on some of the behavioral tasks. 
Study personnel are experienced and sensitive to this issue and will cease testing if a 
participant displays excessive frustration during behavioral testing, although neither  PI

This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality. Researchers with this Certificate 
may not disclose or use information or documents that may identify study participants in any 
federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislati ve, or other action, suit, or 
proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless study

the disclosure, including for their medical treatment; or if it is used fo r other scientific 
research, as allowed by [CONTACT_92452].   A Certificate of 
Confidentiality does not prevent participants from voluntarily releasing information about 
themselves or their involvement in this research. If a  participant wants their research 
information released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person not connected 
with the research, they must provide consent to allow the researchers to release it.  The 
Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure as required by [CONTACT_1032], 
state, or local law of harm to self or others as well as reports of child and elderly abuse and 
neglect.  
▪ Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Our research team employs standard procedures to ensure confidential information about study 
participation is not disclosed. All data are linked to an arbitrary study ID unrelated to personal 
information. The file linking participants to their study ID will be stored in a password -protected 
file, located within a password -protected database on an encrypted computer and maintaine d 
separately from de -identified personal data files. Only select trained laboratory personnel will have 
access to the file. All com puter files or printed data used for analysis also will be de -identified. 
Consent forms and payment forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet separate from data in an 
office that is locked when not occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Participants’ confidentiality also is protec ted by [CONTACT_398750] a participant’s name [CONTACT_398758]. Demographic information, including information about participants’ age, ethnicity, 
education, marital status and employment status, will be reported using averages and percentages 
computed over multiple participants and never reported at the level of individual participants.  
F. Potential Benefits to Subject s 
While no individual benefits for subjects are anticipated, the data obtained through this study may 
help inform and shape effective interventions for smoking cessation.

Prior to conducting outcome analyses, we will use descriptive statistics and graphical analysis to evaluate 
the distributional properties of outcome variables. T -tests and χ2 initial analysis will be used to evaluate 
the equivalence of the groups on baseli ne variables (i.e., successful randomization).  
 
Test of Aim 1:  First, tests of the effects of puff training on puff topography indices (i.e., puff volumes and 
duration, and inter -puff intervals) will be conducted using linear regression models. The mean level of 
each index over the course of the stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398729]. The primary independent variable is training group (PTBT vs. Control. 
Planned covariates include biological sex (0=male, 1=female), number of cigarettes per day, and 
emotional distress  (DASS -21), and the models will be tested with and without covariates. Effect size (d) 
will also be calculated. In addition , a series of multilevel models will be used to test whether 1) the mean 
levels and 2) changes in the levels of puff topography (i.e., volume, duration, inter -puff intervals) during 
stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398730]. Levels of puff v olumes, durations, and inter -puff 
intervals for each puff (outcomes), and puff number (level 1) make up the first level of data neste d within 
individuals at the second level. Training group and other baseline characteristics will be entered in the 
models as level 2 variables.  We will examine the effects of PTBT (vs. Control) on the individual mean 
(i.e., the middle point of the values over time) and the individual trajectory slope (i.e., the rates of changes 
over time) for each topography index in separate models. A cross -level interaction term between training 
group (level 2) and puff number (level 1) will be included in each model. Pu ff number will be centered 
around the mid -point for each individual so that the intercept reflects the estimated mean level of each 
topography outcome. Separate quadratic and cubic slopes (squared and cubic puff number) will be 
included as level 1 predicto rs if their inclusion improves model fit. Intercepts and slopes will be specified 
as random if it improves model fit and coefficients varied significantly across individuals. Deviance 
statistics will be used to compare model fit between two models.79 Unconditional models will be initially 
estimated, and then training group will be included as a level -2 variable predicting level -1 intercept and 
slope coefficients. The models will be fitted with and without level 2 planned covariates (i.e., sex, FTCD, 
DASS-21, and the baseline average value of the corresponding outcome).  
 
Test of Aim 2:  The effects of PTBT vs. Control on acute smoking reinforcement (i.e., cigarette purchase 
task [S -CPT], cigarette satisfaction/reward [mCEQ]) following stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398731]. Planned 
covariates include the baseline value of the outcome when relevant (S -CPT), biological sex, number of 
cigarettes per day, and DASS -21, and the models will be tested with and without covariates. Effect size 
(d) will a lso be calculated.  
 
Test of Aim 3 (Exploratory Analyses):  Differences in CVC (via RSA) between training groups during the 
stress -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_398732], controlling for baseline 
levels. Training group will be used to predicting CVC (outcome). Covariates will be i dentical to those in 
prior analyses, and will be tested with and without covariates, and effect size (d) will be calculated.

suicidal intent) will be made available to clinical staff to more effectively coordinate services.  All research 
staff directly involved with study participants will be fully trained by [CONTACT_978] s and will demonstrate 
competence in procedures for clinical assessment and appropriate intervention to address psychiatric 
adverse events. In such cases, research staff will also immediately contact a PI ([CONTACT_398759]  or [CONTACT_294685] ) 
who will be on call at all times. Appropriate clinical action will be taken in such circumstances. Individuals 
will be provided with a list of referrals for counseling as needed.

6.3 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
 
A. Data/Safety Monitoring  Plan  
We believe that potential risks to participants in this study  will be minimal. The risks do include the possibility 
of psychological distress during study screening. All research staff directly involved with study participants 
will be fully trained by [CONTACT_978] s and will demonstrate competence in procedures for clinical assessment and 
appropriate intervention to address psychiatric adverse events. In such cases, research staff will also 
immediately contact a PI ([CONTACT_398759]  or [CONTACT_294685] ) who will be on call at all times. Appropriate clinical action 
will be taken in such circumstances. Individuals will be provided with a list of referrals for counseling as 
needed.  
 
The principal investigator s, Drs. Farris  and Leyro , will take ultimate responsibility for safety monitoring in 
the study. They  will be in frequent contact [CONTACT_398751] -Is and study staff. All adverse events will be 
promptly reported to the PI. Any incident involving a serious injury, medical hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or death will be 
reported to the Rutgers IRB as a Serious Adverse E vent (SAE) within 24 hours. SAEs will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_398752]. The report will include whether they w ere expected or unexpected, 
a rating of severity of the event, a brief narrative summary of the event, a determination of whether a causal 
relationship existed between the study procedures and the event, whether the informed consent should be 
changed as a result of the event and whether all enrolled participants should be notified of the event. 
Serious and other unexpected adverse events will also be tracked and reported semi -annually to the IRB.  
  
In terms of data monitoring, self-report measures will be entered by [CONTACT_398753] (a 
data entry and management program). Data is stored on a secure cloud -based server that will only be 
accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_398733].  Physiological data will be stored electronically 
in files accessible only to research staff. Data will be reviewed post -collection by [CONTACT_398754] a graduate 
researcher for validity and quality of collection.

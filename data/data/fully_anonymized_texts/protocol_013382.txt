Protocol Body
1.[ADDRESS_1129090] a symptom-reduction strategy based on underlying symptom mechanisms  associated with cancer treatments. Using a blinded, 
randomized placebo-controlled trial, we will evaluate minocycline safety and ability to reduce the symptom burden of oropharyngeal cancer, 
nasopharyngeal cancer, or unknown primary cancer of head and neck  treated with radiation  therapy. The significance of this research is that it (a) 
evaluates a low-toxicity, low-cost symptom therapy, (b) evaluates a therapy which could reduce multiple  commonly reported symptoms in oropharyngeal 
cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer,  or unknown  primary  cancer  of head and neck, and (c) seeks  to establish simple medical symptom prevention  therapy for 
a disease site and treatment  for which the symptom burden is high and few medical  symptom prevention strategies exist.
The agent tested in this trial is minocycline.  The target of action for the proposed intervention is in reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, specifically 
IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, likely mediators  of multiple  symptom expression.  Minocycline also crosses the blood-brain barrier, possibly reducing 
inflammation in the central nervous system, potentially  reducing multiple symptom  expression at the brain level.
3.0 Background
Cancer was diagnosed  in more than 1.4 million people in the [LOCATION_002] in 2007 alone — 34,360 with head  and neck cancer (HNC) (Jemal et al., 
2007).  Many of these patients received aggressive therapy and experienced  multiple symptoms that cause them significant distress and impair  function 
and rehabilitation. Whereas many of these symptoms are the result of disease, it is increasingly recognized that pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance,  cognitive 
dysfunction, and affective  symptoms can also be caused  by [CONTACT_494249].  Treatment-related symptoms  can directly affect survival if they become so 
severe that patients  abandon  potentially  curative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Borden & Parkinson, 1998; Jeremic et al., 2003). Moreover, treatment-related  symptoms  may 
persist for weeks, months, or years and may worsen, even if the cancer  improves.
There is growing  awareness that common biologic mechanisms may cause or contribute  to some  of these  clusters of symptoms at the same time 
(Barsevick et al., 2006;  Dodd et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). The theoretical underpi[INVESTIGATOR_494235], based  on the animal model  of 
inflammation-induced sickness behavior, is that dysregulated  inflammation and its downstream toxic effects  represent a significant  biologic basis for 
subjectively reported clusters of symptoms (Cleeland et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004). Based on this model, optimal  symptomatic control would attack  both 
underlying symptom mechanisms as well as the end effects of these mechanisms  with symptom-focused therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
We have  reviewed the evidence  of the impact  of inflammation  on several cancer-related symptoms  (Lee et al., 2004). The insult of cancer treatment,  
including radiotherapy  and chemotherapy,  increases production of inflammatory  cytokines, especially interleukin  (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis  factor (TNF) 
variants (Linard et al., 2004; Linard et al., 2005).  Inflammatory reaction is a classic feature  of radiation  exposure, and animal models have shown  an 
increase in IL-6 several days  after such exposure (Van der Meeren et al., 2003). This increase in inflammation is a prime candidate for the mechanism 
behind increases  in treatment-related symptoms. It has been suggested that reduction of this treatment-induced  inflammatory response might significantly  
reduce the morbidity associated with radiotherapy (Garden,  2003).
3.[ADDRESS_1129091], the subjective  nature of 
symptoms has limited  innovative research  into the mechanisms  underlying these symptoms and the development of novel ways  of treating  or preventing  
them. Special difficulties include the poor fit of current disease models of research for implementing  this kind of health-related  investigation and lack of 
statistical models that integrate “rough”  self-report data and biologic data (Cleeland, 2001). However, patient-reported outcome  research has recently 
been promoted by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for more accurate  therapeutic agent evaluation,  and symptom reduction has been  
recognized as a primary clinical benefit for drug approval (FDA, 2006b).
Other barriers have  hindered  development of evidence-based  methods for controlling  treatment-related symptom  burden, despi[INVESTIGATOR_815468].  Many  of the agents that might be effective in the control  of treatment-related symptom burden are generic or 
off-patent drugs that will never  receive clinical research  support from the pharmaceutical industry  because  there is no financial  incentive to support clinical 
trials testing their effectiveness  for symptom control. 
Current practice utilizes randomized clinical trials to manage a single symptom with a single agent, for example, pain controlled with a single analgesic. 
When clinicians do treat multiple symptoms, they typi[INVESTIGATOR_815469]’s perceived needs, 
rather than on evidence-based  research (Foley et al., 2001).
3.[ADDRESS_1129092] 500% 
increase in the number of early toxicity events with chemoradiation as compared  with standard  postoperative radiotherapy for head and neck cancers  
(Trotti et al., 2007). Chemoradiotherapy for head  and neck cancers  has consistently shown to yield clinically  relevant improvement in locoregional  control 
and overall  survival, though at the cost of more severe early toxicity (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_556675]., 2000). However, many patients  treated with radiation therapy alone  still 
report high symptom burden. Early  effects are typi[INVESTIGATOR_815470]  a few weeks after the end of therapy, typi[INVESTIGATOR_815471], the mucosal lining  of the GI tract and the hematopoietic system. The alterations in swallowing and nutritional intake may 
cause poor compliance  to therapy, may have long-term effects and even cause death  of the patient.   The burden of treatment- related adverse effects 
needs to be well documented and controlled  to improve  both physical and social functioning in these patients. Thus,  a goal of the proposed study is to 
develop symptom management strategy to improve patient outcomes  and also to improve  compliance to intensive  treatment regimen, in this case 
definitive radiation  therapy.
4.0 Background Drug Information
4.1  Minocycline hydrochloride (Minocin®, manufactured by [CONTACT_815479], LLC) is a semisynthetic antibiotic derived  from tetracycline. It has 
the unusual side effect of markedly  suppressing  proinflammatory cytokine release, the primary reason we will include it as an intervention in this study. 
Preclinical data suggests that minocycline reduces neural  inflammation and prevents apoptosis of neural cells.  Animal studies have demonstrated  that 
minocycline reduces the levels of the proinflammatory  cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha,  IL-1b and interferon (IFN)-g (Ledeboer et al., 2005; Zanjani  et al., 2006). 
Minocycline’s anti-inflammatory  effect  prevents subacute pathological change  in lungs  due to inflammation produced by [CONTACT_815480]-saccharide 
administration in animals (Yamaki  et al., 1998). Minocycline was found  to decrease IL-6 and the acute-phase response protein C-reactive protein (CRP)  
levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Kloppenburg et al., 1996).
Commonly associated side effects include light-headedness, vestibular symptoms, headache, and nausea (Gump et al., 1977), with no correlation  seen 
between serum concentration and toxicity (Kloppenburg et al., 1995).  Minocycline is now widely used in the management of dermatitis associated  with 
targeted therapy  in cancer.
4.2  Absolute Contraindications to study  symptom  intervention agent  Minocycline 
4.21  hypersensitivity  to any tetracyclines;
4.22  pregnancy
      4.23  hepatotoxicity (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT);  2 times the upper  limit of normal)
4.3Minocycline Common Adverse Reactions
4.31  Minocycline: Dizziness (9%) and vertigo.
4.4Minocycline Monitoring Parameters
4.41 Minocycline:  LFTs, BUN, Sr Cr, 
4.42 Signs of acute hepatitis:  rash, fever,  malaise,  abdominal pain, and vomiting
Evidence:  Hepatotoxicity (e.g., elevated  hepatic  enzymes,  hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, hepatic failure with some fatalities,  hepatitis  with 
autoimmune features, and jaundice)  has also been reported.  Abdominal complaints may suggest  hepatotoxicity; the incidence  of this effect is roughly 
4.7%.   Liver  toxicity is possible with excessive  accumulation of the drug, which can occur in patients with renal impairment receiving  even usual oral or 
parenteral doses.
4.44 Minocycline Drug Interactions
4.441 Minocycline
4.442 Calcium-, magnesium-,  or aluminum-containing antacids,  bile acid sequestrants, bismuth, oral contraceptives, iron, zinc, sodium  
bicarbonate, penicillins, quinapril may decrease absorption of minocycline:   Avoid  taking within  2 hours of using this medication.
4.443 Methoxyflurane anesthesia, when  concurrent  with minocycline, may cause fatal nephrotoxicity. 
4.444 Retinoic acid derivatives:  May increase  risk of pseudotumor  cerebri.
4.445 Warfarin: Hypoprothrombinemic response may be increased with tetracyclines; monitor  INR closely during initiation  or 
discontinuation

5.0 Study  Design
Using a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled  trial, we will evaluate minocycline safety and ability to reduce the symptom burden of oropharyngeal  
cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer,  or unknown  primary  cancer  of head and neck treated with radiation therapy. This is especially important in trials where  
symptom reduction is the outcome and where  knowledge of the treatment arm might bias assessment staff or patient.  The compounding pharmacy will 
prepare the appropriate active  agent  and placebo  for each patient.
Design:  Phase II blinded, randomized placebo-controlled  trial
Symptom Intervention Agent: minocycline
Study Period:  15 weeks: intervention agent daily during radiation for 7 weeks (+/- 5 days) + additional  follow-up to first follow  up (4-8 weeks) for a total 
of 11-15 weeks. 
Primary Outcome Variable: 7-week (+/- 5 days) area under the curve (AUC)  for select MDASI-HNC symptoms namely fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, 
difficulty swallowing  and lack of appetite.
Forty patients  will be randomized to either minocycline or placebo, twenty in each arm. AUC values for patients who drop out of the study after entering 
two weeks  of AUC data will be included by [CONTACT_815482] (ITT).  The 
carry-forward method of handling  drop-outs  will be revisited upon completion of the study to determine  if adjustments to these values can be made using 
longitudinal regression models estimated from patients who completed the entire study. 
All Grade [ADDRESS_1129093]  3+[ADDRESS_1129094] 6 patients  assigned to minocycline.  That is, if more  than 1 symptom intervention related 
toxicity (grade  3, 4) in the first [ADDRESS_1129095] of adverse events  known to be associated with primary treatment is listed in section 4.0 of the protocol.
The determination of whether a toxicity (grade 3, 4) was due to minocycline received by [CONTACT_102]  (rather than the primary radiation) will be performed by 
[CONTACT_62674] [INVESTIGATOR_569988]. 
The interaction screening  will be the responsibility  of the research staff.  The Research staff will review any current or new medications started  with the 
patient prior to initiating treatment. During the trial, the research staff will capture all drug interactions causing an adverse event on the Adverse Event 
forms. We plan to document all medications  patients will be or have been using during  the trial.  Medication sheets  will be provided to both patients and 
treating physicians to inform them of the possibility  that the patients may be on this drug (see Appendices T and TT).  
Minocycline will begin at the start of radiation therapy and continue  daily through the final radiation treatment day.

7.0 Data Collection Tools
Patient Reported  Outcome  (PRO)  Measurements
7.11  Symptom Measurement  Symptom data will be collected using the MDASI-  HNC module of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (see Appendix  
C and Appendix P). MDASI-HNC  items namely fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, difficulty  swallowing and lack of appetite  will be used to calculate  the 
symptom AUC. Prior studies (Rosenthal, et al, 2007,  2008) have indicated that a significant proportion of patients  reported  these symptoms to be 
moderate to severe. The MDASI-HNC will be collected face to face in the clinic, through  an interactive voice response  system, through a tablet PC, 
through phone calls by [CONTACT_303904], or by [CONTACT_815483]. 
7.12  Measure of Quality of Life  The EuroQol (EQ-5D) is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.  (See Appendix 
D)  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions  and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile  and a single index value for health  status. EQ-
5D was originally  designed  to complement  other  instruments  but is now increasingly  used as a 'stand alone' measure. The EQ-5D descriptive system 
consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual  activities,  pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three  levels, reflecting "no 
health problems," (level  1) "moderate health problems," (level  2) and "extreme health problems" (level 3).  A dimension for which there are no problems is 
said to be at level 1, while a dimension for which  there are extreme  problems is said to be at level 3. Each  unique health state described by [CONTACT_815484] 5-digit descriptor ranging from [ADDRESS_1129097] possible state. The resulting  descriptive system defines 
243 health states. In addition, "unconscious" and "immediate death" are included in the EQ-5D valuation process but are not a part of the descriptive 
system. 
7.13  Measure of Global  Quality of Life  The Global Quality of Life (GQL)  is a single item asking patients  to rate their quality of life on a [ADDRESS_1129098] week. (See Appendix DD). 
7.14  Measure of Patient Satisfaction with Study Medication Scale   The Study  Medication Satisfaction Scale is a short, 7-item scale  that asks 
patients about  several areas  of satisfaction. (See Appendix E)  The scale includes questions about ease or difficulty of taking the medication in general 
and in its current  form, convenience  of taking the study medication as instructed, and patient confidence that the study medication is of benefit.  
7.15 a Tobacco History  Form  The Tobacco History Form is a short questionnaire that asks about smoking history. (See  Appendix  F).  
7.15 b Follow-Up Smoking  Assessment Form  The Follow-Up Smoking  Assessment  Form asks three questions about smoking  subsequent to the start 
of radiation therapy (See Appendix FF).  
7.16 Alcohol History  Form The Alcohol History Form  is a short questionnaire that asks about alcohol history  at baseline. (See Appendix G).
7.2 Case Report Forms (CRFs)
7.21 Demographic Form  This form includes  patient  birth date, gender, marital status,  race, ethnicity,  education, and employment status. (See Appendix 
H)  The Demographic Form will be completed  at baseline.
7.22  Charlson Comorbidity Index  The Charlson Comorbidity Index  yields  a comorbidity score, to control  for serious concurrent chronic  disease 
conditions (Charlson et al., 1994) (Appendix  I).
 
7.23  On-Study Form  The On-Study Form  contains data about  disease, previous  treatment, whether a patient is on concurrent protocols (See Appendix 
J). This form will be completed at baseline.
7.24  Clinical Monitoring Form  The Clinical Monitoring Form contains clinical data including Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure, performance 
status, symptom  treatment,  and CTC toxicity scores. (See Appendix K).
7.[ADDRESS_1129099] been prescribed.  Medication types include pain 
medications, antiemetics,  and psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_815472]. There is also a general section for other types of medications patients may be taking. (See 
Appendix L).

(see Appendix M).   Each page of the diary  contains space to document [ADDRESS_1129101] visit, and the number of days the pi[INVESTIGATOR_60585].  (See Appendix  
N). 
7.28  Laboratory Data Form  The Laboratory Data Form contains data from blood  analysis  including C-Reactive Protein (CRP), serum  chemistry 
(albumin, calcium,  phosphorous, glucose,  BUN,  creatinine, total bilirubin, and total protein), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, 
magnesium), and complete  blood count (CBC).  (See  Appendix W). These values will be recorded  if they are available in the patient medical record  from 
a blood draw  performed  for clinical purposes. 
Note: Liver function tests are required at baseline.  If they were not performed within the past 3 months prior to starting treatment  with the symptom drug/  
placebo, they will be drawn for eligibility purposes.
 
7.29 Treatment Summary Form  The Treatment Summary Form  contains data about radiation  treatment received and induction chemotherapy.  (See  
Appendix O).
7.30 Final  Study Status Form  The Final Study Status  Form  contains data about patient disposition at the end of the study (i.e., completed study, 
withdrew, vital status) and tumor evaluation after treatment. (See Appendix OO).

10.0 Assessment Schedule
Please see Appendix P for an expanded study assessment/evaluation schedule.
Data Confidentiality  Plan
All patient-reported outcome, laboratory and clinical data gathered in this protocol  will be stored in a password-protected database. All patient information  
will be handled using  anonymous  identifiers. Linkage to patient identity is only possible after accessing a password-protected database. Access  to the 
database is only available  to individuals  directly  involved  in the study. 
When all analysis has been completed and all study results have been reported, the electronic and paper  files will be stored  in a password-protected MD 
Anderson secure server.  This stored data may be made available to MD Anderson  research and clinical  faculty for research purposes, with appropriate 
validation and access controls, so it can facilitate research cross-fertilization and speed insight discovery. Patient data also will be stored and accessible  
in the MD Anderson Translational Research Accelerator database (TRA; PI: A. Futreal). 
11.0 Adverse  Event Reporting
11.1 Adverse Events (AE)  (See Appendix Q)
All patients  will be seen weekly during radiation therapy  in the radiation oncology clinics, allowing for close monitoring of potential adverse events by [CONTACT_815486]. 
During the [ADDRESS_1129111]  phone number for treatment-related questions.
Toxicity and other  clinical  variables will be collected by [CONTACT_494253] 1, 4, 7, and end of study. Treatment-related toxicities  (NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4) will be monitored by [CONTACT_303915]’s  regular clinical appointments. (See  
Appendix R)
Grade 1 and Grade 2 AEs based on radiation  treatment and symptom treatment  that are expected or unrelated will not be reported.   AEs that are Grade 3 
and above that are definite, probable, or possible and related  will be reported.  AEs will be tabulated  and reported  as a summary on the continuing review 
report. All Grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported by [CONTACT_815487] [INVESTIGATOR_815474].  
11.2  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  (See Appendix  S)
A serious adverse event is any adverse drug experience occurring  at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places  the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse  experience as it occurred.  It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more  severe form, might have 
caused death.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  – a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal  life functions.
A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.
Important medical  events  that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious  adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples  of such medical events  include allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
Important medical events as defined  above, may also be considered serious  adverse  events.  Any important medical  event can and should 
be reported  as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_815475].
All events occurring  during the conduct of a protocol  and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported  to the IRB in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in  “University  of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson  Cancer  Center  Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious 
Adverse Events”.   Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the Clinical Research  Support Center,  
regardless of attribution (within 5 working  days of knowledge of the event).  
All life-threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected,  and regardless of attribution  to the study drug, must have a written report submitted 
within 24 hours  (next  working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project  Manager in the Clinical  Research  Support Center.
The MDACC  “Internal  SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for reporting  to the Clinical  Research Support Center. 
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs  consent until  [ADDRESS_1129112] returned  to baseline,  progression of the event has 
stabilized, or there  has been acceptable resolution  of the event.
·Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_1129113] be reported 
to the Clinical Research Support Center. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_815476], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines,  the sponsor’s guidelines,  and Institutional Review Board policy.

variables for the type of treatment (induction chemotherapy  vs. radiation  therapy alone) and location  (unilateral neck vs. bilateral  neck) will be created. In 
addition to the formal  evaluation of treatment  effects on the primary outcome, we will also examine the prognostic effects of the type of treatment,  
location, disease stage,  ECOG status,  age and gender in predicting the outcome variable.  Standard exploratory data analysis techniques  and descriptive 
statistics will be used.
We will test minocycline in its ability to reduce values of [ADDRESS_1129116] 2 weeks  of treatment with the study drug/placebo for patients to be considered  as evaluable.  Any patient  who drops  out prior to this 
will be replaced. 
13.21  Primary Outcome Variable
The primary outcome variable will be the combined AUC  for selected symptoms. The value  of this variable for patient i is denoted lc(i) and is comprised  of 
the MDASI-HNC  scores for fatigue, pain,  sleep disturbance, difficulty swallowing and lack of appetite collected during  the 7 weeks of RadTx. 
Because lc(i) represent the average  of a large number of ordinal  variables, we assume by [CONTACT_815488]. 
13.[ADDRESS_1129117],  this protocol also aims to pi[INVESTIGATOR_815478] (AUC). 
Because future clinical trial requires frequent monitoring and updating of symptom  data collected using either   the interactive voice  response system  
or  paper  and pencil, the logistics developed here will be useful in ensuring an efficient data collection system.
We are also interested  in exploring predictors  of survival. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models  will be used to screen  for potential predictors 
(demographic and clinical  variables) of overall survival.  Predictors that are significant  with  p<.[ADDRESS_1129118] model fitting 
diagnostics will be performed. Finally,  Cox survival curves will be plotted.
13.23 Non-Compliance with Study Agent
Patients who do not comply with study agent  dosing requirements will remain  in the study under the intent  to treat rule.

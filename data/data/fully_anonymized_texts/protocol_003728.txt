IRB Form Version v1201161.0 Research Introduction
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims
The purpose of the current investigation is to examine strategies for encouraging smokers at socioeconomic 
disadvantage in New Brunswick, New Jersey to quit in a randomized clinical trial. Tobacco use is a substantial 
problem for individuals at socioeconomic disadvantage (SED). While smoking prevalence has decreased across the 
[LOCATION_002] over the past several decades, this decrease has not occurred at all levels of socioeconomic status. 
Those at lower socioeconomic status smoke at higher rates than those at higher socioeconomic status (Tucker-
`Seeley et al., 2015).
A. Objectives 
In order to examine strategies for encouraging smoking cessation in socioeconomically disadvantaged 
smokers, we will randomize self-identified smokers interested in our study to one of three intervention 
conditions: (1) Brief motivational interviewing (MI) and referral to the NJ quitline and local Tobacco 
Dependence Program, (2) provision of a two-week supply of nicotine replacement patch and nicotine 
lozenge (NRT sampling) and referral to the NJ quitline and local Tobacco Dependence Program, or (3) 
referral only. This randomized controlled trial will allow for a direct comparison of three brief and easy to 
implement treatment conditions in relation to various cigarette smoking outcomes.  
B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s)
Brief advice to quit (i.e., referral), brief motivational interviewing, and nicotine replacement therapy are 
recommended approaches to promote smoking cessation and reduce health disparities in low-income 
smokers (Fiore et al., 2008). However, as compared to referring participants to the NJ Quitline, we expect 
brief MI and provision of NRT to be superior in terms of: (1) Increasing motivation to quit; (2) increasing 
self-efficacy to quit; (3) setting a quit date; (4) making a cessation attempt; (5) and achieving initial 
abstinence.  
1.2 Research Significance (Briefly describe the following in 500 words or less):
A disproportionate number of individuals who use tobacco are from low socioeconomic status (Tucker-Seeley et 
al., 2015). By [CONTACT_294666], we can have a positive impact on public health.
Brief motivational interviewing is a psychosocial intervention designed to promote behavioral change and 
recommended as part of the clinical practice guidelines for smoking cessation (Fiore, 2008), in particular for 
populations with low motivation to quit. This intervention assumes clients are motivated and have the ability to 
quit. By [CONTACT_294667], the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294645] a series of techniques to illicit intrinsic 
motivation from the client to change. Although MI presumably is designed to affect motivation, thereby [CONTACT_294668], mechanisms research does not support this relationship and instead suggest that a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s 
ability to engage the client in ‘change talk,’ i.e., talk about what it would look like to engage in different behaviors, 
is central to a favorable outcome. Whereas meta-analytic reviews of MI indicate relatively small effect sizes, a 
recent meta-analytic review that examined the combined effect of brief MI (i.e., <60 minutes) found that it was 
significantly related to long-term cessation (d=.33). A similar significant effect for follow-up was found that MI that 
was not combined with pharmacotherapy (d=.21). 
Clinical practice guidelines additionally recommend the provision of NRT to enhance smoking cessation (Fiore et 
al., 2008) via reduction in nicotine withdrawal. Meta-analytic reviews generally provide support for the efficacy of 
NRT in promoting cessation, but are somewhat mixed. More recently, combination NRT is emerging as a preferred 
method that provides smokers with constant nicotine replacement (e.g., via the nicotine patch) as well as relief for 
‘breakthrough’ cravings via the addition of gum or lozenge (Carpenter et al., 2013).

IRB Form Version v120116Overview: We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_294646] a New Brunswick, NJ based agency (e.g., New Brunswick Housing Authority (NBHA) or Elijah’s 
Promise) are randomized to one of two brief interventions designed to enhance motivation to quit smoking (see 
Study Interventions below) or to a control group. Participants will be re-contact[CONTACT_294669]-month by a research 
assistant who is blind to the condition to which the participant was allocated to assess number of quit attempts 
and abstinence from cigarettes.
 
Participant Recruitment and Screening: In collaboration with staff at the New Brunswick, NJ based community 
partners, we will use flyers to advertise and will recruit daily smokers receiving services at a New Brunswick, NJ 
based agency. Interested participants will complete a brief in-person or telephone screening where they will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_294670]. Participants must be between the age of 
[ADDRESS_358822] self-report being a daily smoker and provide biochemical verification of smoking status (expi[INVESTIGATOR_294647] >5). Assessing carbon monoxide to verify smoking status is a common approach 
in tobacco use studies.
1.3.1 Biochemical verification
To confirm smoker status, expi[INVESTIGATOR_33543] (CO) levels (also commonly collected in tobacco 
dependence treatment studies) will be assessed with a carbon monoxide monitor and CO reading in parts per 
million (ppm) will be recorded.  The carbon monoxide monitor used will be the Bedfont Scientific Ltd. Micro+ 
Smokerlyzer. The Micro+ Smokerlyzer is a hand-held, battery powered instrument which uses electrochemical 
technology to sample the gas and a microprocessor to convert the output from the sensor to a carbon monoxide 
(CO) concentration. The result and menus are displayed on a color LCD and an accompanying buzzer sounds in 
response to the CO level. The instrument is controlled using a touch screen operation and has a USB link to a 
computer to download readings.
The Micro+ uses a breath sampling D-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_294648] a one-way valve designed 
to maximize infection control. Each patient uses a fresh mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_294649]. The D-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_294650]. 
The patient is asked to hold their breath for a 15 second countdown. This is displayed on the screen of the device. 
At the end of the breath hold, the patient blows gently into the Micro+ expi[INVESTIGATOR_294651]. The reading on the device shall rise until the peak reading is held on the display.
A research assistant will provide instructions on how to use the CO monitor and will record the results at visit 1 and 
one-month follow-up appointments. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_294652].

IRB Form Version v120116Exclusion criteria include taking FDA approved smoking cessation or anti-psychotic medications, self-reported 
medical issues of potential concern to nicotine replacement therapy users (i.e., unstable angina pectoris, 
myocardial infarction, or significant cardiac arrthymia (including atrial fibrillation) in the past 30 days), or self-
reported pending legal issues with potential to result in incarceration. Additionally, women must state in writing 
that they are not pregnant or nursing, planning on becoming pregnant in the next two months, and that they are 
using effective birth control.
Visit 1: Following the initial phone screen study staff will arrange to meet with eligible participants to administer 
additional measures as well as the brief intervention. In addition to verifying inclusion/exclusion criteria as well as 
smoking status, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire battery online using a laptop provided by 
[CONTACT_464], and a brief interview to further assess motivation and confidence to quit, substance use, physical 
health, and mental health status and history, as well as smoking cessation history.
Study Interventions:  Next, we will use a block randomization procedure to allocate participants to one of three 
groups: A single session motivational intervention (MI), which will include a 30-minute therapy session designed to 
enhance motivation to quit smoking, followed by a referral to the NJ State Quitline and local Tobacco Dependence 
Program; (2) An NRT sample  intervention, which will include free two-week supplies of nicotine patches and 
nicotine lozenge with instructions for proper use and a referral to the NJ State Quitline and local Tobacco 
Dependence Program, or (3) An assessment and referral  only control. 
Block randomization is a procedure in which participants are randomly allocated to intervention groups within 
blocks such that an equal number are assigned to each intervention. We will use the Sealed Envelope Ltd. [ADDRESS_358823] to inform study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294653].
Upon completion of the intervention, participants will be scheduled for a one-month follow-up visit with a 
research assistant. Participants will be reminded of their appointment via text, phone, and email 48 and 24 hours 
prior.
One-month Follow-up: Participants will be asked to complete a brief online survey once again, and smoking status 
will be verified via self-report and carbon monoxide analysis of breath sample. Staff will also conduct brief 
interviews to assess main outcomes of interest.
1.[ADDRESS_358824]. Steinberg was Director of the Mercer County Tobacco Program from 2005–[ADDRESS_358825]. Steinberg recently published data on a motivational interviewing intervention (Steinberg et al., 2016) similar to 
the one proposed in the current application in which he found smokers with schizophrenia receiving a single-
session motivational interviewing intervention were significantly more likely than those receiving an educational 
intervention to make a quit attempt. In addition, [CONTACT_294685] recently published research indicating that clinical 
management of nicotine withdrawal of severely mentally ill smokers on smoke-free inpatient units is enhanced by 
[CONTACT_294671]; these findings support the exploration of our NRT in smokers who live in 
newly smoke-free public housing units.

sample will be reflective of cigarette smokers living in the greater New Brunswick, NJ area:  We expect to enroll 
two participants weekly in order to meet our target N.  Estimating that 50% of the sample will make quit attempt 
during the course of the study, our main outcome of interest, this is adequate to group differences with 95% 
confidence (CI: 0.38, 0.61).

motivation), (1b) readiness to quit, and (1c) confidence in quitting; (2) setting a quit date (yes/no); (3) making a 
cessation attempt (yes/no); (4) days of self-reported abstinence, and (5) achieving initial CO verified abstinence 
(yes/no).  
1.7 Drugs/Devices/Biologics 
1) Nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge are accepted, FDA approved treatments for 
nicotine dependence. Both are available over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Study participants will 
be provided with information written at a 6th grade level describing the proper use of the nicotine patch and 
lozenge, including a description of common side effects. To minimize adverse events, we are excluding 
smokers with potential contraindications (see Participants section within Methods above).
a) Storage and accountability. We will store nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in original packaging (box 
containing 2-week supply) in locked cabinets in a room with locked doors at [ADDRESS_358829]; Suite 105; 
New Brunswick, NJ and at Institute for Health, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey [ADDRESS_358830], Rm 212, New Brunswick, NJ [ZIP_CODE]. We will document temperature of the room weekly using 
a min/max thermometer.
a. Transferring medication. Research coordinators, Jessica Ortiz and Mindy Kibbey, will 
arrange to transfer medication between research laboratory sites as needed. Jessica and 
Mindy will be the only people who transfer medication between sites, arranging with 
one another to pi[INVESTIGATOR_294654]. 
b) Inventory. We will use an NRT inventory log to document the Lot # and Expi[INVESTIGATOR_294655].
c) Dispensing NRT. We will use an NRT dispensing log to document which boxes of NRT are provided to 
which subjects (listed by [CONTACT_117789]), by [CONTACT_20898], and on what date. We will not collect unused 
portions of the NRT because it is not common practice to specify a time limit by [CONTACT_294672].
a. In the event NRT is stored at the Institute for Health, the research coordinators will arrange to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_294656] [ADDRESS_358831]; Suite 105; New

1.[ADDRESS_358832] verify each participant’s smoking status via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33543] 
(CO > 5ppm). Participants will complete a questionnaire battery online via Qualtrics, using a laptop computer or 
tablet provided by [CONTACT_464] (see Table 1 below). If any participant indicates high levels of depression, we will 
provide phone numbers and a recommendation to contact [CONTACT_294673]. 
. 
Timing and Frequency: Following an initial phone screen, participants will be visited by [CONTACT_294674]-person 
session that will last approximately 60-90 minutes (including assessment and intervention). After randomization 
and Visit-1 study procedures are completed, they will be scheduled for a final follow-up visit to occur 
approximately one-month later. 
Location: Study participation will take place at the Rutgers RWJMS Division of Addiction Psychiatry / Tobacco 
Research & Intervention lab, at the New Brunswick Housing Authority offices and / or housing units, or on the 
premises of the non-profit agency, Elijah’s Promise, depending on study patient preference.
Procedures for Audio Recording: Participants will be asked permission to allow study staff to audio record their 
intervention as part of the research study, by [CONTACT_4876] “Agreement to Audio Record” at the end of the consent 
form. Participants do not have to agree to be recorded in order to participate in the main part of the study. The 
recording(s) will be used for clinical supervision, to validate the integrity of the counseling intervention, and 
potentially to later examine the relationship between what is said during the sessions and various clinical 
outcomes. The recording(s) will include the participant ID number and date of the research appointment. Digital 
audio files will be stored on password protected computers and the files themselves will be password protected 
and encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard 256 method (AES-256). Files will be linked with each 
participant’s ID number. Files will be destroyed [ADDRESS_358833]
Online Measures (Qualtrics)
1) Demographic Questionnaire: To obtain basic social support information as well as descriptive 
information including age, race, ethnicity, marital and SES status. Additionally, we will ask the place 
where they are completing the survey.
2) Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD; Fagerström, 2012): 6-item scale use to evaluate 
the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and nicotine dependence. The measure

IRB Form Version v120116has both yes/no items (scored as 1 or 0) and multiple-choice items (scored from 0-3).  These scores are 
then summed to give a total score from 1-[ADDRESS_358834]’s the 
nicotine dependence is.
3) Smoking History Questionnaire (SHQ;Bonn-Miller & Zvolensky, 2005): 30-item questionnaire used to 
assess participants smoking history and patterns of use.  Items pertain to smoking rate, age of onset of 
smoking initiation, and years being a daily smoker.
4) Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS; Simons & Gaher, 2005): 15-item scale used to assess participants’ 
perception of their ability to tolerate mental distress. Items (e.g. “I can’t handle feeling distressed or 
upset”) answered on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree 
evaluate participants’ ability to experience and endure negative emotional states and includes scales 
that assess appraisal, tolerance, absorption, and regulation. This scale contains good psychometric 
properties, including high internal consistency. Because six of these items are included in the DII, below, 
this measure will be comprised of nine items.
5) Distress Intolerance Index (DII; McHugh & Otto 2011): 10 items (e.g. I can’t bear disturbing feelings) 
rated on a five point Likert-type scale (0 = very little to 5 = very much for question 1, 1 = strongly agree 
to 5 = strongly disagree for questions 2-7, and 1 = absent to 5 = very strong for questions 8-10) assess 
individual differences in perceived capacity to withstand and tolerate general somatic and psychological 
distress.102 One item is pulled from the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI),[ADDRESS_358835] validity.
6) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 ; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]., 2006): 7-item index is a valid and efficient tool 
for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.
7) Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6; Kessler et al., 2002): This 6-item measure is a validated and 
brief index that is used to screen for the presence of mood and anxiety disorders. 
8) Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS; Snaith et al., 1995): 14-item measure used to assess the 
ability to experience pleasure from typi[INVESTIGATOR_294657].157 Participants rate the degree to which 
they believe that they would experience pleasure from hypothetical situations using a 4-point Likert 
type scale ranging from 0 = definitely agree to 3 = definitely disagree. The SHAPS appears to 
demonstrate good construct validity through its significant association with a latent dimension of 
anhedonia158 and test-retest reliability.
9) Change Questionnaire  (Miller & Johnson, 2008): Measures ratings of importance of quitting and 
confidence in quitting on a 10-point Likert-type scale from 0=Definitely Not to  10 = Definitely.
10) McArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler & Stewart, 2007): Self-report measure of an 
individual’s sense of social status across different SES indicators.  The scale is in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_294658], and 
presents the participant with a “social ladder” and asks them to place an “X” where they feel they fall.  
There are two separate social ladders that are presented to the participant.  One is linked to traditional

IRB Form Version v120116SES factors, SES Ladder, while the other is linked to social standing within a community, Community 
Ladder. 
11) Readiness to Quit Ladder: Single-item measure that includes ten response options that assess 
motivation to quit along a continuum.  Options range from 10, “I have quit smoking and I will never 
smoke again”, to 1, “I enjoy smoking and have decided not to quit smoking for my lifetime.  I have no 
interest in quitting”.  As such, higher scores on this measure indicate higher readiness to quit.95 
12) Stages of Change Algorithm (Prochaska, Velicer, DiClemente, & Fava, 1988): This three item 
measure is used to assess readiness for change (i.e., smoking cessation) and will be used to categorize 
participants into precontemplation (i.e., not thinking about quitting), contemplation (yes, within next 6 
mo.), and preparation (i.e., yes, within the next 30 days). This will then be used to inform therapi[INVESTIGATOR_294659].
13) Financial Strain Scale (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Jullan, 1981): This 9-item measure will be 
used to assess participants’ perceptions of financial strain. Subjective indices of financial strain, rather 
than using education or income as the primary indicators of socioeconomic status have the advantage of 
assessing perceived burden and interference. On this measure eight items are rated on a 3-point scale 
(1=no difficulty to 3-very great difficulty; e.g., How difficult is it to afford a home suitable for 
(yourself/your family?). The final item asks participants to report how much money they have left over 
at the end of each month. 
14) Subjective Financial Situation Scale  (Williams et al., 2016): This single item measure asks 
participants to describe their subjective view of their overall personal financial situation.
15) Attitudes Toward Nicotine Replacement Therapy scale: This measure assesses previous offering of 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), perceived advantages to NRT use, perceived side effects, and if 
relevant, reasons for not using NRT.
16) Quitting Preparation and Actions Questionnaire. This measure is used at followup only and assesses 
actions consistent with preparing for or making an attempt to quit smoking.
Pencil Paper Measures
1) Initial screen: This measure will allow us to determine if the participant is likely to meet inclusion 
criteria before we conduct a full baseline assessment.
2) Timeline Followback (Sobell & Sobell, 1992): method of assessing substance use requires participants 
to retrospectively estimate their daily substance and alcohol use. For the purposes of our study, we will 
be assessing past month alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and other substance use.  
3) NRT Contraindication Checklist and Expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559]: Participants will be screened for contraindications 
associated with NRT use, including: hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of the 
NRT product, temperomandibular joint disease (should be excluded from using NRT gum), and active

therapy, and motivational interviewing. Students also have prior experience treating individuals with psychosocial 
impairment in the surrounding area. All graduate students have also interfaced with members of the community to 
facilitate completion of research projects focused on nicotine use. This includes, but is not limited to, structured 
clinical interviewing of research subjects and administration of behavioral tasks.
All graduate students have also completed online coursework on ethical research practices (e.g., HIPAA 
compliance).

samples t-tests, corrected for unequal variances if indicated.  Variables found to show significant baseline 
differences between groups will be included as covariates. Logistic regression analyses will be conducted to 
examine differences in dichotomous outcomes such as abstinence (yes/no), quit attempts (yes/no), and treatment 
seeking (yes/no). Because this is a small, pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will report effect sizes representing each of the two active

Page 1 of 9  Revised: January 31, 2017 1) Protocol Title Transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block catheters vs liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_816292]: A prospective randomized control trial  Protocol Version Date: 1/31/17 2) Objectives i) Primary: Compare the use of TAP blocks with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_816293] (1) We anticipate superior efficacy and pain control with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_816294] (measured in oral morphine equivalents) in the first 48 hours following surgery. ii) Secondary: (1) Assess the efficacy and safety of TAP blocks for pain control after colorectal surgery in a prospective fashion (a) Hypothesis: Anticipate satisfactory pain control in both TAP block groups for somatic abdominal pain measured as proportion of pain scores in the mild range (up to 4 out of 10 pain documented in nursing notes) (b) Anticipate equivalent side effects measured as duration of ileus, rash, itching, nausea/vomiting. (2) Compare the pharmacological costs and medical utilization costs of TAP block catheters versus single shot injection of TAP block with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (a) Anticipate lower medical utilization costs with single shot injection with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_816295]  (b) Measured as acquisition cost of drugs and supplies   3) Background  Pain control after abdominal laparoscopic surgery involves multiple components of somatic and visceral pain. Although opi[INVESTIGATOR_816296], opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] – induced constipation that can increase the risk of postoperative ileus, nausea, and pruritus are significant side effects that may prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  Multimodal analgesic regimens have been shown to increase pain control while sparing the use of systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. These have included modalities such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and peripheral nerve blocks.    The transversus abdominus plane block (TAP) is a minimally invasive ultrasound guided peripheral nerve block that is helpful in decreasing somatic abdominal pain after surgery

Page 2 of 9  Revised: January 31, [ADDRESS_1130214] resulted in a decrease in 24-hour morphine consumption as well as earlier discharge and return to diet time compared to patient controlled analgesia (PCA).  At UC Davis, it is standard practice to place TAP blocks with catheters for adult colorectal surgery patients for perioperative pain control. In many cases, the TAP catheters will remain in the patient for two days and are removed when the patient’s somatic pain is controlled and they able to tolerate oral intake. However, it is resource intensive requiring the use of two sterile peripheral nerve catheter kits, two CADD infusion pumps, nursing time to replace the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_816297] 8-10 hours, and 30-40 minutes of physician time for block placement with additional physician time needed for ongoing catheter management. There is also a risk of catheter – related complications including inadvertent dislodgement, catheter infections, and increased burden to the patient from the two additional catheters tethered to the patient.   An alternative TAP can be performed using liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel). This is an extended release local anesthetic that has been shown to last 48-[ADDRESS_1130215] concrete data on the use of single shot Exparel TAP blocks and TAP catheters to improve patient care at UC Davis and educate other institutions.

Linda Farkas, Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of Surgery.  Individuals under 18 years of age or above the age of 90, pregnant women, prisoners and patients unable to provide consent, and patients unable to speak English will be excluded. If the patient is on systemic anticoagulation and is at an increased risk of hematoma then they will be excluded as the block will not be performed.  Patients with an allergy to a local anesthetic will also be excluded.  5) Study Timelines  Eligible patients will be approached for research and written informed consent will be collected on the day of surgery. TAP block catheters or single shot liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_816299], prior to surgery start.  Intraoperative and post-operative care will be routine at the discretion of the physicians caring for the patient.  TAP block catheters are followed by [CONTACT_816313], typi[INVESTIGATOR_816300].   We anticipate completing our enrollment in 2 years (24 months), with data analysis completed within 6 months after the final patient has been enrolled.  6) Study Endpoints  The primary end point will be after enrollment of patients is complete for both the TAP catheter group and the liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195]. Secondary endpoints are the time for PACU discharge and discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

Page 4 of 9  Revised: January 31, 2017 7) Procedures Involved  Individuals will be screened for study inclusion/exclusion criteria in the preoperative holding area. Faculty anesthesiologist, resident anesthesiologist or trained research staff will approach eligible patients in the preoperative holding area, explain the study, and obtain written informed consent.  Consenting patients will be randomized to a study arm (Exparel single injection TAP block or TAP block catheter). Randomization will be performed based on a random number generator (1 or 2) and after patient is consented. Group [ADDRESS_1130218] of 266 mg of Exparel (1.3% in 20cc) diluted to [ADDRESS_1130219] dilution and volume used in other academic centers for Exparel TAP blocks.  For those randomized to the TAP catheter group, 30 ml of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_816301] [ADDRESS_1130220] peripheral nerve catheters, approximately 3-5cm into the TAP space after injection of the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_816302].  Catheters will be secured to the skin with tegaderm tape. Infusions will be ordered with CADD pumps and will be initiated at a rate of 8 ml/hr of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_816303].    Postoperatively, patients will be monitored in the PACU per routine care. Patients will be ordered a combination of standardized short acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (fentanyl), and long acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (hydromorphone) in additional to anti-emetics (ondansetron 4mg IV) for administration if needed in the PACU. In the PACU, perioperative nursing staff will dose medications accordingly to the EMR orders and the PACU clearance time will be logged as well. PACU duration is calculated as the time interval between patient arrival into the PACU and when the patient is signed out of the PACU by [CONTACT_816314]/faculty.

Page 5 of 9  Revised: January 31, [ADDRESS_1130221] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816304].   Information will be collected from the patients’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], including Ultrasound imaging of the patient’s TAP block, intraoperative anesthesia record, the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_816305] 6, 12, 18, and 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery, incidence of nausea/vomiting, pain score averages from EMR Epic RN Pain data, PACU clearance time and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  8) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality During the study phase, patient information will be stored electronically via a password protected database on the UC Davis OneDrive cloud storage folder.  Only authorized study staff will have access to the file while access to the UC Davis OneDrive folder requires UC Davis login. Patients’ information will be stored on a secure database with indirect identifiers, such as patient 1, patient 2, etc. There will be a separate password protected document that contains the indirect and direct identifiers to match the two. After the study has been closed, consents will be maintained for three years, and HIPAA consents for six years, in compliance with IRB rules and regulations. Any data obtained from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) will be identified by [CONTACT_816315]’s password protected computer.  Statistical analysis plan & Sample size calculation The primary outcome measure will be the between group difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_354921] 48 hours surgery. We anticipate superior pain control in the Exparel group based on the potential for TAP catheter problems such as catheter dislodgement and lack of timely infusion refill. A difference in 20% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_816306]. Prior reports (Carney et al) suggest a difference of 55.3mg ± 17.6 in the control group versus 26.8mg ± 19.8 in the TAP block group. Using a power of 0.8 and p<0.05 as statistically significant yields a sample size of 44 per group to show significance. We will enroll 100 to allow for early withdrawal or protocol violations, with planned interim analysis at n=20 of each group completing the study (40 patients) to allow sample size refinement as needed. Data will be analyzed for normal distribution. Normally distributed data will be compared using a T-test for the 2 groups; data that is not normally distributed will be compared using the Mann Whitney U test. Categorical data will be compared by [CONTACT_351404].

Page 6 of 9  Revised: January 31, [ADDRESS_1130222] completed HIPAA – related training and IRB – related training. 9) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects Patients will be monitored closely in the PACU prior to discharge to the inpatient floor for any signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity, abdominal pain, or allergic reaction. The dose of local anesthetic given will be calculated to be less than the toxic dose level for ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] (2-3mg/kg) and liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (2-3mg/kg). Patients receiving TAP catheters will be seen daily by [CONTACT_816316]. Any adverse events, such as intravascular injection, allergic reaction, or other unanticipated event will be assessed for its causative relationship to the TAP block by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_374857]).   If a serious adverse event occurs, it will be reported immediately to the IRB and will trigger an immediate suspension in enrollment and a review of the injection protocol with the Chiefs of both the Departments of Anesthesiology and Colorectal Surgery. If any performer error can be identified and corrected, then with approval from the departments enrollment will continue. If not, the study will be terminated.  Any unexpected adverse events will be documented and reported to the IRB as well as study participants. We will cumulatively review the data after [ADDRESS_1130223] been enrolled, and then again at 50 patients, 75 patients, 100 patients until study completion. Data will be reviewed for any adverse effects from TAP blocks, pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_816307], other additional secondary outcome measures such as nausea/vomiting.

Page 7 of 9  Revised: January 31, 2017 10)  Withdrawal of Subjects  Because this is a study comparing a single injection versus a peripheral nerve catheter, patients receiving a single injection are able to withdraw voluntarily any time prior to the injection. If there was difficulty with visualization of the TAP plane with ultrasound due to body habitus, then the patient will be withdrawn from the study. At all instances, patient safety will be the primary priority above all over study parameters.   With the TAP catheter group, patients may withdraw voluntarily from the study if they wish.   11) Risks to Subjects A possible risk is the TAP block not providing adequate pain control postoperatively. Patients will have access to routine IV and oral pain medications including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], acetaminophen, NSAIDS, and other multimodal adjuncts. Complications after TAP blocks are rare, and there are no known reports of local anesthetic toxicity after TAP block injections. There have been case reports of liver laceration with inadvertent injury by [CONTACT_816317]. There is also one case report of catheter placement into the peritoneal cavity, although there was no injury to any organs. The likelihood of any needle placement errors is minimized by [CONTACT_816318]. Any adverse event is less likely with careful aseptic technique, performance of a procedural time-out prior to the block, and careful aspi[INVESTIGATOR_816308].  The use of Exparel has been shown to have no greater incidence of adverse events compared to plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_816309] 10 randomized control trials with 823 subjects comparing the two.  Allergic reactions/toxicity from local anesthetics are extremely rare, and symptoms can range from itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, abnormal heartbeat, and in extreme cases, death.  TAP catheters have an inherent risk of hematoma formation, dislodgement and infection due to the nature of having a foreign body catheter in the TAP plane of a patient.  12) Potential Benefits to Subjects Patients may have decreased postoperative pain control with either of the TAP blocks. They may also have decreased intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_816310], which in addition to better pain control may lead to less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] – related side effects including pruritus, decreased incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_816311], nausea and vomiting.

Page 8 of 9  Revised: January 31, 2017  13) Sharing of Results with Subjects No additional information will be shared with research subjects 14) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  Patients will be approached about enrolling in this study in the preoperative area. The person obtaining consent will be a research team member from Anesthesiology and/or Surgery departments.  Patient beds in this area are one bed per room; therefore, the conversation will be in private, between the research staff and patient. Family members may be present, but this is standard for all preoperative consents (anesthesia consents, block consents, sometimes surgical consents if they are not on file). The consent process will specifically state that refusal to enroll will not result in any penalty, including any withholding of pain medication in the future. Post-operatively, patient privacy will be protected and only study personal will have access to the encrypted study database with patient data.  15) Compensation for Research-Related Injury  There is no specific compensation for study participation. TAP blocks are a billable procedure and used routinely for postoperative pain control in colorectal surgery patients. Any possible complications related to the procedure will be covered by [CONTACT_22241].   16) Economic Burden to Subjects No economic burden to patients as TAP blocks are already planned for these patients’ surgical operations. Exparel is FDA approved for this use. UCDMC formulary restricts Exparel use and requires IRB approval for this application. Within an IRB approved protocol the medication would be billed for as with all other medications given to the patient.  There is no additional leave time planned for patients and these procedures will decrease the patients’ postoperative pain control and may allow them to be discharged sooner. 17) Drugs or Devices  The study medication, liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) will be obtained from the inpatient pharmacy prior to administration of the TAP block. All anesthesiologists performing the TAP block will have had prior education about the proper administration and dilution of the Exparel single shot injections.  If the patient is receiving TAP block catheters, then the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] 0.25% medication is obtained from the acute pain block cart per protocol by [CONTACT_816319].   18) ClinicalTrials.gov Registration  Section 1:  NIH Funded Studies

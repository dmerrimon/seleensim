PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title  
A Prospective Randomized Phase II Study of Surgery with or without Adjuvant 
Stereotactc  Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in Patients with Previously -Irradiated Head and 
Neck Cancer  
 
Objectives  
The primary  objective of this study is to compare the 1 -year local control in patients with  
operable, recurrent previously -irradiated squamous cell head -and-neck cancers with or  
without adjuvant SBRT.   
 
The secondary  objectives of this study are:  
1. To determine the locoregional progression -free survival (PFS) distant PFS, overall PFS  
(local + regional + distant), and overall survival (OS).  
2. To evaluate the acute and late toxicities of adjuvant SBRT in the re -irradiation setting  
following salvage surgery.  
3. To determine prognostic factors that may predict the likelihood of local failure, regional  
failure, or OS in this cohort to guide future manage ment.  
4. To compare the impact of adjuvant SBRT versus a wait -and-see approach on patient  
reported quality of life (PR -QoL).  
5. To compare surgical versus SBRT -induced immunological serum markers in relation to 
local control.

1.1 Salvage Surgery for Recurrent Head -and-Neck Cancers  
Recurrent and second -primary head -and-neck cancers (rHNC) in a previously -irradiated  
field represent a therapeutic challenge (1). Even with adjuvant therapy, rHNC occurs in  
≥20-30% of high -risk postoperative patients and ≥30% of patients treated with definitive  
chemorad iotherapy (2 -3). While there are no randomized data to test the benefits of  
salvage surgery after prior irradiation, for patients who can have surgical resection, based  
on available data, surgical resection represents the currently accepted standard of car e (4- 
5). However, even patients with resectable rHNC are at high -risk for subsequent failure  
(67% overall failure rates). In patients with close or positive surgical margins following  
salvage surgery, recurrence rates of nearly 100% have been reported (6) . To improve  
tumor control in this setting adjuvant re -irradiation techniques along with chemotherapy  
has been used with mixed but limited success (7 -10). 
 
1.[ADDRESS_768490] -Roussy (7). In this phase III study, 130 previously -irradiated rHNC  
patients were randomized following salvage surgery to chemotherapy + re -irradiation  
(CT/Re -RT) versus observation. Chemotherapy consisted of six cycl es of hydroxyurea and  
continuous infusion 5 -FU, while adjuvant re -irradiation was delivered to a total dose of 60  
Gy in a split -course fashion (the contemporaneous RTOG standard). Disease -free survival  
(DFS), but not overall survival (OS), was improved wit h the addition of adjuvant CT/Re -RT 
(the study was not powered for OS). However, this treatment was not without toxicity.  
Grade 3 or 4 mucositis was seen in 28% of patients and 39% of patients had grade 3 or 4  
late toxicity versus only 10% of patients in the observation arm. This is the only level I  
evidence for adjuvant therapy in re -irradiation setting. Thus the data supports the role of  
re-irradiation in improving local control albeit with the expense of significant toxicity.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_768491] ic Body Radiotherapy  
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), is a treatment technique that incorporates advances in radiation 
planning and delivery to provide highly conformal doses of radiation with a  
steep -dose gradient to surrounding critical organs -at-risk. Since 2001, researchers at the  
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_584433] a variety of benign and malignant lesions. The advantages of SBRT in  
the setting of re -treatment of high -risk pat ients with head and neck carcinomas are a highly  
conformal treatment volume that affords a small number of fractions, decreased overall  
treatment time, and radiobiological advantages (where acute responding tissue is better  
spared with higher doses per fra ction/lower overall dose to) minimizing acute toxicity.  
 
1.4 Experiences with SBRT at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_584434] (SBRT) has emerged as a promising treatment option in  
patients with unresectable rHNC. Initial phase I dose-escalation study from the University  
of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_584435] 44 Gy in 5 fractions  
(11). Numerous subsequent international single -institution studies have confirmed the  
primary benefits of SBRT relative to co nventional re -irradiation ± chemotherapy for  
unresectable rHNC: decreased toxicity with comparable tumor control/survival (12 -17). 
 Page [ADDRESS_768492] established a dose  
volume  response model and shown similar outcomes for non -squamous versus squamous  
histologies (18 -19). Moreover, longitudinal prospective evaluations of patient -reported  
quality of life (PR -QoL) have shown that improved tumor control associated with SBRT 
reirradiation  ameliorates d ecreased PR -QoL resulting from rSCCHN which transcended all  
measured domains in a validated PR -QoL assessment tool. This improvement was  
independent of age, use of cetuximab, tumor volume, and interval since prior irradiation  
(20). Finally, recent prospect ive data has suggested that the addition of cetuximab to SBRT  
may improve tumor control without significant increases in re -irradiation toxicity for  
unresectable rHNC (21 -22). While there is growing evidence for SBRT in unresectable rHNC,  
there is limited data in the adjuvant setting (23). We recently reported our experience using  
SBRT following salvage surgery for patients with compromised/positive surgical margins  
and extra -nodal extension at high -risk for recurrence (24). Based on these results, SBRT  
may improve tumor control relative to salvage surgery alone and reduce toxicity relative to  
conventional adjuvant radiotherapy ± chemotherapy in rHNC (see Table 1). We seek to  
confirm these retrospective observations with the prospective trial evaluating SBRT  to 
observation post -surgery.

3.1 Overall design and plan of the study  
Detailed visit -by-visit study procedures and a study flow chart are provided in Section 6.3.  Prior 
to enrollment, all subjects will be evaluated with medical records to confirm patient received 
diagnosis of recurrent or second -primary head -and-neck squamo us cell carcinomas. Additionally, 
these records will confirm the patient had had macroscopic complete (R0/R1) salvage surgery and 
previous radiation. Patients will receive a  Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and then followed 
periodically for up until 2 years . 
 
3.2 Screening procedures  
• Medical history (including review of pathology and laboratory values) and physical 
examination  
• Pathologic confirmation of diagnosis and disease status/staging with biopsy to rule out 
metastatic disease (if necessary)  
• Baseline la boratory assessment, including CBC and blood chemistry  
• Urine or blood β -HCG within [ADDRESS_768494] not undergone a surgical sterilization procedure  
• CT or PET -CT of the neck and chest  
• Baseline Quality of Life Assessment  
 
3.[ADDRESS_768495] may be an inpatient at the  
time of diagnosis.  All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_584438].  
 
3.5 Timeline of study procedures  
Once eligible by [CONTACT_584439], patients will be randomized into one of two arms. 
One arm will receive SBRT treatment for 1 – [ADDRESS_768496] of care treatment. Patients will be followed for 8 -12 weeks after 
treatment and every 3 -6 months for up to 24 additional months. Extended long -term follow -up will 
occur as clinica lly indicated until death.  
 
3.6 Research Activities  
 
3.6.1 Pretreatment Evaluation  
The following tests/procedures will be performed within 3 months prior to registration unless 
otherwise specified:  
• Medical history and physical examination  
• Pathologic confirmation of diagnosis and disease status/staging with biopsy to rule out 
metastatic disease if necessary  
• Baseline laboratory assessment, including CBC and blood chemistry  
 Page 9 of 19                                                      14-151 • Urine or blood β -HCG within [ADDRESS_768497] not undergone a surgical sterilization procedure  
• CT (computed tomography) scan or FDG -PET-CT (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography) of the neck and chest  
• Baseline Quality of Life Assessment (University of Washington – Quality of Life – 
Revised (UW -QoL-R) 
 
3.6.2 Randomization  
Once the participant is deemed eligible for the study based upon the screening procedures, the 
patient will be randomized. The randomi zation of subjects to one of the two treatment arms will 
be in a 1:1 ratio,  between the presence or absence of SBRT treatment.  The Hillman Cancer 
Center biostatics facility has a randomizer, an intranet application for randomly assigning 
patients to differ ent thresholds, which will be used for the randomization in the trial.  
 
3.6.3 Treatment  
Steriotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) will be performed on 1 of the treatment arms. Group  
1 will receive SBRT for 1 -2 weeks.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Volume  
Tumor volumes <25cc will receive 40Gy (5 fractions of 8Gy per fraction). Tumor volumes ≥25cc 
will receive 44 -50Gy (5 fractions of 8.8 – 10 Gy per fraction). Ideally, all tumor volumes ≥25cc 
will receive 50Gy over 5 fractions; however, at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist 
based on tumor bed volume, prior radiation dose, and proximity to critical organs , the dose can be 
reduced to 44 Gy over 5 fractions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Arm  
Patients randomized to the adjuvant SBRT arm will receive 40 -50Gy in 5 fractions on non -
consecutive days in 1 -2 weeks  on an outpatient basis. SBRT should be completed at a minimum 
of 4-weeks following salvage surgery, with a maximum of 12 -weeks. CTV (clinical target volume) 
will represent the tumor bed/high -risk region as defined by [CONTACT_584440]. A maximum of 5mm expansion from CTV to PTV  (planning target volume) shall be 
applied  
 
 Treatment Volumes < 25cc will receive 40Gy (5 fractions of 8 Gy per fraction)  
 Treatment Volumes ≥ 25cc will receive 44 -50Gy over 5 fractions (5 fractions of 8.8Gy per  
    fraction). Ideally, all tumors volumes ≥ 25cc will receive 50Gy over  
5 fractions; however, at the discretion of the treating radiation  
oncologist based on tumor  volume, prior radiation dose and  
proximity to critical organs, the dose can be reduced to 44Gy over 5  
fractions as outlined in prior SBRT protocols.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Specifications  
SBRT treatments are to be delineated using CT -based planning with custom thermo plastic  
mask for immobilization. SBRT is to be delivered using linear accelerators commissioned to  
deliver SBRT such as Cyberknife™ M6 (Accuracy, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) Trilogy™ or  
TrueBeam™ STx (Varian Medical Systems Inc., Palo Alto, CA), with daily image guidance to  
 Page 10 of 19                                                      14-151 set-up verification and assessment of intra - and inter -fraction motion.  
 
3.6.4 Follow -up/Long -term follow -up/Extended long -term follow -up procedures  
Follow -up evaluations will be completed in patients in both arms (SBRT and wait -and see).  
They will be carefully followed every [ADDRESS_768498] of the following:  
• Interim medical history and physical examination  
• Careful documentation of Toxicity According to National Cancer Institute Common 
Toxicity  Criteria Events Scale version 4.0  
• Follow -up Patient -Reported Quality of Life Assessment (PR -QoL)  
• FDG PET -CT at [ADDRESS_768499] -treatment then every 12 weeks

3.6.5 Methods of Measurement  
The methods of measurement are as follows:  
 
CT, PET/CT, or MRI are the best currently available methods for measuring disease status.  
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension ≥ 10mm (1.0 cm). If  
measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be  
confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
Clinically detected les ion will only be considered measurable when superficial (vis -à-vis skin  
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). Documentation should include color photography and  
ruler estimation of size.

4.4.1 Specific criteria to exclude pregnant females and feta/neonatal exposure  
 
For all females who are not at least one year post -menopausal or who have not undergone a  
surgical sterilization procedure, a urine pregnancy test will be done. If this is positive or  
questionable a serum pregnancy test will be done. The results of the pregnancy test must be  
negative in order for the patient to participate in this study.  
 
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from part icipation in this study. All  
females of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_768504] agree to use an appropriate "double barrier" method  
of birth control starting from the subject's participation in the screening process to include a  
negative pregnancy test to continue as a study participant and continuing until two  weeks  
following the subject's participation in the study. The methods of birth control should  
include intrauterine device (IUD), contraceptive sponge and spermicide, in addition to male  
use of a condom, or the female should be using prescribed birth control implant. Subjects  
will be instructed to notify the study doctor of their birth control method prior to the start of  
the study, and also if they plan to change their birth control method.  
 
Subjects that choose to be sexually active must be made awar e that even with the use of  
birth control measures, pregnancy could still result. Subjects will be informed that if they  
become pregnant or impregnate a woman while taking part in this study, they must  
immediately notify one of the doctors listed on the co nsent form.  
 
The information listed above will be relayed to applicable subjects by [CONTACT_5984]. It will  
also be listed in the consent form, a copy of which will be provided to the patients for them  
to take home.

5.1 Primary outcome variables to be evaluated  
 
(1) Primary endpoint - local progression -free survival (LPFS), defined as the time from the  
date of randomization to the date of local progression or the date of death from any cause.  
Subjects who are alive and have not progressed will be censored at their last follow -up date.  
(2) Regional PFS, distant PFS, PFS (local + regional + distant): The definition of these  
endpoints is similar to LPFS.  
(3) Overall Survival: time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any  
cause.  
(4) Acute and late toxicities of adjuvant SBRT. Acute toxicity is defined as toxicity occurring  
within 3 months of completion of SBRT. Late toxicity is defined as toxicity occurring later  
than 3 months after SBRT treatment.

6.1 Study objectives and design  
The primary objective is to compare the 1 -year local control in patients with  
operable, recurrent previously -irradiated squamous cell head -and-neck cancers with or  
without adjuvant SBRT.  
 
Secondary objectives include  to determine the  locoregional progression -free survival (PFS) 
distant PFS, overall PFS (local + regional +  distant), and overall survival  (OS) ; to evaluate the  
acute and late toxicities of adjuvant  SBRT in the re -irradiation setting following salvage surgery ; 
to determine prognostic factors  that may predict the likelihood of local failure, regional failure, 
or OS in this cohort to guide  future management ; and to compare the impact of adjuvant SBRT 
versus a wait -and-see approach on patient reported quality of life (PR -QoL),  
 
This clinical trial is planned as a prospective, randomized, two -arm Phase II study.  
 
6.2 Sample size and accrual rate  
Forty (40) patients will be screened for each arm of the trial so that 21 subjects will be cleared to 
participate in research procedures in each arm of the trial.  
 
The following assumptions are used in determining the sample size for this study:  
Primary endpoint: local progression -free survival (LPFS)  
One-sided type I error rate: 0.10  
Statistical power: 90%  
One-year LPFS for surgery alone: 20%  
One-year LPFS for surgery + SBRT: 52%  
Randomization: 1:1  
2-year accrual period and one year follow -up following closure of accrual  
5% lost to follow -up in each arm  
 
To have 90% power to detect the above 32% difference in one -year LPFS, using a onesided  
log-rank test with a 0.1 level of significance, 21 patients are required in each arm.  
The randomizati on of subjects to one of the two treatment arms will be in a 1:1 ratio. The  
UPCI Biostatistics Facility has a randomizer, an intranet application for randomly assigning  
patients to different treatments, which will be used for the randomization in this tria l. 
 
6.3 Statistical approach and analysis  
 
(1) Efficacy Analysis Set: includes all enrolled and randomized patients. Subjects will be  
analyzed according to their randomized treatment group assignment.

Survival endpoints  will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meiermethod and the corresponding median 
survival times (with 95% confidence interval)  reported. The one -year LPFS will also be 
estimated along with its 95% confidence interval.  Survival will be compared between the two 
arms with the one -sided log -rank test. Effect of  treatment and other variables (e.g., baseline 
characteristics, biomarkers etc) on su rvival will  be explored with Cox regression models.  
 
For the quality of life (QoL) data analysis, each item of the UW -QoL-R will be individually  
assessed. The mean and standard deviation of the observed data will be summarized at  
each collection time and p lotted against time, from baseline through the end of patient  
follow -up. Generalized linear models (such as cumulative logit models) for repeated  
measures will be used to explore if there are significant changes in PR -QOL over time.  
 
Using NCI Common Termi nology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), the number of  
patients experiencing adverse events over their course of treatment will be characterized by  
[CONTACT_584445], by [CONTACT_584446],  
and w hether the event is clinically significant. Attribution of adverse events to treatment  
(unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely) will also be summarized for any serious  
adverse events (SAEs), CTCAE grade 3 or higher. The percentage of patien ts experiencing  
SAEs that are considered to be treatment -related (probable or definite) will be determined.  
The percentages of patients experiencing the acute/late toxicities associated with SBRT will  
also be estimated along with their exact 95% confidence intervals.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_768505] data will be collected by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_21823]’s  
Department of Radiation Oncology’s Protocol Office. All data will be secured in a password  
protected file with observance of all applicable HIPAA regulation. A data safety monitoring  
board comprised of the PI, ph ysicians, residents, fellows, physics, statistician and research  
manager will meet monthly to evaluate toxicity for this trial. Subjects/adverse events will  
be discussed at these monthly disease center meetings. Unexpected serious adverse events  
will be re ported to the IRB and DSMC, and minutes of the monthly disease center meetings  
will be reviewed at the DSMC meetings.  
Reports will be submitted annually at the time of the yearly renewal.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_768506]’s website at http://www.irb.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu. In the event  
of such adverse event, the investigator must report the event(s) via phone within 24 hours  
and a written report filed  within 24 hours to the Principal Investigator, or the University of  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_21823]’s Department of Radiation Oncology’s Protocol Office.  
All adverse events will be reported as per the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_584436].irb.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu  .

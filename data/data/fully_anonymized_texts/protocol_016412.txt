Background:  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the commonest genetic disorder in Nigeria , 
affecting up to 150,[ADDRESS_1169712] 6% of all childhood mortality and of those affected, 
only 10% in sub Saharan Africa (SSA) are likely to reach adolescence.  The clinical course 
of SCD is characterized by [CONTACT_841812], which may be severe, 
leading to significant morbidity and mortality . Timely diagnosis is key to pr event or 
manage these complications. However, current diagnostic methods rely  on laboratory 
systems that a re expensive and time consuming  or may even be unavailable.  
General Aim:  The primary study objective is to validate the HemeChip technology as a 
rapid , poin t-of care (POC) platform for screening  SCD.  
Methodology : This will be a  single site  cross -sectional  study . 
Expected Outcome : The validation of the HemeChip technology as an affordable, 
robust, easy -to-use POC  platform for screen ing of sickle cell disease ( SCD).

1.1 Introduction  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) 
synthesis, first described in the medical literature by [CONTACT_841813] 1910. Each year 
about 300,000 infants are born with SCD, including more than 200,000 cases in sub -
Sahar an Africa alone .1 In Nigeria, alone, there are over 150,000 of these children born 
annually and it is estimated that between 50 -90% of these children die before their 
fifth birthday .2 Overall , in the region , 6% of all childhood mortal ity in children less t han 
5 years of age is due to SCD complications  and infections . Vaso occlusive crisis and 
anemia are serious complications of SCD , with infection often being the major cause 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], crisis and death . 
SCD is caused by a point mutation in the six th codon of the beta glo bin chain that 
produces normal Hb  (HbA). This substitution of hydrophilic glutamic acid with 
hydrophobic valine produces sickle Hb  (HbS) , which is abnormally polymerized at low 
oxygen con ditions causing sickling. A bnormal polym eriza tion of HbS  affects red cell 
membrane properties, shape, and density, and subsequent critical changes in 
inflammatory cell and endothelial cell function .[ADDRESS_1169713] practi ces for diagnosing SCD are high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and bench -top Hb electrophoresis . These two approaches, 
however, require trained personnel and state -of-the-art facili ties, both of which may 
be lacking in many parts of sub -Saharan Africa  where the disease is most prevalent .[ADDRESS_1169714] patients.  
1.3  Relevance and Innovation  
HemeChip  diagnostic system offers an original and innovative solution, leveraging a 
novel en gineering approach, to point of care (POC)  diagnosis of SCD . HemeChip 
 Page 4 of 17 Version date: 1.4; 17 September 2018  separates h aemoglobin protein types in a miniscule volume of blood (1μL) on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_841798] a micro -engineered chip with a controlled 
environment and electric field. Differences in Hb  mobilities allow separation to occur 
within the cellulose acetate paper. A micro -engineered design and multiple layer 
lamination approach  are utilized in fabrica ting the HemeChip. The design allows rapid 
manual assembly and results are available within a few minutes  of performing the test . 
HemeChip can also integrate with a mobile user interface (e.g.  IPhone, IPod), which 
shows the  test result quantitatively and objectively on the screen . HemeChip can be 
used  by [CONTACT_841814] a short (30 mi nute) training , eliminating the need for highly skilled 
personnel.   
2.AIMS
2.1  General objective  
The primary study objective is to validate the HemeCh ip technology as a novel, point -
of care (POC) platform for screening  SCD.  The results obtained using the HemeChip 
will be compared to High Performance Liquid Chromatography  (HPLC), and t he 
sensitivity and specificity of the HemeChip will be determined.  
2.2  Secondary objective  
i.To determine the acceptability of using the HemeChip  for POC screening  of
SCD during clinical assessments .
 Page 5 of 17 Version date: 1.4; 17 September 2018  3.LITERATURE REVIEW
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_841799] a global public health problem, SCD  remains a neglected 
health priority in many low- and middle -income countries. Ironically, the burden of 
haemoglobinopathies is projected to increase in the coming decades. By 2050, it is 
estimated that the proportion of sickle cell anaemia births in sub -Saharan Africa will 
be about 88% of the worldw ide total, compared to 79% in 2010. This increase will be 
largely as a result of population growth and public health transition .[ADDRESS_1169715] diagnostic testing for sickle cell disease in clude cellulose acetate or ci trate 
agar electrophoresis  (bench top electrophoresis) , IEF , high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC),  capi[INVESTIGATOR_841800] .11  
Bench top Hb electrophoresis : This is a laboratory method that can be done under 
alkaline or acidic conditions and with a variety of sieving materials such as gel or 
paper .[ADDRESS_1169716] high 
HbF levels, which may result in inaccurate identification of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_841801].  
 Page 6 of 17 Version date: 1.4; 17 September 2018  Isoelectric Focusing  (IEF) : IEF exploits the fact that the net charge of a protein varies 
with the pH of the surrounding medium. Utilizing this variation, proteins are separated 
based on their isoelectric points (pI), which can be defined as the point at which a 
protein possesses zero net charge. The technique use s an applied electric field across 
a gel medium with a fixed pH gradient, each Hb type becomes immobilized once it 
reaches its pI. IEF exhibits higher resolution than Hb electrophoresis, thus it is capable 
of distinguishing between a larger number of Hb va riants . However, due to the larger 
number of bands that this higher resolution results in, IE F results are harder to 
interpret .12,13 IEF is also exp ensive and  results can be inaccur ate especially at low Hb  
concentrations. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_841802], IEF i s considered suitable for newborn 
screening since diagnosis is possible with very small sample volume or even an eluate 
from a dried blood spot .12 
High Performance Liquid Chromatography  (HPLC) : HPLC separates a fluid into its 
components based on size and c harge using cation exchange chromatography to  
identify the various Hb  types in a blood sample. Unique aspects of this test are full 
automation and accurate quantification of the Hb  levels. These machines are relatively 
expensive and are not readily available in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] .[ADDRESS_1169717].  
DNA Analysis : DNA -based assays can be used to detect the mutations in 𝛽 globin that 
produce abnormal Hb .[ADDRESS_1169718] often used for prenatal testing rather than 
postpartum .15  
HemeChip Technology : HemeChip  technology offers an original and innovative 
solution, leveraging a novel engineering approach, to point -of-care diagnosis of SC D. 
The basis of HemeChi p technology lies in Hb electrophoresis, in which Hb  types C, 
A2, S, F, and A0 have net negative charges  in an alkaline sol ution. Differences in Hb  
mobilities allow separation to occur within the sieving medium, cellulose acetate 
paper.  
 Page 7 of 17 Version date: 1.4; 17 September 2018  There is no POC device  for SCD or any other Hb  disorder screening on the market. 
Currently available tests require skilled technicians in central labs. In Africa , HPLC 
costs up to $[ADDRESS_1169719] year to six small businesses to deve lop affordable POC diagnostic 
technologies for SCD (Correlia Bio., Rockland Immun., Daktari Diag., Silver Lake 
Res., Halcyon Biom., and Qoolabs). The vast majority of these companies rely on 
lateral flow immunoassays, which embody specific antibodies. Unli ke the HemeChip 
technology, antibody based devices are specific to only a single disease, and would 
not work for different Hb  disorders. Furthermore, the performance and reliability of 
lateral flow devices quickly degrade under uncontrolled envir onmental conditions in 
resource -limited countries .[ADDRESS_1169720] methods (i.e., HPLC, bench -top 
electrophoresis) using 82 blood samples from 27 patient s at Unive rsity Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 
Cleveland, [LOCATION_003] . HemeChip offers a $[ADDRESS_1169721] for SCD (and other Hb  
disorders), which takes 10 minutes to run. It is mobile and easy -to-use; it can be 
performed by [CONTACT_841814] a short (30 minute) training. The $2 HemeChip based 
newborn screening can be overlaid on existing successful (WHO, UNICEF data ) 
primary vaccination programs in sub -Saharan Africa, as a time -for-screening. Primary 
customers would be the front -line health care workers in government -established 
immunization programs  and pediatric clinics  in sub -Saharan Africa.

Title Oral Immunotherapy for Induction of Tolerance and Desensitization in 
Peanut-Allergic Children  
Short Title  Peanut OIT in Children  
Sponsored by  [CONTACT_80913]:  Wesley Burks, MD  
Protocol Co -chair:  Stacie M. Jones, MD  
Accrual Objective  144 participants  
Study Design  This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study 
comparing peanut oral immunotherapy to placebo.  Eligible participants with 
peanut allergy will be randomly assigned to receive either peanut OIT or 
placebo for 134 weeks followed by [CONTACT_80914] 26 weeks.  
 
An initial blinded oral food challenge (OFC) to 1 g of peanut flour (500 mg 
peanut protein) will be conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction 
during this blinded OFC to initiate study dosing. After the initial blinded 
OFC, the study design includes the following:  
 Initial Dose Escalation:  This will occur on a single day in which multiple 
doses are given. Peanut or placebo dosing  will be given incrementally and 
increase every 15-30 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut fl our (6 mg 
peanut protein) or placebo  flour is given. The first four doses will be 
administered as a peanut flour extract of 0.[ADDRESS_88157] 3 mg peanut flour (1.5 mg peanut protein) or placebo  flour to remain 
in the study.  
 Build-up:  After the initial dose escalation day, the participant will return to 
the research unit the next morning for an observed dose  administration of 
the highest tolerated dose from the initial escalation day. The participant will then continue on the daily OIT dosing at home and return to the research unit every 2 weeks for a dose escalation. The dosing escalations will be consistent with previous similar OIT studies . 
 
Participants who do not reach the 4000 mg peanut flour (2000 mg peanut 
protein) or placebo flour dose during the build-up phase may enter 
maintenance phase at their highest tolerated dose, which must be at least 500 
mg peanut flour (250 mg peanut protein)  or placebo flour . 
 The build-up phase will comprise 30 weeks.  
 Maintenance:   The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits 
every 13 weeks. At the end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).  
 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88158]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children This phase will comprise 104 weeks.  
 
Avoidance :  In this final phase participants stop OIT and will avoid peanut 
consumption They will be seen [ADDRESS_88159] a final blinded 
OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein) . Participants who do not have 
a clinical reaction to the challenge will receive an Open Food Challenge (OpFC). 
 
Avoidance will comprise [ADDRESS_88160]-challenge:  
If participants do not have a clinical reaction  during 
the OpFC at the end of avoidance, they will be allowed to consume 
peanut and will have one visit which will include peripheral blood 
sampling for mechanistic assays assessments . 
 
Post-challenge will comprise 2 weeks.  
Study Duration  Total study duration will be up to 238 weeks (slightly more than 4 and one -
half years).  
 
• Enrollment will be up to 78 weeks.  
• Study participation will be [ADDRESS_88161]-
challenge. 
Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants desensitized to peanut 
after 134 weeks OIT.  
 
Participants who pass a  blinded OFC to 10 g of peanut flour (5 g of peanut 
protein) at this time without significant symptoms as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] will be considered desensitized to peanut. Failure will be defined as 
either unable to undergo the final food challenge or inability to tolerate the maximum dose because of significant symptoms such as hives, wheezing, 
vomiting, or laryngeal edema.  
Secondary Endpoints  Efficacy 
• Tolerance Endpoint  
The proportion of participants who pass  both the blinded OFC to 10 
g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein)  and the Open OFC to 8  g peanut 
protein in natural food form  at week 160.   
Passing a blinded OFC is defined in Section 3.3.1. 
            Passing an Open OFC is defined in Section 6.4.3.  
 
• Transient Desensitization Endpoint 
This is the change in proportion of participants who pass the 
blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein) at week [ADDRESS_88162]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017

Peanut OIT in Children 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 BACKGROUND 
Allergy to cow’s milk, hen’s egg, and peanut comprise about 80% of food allergies in children in the 
[LOCATION_002] .1,[ADDRESS_88168] decade and is 
estimated to be about 1%.2 Symptoms of food allergy can be mild to severe, with peanut being the 
leading cause of life threatening or fatal reactions. Unlike cow’s milk and hen’s egg allergy, peanut allergy tends to persist, and only 20% of children outgrow their disease.
[ADDRESS_88169] of care in management of peanut allergy is dietary avo idance of peanut and 
education of the patient/family in the acute management of an allergic reaction .[ADDRESS_88170] has shown some efficacy;  however, this approach was associated 
with frequent and severe adverse reactions.
8,9 Novel approaches such as treatment with anti -IgE 
antibody,10 immunotherapy with mutated recombinant protein11 or alternative medicine approaches12 
are currently under investigation or are lacking  proof of efficacy in humans.  
This trial of peanut oral immunotherapy is based on data from previous work suggesting peanut OIT 
will desensitize and possibly tolerize peanut allergic subjects.13-15 A study published by [CONTACT_80917]. 
suggested efficacy of the peanut OIT .15 In the study, peanut allergic children underwent an OIT 
protocol consisting of an initial dose escalation day, bi -weekly build -up (to 2 g) and daily 
maintenance phase followed by [CONTACT_80918]. After tolerating less than [ADDRESS_88171]. Burks’ group 
demonstrated that at the completion of OIT, the OIT subjects ingested the maximum cumulative dose 
of 5000 mg during OFC while the placebo subjects ingested a median cumulative dose of 280 mg 
(p<0.001).[ADDRESS_88172] been identified , 
including both thymus-derived “ natural” as well as antigen -specific, adaptive Tregs, both of which  
have recently been associated with expression of the transcription factor  FoxP3
21. Evidence that  this 
subset of cells may be important in food allergy comes from a study by [CONTACT_80919], which demonstrated 
the presence of a regulator y population among CD25+ T cells in milk -allergic subjects who had 
become tolerant to milk and was absent in those subjects with persistent milk  allergy22. 
Food-specific IgE generally decreases in concentration over time in individuals who are in the 
process of “outgrowing ” the specific food allergy23. Aside from the degree of respon se (i.e., 
concentration of allergen -specific IgE antibodies), recent studies indicate that the profile  of IgE 
binding to specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_80863]. For example, studies 
evaluating epi[INVESTIGATOR_80864] s equential epi[INVESTIGATOR_80865] ’s milk proteins, using 
synthesized overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_80866], revealed particular epi[INVESTIGATOR_80867]24-26. Moreover, IgE binding to particular epi[INVESTIGATOR_80868] (e.g., at age 3 years rather than ages 
over 5 or 6 years). One hypothesis as to why certain epi[INVESTIGATOR_80869], which remain stable despi[INVESTIGATOR_80870] (such as cooking and digestion). Conversely, IgE antibodies dir ected to epi[INVESTIGATOR_80871] l structures that are more prone to denaturing elements may be 
associated with transient allergy.  In addition, IgE recognition of certain immunodominant regions 
within the major peanut allergens Ara h [ADDRESS_88173] a recent  study showed that a 
binding “signature” of IgE to specific linear peanut peptides could accurately predict the development of spontaneous natural tolerance
28.  
Peanut OIT studies conducted at Duke University  and the University of Ar kansas support the concept 
that tolerance can be  achieved by a long period of OIT. In these studies, [ADDRESS_88174] reached the 2.5 -year point in the study29. The study was designed where subjects who were on 
OIT longer than 2.5 years and who had a peanut IgE < 2 kUA/L would have a food challenge while on 
therapy. I f they passed the challenge, they were taken off the OIT. One month later, they would have 
a food challenge off-therapy. If they passed this challenge, they would introduce peanuts into their 
diet. For the 9 subjects, 6 of them had a peanut IgE < 2 kUA/L and followed the above protocol. All [ADDRESS_88175] peanuts in their diet. Beyond the 2 -year time frame, the peanut 
IgE continues to decline in all subjects (personal  communication Drs. Burks and Jones). Two thirds of 
subjects developed tolerance after 2.[ADDRESS_88176] food allergy is a 
practical and safe method of active treatment. The overall goals of this study are to show that  oral 
tolerance to specific food allergens can be induced and that children can be protected from  adverse 
reactions from accidental food ingestion (desensitized). In this prospective, mul ti-center 
interventional study, we will select relatively young children who have peanut allergy for a  double 
blind, placebo- controlled trial of peanut  OIT. This approach provides a unique opportunity to monitor 
the natural course of peanut allergy and to perform comparative investigations concerning  biological 
and immunological outcomes. We will explore several primary hypotheses that should identify the 
major immune responses responsible for the evolution of peanut allergy. 
The current study investigate s long term tolerance by [CONTACT_80920]. After a dose escalation phase, subjects receive maintenance oral immunotherapy 
for an extended period. At the end of that period an assessment for peanut allergy  is carried out.  Then 
OIT or placebo is stopped, and subjects are observed during an avoidance phase. Participation will 
conclude with a final assessment for peanut allergy a fter the avoidance phase. This approach entails 
several design decisions, which can be justified by [CONTACT_80921].  
The age of potential participants was chosen with the aim  of finding a  group whose immune system is 
more likely to be modified by [CONTACT_80922]. Older children tend to have higher IgE levels and may be less 
likely to undergo desensitization successfully and to develop tolerance. Other entry criteria such as 
skin test wheal size and peanut -specific IgE level were chosen to  ensure that participants have strong 
evidence of established peanut allergy. The se objective measures are considered more important for 
study entry than clinical history which is less reliable.  
Reactivity on an oral food challenge is part of the eligibility for the trial. While we expect children to react at different levels of peanut  in an initial OFC, this level is not known to predict accurately the 
likelihood of desensitization or development of tolerance. Therefore stratification based on this level 
is not applied in this study. Children with asthma beyond a specified level of severity are excluded for safety considerations.  Presence of a sibling in a subject’s household with peanut allergy will not be 
considered an exclusion because we judge the risk of exposure to the investigational product is small 
and can be managed by [CONTACT_80923]. 
The protocol specifies minimum and target doses that must be achieved for the initial dose escalation, 
build-up and m aintenance phases . The minimum dose for initial dose escalation is chosen based on 
findings in previous studies
15,[ADDRESS_88177] to a challenge dose to build -up to and continue 
maintenance . We propose a target maintenance dose that previous experience suggests is close to the 
maximum that is practical to give as peanut flour (or placebo) added to other food.  
The optimal duration of OIT is unknown. Previous studies indicate that one year or more of OIT 
results in desensitization. Results emerging in [ADDRESS_88178] a moderate one exists.  
1.4 SUMMARY OF KNOWN AND POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS FOR 
PARTICIPANTS   
1.4.1 Risks  
The initial dose escalation day followed by [CONTACT_80924]-up phase is developed based on the 
investigators’ previous experience with peanut OIT. In the Principal Investigators’ experience, the 
initial doses have been well tolerated. Consequently, the initial escalation phase was included in an attempt to shorten the rather prolonged build-up phase. The likelihood of a subject experiencing 
allergic symptoms will be lessened by [CONTACT_80925] l, starting at extremely small amounts (0.2 mg 
peanut flour or 0.1 mg protein) of the peanut for dosing. Although few in number, the previous OIT 
studies have not reported significant clinical reactions during the build -up phase of treatment. 
The build-up and daily maintenance doses of peanut O IT may cause allergic  symptoms  including 
sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of eczema, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
discomfort, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath , or ocular, nasal, oral, or throat pruritus, in addition 
to severe anaphylaxis. The likelihood of a participant  experiencing any allergic symptoms will be 
lessened by [CONTACT_80926]-up dosing under observation in a c linical setting until the maintenance dose is achieved.  
Oral food challenges may induce an allergic response. Three OFCs will be conducted: one at study entry, one at the end of therapy, and one 26 weeks  after cessation of therapy. Allergic reactions can b e 
severe and include  life-threatening allergic reactions; however, the risk of an  allergic reaction is 
reduced by [CONTACT_80927] a very small amount of the food, gradually increasing the dose, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80872] a reaction. If participants have an allergic reaction during the challenges, they may need oral, intramuscular, or intravenous medications ( participants 
judged by [CONTACT_80928]). Trained personnel, including a physician, as well as medications and equipment, will be immediately  available to treat any reaction. The DBPCFCs will potentially be made safer by 
[CONTACT_80929], thereby [CONTACT_80930].
[ADDRESS_88179] may experience other allergic symptoms including sneezing, ocular pruritus and tearing, 
rhinorrhea, and/or urticaria. Very rarely, some  individuals with these types of symptoms may develop 
a serious allergic reaction that is life threatening, but no deaths from skin prick testing using standard 
dosing techniques have been reported in fifty years.  
1.4.2 Potential Benefits  
The benefits include the po tential of decreas ing the participant’s reactivity to peanuts after an 
accidental ingestion and the altering of the natural progression of peanut allergy by [CONTACT_80931]. The subject may potentially become clinically and immunologically tolerant to peanut, 
which otherwise occurs in only about 20% of children. A m ajor obstacle to the widespread 
implementation of current treatment strategies is the requirement for daily dosing. T his outcome may 
provide new evidence that daily treatment is not required for an indefinite period to maintain  a state 
of desensitization.  
In this way, this study will also help expand the knowledge of food allergy in general and may lead to 
new management and therapeutic protocols for individuals with food allergies.  
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective is to determine whether 134 weeks of peanut OIT induces desensitization in 
children with peanut allergy. 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
1. To determine whether 134 weeks of peanut OIT induces tolerance in children with peanut 
allergy. 
2. To assess the safety of peanut OIT and subsequent withdrawal of OIT in this population.  
3. To define the immunological responses underlying desensitization and tolerance to peanut . 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 DESCRIPTI ON 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study comparing peanut oral 
immunotherapy to placebo.  
Eligible participants with peanut allergy  will be randomly assigned to receive either peanut OIT or 
placebo for 134 weeks  followed by [CONTACT_80914] 26 weeks . 
An initial blinded oral food challenge (OFC) to 1 g of peanut flour ( 500 mg peanut protein ) will be 
conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction during this blinded OFC to initiate study dosing. 
After the initial blinded OFC, the study design includes the following :

Peanut OIT in Children Initial Dose Escalation :  This will occur on a single day in which multiple doses are given.  Peanut or 
placebo dosing will be given incrementally  and increase every 15-30 minutes until a dose of 12 mg 
peanut flour ( 6 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour is given. The first four doses will be administered 
as a peanut flour  extract of 0.[ADDRESS_88181] three doses will be given as peanut flour of 3 to 12 mg 
peanut flour (1.5 to 6 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour . Participants must tolerate a dose of at least  
3 mg peanut flour ( 1.5 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour to remain in the study. 
Build-up:  After the initial dose e scalation day, the participant will return to the research unit the next 
morning for an observed dose  administration  of the highest tolerated dose from the initial escalation 
day. The participant will then continue  on the daily OIT dosing at home and return to the research 
unit every 2 weeks for a dose escalation. The dosing escalation s will be consistent with previous 
similar OIT studies. The dosing escalation table is as below . Participants who do not reach the 4000 
mg peanut flour (2000 mg peanut protein) or placebo flour dose during the Build -up phase may enter 
maintenance phase at their highest tolerated dose, which must be at least 500 mg peanut flour (250 
mg peanut protein) or placebo flour. 
The build-up phase will comprise 30 weeks. 
Maintenance :  The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits every 13 weeks. At the 
end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein ). 
The maintenance phase will c omprise 104 weeks. 
Avoidance :  In this phase p articipants will stop OIT and will avoid peanut consumption. They will be 
seen [ADDRESS_88182] a blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein). Participants who do not have a clinical 
reaction to the blinded OFC will undergo an Open Food Challenge (OpFC) (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The avoidance phase will comprise [ADDRESS_88183]-challenge :  If participants do not have a clinical reaction  during the OpFC at the end of 
avoidance, they will be allowed to consume peanut and will have one visit which will include 
peripheral blood sampling for mechanistic assays assessments. 
The post-challenge phase will comprise [ADDRESS_88184]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017

reestablish contact [CONTACT_73880]) . 
5. STUDY MEDICATION S 
5.1 PEANUT ORAL IMMUNOTH ERAPY 
5.1.1 Overview  
There will be two forms of peanut oral immunotherapy. Both will be derived from Partially Defatted 
Peanut Flour—12% fat —Light Roast from the Golden Peanut Company, Blakely, Georgia. 
One form will be a liquid extract derived from the peanut flour source material . This will be used 
during initial dose escalation for doses 0.1 to 0.8 mg of peanut protein (see Table 1). Another form 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88196] derived from oat flour source material . This will be used during 
initial dose escalation for doses 0.1 to 0.8 mg (see Table 1).  Another form will be oat flour. This will 
be used for the remainder of dose escalation, build-up, and m aintenance. 
The peanut and placebo extract and flour are similar in appearance, texture , and taste. This will help 
protect blinding. 
All liquid extract peanut and placebo oral immunotherapy products that will be used for the initial 
dose escalation day, will be manufactured  centrally at the University of North Carolina GMP 
manufacturing facility by [CONTACT_80932] p roduct Drug Master 
File. The liquid extracts will then be frozen and sent to all sites.

Peanut OIT in Children 6.1.3 Discontinuation Visits  
 Participants who prematurely terminate due to withdraw al of the consent or investigator decision  will 
be invited to attend a disconti uation visit prior to discharge from the stu dy.  
6.2 RANDOMIZATION , BLINDING  AND UNBLINDING  
6.2.1 Enrollment, Randomization and Preparation of Doses  
Participants who provide informed consent and meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 
2:[ADDRESS_88210]-protected, w eb-based, electronic data capture (EDC) system 
that is developed, validated, and maintained by [CONTACT_63662] (SDCC). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_80937] a password-protected, web-
based, randomization system (RhoR AND™) maintained by [CONTACT_80938]. Authorized clinical study 
personnel, who will remain blinded, will enter the parti cipant identifica tion number and eligibility 
criteria for randomization into the system. The system will generate an unblinded electronic treatment 
assignment notification to the unblinded investigational pharmacist  and a blinded participant 
randomization notification to the clinical study personnel  via email .  
The manufacturing f acility will centrally prepare, package, label, and store, investigational product in 
individual unblinded doses and distribute to the investigational pharmacy. 
The investigational pharmacist  will obtain  individual un blinded partic ipant doses consistent with 
participant’s  treatment assignment and current dose level.  The investigational pharmacist will link  the 
unique participant  identification number to a unique barcoded label on the treatment doses from the 
site’s inventory to confirm the correct treatment assignment.  
Participant doses will be dispensed to clinical study personnel in a blinded manner for dispensing to 
the participant. Prior to dispensing  the doses, the blinded study personnel will scan the unique 
barcoded labels linked to the participant ’s doses to confirm the correct treatment assignment using the 
EDC system.  
During site visits, an unblinded site monitor will check the pharmacy logs to ensure that appropriate 
randomization as signments were received, recorded, and maintained.  
6.2.2 Blinding  
Blinding will be maintained for all study participants through the time of the final blinded 10 g peanut 
flour (5 g peanut protein) OFC, which will occur 26 weeks after cessation of OIT at the end  of the 
study (week 160).  
6.2.3 Unblinding  
Unblinding before the study is completed will occur only if a participant’s well- being is threatened 
and the investigator believes unblinding is necessary to protect the participant.  
Before treatment assignment for an  individual participant is unblinded, the investigator must confer 
with the DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor. In the event of extreme medical emergencies, the site 
investigator will contact [CONTACT_80939] . The site investigator will notify the Protocol C hair or co-Chair of the unblinding event, 
and the DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor will notify the study management team (SMT).  
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88211] verify that the Medical Monitor was notified and 
that a written account was completed . The reasons for unblinding of a participant’s treat ment will be 
included in the final study report.  
ITN and DAIT/ NIAID approval is required for unblinding the treatment of an individual participant 
or subgroups of participants for unplanned interim analyses to support DSMB reviews and final analysis. 
An exception to the above rule is that IND Safety Reports will be reported to the FDA, DSMB and 
IRBs in an unblinded fashion as requested by [CONTACT_80940]. 
6.3 GENERAL ASSESSMENTS  
• Informed Consent. 
• Demographics. 
• Medical history to determine if there are any clinically significant diseases or medical 
procedures other than the disease under study. 
• Comprehensive physical examination  to include skin, HEENT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular , 
gastrointestinal, endocrine/metabolic, neurological, blood/lymphatic, musculoskeletal .  
• Brief physical examination to include skin, HEENT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular , gastrointestinal. 
• Vital signs . Weight, height, temperature, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and pulse will be obtained 
at all visits .  
• Concomitant medications. All concomitant medications will be recorded . 
• Adverse events . Participants will be assessed for AEs. 
6.[ADDRESS_88212] skin prick tests performed using study approved procedures for food and environmental allergens. Participants will be required to be off of antihistamines for an appropriate 
length of time (5 half-lives of the an tihistamine that is being used).  Positive (histamine) and negative 
(saline glycerin) controls are placed to establish that the response is not blocked and to determine if 
there is dermatographism, respectively.   
 The following allergens will be tested :  
 
Food allergens :  Peanut, egg white, c ow's milk, soy, wheat, s esame, tree nuts (cashew, walnut, 
hazelnut, almond, pecan , pi[INVESTIGATOR_80879], and Brazil nut ) 
Inhalant allergens:   Cockroach, dust mite , cat, dog, Bermuda grass, Timothy grass , ragweed, oak, 
birch, Alternaria  sp. 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88213]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children In addition, IgE t esting will be done for  the food allergens and inhalant allergens listed above (see 
Appendix 1 and 2).  
Oat will be tested by [CONTACT_80941] a suspected clinical reaction to oat . 
6.4.3 Oral Food Challenge s (500mg, 5g and Open Food Challenge ) 
All OFCs conducted in the study are double blind and placebo controlled and will be performed so 
that neither the participant, nor the participant’s caregiver, nor the physician knows which challenge 
contains the peanut or the placebo. The [ADDRESS_88214] medical supervision in a clinical research center 
or food challenge area with emergency medications and staff immediately available and will follow 
establishe d study procedures.  
Prior to a blinded OFC, participants will be off antihistamines for an appropriate length of time (5 
half-lives of the antihistamine that is being used)  and participants will be assessed for an exacerbation 
of asthma as determined by [CONTACT_80942] a current flare in atopic dermatitis (
Section 
6.7.2).  
Participant s judged by [CONTACT_80943].  Such participants would include those with a history 
of life-threatening anaphylaxis to any food , or a reaction to any food which caused dehydration and 
required i ntravenous fluid resuscitation.  
A uniform approach for food challenges will be used. The blinded OFC will consist of 1 g or 10 g of 
peanut flour (500 mg or 5 g of the peanut protein) or placebo flour in gradually increasing doses at 
15-[ADDRESS_88215], the investigator may use 
clinical judgment to increase the intervals between doses or repeat lower doses, if there is a concern that a reaction may be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. For the 500 mg blinded OFC , the set of doses will be comprised of 
the following : 1%, 4%, 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 25%. F or the 5 g blinded OFC, t he set of doses will be 
comprised of the  following : 0.1%, 1%, 4%, 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 25%. Though many published 
challenges begin with 5% i nitial doses, the minimum dose for this study was chosen to be a lower 
dose according to additional recent recommendations and consensus
32.  
If conducted in a single day, at least [ADDRESS_88216] a meal size portion  (approximately 8 grams of peanut protein) of 
the food in its natural form (e.g., 2 tablespoons peanut butter ) in an open setting  in which all of the 
involved parties are aware of the identity of  the food to make sure that it  is tolerated.  
The OpFC will be conducted 2 hours after passing a 5g blinded OFC. The  peanut-containing food 
should be consumed during a 120 minutes maximum (30- 60 minute  preferred) time  period at the 
participant’s own pace (i.e., not in a stepwise or graded fashion). If the participant passes the OpFC, 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88217]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children the participant should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours or longer as  indicated by [CONTACT_2416]’s status.  
If the participant has negative reaction during OpFC but could not consume the full amount of open 
challenge material, a repeat OpFC may be scheduled within [ADDRESS_88218], and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]. Outcome of the challenge will be determined by [CONTACT_80944]: 
A positive food challenge will be defined by [CONTACT_80945]:  
o One or more major criteria.  
o Two or more minor criteria. 
Otherwise, the food challenge will be considered negative. A  challenge may be discontinued and 
considered positive if in the judgment of the investigator, the subject is experiencing an allergic 
reaction even though scoring criteria are not fulfilled. The investigator should document why she or he believes the subject is experiencing an allergic reaction.  
All symptoms should be of new onset and not due to ongoing disease. Symptoms must occur no later 
than [ADDRESS_88219] dose.  
During a challenge, if a participant has a false positive reaction to the placebo, both the peanut and 
placebo challenge can be repeated, at the study physician’s discretion.

with graduated doses every 15-30 minutes up to 12 mg peanut flour ( 6 mg peanut protein) or placebo 
flour, if tolerated , in one day. A table listing dose increments during i nitial dose escalation is 
in Section 3.[ADDRESS_88225] active wheezing or a current flare in atopic dermatitis. If symptoms occur  
preventing escalation to 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg  peanut protein) or placebo flour , the highest 
tolerated dose of at least 3 mg peanut flour (1.5 mg  peanut protein) or placebo flour  will be accepted  
as the dose for further escalation. Participants must tolerate at least 3 mg peanut flour (1.5 mg peanut 
protein) or placebo flour as a f inal dose to remain in the study. 
Intravenous access will be established prior to initial day of dosing and maintained with a 
saline/heparin lock, per investigator’s discretion.  Intramuscular epi[INVESTIGATOR_80883] e. If 
necessary, albuterol will be used for lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (wheezing). A licensed and qualified 
nurse coordinator will oversee administration of the dose to the participant. A physician is required to 
be available on site during administration  and must be available at all times for emergency treatment 
for anaphylaxis.  
Since the p articipants are very young children, they may have clear liquids, JELL-O, or other small 
amounts of food such as crackers, cereal, etc. during the day of the i nitial dose escalation while they 
are being given the desensitization doses.  
Participants may develop symptoms during the initial escalation. The investigator’s judgment will be 
required to determine the best course of action with possible actions being:  
1. Extend time interval between dosing ( up to an additional 30 minutes). 
2. Return to previously tolerated dose (i.e., repeat of last tolerated dose) then advance forward. 
3. Discontinue protocol. 
For oral or pharyngeal pruritus , the action should be to continue the normal dosing in 30 minutes. 
For mild symptoms , defined as : 
• skin — limited or localized hives  or swelling, skin flushing or pruritus

the action should be to implement a 30-60 minute observation period and if symptoms resolve, reduce 
the dose by [CONTACT_80946], repeat the same dose, or increase the dose by [CONTACT_80946] ; 
if symptoms continue or worsen, the participant  can be treated with appropriate rescue medication : 
 
if symptoms resolve, reduce the dose by [CONTACT_80946] , repeat the same dose, or increase the dose by [CONTACT_80947]; 
if symptoms require additional treatment, then consultation with the Protocol Chair or Co -Chair as 
listed on the cover page of the protocol is warranted to determine the next course of a ction. The 
Protocol Chair or Co -Chair will be available for questions and decision making for any questions 
related to the study protocol from 10 AM ET to 5 PM ET Monday through Friday. 
For severe symptoms, defined as : 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] — laryngeal edema, throat  tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with dyspnea 
• GI — significant severe abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/repetitive vomiting  
• neurological — change in mental status  
• circulatory — hypotension 
 
The initial escalation dose should be discontinued and the appropriate rescue medications 
administered. 
If the subject requires treatment for symptoms with antihistamines on one occasion  during the initial 
escalation protocol, then the rest of the protocol may be followed. If the subject requires more than 
one medication (e.g., albuterol, diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or others) or multiple doses of 
antihistamines, the initial escalation protocol should be terminated.  
For a completed initial escalation protocol with no symptoms or only mild symptoms, subjects should 
have a 2-hour post-protocol observation period. For moderate to severe symptoms, the observation 
period should be at least [ADDRESS_88227] dose or

The dosing escalation will be incremental based on previous OIT studies .  
The first daily dose of peanut will be given in the clinical research  unit to ensure there are no ill 
effects of the once-daily dosing. Thereafter, the daily dose will be given at home. Every 2 weeks  (12 
to 21 days) , the participant will return to the research unit for a dose escalation. During observed dose 
escalation visits, if there are no symptoms after a [ADDRESS_88229]’s previous dosing history for the immediate past [ADDRESS_88230] will be observed for a 
minimum of 2 hours or until the participant ’s symptoms resolve. If symptoms occur that require 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], the participant  will be observed a minimum of 4 hours or until the participant ’s

Peanut OIT in Children symptoms resolve. If symptoms do not fully resolve after 4 hours or if new symptoms occur, the 
participant will be transferred to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80885]’s discretion . 
Participants will be given the contact [CONTACT_80948], 
pager numbers,  and office phone numbers for questions or concerns as they arise during the study. An on-call physician at each site will be reachable by [CONTACT_80949]. At each dose escalation 
visit to assess for dosing compliance and dosing reactions the contact [CONTACT_80950] . Any dose escalation attempts may be postponed for 1- [ADDRESS_88232] on the escalation day but should take all other prescribed medications unless told to hold for study procedures .  
The daily home dose should be taken as part of a meal. It is recommended that the dose be taken at a 
consistent time (within a 4 -hour time period), and it is cr itical to take the dose every day. Doses 
should be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 12 hours. Participant s that require dosing reduction during the 2- week 
period will reset their 2 -week escalation schedule to maintain the new dose for a 2 -week period prior 
to attempting to escalate again.  
Participants will be allowed to take their other daily medications during the build-up and m aintenance 
phases of the study (i.e., antihistamines, albuterol).  
Participants will be free from active wheezing or a flare of atopic dermatitis prior to any dose 
escalation. Participants will be maintained on their current dose of study product until their flare of asthma or atopic dermatitis resolve.  
Participants  may develop symptoms during dosing for the build -up phase. The investigator ’s 
judgment will be required to determine the best course of action with possible actions being: 
1. Continue with daily home dosing. 
2. Continue the same daily dose for the rest of the 2- week interval . 
3. Return for repeat dosing in the clinical research center . 
4. Return for dosing of previously tolerated dose (without escalation) in the clinical research center. 
5. Discontinuation of dosing . 
If a participant  has a dose escalation in the clinical research center  without symptoms, the action 
should be to continue per protocol with daily home dosing of the tolerated dose with the next 
escalation visit to the clinical research center  2 weeks later. If the participant  only experiences 
oral/pharyngeal pruritus during the administration of the daily dose, then the same dose can be 
repeated the next day at home and continued throughout the interval unless other symptoms begin to develop (see below).  
For mild symptoms , defined as  —  
• skin — limited or localized hives/swelling, skin flushing or pruritus  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] — rhinorrhea or sneezing, nasal congestion, occasional cough, throat discomfort 
• GI — mild abdominal discomfort or minor epi[INVESTIGATOR_80886] (day 2) at home or to have the participant  
return to the clinical r esearch center the next day (day 2) for a repeat of the previous d ay’s dose or the 
last tolerated dose (at the physician ’s discretion). If the dose is tolerated, then the  participant will

Peanut OIT in Children continue on that dose and return at the normal interval. If the dose causes mild symptoms again, then 
the participant may return to the clinical research center (day 3) and be given the last tolerated dose or 
a 1-2 step dose reduction. If tolerated, the participant  will continue on this dose for the normal time 
interval. If mild symptoms recur, a 1-2 step reduction would be administered the next day (day 4). If 
tolerated then that dose would be continued for 2 weeks. If not tolerated, consultation with the 
Protocol Chair would be indicated.  
For moderate symptoms , defined as— 
• skin — systemic hives or swelling 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] — throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing without dyspnea 
• GI — persistent moderate abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/nausea, increased vomiting 
 
The action should be to have the subject return to the clinical research center the next day (day 2) for 
dosing with the previous day’s dose or the last tolerated dose under observation. If the dose is 
tolerated, the participant  will continue on that daily home dose for the normal time interval  per 
protocol. If the subject does not tolerate this dose, the participant  should receive the last tolerated 
dose or a 1 -2 step dose reduction (day 3) in the clinical research center or at home if the  planned dose 
was previously tolerated. If this dose is tolerated, it will be continued as  the daily home dose for the 
normal time interval, then escalation attempted in the clinical research center  as noted below. If this 
dose is not tolerated, then the next dose will be a 1-2- step reduction in dosing, and the dose will be 
given at the clinical research center (day 4). If this next dose is not tolerated, then a discussion with 
the Protocol Chair or Co -Chair will ensue to make a decision about whether to continue the subject on 
active treatment in the study.  
For more severe symptoms,  defined as  — 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] — laryngeal edema, throat tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with  dyspnea 
• GI — significant severe abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/repetitive vomiting  
• neurological — change in mental status  
• circulatory — hypotension 
 
The action should be to treat the participant , and at the physician ’s discretion either: ( 1) have them 
return to the clinical research center the next day (day 2) for dosing with a two- step reduction in  dose 
under observation or (2) discontinue them from the active treatment. If the participant  tolerates the 
dose reduction, then they will remain on that dose for [ADDRESS_88234] 4 hours and up to 24 hours based on symptoms and treatment regimen needed to stabilize. 
If a participant  fails dose escalation aft er 3 consecutive ( with 2-4 weeks between) attempts, he or she 
will be considered a dose escalation failure, and the last tolerated dose  will be accepted as the 
maintenance dose. If the participant  has attained a dose of 500 mg peanut flour ( 250 mg peanut 
protein), this dose will become the maintenance daily home dose. If 500 mg peanut flour (250 mg 
peanut protein) has not been attained, the subject will be removed from the dosing arm and will be 
followed only as a longitudinal follow-up participant.  
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88235]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children If a child reaches the 2g dose prior to visit 15 (week 28) (either at visit 13 or v isit 14) per the schedule 
of events, there will be two scenarios.  
Scenario 1)   If the child reaches 2g at visit 13, the child will be dispensed 2 weeks of 2g home dosing  
and  return for their next visit in two weeks (v isit 14). If the child is tolerating 2g well, then the child 
will be dispensed [ADDRESS_88236] return 
to the clinic for visit 16 (week 30) within  the protocol -specified windows ( -2 to 7 days).  
Scenario 2) If the child reaches the 2g dose at visit 14, the child will be dispensed [ADDRESS_88237] receiving the daily dose of  4000 mg peanut flour ([ADDRESS_88238] tolerated dose) daily for at least 104 weeks  at home. The participants will continue 
to follow an otherwise peanut-restricted diet.  
Participants who did not reach the 4000 mg peanut flour (2000 mg  peanut protein) dose during the 
build-up phase will continue at their highest tolerated dose, which will be at least 500 mg peanut flour 
(250 mg peanut protein). 
A consistent time (within a 4 -hour time period) will be recommended for home dosing, and it will be 
stressed that it is critical to take the dose every day. Participants will be informed to separate the dose by [CONTACT_2669] 12 hours. Participants will continue to take all their regularly prescribed medications 
consistent with the  eligibility criteria for the protocol.  
For any noted symptoms during the maintenance phase, the same study dosing rules for the build -up 
phase will be followed. 
The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits every 13 weeks.  
6.7.5 Avoidance  
After completion of 104 weeks  of maintenance dosing and a 10 g blinded OFC to peanut flour (5 g 
peanut protein), participants will stop daily dosing. Participants will avoid consumption of peanut, 
either as a daily dose or as part of their regular diet for 26 weeks.  
After 26 weeks of avoidance, participants will undergo a final 10 g blinded OFC to peanut flour (5 g 
peanut protein). Participants who do not have a clinical reaction to the challenge will receive an Open Food Challenge (OpFC) (See Section 6.4.3
). 
6.7.[ADDRESS_88239]-challenge will comprise 2 weeks.  
6.8 MISSED DOSES AND DOSING D URING CONCURRENT ILLNESS  
6.8.1 Missed Doses for Non -Compliance  
Missed doses at any phase of the study can pose a significant risk to the enrolled subjects.  
The algorithm for missed consecutive doses is as follows:  
• 1 dose — the next dose would be the current dose and could be given at home 
• 2 doses in a row — the next dose would be the current dose and could be given at home 
• 3 or 4 doses in a row — the next dose would be the current dose and would be given under 
observation in the clinical research unit  
• 5 to 7 doses in a row-— the next dose would be 75 % of the current dose and would be given 
under observation in the clinical research unit 
• 8 to 14 doses in a row — in itiate the next dose as approximately 50% of the last tolerated dose. 
This would be done under observation in the clinical research unit.  
After any dose reduction, dose escalation would occur in the clinical research unit with an escalation no sooner 
than weekly and no longer than every [ADDRESS_88240] the investigator for all missed doses of 3 or more.  
6.8.2 Management of Dosing During Concurrent Illness 
If a participant has gastroenteritis, nausea and vomiting, upper- respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], active wheezing, 
fever greater than 100.5°  C, or other similar illness , the parent sh ould hold the dose and call the s tudy 
center for instructions regarding  dosing. Depending on the severity of the illness, the study center 
may instruct the parent to hold dosing for one or mor e days. Reinitiating  dosing will be according to 
the algorithm described in Section 6.8.1 .  
6.9 ASSESSMENT OF GA STROINTESTINAL SYMPTO MS

A total score of 5 or more will be reported to the site  investigator . The investigator will follow -up 
with a discussion with the participant’s family to collect additional history . Depending on the severity 
of the symptoms, the investigator may instruct the participant’s family to consult with the participant’s primary provider about further workup and treatment, review dosing instructions, or 
hold and/or adjust dosing for one or more days. In addition, the investigator will consider whether to refer the participant to a gastroenterologist . The DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor, the Protocol Chair or 
co-Chair, and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician will be notified based on the principal investigator’s 
judgment.  
7. TOLERANCE ASSAYS 
7.1 MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESES  
Peanut allergy is characterized by [CONTACT_78443]2 -skewing and production of IgE to peanut proteins. A recent 
study by [CONTACT_80952].15 demonstrated several im munological changes induced by [CONTACT_80953]: (1) decreased peanut specific IgE after 24 months of OIT; ( 2) increased peanut -specific 
IgG and IgG4 following 12 months of OIT; (3) decreased basophil reactivity following 12 months of OIT; (4) increase d number of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ T regulatory cell s (Tregs); and (5) decreased Th2 
cytokine secretion (IL -5, IL-4, and IL-13) after [ADDRESS_88244] that immunotherapy-induced tolerance (vs. a non- tolerant state) is 
associated with increased levels of egg -specific IgG4 antibody and reduced size of skin prick test to 
egg. 
Peanut-specific CD4+ T cells are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of peanut allergy. 
34,[ADDRESS_88245], characterize and sort 
allergen-specific CD4+ T cells. Transcriptome and surface marker immuno -phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_80888]-specific CD4+ T cells from allergic and non -allergic subjects revealed a “pathogenic 
footprint” that could be analyzed by f low cytometry. These T cell biomarkers were then assessed in 
allergic individuals and non- allergic individuals to test for their ability to discriminate allergen -
specific T cells from the rest of the T cell repertoire. This analysis identified a distinct Th2 subset 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88246] majority 
of allergen -specific CD4+ T cells as determined  by [CONTACT_80954]. We intend to monitor the 
frequency of these cells, denoted Th2A, to determine if modification of this cell subset could serve as 
a surrogate end -point for clinical outcome s in patients undertaking immunotherapy.  
Based on these findings the following mechanistic hypotheses are proposed: 
1. Subjects who become desensitized to peanut after [ADDRESS_88247] decreased peanut- IgE, increased peanut -IgG4, basophil hyporesponsiveness 
to peanut allergens, increased Treg functional cytokines, fewer peanut- specific CD4+ T cells, a 
reduction  over time in the Th2A cell sub -set and decreased Th2 cytokine resp onses relative to 
baseline that will remain unaltered  after OIT is discontinued. 
2. Subjects who become desensitized to peanut after [ADDRESS_88248] increased peanut -induced basophil reactivity from week 134 ( while still on 
OIT) to week 160 (off OIT  for 26 weeks ). This will be driven by [CONTACT_80955]2 
cytokines and peanut -specific IgE during the [ADDRESS_88249] that we would also see a reduction in the Th2A cell sub- set but we may not see a 
significant change in the numbers of peanut- specific CD4 + T cells. 
3. Subjects who become desensitized to peanut after [ADDRESS_88250] decreased IgE binding to epi[INVESTIGATOR_80889] h 1, 2, and 3 (fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_80890]) with a parallel increase, or spreading, of 
IgG4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_80889] h 1, 2, and 3. 
4. Subjects on placebo that develop natural tolerance to peanut will have decreased peanut- IgE, 
decreased basophil reactivity to peanut allergens, and an increase in peripheral Tregs that precede the development of tolerance. We also predict that over time these patients would also show a 
reduction in peanut- specific CD4 + T cells, and the T h2A cell sub -set. 
7.2 PROPOSED MECHANISTIC ASSAYS  
7.2.1 Comparisons and Sample Flow  
Comparisons for each of the parameters discussed below could occur between:  
• treatment and placebo group s, 
• on-treatment and baseline time points for each subject, and  
• subjects with tolerant versus desensitized versus allergic clinical outcomes.  
7.2.2 Serum and Mucosal Assays in Order of Priority 
Serum and mucosal assays 
Assay l Volume needed for each sample collection  
Specific IgE, IgG4, IgA anti -
peanut and component -resolved 
diagnostics ( most likely  IgE and 
IgG4 anti -Ara h 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8) [ADDRESS_88251]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children Salivary IgA and stool samples  ~ 0.5 mL saliva collected by [CONTACT_80956] < 5g of stool  
 Explanation of Serum and Mucosal Assays:  
Plasma immunoglobulin assays: IgE, IgG, IgA, and IgG4 anti- peanut will be measured at baseline 
and longitudinally on an ImmunoCAP™ instrument (Phadia) or equivalent .  
Component -resolved assays: Phadia’s ImmunoCAP™ peanut component tests for quantification of  
serum IgE and IgG4 against specific peanut allergens, such as Ara h 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 and may be used 
to evaluate changes in specific reactivity over time and between groups.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80891]: Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]-specific IgE and IgG4 in the plasma may be measured for Ara h 1, 2, and 3, 
as previously described.27,38  The arrays include 20 -mer peptides offset by 3 amino acids, and cover 
the entire sequence of these 3 major peanut allergens. Note that this approach does not measure 
conformational epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. 
Facilitated antigen binding (FAB) assay:  The FAB assay uses FACS to measure serum inhibitory 
activity for IgE -facilitated CD23 -dependent allergen binding to B cells. Increases in allergen- specific 
IgG are accompanied by [CONTACT_80957]- associated serum inhibitory activity for IgE -facilitated 
binding of allergen- IgE complexes to B  cells (IgE -FAB). We hypothesize that persistent increases in 
serum inhibitory activity for IgE -FAB correlate with desensitizati on and tolerance. Longitudinal 
serum samples from the current trial  will be assessed for inhibitory activity as a functional measure of 
blocking antibodies in plasma potentially in duced by [CONTACT_80958]. 
Serum, stools, and saliva assays : Saliva and stool samp les will be collected at baseline  and then, as 
specified in the SOE, stored at -80ºC. Peanut-specific secretory IgA (s -IgA) could be measured in 
saliva samples via ELISA assays. DNA may be extracted from stool samples for microbiome 
analysis.

Peanut OIT in Children make these assays technically feasible. Blood will also be shipped fresh fo r the basophil activation 
assays. 
DNA-HLA Genotypes : MHC tetramers bind to the T -cell receptor in an HLA -specific context. 
Therefore, DNA will be isolated from participants’ buccal mucosa to perform sequence- based HLA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], so  that appropriate candidates  can be identified for tetramer analysis as described below. 
Tetramer reagents for peanut have been focused on the HLA class II molecules DRB1 and DRB3. 
However, we will type DQ and DP as well as DR alleles in the event that new data suggests that those 
alleles are also important.  
Tetramer Assays:  We anticipate  that tetramer assays will be done in collaboration with Dr. W. 
Kwok at the Benaroya Inst itute in Seattle. [CONTACT_80974] has generated tetramer reagents for Ara h 1 
restricted by 8 HLA class II alleles and successfully used these reagents to examine the frequency and 
phenotype of peanut-specific CD4+ T cells in individuals with and without peanut allergy36. These 
reagents have been successfully used to stain previously frozen PBMCs. The ability to use these 
reagents will depend on the overlap between HLA alleles among study participants and available reagents. These and similar reagents can be used to  track changes in frequency of CD4
+ T cells in 
response to therapy. For optimum use, t hese assays require [ADDRESS_88253] majority of allergen -specific CD4+ T cells as 
determined by [CONTACT_80954].  
Basophil Activation Assays:  Ocmant et al.[ADDRESS_88254] (BAT) works well on 
blood up to [ADDRESS_88255]-collection. Approximately 200 µL of blood (from finger prick or blood 
draw) in potassium /EDTA will be collected. To minimize variation all BAT assays will be performed 
by [CONTACT_80959]. Kari Nadeau . The [ADDRESS_88256] (containing all major allergens) as well as glycerin and

Peanut OIT in Children Additional Flow Cytometry Assays may be done using banked PBMC samples. For example:  
Treg quantification and functional cytokine intracellular measurements: W e have shown an 
increase in CD4+ CD25hi FoxP3+ Tregs after [ADDRESS_88258] for those who exhibi t tolerance. 
T cell immunoprofiling : Teff cell immunoprofiling may be carried out to determine if parallel 
mechanisms of anergy, exhaustion or deletion are occurring in the peanut- specific T eff cell subset. 
Live/dead (for deletion evaluation) and apoptosis marker staining can occur in parallel with  
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_80894]-positive, CD45RO+, Ki67+, IL-2 dependency (for exhaustion vs.  anergy

transition to Th 1 subtypes during the course of successful oral immunotherapy. 
Other immune cells: Through high throughput multiplex immunoprofiling, we will be able to 
determine absolute counts of subsets of other immune cells such as  dendritic cells, natural killer T  
cells, and others.

8. ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.1 OVERVIEW  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE (adverse event) or SAE (serious adverse event) as described in Sections 8.2.1
 
and 8.2.2. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate 
electronic CRF(s) . All data will be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_4318], which may provide 
recommendations to DAIT/NIAID about withdrawing any participant and/or terminating the study 
because of safety concerns.  
Adverse events that are classified as serious according to the definition of FDA must be reported 
promptly and appropriately to the DAIT/ NIAID Medical Monitor, Proto col Chair or co-Chair, the 
ITN Clinical Trial Physician , IRBs, and FDA. This section defines the types of AEs and outlines the 
procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this 
section complies with 21CFR 312; ICH Guideline E2A : Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting ; and ICH Guideline E-6: Guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice ; and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 4.03 (June 14, 2010). This document is referred to herein as 
the “NCI - CTCAE Manual .” 
8.[ADDRESS_88264]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children will be reported as specified in Sections 8.3 and 8.5 whether they are or are not related to disease 
progression or study participation. 
8.2.2 Study Specific Adverse Events  
During the study it is anticipated that participants undergo ing study procedures involving 
administration of peanut flour (blinded OFC, IDE, home or clinic OIT/placebo dosing) will 
experience allergic symptoms related to peanut allergy. Events related to these study procedures will 
be captured on procedure -specific forms, and will NOT be recorded as adverse events, unless they 
meet certain criteria as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
8.2.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction and Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any ad verse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse 
reaction. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 
An adverse reaction (AR) means any adverse event caused by a study drug . Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reaction s for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. 
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
• Death:  A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator during the protocol-defined follow-up period must be reported whether it is considered treatment related or not. 
• A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or DAIT/NIAID, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurr ed in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
• An event that requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. An important 
medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based on appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
8.2.5 “Expected” versus Unexpected Suspected  Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “expected” when it is listed in the General 
Investigational Plan  of the IND or the protocol. A suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” when the specificity or severity is not consistent with the risk information described in 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88265]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children the safety section provided in the General Investigational Plan of the IND or the protocol (21 CFR 
312.32(a)). A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is referred to as a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
8.[ADDRESS_88266].  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an objective manner. 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant. 
An AE that is an asymptomatic abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation (e.g., a radiograph, an ultrasound, or an electrocardiogram) will be documented and maintained in the 
source records. Asymptomatic adverse events must be record ed on the AE CRF  when they meet the 
criteria for a Grade 3 or greater AE per CTCAE criteria. The evaluation that produced the value or 
result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or can be explained and the 
participant’s safety i s not at risk. 
8.3.2 Methods  of Recording  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
Throughout the study, the investigator will record all AEs , as defined by [CONTACT_760], on  the 
appropriate CRF regardless of their severity or relation to study participation. The investigator will 
treat participants experiencing AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable intervals until their 
symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring  During Peanut Flour / Placebo Administration  
Guidelines for recording events that occur duri ng investigational product or placebo administration, 
which include blinded OFC, IDE and daily home and clinic dosing: 
All symptoms or events that occur within two hours and that are expected according to the General 
Investigational Plan  and related to adm inistration  of investigational product or placebo will be 
recorded on the dosing-specific CRFs for blinded OFC, IDE, home or clinic dosing. They will be 
graded according to table 3 (Section 8.4 ).  
Any of the following symptoms or events that occur at any time related to dosing, should also be 
recorded as an adverse event:  
• hypotension  
• cyanosis 
• SpO2< 92% 
• confusion 
• collapse 
• loss of consciousness 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88267]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children • incontinence 
• required more than 2 injections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80896] 8.2.4  will also be reported as an 
SAE. 
Any symptom or event that occurs more than two hours after dosing will be recorded as an adverse 
event. 
Any symptom or event that is not expected according to the General Investigational Plan will be 
recorded as an adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events Related to Peanut Flour / Placebo  Administration  
If systemic allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and Eosinophilic Es ophagitis meet the criteria for Serious 
Adverse Event, as defined in Section 8.2.4 , they will be recorded on the SAE CRF within 24 hours 
and the FDA  will be notified as outlined in Section 8.5 .  
An SAE notification will be sent by [CONTACT_80960] 24 hours to the DAIT/NIAID Medical 
Monitor, the Protocol Chai r or co-Chair, and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician . Together the 
DAIT/NIAID Medica l Monitor, the Protocol Chair  or co-Chair, and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician  
will determine whether the SAE meets expedited reporting criteria and if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] ( Section 
3.4.1) have been met.  
8.4 GRADING AND ATTRIBUT ION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.4.1 Grading Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Related to Study Procedures 
Symptoms associated with systemic allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis that occur during 
administration of peanut flour or placebo will be graded according to Table 3 below.  
All AEs will be collected and recorded in the source documents from visit - 1 until the time the 
participant completes the study (visit 27), or premat urely withdraws from the study. Table 3 was 
adapted from the grading of allergic reactions in the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR3) 
protocol, entitled “Oral Desensitization to Egg with Subsequent Induction of Tolerance for Egg-
Allergic Children”. CoFAR3 protocol is conducted unde r the IND #[ZIP_CODE] sponsored by [CONTACT_80961]/NIAID . This completed study assessed the oral desensitization to egg and induction of 
tolerance in egg -allergic children between the ages of 5 and 18 years (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).

form. 
[IP_ADDRESS] All Other Adverse Events 
Adverse event s not associated with study procedures will be graded according to the criteria set forth 
in the NCI -CTCAE National Cancer Institute’ s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v 
4.03) manual which  provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and 
interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all AEs.  
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-
CTCAE manual:  
• Grade 1 = mild adverse event  
• Grade 2 = moderate adverse event  
• Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse eventgra  
• Grade 4 = life- threatening or disabling adverse event 
• Grade 5 = death

8.5 REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.5.1 Reporting SAEs to the IND Sponsor  
The following process for reporting an SAE ensures compliance with 21CFR 312 and ICH guidelines. After learning that a participant has experienced an  SAE, the investigator or designee will 
report the SAE to the DAIT/ NIAID, the IND sponsor for this protocol , via the electronic SAE report 
form (SAE CRF) within [ADDRESS_88270] include the following: 
• AE term 
• Study drug treatment 
• Relationship to study medications 
• Reason why the event is serious  
• Supplementary CRF pages that must be current at the time of SAE reporting: medical history, 
concomitant medications, demographics, study drug administration, death.  
As additional details become available, the SAE CRF should be updated and submitted. Every time 
the SAE CRF is submitted, it should be electronically signed by [CONTACT_80962].  Code Descriptor  Definition

8.5.2 Reporting SAEs to Health Authorities  
After the SAE has been reported by [CONTACT_80963] 
(DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor, and the DAIT/NIAID Office of Regulatory Affairs ), the IND 
sponsor, must report the  event to the FDA using one of these two options: 
• Standard reporting (report in the IND annual report). This option applies if the AE is 
classified as one o f the following:  
o Serious, expected, suspected adverse reactions described in Section s 8.2.1, 8.2.4, and 8.2.5. 
o Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction described in Sections 8.2.1, 8.2.4, and 8.2.5 . 
• Expedited reporting is required. This option applies if the AE is classified as one of the 
following: 
o Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions described in Section s 8.2.1, 8.2.[ADDRESS_88273] a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such 
as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure. (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon 
rupture); 
o An aggregate analysis of specific adverse events observed in a clinical trial (s uch as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug  treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control group. 
o Any findings from clinical or epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analysis of data pooled across multiple 
studies, published or unpublished scientific papers, or from animal or in vitro testing that 
would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, General 
Investigational Plan section of the IND  or other aspects of the overall conduct of the trial . 
Safety reports must be submitted by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID to the FDA within 15 calendar days; fatal or 
immediately life -threatening, serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_88274]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children 8.5.3 Reporting SAEs to the DSMB  
The DAIT/NIAID will provide  the DSMB with data of all SAEs on an ongoing basis as determined 
by [CONTACT_80964]/ NIAID Medical Monitor, including expedited reporting of SAEs that are also reported to 
the FDA (see Section 8.5.2 ), and annual safety review s of all SAEs and as indicated in Section 3.4.1 . 
8.5.4 Reporting SAEs to IRB/EC  
The DAIT/NIAID will notify all investigators of AE information. The investigator will ensure the 
timely dissemination of all AE information, includ ing expedited reports, to the IRB/EC in accordance 
with all applicable regulations. All site investigators must report SAEs to their respective IRBs as 
mandated by [CONTACT_9918]. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
9.1 ANALYSIS SAMPLES  
• Intent-to-treat (ITT) sample: All subjects who are randomly assigned  to treatment or placebo will 
comprise the ITT sample.  
• Per-protocol sample for the primary endpoint: All ITT subjects who are also  study-compliant 
through the maintenance phase and have an evaluable blinded OFC at the end of the m aintenance 
phase. Compliance is defined as completion of the maintenance phase as described in Section 
6.7.4; than 3 occasions on which more than 3 consecutive home doses of study medication were  
missed; and less than 3 non-protocol specified ingestions  of peanut -containing food within a year.  
• Per-protocol sample for the secondary endpoint: All participants incl uded in the per protocol 
sample for the primary endpoint who are compl iant with peanut avoidance during the a voidance 
phase and  have an evaluable blinded OFC at the end of the avoidance phase. Compliance is 
defined as completion of the avoidance phase as described in Section 6.7.5  and less than 3 non-
protocol specified ingestions of peanut-containing food within a year. 
•  As-treated sample: All evaluable subjects, analyzed according to the amount of peanut therapy 
received, regardless of their randomized assignment.  
• Safety sample: All enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of OIT or placebo. Participants 
in the safety sample will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received, regardless 
of their randomized assignment. 
9.[ADDRESS_88275] will be specified 
a priori and in detail within the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  All statistical tests will be two -sided at 
the alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_88276] will be 
investigated. If no interaction is present, only the main effects and adjusted proportions and 
confidence intervals will be reported. Unadjusted proportions and odds ratios will also be presented 
with confidence intervals. All statistical analyses will be performed on each study sample specified in  
Section 9.1.  
9.2.3 Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy 
1. Tolerance Endpoint 
 This is the proportion of participants who pass the blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour ( 5 g peanut 
protein) at week 160.  
 The comparison of tolerance between the two randomized groups will be performed using a 
multivariate logistic regression model. The statistical methods specified for the primary endpoint in Section 9.2.1 and 9.2.2
 will also be used for this endpoint.  
2. Transient Desensitization Endpoint 
 This is the change in proportion of participants who pass the blinded OFC to 10 g peanut flour (5 
gram peanut protein) at week 134 and 160. This matched, pre/ post peanut avoidance comparison 
allows for the exploration of mechanistic and immunologic differences between children who 
appear to be transiently desensitized compared to those who appear to be tolerant after 26 weeks 
of avoidance. If there is a statistically significant increase in the rate of peanut allergy from weeks 134 and 160, this will be interpreted as evidence of transient desensitization . This within -group, 
paired comparison of proportions will be performed using a McNemar’s test at a 0.[ADDRESS_88277] tolerate d dose of peanut protein during each blinded OFC will be analyzed within 
and between both placebo and peanut OIT groups. This will allow the investigation of 
desensitization at 134 weeks, tolerance at 160 weeks, and possible changes between week 134 
and week 160. Each of these analyses will be performed in a similar manner as all other endpoint 
analyses. However, instead of a binary (pass or fail) blinded OFC outcome, the highest dose of 
peanut protein tolerated for each subject will be analyzed as a contin uous outcome . Depending on 
the distribution of the data, parametric or non -parametric statistical methods may be performed . 
For example, a multivariate linear model could be used to test for desensitization at [ADDRESS_88278] transient desensitization between 
134 weeks and 160 weeks within the peanut OIT or placebo groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 
Safety will be analyzed through the reporting of AEs. All AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_80965] . The severity of AEs will be classified using the 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88279]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children specific grading scale for allergic reactions associated with study procedures related to administration 
of peanut flour or placebo which was adapted from the CoFAR3 protocol (DAIT /NIAID IND # 
[ZIP_CODE]). The NCI-CTCAE toxicity scale  will be used for all other AE s. The total number of events 
and the number of participants experiencing AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_80966]. Separate summaries will be provided for serious AEs, 
treatment -related AEs, and AEs leading to study discontinuation. Abnormal vital signs, physical 
examination results, and laboratory values that the investigator deems clinically significant will be 
graded accord ing to the NCI- CTCAE toxicity scale and reported as AEs. Rates of withdrawal from 
therapy will be compared in the ITT, per protocol and safety samples.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanistic 
The mechanistic analyses of endpoints described in Section 7 will be performed using a wide range of 
statistical methodologies. Generally, all statistical tests will be two -sided at the alpha = 0.05 level of 
significance. Normality can be assessed by a combination of methods including graphical analysis (e.g. normal probability plots, histograms, and quantile-quantile plots) and formal hypothesis tests 
(e.g. Kolmogorov- Simirnov test and Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test). Depending on the distributions of the data, 
parametric or non -parametric statistical methods may be performed. Transformation methods may 
also be used prior to fitting models where the normality assumption is required. 
T-tests (both paired and two-sample tests), ANOVA, and ANCOVA models can be used to compare 
mean values among groups of interest and across multiple time points. Pearson correlations 
coefficients can be used to compare continuous measurements when data are considered to be 
normally distributed. Analogous non- parametric methods such as the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, 
Mann-Whitney U Test, the Kru skal-Wallis Test, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient can be 
used if the data are considered non -normal.  
9.2.4 Missing Data  
Dropout in this study is anticipated to be ≤15% and equally distributed between the randomized 
groups. The main  ITT analysis requires that missing data be imputed. As noted in Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_88280] without an evaluable blinded OFC will be considered a treatment failure. Thus, up to about 15% of subjects could have results imputed and therefore be designated as not 
desensitized and not tolerant.  
If missing data are not equally distributed between groups, bias es can be created. For example, if a 
significantly greater proportion of dropout occurs in the treatment a rm, this arm will have a larger 
proportion of imputed treatment failur es than the placebo arm . This imbalance could tend to 
underestimate a treatment effect.  Conversely, if a significantly greater proportion of dropout occurs in 
the placebo arm, this could tend to overestimate a treatment effect.  
These opposing hypothetical biases will be investigated by [CONTACT_80967]. 
Optimistic and pessimistic imputation methods and sensitivity analyses data will  be used to  provide 
upper and lower bound s for potential bias. These will provide a measure of robustness of the 
treatment as it relates to the causes and consequences of missing data. More specific deta ils of the 
imputation methods and sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP. Generally, a combination of Multiple Imputation methods for missing data will be used including for example: regression, 
propensity scoring, and/or Markov chain M onte Carlo methods.

9.2.6  Use of Medications  
All medications taken by [CONTACT_80968] 30 days before enrollment 
and continuing throughout the study will be collected. All medications used will be coded according 
to the WHO drug dictionary. The number and percentage of participants receiving prior and concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80902].

25%.
15 Adverse reactions in this trial were seen mainly during the dose escalation phase. Since then, 
the peanut escalation regimen has been completed over a longer duration. We therefore estimate that 
the overall drop-out rate in the current trial will be 15%. 
Sample size requirements were determined by [CONTACT_80969], allocating subjects to treatment and placebo arms in a ratio 
of 2:1. The power calculations were performed using a two -sample Pearson Chi- squared test of 
proportions at a two- sided 0.05 level of significance.  
Assumptions: 
• For subjects completing study therapy, the proportions in treatment and placebo arms achieving 
desensitization are estimated to be 0.90 and 0.15 respective ly. 
• For subjects completing study therapy, the proportions in treatment and placebo arms achieving 
tolerance are estimated to be 0.40 and 0.15 respectively. 
• Overall dropout proportion, which is the total loss to follow -up, at any time from randomization 
to the 160-week blinded OFC, will be 0.15. 
• Under the intent -to-treat principle, subjects who discontinue study participation, but return to 
perform the 134-week or 160- week blinded OFC, will be evaluated as belonging to the arm to 
which they were randomly assigned. 
• Subjects who lack evaluable endpoint data will be considered treatment failures; that is, not 
desensitized and not tolerant.  
Combining these assumptions, we compute an as- analyzed expected rate of tolerance in the treatment 
arm of 0.40*(1-0.15) = 0.34, and in the placebo arm of 0.15*(1-0.15) = 0.1275. 
Immune Tolerance Network  CONFIDENTIAL   Page [ADDRESS_88283]  Version 5.0 March 28, 2017 
Peanut OIT in Children We similarly compute an as -analyzed expected rate of desensitization in the treatment arm of 
0.90*(1-0.15) = 0.765, and in the placebo arm of 0.15*(1-0.15) = 0.1275. 
To provide 80% power for the tolerance endpoint with these assumptions and calculations requires a 
sample size of 144, which is [ADDRESS_88284] size, is that the power for the primar y endpoint is 
greater than 99%.  
9.[ADDRESS_88285] ATISTICAL PLAN  
The principal features of both the study design and the plan for statistical data analysis are outlined in this protocol and in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Any change in these features requires either a protocol or an SAP amendment, which is subje ct to review by [CONTACT_9533], DSMB, the study 
sponsor(s), and the FDA. These changes will be described in the final study report as appropriate.  
10. ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The investigational sites participating in this study will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality 
permitted for the clinical and research information obtained from participants in this clinical trial. 
Medical and research records should be maintained at each site in the strictest confidence. However, 
as a part of the q uality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, the investigational sites 
must permit authorized representatives of the ITN, IND Sponsor, and FDA to examine (and to copy 
when required by [CONTACT_1289]) clinical records for the purposes of  quality assurance reviews, 
audits, and evaluation of the study safety and progress . Unless required by [CONTACT_80970], only the coded identity associated with documents or other participant data may 
be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (and any personally identifying information must be obscured). Authorized representatives 
as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals . The investigational sites will normally be notified in 
advance of auditing visits.  
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. The investigator is required to ensure that all CRFs are completed for every participant 
entered in the trial.  
The sponsor is responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data. 
The CRFs will be completed online via a web -based electronic data capture (EDC) system that has 
been validated and is compliant with Part 11 Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Study staff 
at the site will enter information into the electronic CRF s, and the data will be stored remotely at a 
central database. Data quality will be ensured through the EDC system’s continuous monitoring of data and real -time detection and correction of errors. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, 
verbatim text , and the name [CONTACT_8066]) will be recorded in an electronic 
audit trail to allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations.

Peanut OIT in Children 12. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
12.1  STATEMENT OF COMPLIA NCE 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
guidelines — adopting the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki — and all applicable regulatory 
requirement s. 
Prior to study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_80971] (IRB) . Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must also be approved by [CONTACT_429], the IRB and submitted to FDA before they are implemented.  
12.2  INFORMED CONSENT  
The informed consent form is a means of providing information about the trial to a prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study. All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) must read, sign, and date a consent form before participating 
in the study, taking the study drug, and/or undergoing any study- specific procedures. If a par ticipant 
does not speak and read English, the consent materials must be translated into the appropriate language.  
The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety information is available, whenever the protocol is amended,  and/or whenever any n ew information becomes 
available that may affect participation in the trial.  
A copy of the informed consent form will be given to a prospective participant for review . The 
attending physician, or his/her designated study staff member, will review the consent and answer questions. The participant  will be informed that participation is voluntary and that he/she may 
withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. 
12.3 PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality  will be respected throughout the study. Each participant 
will be assigned a sequential identification number. This number, rather than the participant’s name, will be used to collect, store, and report participant information.  
13. PUBLICATION POLICY 
The ITN p olicy on publication of study results will apply to this study. Authorized participants may 
find details regarding the policy statement on the ITN internet website at http://www.immunetolerance.org .

Peanut OIT in Children Appendix 3: Anaphylaxis Staging System  
Anaphylaxis is a generalized allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may progress to 
death.40  
Criteria for Diagnosis  
Anaphylaxis is likely when any one of the three following sets of criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of: 
• Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch or flush, swollen  lips/tongue/uvula) 
AND 
• Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced PEF) AND /OR 
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80909] (minutes to 
hours): 
• Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., g eneralized hives, itch/flush, swollen  lips/tongue/uvula)** 
• Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) 
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
• Persistent GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours): 
• Infants and Children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP*  
• Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline 
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than (70 
mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1-10 years; and < 90 mmHg from age 11- 17 years. 
** Isolated skin or mucosal lesions following the ingestion of a food constitute a “f ood-
induced allergic reaction.” 
Staging System of Severity of Anaphylaxis  
Stage Defined By  
1. Mild (skin & subcutaneous tissues,  GI, &/or mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_696])  
Flushing, urticaria, periorbital or facial angioedema; mild dyspnea, wheeze or upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908]; mild  abdominal pain and/or emesis  
 2. Moderate (mild symptoms + features suggesting moderate respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  cardiovascular or GI 
symptoms) 
Marked dysphag ia, hoarseness, and/or stridor; shortness of breath,  wheezing and 
retractions;  crampy abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting and/or diarrhea; and/or mild 
dizziness 
 
3. Severe (hypoxia, hypotension, or  neurological compromise) 
Cyanosis or SpO2 < 92% at any stage, hypotension, confusion, collapse, loss of consciousness; or incontinence.

Background :    
Up to 80% of women experience menopausal vasomotor symptoms during the  perimenopause  
transition  period , such as hot flashes, night sweats, and flushes , although they can vary between 
individuals .  These often last for more than 7 years for over half of women.  These symptoms  are related 
to negative outcomes  including depressed mood, reduced social quality of life , and decreased  
quantity/quality of  sleep.  A common therapy used to address these symptoms is hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT), although there is concern with long term use and safety is unknown.  Noninvasive, n on-
drug alternative interventions are needed.   
High- resolution, relational, resonance -based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®) is a closed -loop, 
allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology that uses software -guided algorithmic analysis to 
identify and translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones to support real -time self-
optimization of brain activity.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117642], and improved autonomic cardiovascular regulation across 
heterogeneous cohorts, as well as reduced blood pressure in a small series with comorbid hypertension.  
This study will evaluate the use of HIRREM for those with hot flashes  in a randomized clinical trial.   
Objective :  The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_117643] ( HIRREM ), to continued current care , will reduce the frequency  and 
severity of vasomotor symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_117661].  
Methods : This will be a randomized, single site,  p ilot clinical trial, enrolling u p to [ADDRESS_131273] 5 hot flashes per day  (with at least  one being categorized as moderate to severe), and who are not 
taking medications or supplements for management of hot flashes .  Participants will be randomly 
assigned to receive 8-16 sessions over a maximum of 4 weeks of acoustic stimulation linked to brain 
activity (HIRREM  and continued current care , HCC) or will be assigned to a waitlist group  (continued 
current care, CCC) .  Both groups will continue their other current care throughout.  There will be pre - 
and post -intervention data collection to include physiological outcomes (BP, HR, and measures of 
autonomic cardiovascular regulation), as well as daily hot flash diaries, Hot Flash Related Daily 
Interference Scale (HF RDIS), the M enopause Rating Scale (MRS), symptom inventories for insomnia 
(Insomnia Severity Index , ISI; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272], PSQI; and the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284], 
ESS) , depression ( Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] - Depression Scale , CES -D), anxiety ( Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder -7, GAD -7), stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), and a quality of life measure ( Quality of 
Life Scale, QOLS) , as well as drop stick reaction testing, and dynamometry for grip strength.  Measures 
will be collected at an enrollment visit (V1) .  Both groups will then maintain a hot flash diary for [ADDRESS_131274] -intervention data collections will 
be obtained at 4-6 weeks  (V2, primary outcome ) and 12 -14 weeks (V3 ) following completion of the 
intervention.  Follow up data collection for the CCC group will occur at 10-12 weeks (V2), and 1 8-20 
weeks (V3) after the V1 visit.  Both groups will maintain a hot flash diary for 1 -2 weeks prior to the V2 
and V3 visits.  The p rimary outcome will be differential change  in hot flash frequency and severity from 
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/2018  
 V1 to V2  between HCC and CCC, based on data from the hot flash daily diary .  Following V 3, those in the  
CCC group will be offered the opportunity to cross over to receive a  course of HCC within 3 months , and 
will continue to be followed for data collections at 4 -6 weeks (V 4), and 12 -14 weeks (V 5) after 
completing their crossover HIRREM sessions.   Additional mean contrasts will be constructed to evaluate 
the consistency of an y benefit of HIRREM through subsequent visits beyond V3.  Comparisons of 
changes in all secondary outcomes will be assessed in a similar fashion.  
Importance :  This study will explore the use of HIRREM  for vasomotor symptoms  associated with 
menopause in a randomized, clinical trial.  The study will confirm feasibility using a closed -loop, acoustic 
stimulation intervention for a randomized clinical trial in this population, and will also provide estimates 
of effect size, which might justify larger controlled  trials .  A positive result would suggest that HIRREM 
might have benefit as a noninvasive, non- drug alternative for management of vasomotor symptoms .  
This, over and above the potential benefit from participating in a clinical trial, and  interacting with t he 
study personnel and the study environment.  The study will also help to identify the characteristics of 
subgroups that might experience differential effects/benefits from HIRREM.

 Background:  
An estimated [ADDRESS_131275] begun the perimenopause transition.  Of these women, approximately 75% of them 
will experience vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes)  due to the menopause transition, and 25% will seek 
medical treatment.  A round $4 billion is spent annually in the [LOCATION_002] on medications to treat 
women going through menopause.  
As individuals go through the menopausal transition, their body begins to reduce the production of estrogen and progesterone.  Progesterone is a  sleep -promoting hormone, so this can also lead to 
troubles sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_117644].  
There is evidence that patients are at an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) when given 
standard oral doses of hormone therapy treatments, which are often use d to manage symptoms 
associated with perimenopause (Huang , Sawaya, Vittinghoff, Lin, & Grady, 2009).  The risk increases for 
older postmenopausal individuals when compared to those who more recently went through the menopause transition.  Due to safety concerns surroundin g the use of hormone therapy, there remains 
a need for safe, effective, relatively brief, non -pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117645].   
Autonomic hyperarousal appears to play an etiological role related to vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.  Use of non -pharmacological strategies such as biofeedback and slow abdominal 
breathing, EMG -biofeedback, and HRV -biofeedback, targeting downstream autonomic function are 
reportedly associated with improved autonomic function and reduced blood pressure in those with 
prehypertension  (Chen, Sun, Wang, Lin, & Wang, 2016; Innes, Selfe, & Vishnu, 2010; Lin et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2010 ; Xu, Gao, Ling, & Wang, 2007) .  Trials of mind- body, relaxation, behavioral, and 
complementary interventions have shown promise, possibly related to im pact on autonomic 
hyperarousal (Avis, Legault, Russell, Weaver, & Danhauer, 2014; Befus et al., 2018; Guthrie et al., 2018; 
Innes et al., 2010; Stefanopoulou & Grunfe ld, 2017) . 
High- resolution, relational, resonance -based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM®) was developed by 
[CONTACT_117662], Scottsdale, AZ.  It is a commercially available, noninvasive, electroencephalic -
based method to facilitate client -unique relaxation and auto -calibration of cortical neural oscillations by 
[CONTACT_117663]  (Gerdes, Gerdes, Lee, & Tegeler, 2013).  HIRREM  uses scalp 
sensors to observe brain  frequencies and amplitudes in real time, and software -guided algorithmic 
analysis to identify and translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones to support real- time self -
optimization of brain activity.   The audible tones are reflected back to th e recipi[INVESTIGATOR_117646], 
simultaneously, in [ADDRESS_131276], “relax,” and reset/get unstuck from what has been stuck 
stress/trauma response patterns.  The brain electrical patterns are typi[INVESTIGATOR_117647], with no conscious, cognitive activity required, no operant co nditioning, and no learner in 
the loop, towards improved balance and reduced hyperarousal.   
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/[ADDRESS_131277] remains to be fully understood, but may involve resonance between 
reflected tones and oscillating brain networks, much like a musical instrument tuning itself.  
Functionally, it may be that this acoustic stimulation facilitates kindling of sleep in neuronal units, which 
had previously been stuck in the “on” position due to stress responses (Krueger, Huang, Rector, & Buysse, 2013) .  Better sleep is foundational for all health and healing.  A key aspect of observed 
beneficial effects may also be related to the observed improvement in downstream autonomic function, as evidenced by [CONTACT_117664], apparently associated with increased dynamic range and flexibility of autonomic responses managed by [CONTACT_117665].  
Since 2011, the HIRREM Research Program at WFSM has enrolled over [ADDRESS_131278] shown reduction in 
symptoms of insomnia, depression, stress/anxiety, military -related traumatic stress,  hot flashes, and 
persisting symptoms after athletic concussion, associated with the use of HIRREM  (C. L. Tegeler et al., 
2017) .  Improved autonomic cardiovascular regulation has also been observed in those receiving 
HIRREM, including a cohort of adolescents with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (J. E. 
Fortunato et al., 2016; J.E. Fortunato et al., 2013; C. Tegeler et al., 2014) .  In addition, correlation has 
been reported between high frequency electrical brain pattern asymmetry scores at baseline, and 
measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation (C.H. Tegeler, Shaltout, Tegeler, Gerdes, & Lee, 2015) . 
Specific Relevant Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]:  
12 women (median age 56 y; range, 46 -69 y) were enrolled in an  ongoing IRB approved study exploring a 
variety of neurological, cardiovascular, and psychological conditions, and were identified as also 
reporting co -morbid perimenopausal symptoms  (C. H. Tegeler, Tegeler, Cook, Lee, & Pajews ki, 2015) .  
After an initial HIRREM assessment of brain frequencies and amplitudes, baseline data collection included symptom inventories for insomnia (ISI), depression (CES -D), and anxiety (GAD -7), along with 
physiological and functional measures.  Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded while 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with spontaneous breathing. Participants completed a hot flash diary for a median of 3.5 days 
(range, 1 -11 d) before beginning their HIRREM sessions, and maintained through follow up data 
collection visits.  Subjects then received a median of 13 (range, 8 -23) HIRREM sessions approximately 90 
minutes each (range, 54 -102 min).  Sessions consisted of 4 -9 protocols, from 6- 30 minutes each, with up 
to two sessions per day, and were received over  a median of 9.5 days (range, 4 -32 d).  All measurements 
were repeated at the follow-up data collection visit at a median of 10 days (range, 0 -20 d) after 
completing their final HIRREM session.   
Primary outcomes included hot flash frequency and severity, sleep and depressive symptoms.  High frequency (23 -36 Hertz) amplitudes from bilateral temporal scalp recordings were measured at baseline 
and during serial sessions.  Median changes (range, p value) for hot flash frequency and severity were -2.32 ( -14 to 3, 0.050) and -1 (-3 to 0.8, 0.004), respectively.  Sleep and depression scores decreased by -
8.5 ( -20 to - 1, p = 0.022), and - 5.5 ( -32 to 8, p = 0.015) points, respectively.  Median amplitude in 
temporal high frequency brain electrical activity was 8.44 m icrovolts (µv, 6.27 -16.66) at baseline and 
decreased a median of -2.96 µv ( -11.05 to - 0.65, p = 0.0005) by [CONTACT_117666].

 Hypothesis:  
The addition of acoustic stimulation linked to brain activity (H IRREM plus continued current care, HCC ) 
will be associated with greater reduction in the frequency  and severity of hot flashes experienced  than  
that seen with continued current clinical care alone (CCC), among patient s with perimenopaus al and 
postmenopausal  vasomotor symptoms.    
Research Design and Method:   
Objectives:   
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_117648] ( HIRREM, HCC ) to continued  current clinical care , will reduce the frequency  and 
severity of vasomotor symptoms , as compared with continued current clinical care (CCC) alone in 
patients with documented perimenopaus al and postmenopausal  vasomotor symptoms .  
Secondary Objectives:   
Evaluate whether the addition of HCC  to continued current clinical care  will result in greater differential 
changes in a variety of physiological, behavioral, and function outcome  measures  outlined below , as 
compared to CCC .    
1. Auton omic nervous system functions, as manifested by [CONTACT_4701], HRV , and BRS .  We expect to 
see greater changes in autonomic activity and an improvement of sympatho -vagal balance  in 
the H CC group.  This would be reflected as changes in heart rate, and an incre ase of HRV  and 
BRS parameters such as the standard deviation of the R -R interval (SDRR) , rMSSD, HF alpha, and 
Sequence Up, Down, or All.  
2. Reduction in menopause -related scales : Menopause Rating Scale ( MRS) and Hot Flash Related 
Daily Interference Scale (HFR DIS).  We  anticipate to see greater improvement in these 
symptoms in the HCC group.  
3. Behavioral outcomes such as insomnia (assessed by [CONTACT_117669], ISI ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22336], PSQI; and the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284], ESS ), depression  (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_80827][INVESTIGATOR_2557] -Depression Scale , CES-D), anxiety (as evaluated by [CONTACT_117670] -7), and stress (as assessed by [CONTACT_117671], PSS).  We expect to see greater 
improvement in these symptom inventory scores  in the HC C group . 
4. Overall quality of life as evaluated using the QOLS .  We hope to see greater improve ment in  
overall quality of life  scores  in the HCC group.  
5. Functional performance evaluated using d rop stick reaction testing .  We expect to see more 
improve ment in the HC C group . 
6. Functional performance evaluated by [CONTACT_40297], using a hand dynamometer.  We expect to 
see greater improvement of grip strength in the HCC group.  
Overview:  
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/2018  
 This will be a randomized, single site , pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833].  Assuming a  potentia l drop -out rate of 20%, up 
to [ADDRESS_131279] 40  subjects ( 20 per group) complete 
the study , per protocol .  Patients who have at least 5 hot flashes per day ( with at least  one being 
categorized as moderate to severe) will be eligible to participate.     
Those who have no other exclusions, are interested to participate, and provide informed consent will be 
randomly assigned to receive [ADDRESS_131280] activity 
(HCC), over a maximum of 4 weeks, while continuing their other current clinical care, or to continue 
their current clinical care alone (C CC).  There will be pre - and post -intervention data collection to include 
a daily hot flash diary (to be completed for 7 -14 days  by [CONTACT_117672] ) and many secondary outcome 
measures including completion of the MRS , HFRDIS, measures of autonomic cardiovascular regulation 
(continuous recording of BP and HR for calculation of measure of HRV  and BRS), behavioral symptom 
outcomes (ISI, PSQI, ESS, CES -D, GAD -7, PSS), quality of life measure (QOLS), and function performance 
measures (drop stick reaction testing, and grip strength).  All measures will be collected at an enrollment 
visit (V1) .  Both groups will then maintain a hot flash diary for [ADDRESS_131281] -
intervention visit (V2 , primary outcome, 4 -6 weeks after interven tion completion for HCC, and 10 -12 
weeks  after V1 for CCC), and a final follow up  visit (V3, 12-14 weeks following completion of the 
intervention for HCC, and 18 -20 weeks after V1 for CCC).  Both groups will maintain a hot flash diary for 
1-2 weeks prior t o the V2 and V3 visits.  The primary outcome will be reduction in frequency and 
severity of hot flashes score from V1 to V 2.  Following V3 , those in the CCC group will be offered the 
opportunity to receive a course of HCC  within 3 months (will have another  brainwave assessment 0-14 
days before beginning sessions) , and will continue to be followed for data collections at 4 -6 weeks (V 4), 
and 12 -14 weeks (V 5) after completing their HIRREM sessions.

 Participants/Subjects:  
Women  ages [ADDRESS_131285] five hot 
flashes per day (with at least one being categorized as moderate to severe) .  
Interested subjects will be informed with a more detailed description of the study, and the extent of 
their commitment, through phone calls or email communications.  If no exclusions are apparent from 
initial phone or email communications, potential participants will complete an online eligibility screening 
form, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3476].  If potential participants express continued interest in 
the project and have no major exclusions, they will be scheduled for an enrollment visit (V1) at which time an informed consent will be completed .  Those scheduled for an enrollment visit will also b e 
provided a copy of Appendix B, Handout to Study Participants , and/or a welcome email with details . 
 As part of the informed consent process, study procedures, schedule for visits, and duration of 
participation will again be reviewed, and alternatives dis cussed, including the option to not enroll in this 
project, and follow up with their primary health care provider.   
After informed consent is obtained, randomization will be completed, baseline study measures obtained, and all participants will be instruc ted how to maintain a hot flash daily diary . 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Women , age 40 or older, with perimenopaus al and postmenopaus al related  vasomotor symptoms  
(intact uterus and ovaries ), who have at least 5 hot flashes per day ( with at least  one being categorized 
as moderate to severe), with what is reported to be a stable pattern for at least one month.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
Less than  [ADDRESS_131286] 1 moderate to severe hot flash per day

will be tested for pregnancy prior to randomization)  
Severe hearing impairment (because the subject will be using headphones during the interventions ) 
Ongoing need for treatment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or anti -psychotic medications, anti-depressant 
medications such as SSRI, SNRI, or tricyclic, and sleep medications such as zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_117649] 1.0

other chemicals or medications   
Anticipated and ongoing use of recreational drugs, alcohol, or energy drinks  
Ongoing need for treatment with thyroid medications  
Weight is over the chair limit (285 pounds)  
Are enrolled in another research study that includes an active intervention  
Have previously received brainwave optimization (BWO), used a B2 or a B2v2 wearable device, or previously participated in a HIRREM research study  
 
Participants are encouraged to discuss their participation with their health care provider following 
completion of the study because HIRREM may alleviate some of the need for medications they were on 
previously.  Participants are requested to abstain from using any alcohol or recreational drugs during the intervention, and for at least six weeks following sessions since use of t hese substances may cause 
reversal or cessation of the benefits of HIRREM.  In addition, the participants are also advised to suspend chiropractic, cranial- sacral therapy, and bio -energy work during the intervention, and for at least six 
weeks following . 
Nu
mber of Subjects:  
As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], in a new cohort of participants, using a wait -list control, we are not able to calculate an 
accurate sample size.  In order to evaluate feasibility and effect size, and allowing for up to 20% drop 
outs, we will arbitrarily enroll up to 48 subjects to achieve a goal of having 40 subjects complete the 
study per protocol (estimated 20  per group).  
Number of HC C Sessions and Length of Study:  
All baseline measures, along with a brainwave assessment, will be obtained during an enrollment visit (V1).   The intervention will commence 7- [ADDRESS_131288] three days of the intervention period.  Following the 
initial 6 sessions, some sessions may be arranged as singles (one per day), if needed due to schedule 
issues.   Participants will be encouraged to complete the remainder of the intervention sessions within 
two-three weeks, with a maximum of four weeks to complete the sessions.  If done as two sessions per 
half day, subject involvement will thus require 4-[ADDRESS_131289] -intervention data  collection visit, all measures will be repeated.  This visit will occur 
at 4-6 weeks after completion of the intervention  for the HCC group, and 10 -12 weeks after V1 for the 
CCC group.  A final data collection visit (V 3) will occur [ADDRESS_131290] assessment .  At V3, official study involvement is complete for those in the HCC group, 
while those randomized to the CCC group will be offered an opportunity to be scheduled to receive a 
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/[ADDRESS_131291] assessment 0 -14 days 
before starting sessions .  Those who opt to do so will receive a course of in -office acoustic stimulation 
linked to brainwaves, as described for the HCC group, and will continue to be followed for data 
collections at 4 -6 weeks (V 4), and 12 -14 weeks (V 5), as done during the initial  intervention period,  after 
completing their HCC sessions.   
Enrollment Visit:  
Informed consent is obtained , notification of group assignment is made, and all baseline measures are 
collected , including a brainwave assessment .  The V1 visit will req uire about 2 hours of time.  
Intervention Period:  
During the intervention period, subjects will receive in -office sessions of  acoustic stimulation linked to

High- re
solution, relational, resonance -based,  electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM) : 
High- resolution, relational, resonance -based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM ®) is a computer -
based technology created by [CONTACT_117662], LLC, Scottsdale, AZ, designed to facilitate 
relaxation and auto -calibration of neural oscillations through reflecting back musical tones in near real 
time.

  03/22/[ADDRESS_131295] Assessment:  
This is the first step in the HIRREM process.  It occurs during the V1 enrollment visit , and will be 
performed on both groups .  The assessment creates a map of frequencies and amplitudes, and informs 
the choice of protocols for the initial HIRREM sessions.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_117650] ( HRV and BRS), and that changes can be observed 
in frequencies and amplitudes from pre - to post -HIRREM.  For the assessment, with the participant in a 
sitting position, sensors are sequentially placed over six areas of the scalp to record one minute epochs of data while the brain is at rest, or on task, with eyes open and with eyes closed.  For the assessment, measurements are taken at homologous regions of the bilateral hemispheres according to the 10 -20 
International System at F3/F4, C3/C4, P3/P4, T3/T4, FZ/OZ, O1/O2 , FP1/FP2, an d CB1/CB2  with both 
eyes closed (EC; one minute), and eyes open (EO; one minute) conditions  ("Report of the committee on 
methods of clinical examination in electroencephalography: 1957," 1958) .  For EO assessments, subjects 
are given standardized tasks involving numerical digit recall (F3/F4), reading silently (C3/C4), math 
calculations (P3/P4), listening comprehension (T3/T4), and to relax with eyes open (O1/O2).  A sixth 
midline measurement is taken at FZ/OZ, with an EO task to count number of appearances of a specific word as they read a standardized printed passage . A seventh (FP1/FP2 , given standardized tasks 
involving numerical digit recall), and eighth (CB1/CB2 , relax with eyes open ) location  are also measured .  
The reference sensors are connected at A1/A2 and linked for assessments. The data are processed to 
identify patterns and imbalances of frequencies and amplitudes, which are used to generate specific 
protocols for the initial HIRREM session.  The assessment takes about [ADDRESS_131296] -intervention, between the two groups.  
HIRREM Sessions:  
Participants assigned to both study groups will co ntinue their current clinical care.  The HIRREM 
intervention group (HCC), will also receive a course of [ADDRESS_131297], sitting or reclining, the sensors are placed over the specific target areas on 
the scalp corresponding with brain regions/lo bes to be observed.  Brainwaves  are monitored in real 
time, and the dominant frequency within a chosen target frequency band, e.g. delta (0.5 -3 Hz) is 
identified.  The dominant frequency is assigned an auditory tone which is played back to the subject via ear phones with as little as [ADDRESS_131298] listens to the energetic 
"song" being played in the brain from moment to moment, providing the brain with rapid updating about its frequencies, amplitudes, and patterns via an el ectronic/acoustic mirror of itself.   
Some sessions will occur with eyes closed, for which the subject will be instructed to relax.  Some 
sessions will occur with eyes open, during which the subject can read, or do other activities such as a 
word search, o r just relax.

proportionation in frequency ranges, between and within cortical regions, based upon data from the initial assessment and the ensuing sessions (Gerdes et al., 2013) .  Each participant in the HCC group wil l 
receive at least 8 sessions.  The final number of HIRREM sessions , which may be extended to as many as 
16, will depend on continuous review of brain patterns  relative to progress towards improved balance 
and quieting of electrical amplitudes, as well as progress and stability of self- reported status regarding 
symptoms such as sleep and stress.   
Safety:  
Evidence to date indicates that the HIRREM intervention has potentially high benefit and low risk.  Based on experience reported by [CONTACT_117673], garnered from provision of case management 
support, feedback from their clients, and feedback from the HIRREM provider community, as well as results from IRB-approved studies at WFSM (now over 480 participants to receive HIRREM), we are not aware of an y serious adverse events resulting from HIRREM sessions.   
Non -serious, temporary, effects have been reported by [CONTACT_117674].  This includes 
things such as the participant reporting being more aware of, or more affected by [CONTACT_117675],  or by 
[CONTACT_117676], changes in sleep, including dreams, emotions, or energy levels, or a feeling of fullness in the head or mild headache.  In the course of provision of HIRREM as part of five IRB- approved 
studies at WFSM, such non -serious, temporary  effects have been estimated to occur in ten percent or 
less of participants.  Based on recent analysis of a placebo controlled trial of HIRREM for moderate to severe insomnia (n = 107), such non -serious, temporary adverse effects that were judged to go beyond 
the intensity, expression, or nature of pre- existing health conditions were reported during study 
participation by 10.7% in the HIRREM group, and 13.7% in the placebo group.  All epi[INVESTIGATOR_117651], typi[INVESTIGATOR_117652] [ADDRESS_131300] lasted less than one week.  Skin irritation at the 
site from the paste used to affix the sensors to the scalp was reported by a single participant (<1%) (personal communication).   
All HIRREM sessions are administered by [CONTACT_117677], including guidelines for addressing any adverse effects that may occur.  In the event that any adverse effect is prolonged or intense, participants will be advised to see their primary care physician, or if 
needed, to see a mental health professional for additional evaluation or treatment.  It acute, and severe,

 participants will be referred to the Emergency Department.  There are no anticipated additional risks 
associated with continuation of current clinical care.      
Other Da t a Collection , Measures, and Process:  
A series of measures will be collected at the enrollment visit  (V1), as well as at three post- intervention 
period visits for all participants.  Those in the CCC group , who choose to receive HCC within [ADDRESS_131301] -interventions data collection visits.    
Demographics:  
Demographic information will include embedded elements to allow calculation of the Charlson Como rbidity Index Score  (Charlson et al., 2008) .   
Autonomic cardiovascular Regulation [ B
 lood Pressure  (BP), Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), 
Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS), and Blood Pressure Variability (BPV) ]: 
Continuous BP and HR are acquired from noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG 
for a minimum of 10 minutes in subjects lying down quietly, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR, 
intervals (RRI) files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and software, Santa Barbara, CA) at [ADDRESS_131302] SA -BRS software ( by [CONTACT_117678], 
d.o.o., Izola, Slovenia ) for measures of BRS, HRV and BPV as follows:  Frequency Method .
   Power 
spectral densities of SBP and RRI oscillations are computed by [ADDRESS_131303] Fourier Transform (FFT) and integrated over specified frequency ranges (LF: 0.04 -0.15 Hz; HF: 0.15- 0.4 Hz).  A Hanning window is 
applied and the squared -coherence modul us is computed if coherence is >0.5 as reported.  The square -
root of the ratio of RRI’s and SBP powers is computed to calculate LF, HF alpha indices, which reflect BRS (16).  Power of RRI spectra in LF, HF range (LFRRI and HFRRI) are calculated in normaliz ed units and the 
ratio of LFRRI/HFRRI is used as a measure of sympathovagal balance.   Power of SBP spectra calculated as 
LFSAP is used as a measure of BPV.  Sequence Method .  BRS calculated by [CONTACT_117679] (n) in which SBP consecutively increases (UP 
sequence) or decreases (DOWN sequence), which are accompanied by [CONTACT_117680] (n+1).  The software scans the RRI and SBP records, identifies sequences , 
and calculates linear correlation between RRI and SBP for each sequence.  If the correlation coefficient 
exceeds a pre- set critical value (0.85), the regression coefficient (slope) is calculated and accepted.  The 
mean of all individual regression coeffi cients (slopes), a measure of sequence BRS, is then calculated for 
Sequence UP, DOWN and TOTAL.  Time -Domain Analysis .  Three time-domain parameters are used for 
hemodynamic variability.  HRV is determined by [CONTACT_117681] n ormal 
intervals (SDNN), and the root mean square of successive beat-to -beat differences in R -R interval 
duration (rMSSD).   BPV is the standard deviation of the mean arterial pressure (SDMAP).  
HRV and BRS D ata Processing and Interpretation : 
Heart rate is measured as beat -to-beat intervals (RRI) recorded by [CONTACT_117682] -wave recording, and will be 
analyzed using custom software developed by [CONTACT_117683].  Data can be loaded and viewed, and a subset of 
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/2018  
 the data can be selected to avoid artifacts during device placement or removal.  Outlier identification is 
performed by [CONTACT_117684] a 30% difference from the mean of the previous 
four samples.  Such outliers are removed from the data set.  HRV statistics that are generated include 
mean, variance, SD NN, r MSSD, VLF, LF, HF, TP, LF/HF, sample asymmetry, sample entropy, and 
coherence  ("Heart rate variability: standards of measurement, physiological interpretation and clinical 
use. Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and 
Electrophysiology," 1996).  All of the algorithms for computation of these parameters are derived from information or source code from the Physionet archive.  Data are saved to Excel spreadsheets for further 
statistical analysis by [CONTACT_38991].  
Menopause -r
 elated symptoms:  
Hot flash diaries provide a valid and reliable approach to understanding a participant’s experience of hot 
flashes and night sweats  (Sloan et al., 20 01).  An adapted hot flash daily diary that includes daytime and 
nighttime frequency and severity will be include d.  Categories are mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and 
very severe (4).  Data will be used to calculate a hot flash severity score for each day as the sum number 
of hot flashes within each severity category multiplied by [CONTACT_117685], with the 
resulting sum divided by [CONTACT_117686].  Participants will be asked to keep a 7 -14 day 
daily hot flash diary after V1, and then 7 -14 days before each subsequent data collection visit.  
Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) is  a [ADDRESS_131304] week.  These domains include work, social 
activities, leisure activities, sleep, mood, concentration, relation with others, sexuality, enjoyment of life, and overall quality of life.  Items are scored from 1 (not at all) to 10 (extremely)  (Carpenter, 2001) .      
The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) is a survey that generates a score between 0 and 44 based on the 
individual ’s symptom severity rankings  (Research, 2008).  There are 11 symptoms listed related to 
perimenopause that are each assigned a score of 0 to 4 by [CONTACT_39359].  A score of 0 indicates none, 1 
is mild, 2 is moderate, 3 is severe, and 4 is very severe.  After completion, the individual’s score is tallied 
to create an overall score.  Scores from 0 -4 are considered zero to little, scores from 5 -8 are considered 
mild, scores from 9 -16 are moderate, and scores 17 or greater are considered severe.  
Insomnia :
  
The severity of insomnia symptoms is measured using three self -report symptom inventories  with each 
data collection visit (Appendix A).  This includes the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) , the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8326]  (PSQI), and the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284] (ESS).   The ISI is a 7 question measure, with 
responses from 0 -4 for each question, yielding scores ranging from 0 -28 (Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 
2001; C.M. Morin, Belleville, Belanger, & Ivers, 2011; C. M. Morin et al., 2009) .  The PSQI is a 19 item 
inventory that assesses sleep quality over a 1 -month time interval (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & 
Kupfer, 1989) .  Items are weighted on a 0 -3 interval scale .  A global PSQI score is calculated by [CONTACT_117687], providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores 
denote  a healthier sleep quality.   The ESS measures a person’s general level of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or 
their average sleep propensity in daily life.  The simple questionnaire is based on retrospective reports 
  Version 1.0 
  03/22/2018  
 of the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in a variety of different situations.  Rate d on a 4 -point 
scale (0 -3), it evaluates their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different 
activities.  The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0 -3) can range from 0 to 24  (Johns, 1991) . 
Behavioral a nd Psycho -physiological function: 
Depression:  
The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D) is a depression scale which will help to 
assess this co -morbidity.  CES-D is a 20 -item survey assessing affective depressive symptomatology to 
screen for risk of depression  (Radloff, 1977).  Scores range from 0 -60, with a score of 16 commonly used 
as a clinically relevant cut -off (SmarrK.L., 2003) . 
Anxiety:  
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD -7) is a seven item screening tool for anxiety that is widely used 
in primary care.  GAD -7 is a brief, reliable and valid measure of assessing generalized anxiety disorder 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) . 
Stress: 
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a ten -item psychological instrument for meas uring the perception of  
stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. Items 
were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. 
The scale, with answers rated from [ADDRESS_131305] queries about current levels of 
experienced stress  (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). 
Quality of Life:  
Quality of Life:  
The Quality of Life Scale  (QOLS) is a 16 -item scale that was modified from a 15 -item scale used in chronic 
disease patients.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117653], community engagement, personal fulfillment, and recreation.  Each item is scaled from 1 to 7 and a sum score is calculated to represent higher levels of satisfaction in life (range is 16 -112)  (Carol S. Burckhardt & 
Anderson, 2003; C. S. Burckhardt, Woods, Schultz, & Ziebarth, 1989; Offenbächer, Sauer, Kohls, Waltz, & Schoeps, 2012) . 
Alcohol Intake Screening:  
The AUDIT -C is a short, 3 -item alcohol screening for hazardous drinkers or active alcohol use disorders.  
This measure consists of 3 questions to assess an individual’s alcohol use.  Each question has five 
possible answers ranging from of 0 -4 with a total scoring scale of 0 -12.  A total score of 3 or more in 
women and a score of four or more in men is suggestive of hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders.   This form is modified from the longer, 10 -item AUDIT instrument  (Bradley et al., 2003; 
Bradley et al., 2007; Bush, Kivlahan, McDonell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998) .

 Functional Measures:  
Reaction Testing : 
Reaction testing will be evaluated by a drop -stick, clinical reaction time apparatus.  It is constructed 
from a meter stick covered in friction tape with gradations.  The modified meter stick is fixed to a 
weighted rubber cylinder.  The apparatus is placed between the thumb and index finger of the subject 
and released at a random time during a countdown.  The subject catches the apparatus and the distance fallen  (cm)  is converted to reaction.  Following two practice trials, subjects perform eight trials, and a 
mean distance value is used for analysis.  This is repeated with a  second  set of [ADDRESS_131306].  This simple clinical measure has been evaluated by [CONTACT_117688], and dem onstrated utility in testing comparable to computerized testing methods  (Eckner, Kutcher, & 
Richardson, 2010) .  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_117654]-concussion symptoms  (C. H. Tegeler et al., 2016) . 
Grip Strength :
  
Grip strength  will be evaluated using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline Hydraulic Hand 
Dynamometer).  The mean value of the greatest force generated during three trials will be used for 
analysis  (Roberts et al., 2011). 
Statistical Analysis :  
Continuous variables will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics, such as quartiles, means, and standard deviations, while categorical variables will be summarized with percentages and 
frequencies.  LMMs will be employed to contrast longitudinal changes in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure between the HCC and NCC groups.  Mean contrasts will be used to co mpare the changes in 
blood pressure between groups from V1 to V3, our primary test of efficacy.   Comparisons of changes in 
all secondary outcomes will be assessed in a similar fashion.  Assumption and computation diagnostics 
will be assessed for all model fits  (Cheng, Edwards, Maldonado -Molina, Komro, & Muller, 2010)  and 
model adjustments and outcome variable transformations will be made as necessary.  Data will be 
analyzed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) or the R Statistical Computing Environment.  
Participant C o
 mpensation : 
Partic ipants will receive up to $ 100 compensation for time, travel, and inconvenience related to study 
visits.  Subjects who do not complete the entire study will receive a prorated portion of this amount 
($25 per visit for completion of each of the three  data collection visits , and $25 for completion of the 
daily hot flash diaries ).

Cognitive Testing  (ImPACT),t he first year of the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_530472]  a 
comprehensive battery of clincial assessment through the utilization of functional movement and dynam ic 
postural control assessments. Year one of the assessments was focused on  the m ale high school football 
player  (who is at increased risk for concussion) . Year one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_530473] [ADDRESS_688937] testing in 
youth athletes in light of ongoing neurodevelopment in this population.  In addition, year one implement ed 
additional  tools focused on assessment of dynamic balance, reaction time, and agility . This battery of t ests 
will provide clinicians with invaluable information to guide both rehabilitation of and return to play  (RTP) 
decisions for  concussed high school athletes . Year one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_530474] a concussion and assess ed increased r isks for musculoskeletal injury . This more global 
appro ach will signficantly enhance predictions of subsequent concussions and musculoskeletal injuries that 
have been shown to occur in concussed collegiate and professional athletes and that we belie ve are also 
occurring in our high school athletes.  
Year two  and three  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_530475]  1) concussed  
high school patients  (male and female high school athletes)  presenting to clinic at Arkansas Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ACH) ,(n=50)  2)  9th grade  male  athletes  (a younger population than was tested in year one) (n=90)  
and 9th-12th grade female  athletes participating in soccer (an at risk and under -represented group in the 
concussion literature), (n=85)  and 3) continue to use injury tracking software to document concussion and 
musculoskeletal injury as they occur in high school  male and female athletes.  
  
III.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Sport -related concussion is a pervasive problem in varsity and collegiate athletics. The Center for Disease 
Control reports an estimated 1.[ADDRESS_688938] -Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) has been utilized to 
establish baseline neuro -cognitive abilities and to provide data for return to play decisions after concussion.  
The frequency of ImPACT administration (biennial or annually), however, has been called into question in 
the young, neuro -developmentally immature athlete.[ADDRESS_688939] that continued deficits in neuro -motor control may be implicated, though current 
concussion management does not sensitively m easure dynamic movement and control.12-14 This 
connection between concussion and subsequent musculoskeletal injury rate has not been studied in the 
high school population and represents a major gap in our knowledge of identification of risk and injury 
prevention in this population.  
    
Significance  
 
The overall goal for year two of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041] (May 2017 -April 2018)  is three -fold. We will , 1) 
implement the battery of tests constructed in year one  that are sensitive to neuro -motor control (i.e. 
balance, reaction time, and agility ) in concussed  high school patients  presenting to clinic at Arkansas 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ACH), 2) examine  the frequency of current neurocognitive measures in 9th grade  male  
athletes  (a younger population than was tested in year o ne) ,9th-12th grade female  athletes participating in

 soccer (an at risk and under -represented group in the concussion literature) , and annual assessment of 
athletes participating in football for a consecutive year , and 3 ) use injury tracking software to do cument 
concussion and musculoskeletal injury as they occur in high school  male and female athletes.  
 
Achievement of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_530476]. We anticipate that completion of these innovative studies will not only enhance our knowledge of the 
relationship between concussion and subsequent musculoskeletal injury, but that also implement ation of 
these clinically applicable tests will allow us to more accurately define the impairments that are factors for 
increased injury risk.  
 
 
 
 
IV.  HYPOTHESES   
 
Our central hypothesis  is that, like collegiate and professional athletes, high school athletes who sustain a 
concussion are at an increased risk for future  concussions or subsequent  musculoskeletal injury. However, 
unlike the adult athletes whose cognitive function is mature, annual assessment of cognition (ImPACT) in 
youth athletes, whose cognition is developi[INVESTIGATOR_239559], may be insufficient as a baseline measure, and so, we 
plan to test the youth athletes tri -annually to determine how stable ImPACT testing is in this populat ion. 
 
V.  TRIAL DESIGN   
 Experi ment 1. Concussed  (sports related)  adolescent males  and females  (n=50) ages [ADDRESS_688940] (SEBT), a divided attention gait task, the 
Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), and the Illinois Change of Direction (COD) Illinois agility test (IAGT).  The 
SEBT is an established, reliable outcome measure of  dynamic postural stability through measurement of 
lower extremity reach distance.15-Our study can utilize a force plate during SEBT testing to allow the 
investigators to sensitively measure center of mass in all planes. To test gait , balance , control and adaptatio n 
of gait strategy which have  each  been shown to be impaired in concussed individuals acutely and chr onically, 
athletes will walk at a self-selected speed on the GAITRite® portable gait analysis walkway for three undivided 
attention trials and three divide d attention trials  during which a cognitive task will be imposed.18-25The GaitRite® 
will calculate spatio -temporal parameters during gait and has been used in the concussion literature.24,[ADDRESS_688941] yields a completion time in seconds. These tests will be administered by [CONTACT_530482][INVESTIGATOR_11437], assisted by [CONTACT_530483]  (DPT) and PhD physical 
therapy programs at UCA. The total testing time per ath lete will not exceed 1 .5 hours. All athletes will be asked 
to complete  between 1 -3 functional tests with  a maximum of 4 functional tests  (the SEBT, IGAT, and divided 
attention gait task ), in addition to the  standard static B alance Error Scoring System (BESS) test .  The tests can 
be administered (1 -2 additional times) for fol low-up, if [CONTACT_433651] or the PT have made a clinical decision that 
the athlete is not prepared for return to play.  
Experiment 2. Qualified athletic trainers  or Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] , with  oversight  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Israel will administer the 
ImPACT . The ImPACT  is a widely used neurocognitive testing component of the standard three -prong 
approach to concussion management which also includes symptom inventories and static balance 
assessment.[ADDRESS_688942] 
also has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure in the high school and collegiate populations.34-40 
Composite scores fo r each of the non -injured athletes will be stratified by [CONTACT_530484]:  Compre hensive dynamic movement assess ment for concussion management   
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_530470], Sponsor: NIH Program award through the Center for Translational Neuroscience, UAMS  
 
Protocol Version  #10 Date :3/5/[ADDRESS_688943] testing  to include female soccer (the second 
most concussive sport) players in 9th-12th grades.  Composite scores for each of the non -injured athletes will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_530485].  ImPACT testing will not 
exceed 1 hour and will be completed at the computer lab of the athlete’s schoo l or in the ACH concussion 
clinic.  
Experiment 3. Athletic trainers will use the established injury tracking system or Athletic Trainer System® injury 
tracking software mobile application to record incidence of injury, both musculoskeletal and concussive , during 
all practice and game play. Injuries acquired outside of the athletic and school setting will also be documented  
through athlete questionnaire.  Retrospective injury data for the previous school year were obtained through 
athlete questionnaire and r eview of current charting system to control for confounding variables. To accurately 
document injury and care -received, medical records may be obtained through ACH Adolescent Sports 
Medicine and Rehabilitation departments, and the ACH emergency department.

used in the analysis unless forbidden by [CONTACT_530486].  
 
 
VII. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
VII.1  Randomization Procedures :  The order of  functional movement testing will be  randomized for 
each athlete enrolled.   
VII.2  Consent Process :  Athletes  in area schools  will be screened using the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria noted above .  Athletes  in area schools  will have an educational session on concussion injury  
provided by [CONTACT_530487]. The study will be explained during a designated time 
determined by [CONTACT_530488] .  The parents of eligible athletes  will then receive a written detai led 
description of the study procedures  distributed with the participation for high school sports packet.   The 
consent process will be initiated prior to any scheduled  testin g so that parents have enough time for 
determining the risks and benefits of the p roposed study and have related discussions with study 
personnel.  Study personnel will be available by [CONTACT_530489].   
 
The investigators are requesting a waiver of the verbal consent process to the parent  for healthy athletes 
participating in the area school . The investigators will have verbal communication with the athlete  at the 
team meeting or another time as allowed , written communication to the parent  through a informational 
sheet that will be sent home following the team meeting , and will be available to the subjects/family for 
phone consultation.  The packet will be returned by [CONTACT_530490].  The study has 
met the required waiver elements as outlined in IRB protocol 15.3.  By [CONTACT_530491], the investigators are requesting a waiver for the requirement that a participant who turns 18 during 
the duration of the study be re -consented . The study will attempt to include  wards of the state using the 
approved process in policy 17.1.  
    The information will be given in language understandable to the reader.  All questions regarding 
participation will be answered.  No coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process.  No 
research related procedures will be performed prior to obtaining informed consent.  All signatures and 
dates will be obtained.  Once a signed consent is obtained the participant becomes eligible for the study.   
A copy of the signed consent wi ll be mailed home to the participant  or delivered to the athlete at their 
school . A copy of the consent will be maintained in a locked cabinet of the PI. After written consent has 
been obtained from the parents, the athlete’s functional testing assignment will be randomized  by [CONTACT_1275].    
 
 [CONTACT_433651] will screen athletes in the concussion clinic using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
study will be explained to the athlete and parent by a study investigator . 
The parent(s) of the eligible athlete and the athlete will receive a detailed description  of the  study 
procedures.  The consent process will be init iated prior to any functional testing  so that the parent(s) will 
have enough time for determining the risks and benefits of the proposed st udy and have related 
discussions with study personnel.  
 The investigators  will conduct the consent discussion and will be prepared to devote approximately 30 
minutes (longer if needed) to the discussion.  The consent process will take place in a quiet and private 
room in a location that is convenient for the person authorized to give informed consent.  The person 
obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the protocol and outline the risks a nd benefits,  
and follow -up requirements of the study .  The information will be given in language understandable to the 
reader.  Participation privacy will be maintained.  All questions regarding participation will be answered.  No

will be compensated $30 per visit and can include 2 follow -up visits for a total of $90.   
X.  DAT A SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
Before the study begins, approval of the UAMS/ACHRI IRB will be obtained. All IRB policies and 
procedures will be followed with regard to initial approval, continuing review, protocol and consent 
modifications, and adverse even t reporting. In addition, all relevant policies and procedures of the National 
Institutes of Health will be observed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_530477], the quality of the data , and the integrity of t he study.  All study subject material will be 
assigned a unique identifying code or number.  The key to the code will be kept in a locked file in the 
principal investiga tor’s office.  Only the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_530478].  The risk level associated with this study is estimated to be minimal.  Data will be 
published in aggregate form. No individual subjects will be identified.  The data will be de -identified after 
analysis and included in the long term database without identifiers.  The data will be destroyed per ACH 
document destruction policy.  
 
Risks   
The risk level associated with this study is estimated to be minimal. A licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_530479]. 
Israel will be onsite during all clinical functional testing. The neuro-cognitive testing will be supervised by a 
co-investigator or the athletic trainer assigned to the school.  
 
Benefits  
This study is seeking to determine the stability of neuro -cognitive testing  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_93342]. This study 
is also seeking  to determine normative data on dynamic movement testing in the high school athlete  
collected in year one as a comparison for scores obtained in the concussed athletes to more accurately 
identify remaining deficits that could place these athletes at risk with return to activity or play . The subjects 
will receive concussion education as p art of the study.

Protocol Version  #10 Date :3/5/[ADDRESS_688947]. Keith Williams, a co -investigator in the Biostatistical 
Department will oversee the analysis.  
  Data Analyses :   
Experiment 1 :  Comparisons will be made for each concussed athlete ’s measurement on the 4 functional 
tests with baseline data collected in healthy athletes during year one of our study . Additionally, 
comparisons will be made between our battery of dynamic tests and the static BESS for the concussed 
athle tes. For the returning uninjured subjects from year one, we will again examine  them individually and 
as a cohort including important covariates (age, position played , and history of concussion) and trends of 
the means will be assessed.  
Experiment 2:  Indiv idual athlete neurocognitive assessment will be observed over time to determine if 
scores remain within expected norms or change over time.  Athlete assessment will be examined as a 
cohort including important covariates (age, position played and history of  concussion) and trends of the 
means will be assessed.  Data will be analyzed using a repeated measure model. Post hoc comparisons 
will be performed using the Bonferroni adjustment .  
Experiment 3 : Continued documentation of  concussion and injury rates (during and beyond football 
season)  and in expanded populations  will provid e a more robust data set on which a regression analysis 
may be run to examine predictive factors to move toward the goal of ascertaining the incidence o f 
musculoskeletal injury after concussion in the high school population.

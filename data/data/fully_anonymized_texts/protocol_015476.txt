Outcome 
Parameters:   The primary outcome is patient score on the Quality of 
Recovery 40 (QoR40) inventory, measured at POD3.  
1. Length of stay and time from surgery to meeting discharge 
and physical therapy goals (measured in days after 
surgery).  
2. Pain control: opi[INVESTIGATOR_181317] (measure d in morphine equivalents, and 
numerically, respectively, daily).  
3. Time to post -operative oral intake (measured in days after 
surgery; or hours, if on POD 0).  
4. Post-operative nausea, vomiting and ileus (measured daily 
after surgery).  
5. Levels of plasma markers of surgical stress (IL -6, cortisol, 
CRP and insulin resistance; post -operative days 0 [ie, 
PACU], 1 and 3).  
6. Other post -operative complications: presence of 
delirium/confusion, infection, DVT/PE (will be assessed 
for the entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181318], but measured at 
discharge.  
7. QoR40  administered daily during the admission (starting at 
POD 0; ie, prior to PACU discharge) until POD 3, once 
on the day of discharge, and on PODs 14 and  56.

Statistical Analysis:  1. Proposed analysis (e.g., student’s t-test, ANOVA, chi -square, 
regression, etc.): two -sample t -test 
2. Alpha level: 0.05  
3. Beta or power level: 80%  
4. Primary outcome variable estimate (mean +/ - s.d. for 
continuous outcome, frequency/percentage for categorical 
variable): mean +/ - SD QoR40 o n POD 3 in control group = 
183.0 ± 14.1 (Bekker 2013)  
5. Number of groups being compared (use 1 for paired analysis 
within the same subjects):[ADDRESS_213918] size or change expected between groups: 12 point 
difference in QoR40 score between groups (Myles et al ., 2012 
found a 12 point  
difference in mean QoR40 score between patients with and 
without severe postoperative nausea and vomiting)  
7. Resulting number per group: 25  
8. Total sample size required: 50 + ~10% to account for attrition 
= 56 
  Adding 4 more pati ents to achieve 80% power which is 
a total sample size of 60  
 
The primary outcome (QoR40 on POD3) will be compared 
between the ERAS and conventional perioperative management 
groups using a two  sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank -sum test, 
depending upon the distribution of the data. As a secondary 
analysis, linear regression will be used to  compare the primary 
outcome between groups while adjusting for number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181319]. Secondary outcomes measured once per patient 
will be analyzed by t-test or Wil coxon rank -sum test (continuous 
data) and χ2 or Fisher’s exact test (categorical data).  
Outcomes measured multiple times per patient (e.g., plasma 
levels of IL -6, cortisol, CRP and the glucose:insulin) will be 
analyzed using regression  based on a generaliz ed estimating 
equation approach.  
Balance on demographics and baseline characteristics will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_33072] (difference in 
means or proportions  divided by [CONTACT_103884]) 
between groups. An absolute value o f 0.2 or greater will be 
interpreted as more imbalance than would be  expected by 
[CONTACT_3364] (Austin 2009).  
All analyses will be performed on an intention -to-treat basis.  
 
  
 
  
 
Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_213919] introduced by [CONTACT_181333] 1990s (K ehlet, 1997).  The 
goal of ERAS pathways is to promote faster recovery by [CONTACT_181334] -operative organ 
function and reducing the profound stress response that follows surgery.  Early studies in 
colorectal surgery patients established that “organ dysfunc tion”, (expressed as pain, nausea, 
vomiting, ileus, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction), together with prolonged immobilization, and 
logistical issues all contribute to slow post -operative recovery.  Kehlet hypothesized that it 
was unlikely any single surgi cal technique, anesthetic intervention or medication could 
significantly impact organ dysfunction individually.  However, a better recovery could be 
achieved with a multimodal approach directed towards modulating the surgical stress 
response.  This led to the introduction of ERAS for colorectal surgery in which a number of 
pre-, intra - and postoperative interventions are delivered together in order to produce 
improvements in overall clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization.  A recent study 
published in JAMA  highlights the clinical and economic gains that can be achieved with an 
ERAS -for-colorectal surgery pathway: compared to historic controls, after introducing the 
ERAS pathway, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181320] 3 days, without an increase in readmi ssion rates; 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_181321] 50%; and a cost saving of almost $7000 per surgery was 
achieved (Geltzeiler et al., 2014). Given the quality improvements found in colorectal patients, 
ERAS pathways have been quickly implemented in a range of  surgical specialties, including 
total joint arthroplasty (hip and knee; Aasvang et al., 2015), gynecologic oncology (Nelson et 
al., 2014), urology (Melnyk et al., 2011), vascular (Podore & Throop, 1999) and thoracic 
surgery (Tovar et al. 1998).   
 
There i s a strong theoretical case for the introduction of ERAS principles to major spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017].  The demand for spi[INVESTIGATOR_181322], and there are wide variations in length 
of stay, complication rates, post -operative pain and functional recovery.  In p articular, spi[INVESTIGATOR_181323].  Indeed, in a recent prospective 
study of pain intensity across [ADDRESS_213920] painful (Gerbershagen et al., 2013).  Similar 
to colorectal procedures, ileus is a frequent complication limiting recovery and increasing 
length of stay after spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680] (Motasem et al., 2014).  Additionally, rates of lumbar fusion 
are increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y, particularly for spi[INVESTIGATOR_181324].  The 
US Spi[INVESTIGATOR_181325] 2017  indicates that advanced technologies and an aging 
population will lead to further increased demand for these procedures (Ken Research, 201 3).  
At the same time, evidence derived from Medicare patients suggests that aggregated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181326], suggesting greater surgical 
complexity and/or longer length of stay (Deyo et al., 2010).  
 
Thus, there are clinical and economic imperatives to develop strategies to improve outcomes 
after spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  To date, ERAS principles have not yet been applied to spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  
Given the success of ERAS in so many surgical disciplines, here we ask w hether an ERAS 
pathway can also improve quality of recovery and reduce complications after multi -level 
lumbar fusion.

A major assumption underlying the efficacy of ERAS pathways is modulation of the systemic 
inflammatory response (SIR) to surgery ( Kehlet, 1997).  The stress of surgery leads to well -
characterized metabolic, endocrine and immune responses, which together promote 
physiological stability and healing (Marik & Flemmer, 2012).  The major responses to 
surgical injury include the release of proinflammatory cytokines (most importantly, IL -6) and 
acute phase proteins (C -reactive protein), elevated cortisol, and the development of insulin 
resistance (Desborough, 2000). CRP and IL -[ADDRESS_213921] association with the 
magnitude of the surgica l injury (Watt et al., 2015a).   A recent meta -analysis of the effect of 
ERAS on markers of SIR after colorectal surgery concluded that overall, objective evidence 
is limited, with the exception that a laparoscopic approach is associated with reduction in IL-
6 and CRP (Watt et al., 2015).  There is limited data regarding inflammatory markers after 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]: percutaneous lumbar discectomy is associated with lower levels of 
inflammatory cytokines compared to open discectomy (Pan et al., 2014), and glucoc orticoids 
modulate levels of most cytokines after osteotomy (Reikeras et al., 2009).  Bekker et al 
(2013) described reduced IL -10 and cortisol after dexmedetomidine infusion in patients 
undergoing lumbar fusion, but to date, the relationship between periop erative interventions 
and effects on SIR remains an underexplored area of research.

1. Proposed analysis (e.g., student’s t -test, ANOVA, chi -square, regression, etc.): two -
sample t -test 
2. Alpha level: 0.05  
3. Beta or power level: 80%  
4. Primary outcome variable estimate (mean +/ - s.d. for continuous outcome, 
frequency/percentage for categorical variable): mean +/ - SD QoR40 on  POD 3 in control 
group = 183.0 ± 14.1 (Bekker 2013)  
5. Number of groups being compared (use 1 for paired analysis within the same subjects):[ADDRESS_213925] size or change expected between groups: 12 point difference in QoR40 score 
between groups (Myles et al. , 2012 found a 12 point  
difference in mean QoR40 score between patients with and without severe postoperative 
nausea and vomiting)  
7. Resulting number per group: 25  
8. Total sample size required: 50 + ~10% to account for attrition = 56  
  Adding 4 more patie nts to achieve 80% power which is a total sample size of 60  
 
The primary outcome (QoR40 on POD3) will be compared between the ERAS and 
conventional perioperative management groups using a two  sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank -
sum test, depending upon the dist ribution of the data. As a secondary analysis, linear 
regression will be used to  compare the primary outcome between groups while adjusting for 
number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181330]. Secondary outcomes measured once per patient will be 
analyzed by t-test or Wilcoxo n rank -sum test (continuous data) and χ2 or Fisher’s exact test 
(categorical data).  
Outcomes measured multiple times per patient (e.g., plasma levels of IL -6, cortisol, CRP 
and the glucose:insulin) will be analyzed using regression  based on a generalized 
estimating equation approach.  
Balance on demographics and baseline characteristics will be assessed by [CONTACT_181338] (difference in means or proportions  divided by [CONTACT_24703]) between groups. An absolute value of 0 .2 or greater will be interpreted as more 
imbalance than would be  expected by [CONTACT_3364] (Austin 2009).  
All analyses will be performed on an intention -to-treat basis.  
9.0 ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT  
All Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported in the final study report.  Definitions for Adverse 
Event (AE) used in this study are listed below and are based on FDA and international 
guidelines:  
 
9.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
All of the components included in the proposed ERAS pathway have evidence of benefit, no 
evidence of harm, and ar e used routinely in the care of patients undergoing lumbar fusion at 
HSS. The objective of this study is to ensure that those assigned to the ERAS pathway will 
receive these standard of care components. Patients who are assigned in the no -treatment 
(usual care) group will be receiving conventional perioperative management and will thus be 
considered standard of care, as well. Prior to enrollment at their pre -operative surgical clinic 
appointment, patients will be thoroughly screened to determine eligibility  by a study

investigator. However, if after enrollment, the clinical judgment of the healthcare provider(s) 
deems the patient to be unfit to continue the study procedures specific to his/her ERAS group 
assignment, he/she will thereafter proceed through the  conventional perioperative pathway. 
The risks of collecting plasma for this study are similar to the risks of a routine blood draw, 
including - mild pain, bruising, and very rarely infection at the place of needle insertion. 
However, the likelihood of the se risks occurring is rare, as an arterial line catheter is routinely 
placed in patients undergoing this class of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181332]'s hemodynamics perioperatively. The study team expects to draw samples using the 
pre-existing catheter. Patients can decline to participate in further blood draws at any point 
after enrollment should discomfort become a concern.  
Participation in this research involves the potential risk of a break of confidentiality to stored 
health information. HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some direct identifiers 
from stored information (i.e., names, social security numbers, medical record numbers); (ii) 
securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to information that wo uld be identifiable; 
and (iii) limiting access to information stored to HSS investigators.  
The likelihood of a breach of confidentiality is minimal.

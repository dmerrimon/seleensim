CONFIDENTIAL  INVESTIGATOR' S AGREEMENT  
I have received and read the Inv estigator’s Brochure for rux olitinib.   I have read the 
INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_627168]:  ruxolitinib    
Throughout this protocol, ruxolitinib will be used to designate the drug substance  (ruxolitinib 
phosphate) and drug product (ruxolitinib phosphate tablets)  
Title of Study:  An open label assessment of safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib  (INCB018424) in 
subjects with primary myelofibrosis, post essential thrombocythemia-myelofibrosis and post 
polycythemia v era-myelofibrosis who have platelet counts of 50 x 109/L to 100 x 109/L 
Protocol Number:  INCB [ZIP_CODE]-258 Study Phase:    2 
Primary Objectives:  
• To determine the effects of ruxolitinib on spleen volume and symptom atic burden in patients 
with primary myelofib rosis (PMF), post polycythemia vera- myelofibrosis (PPV -MF) and post 
essential thrombocythemia -myelofibrosis (PET-MF) who have baseline platelet count of 
50 x 109/L to 100 x 109/L.  
• To determine the safety and tolerability of ru xolitinib  in patients with PM F, PPV -MF, and 
PET-MF who have a baseline platelet count of 50 x 109/L to 100 x 109/L. 
Secondary Objective:  
• To determine appropriate dosing for patients with low platelets. 
• To determine the long- term safety and efficacy effects of ruxolitinib in patients w ith PMF, 
PPV-MF and PET -MF who have baseline platelet count of 50  x 109/L to 100 x 109/L. 
Overall Study Design:  
This is an open label study of ruxolitinib  in patients with PMF, PPV -MF, and PET-MF.  The study is 
comprised of 4 phases:  
Screening:  Up to 21 days 
Baseline:  Exactly 7 days  
Core Treatment Phase:  24 weeks    
Exten ded Treatment  Phase:  132 weeks; subjects receiving benefit will continue ruxolitinib 
treatment until Week 1 56 
Follow -up Phase:  All subjects will be followed for safety (eg, reporting o f AEs and 
serious AEs) for  [ADDRESS_627169] dose of study drug is 
administered  
 
Study Drug, Dosage and Mode of Administration and dose adjustments :  
All subjects will begin dosing at 5 mg bid ruxolitinib.  Doses should be taken morning and evening, 
approximately 12 hours apart, and without regards to food. 
During the core treatment phase, doses of ruxolitinib may be increased in 5 mg qd increments up to a 
dose of 10 mg bid starting at the Week 4 visit and at subsequent study visits (no more than every 
4 weeks) if platelet count was always ≥  40 x 109/L since the last scheduled study visit, platelet count, if 
decreased since the last visit , is decreased by ≤ 20%, no dose decreases or holds for safety have 
occurred during the preceding 4 week interval, no ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_627170] occurred since 
initiating treatment and ANC is >  1000/µL.  Doses may not exceed [ADDRESS_627171] meets the above dose escalation criteria, or per the investigator’s 
discretion.   
Doses may never exceed 25 mg bid. 
Subjects will be required to decrease the dose for platelet count <  35 x 109/L, and to hold dosing for 
platelet count < 25 x 109/L.  Subjects will have the option to  restart or re -escalate the dose with  
improving platelet count.  
Subjects will be required to interrupt dosing for any Grade 2 or higher hemorrhage events.  Subjects 
will be able to restart ruxolitinib dosing with resolution of Grade 2 even ts; restart after a second event 
requires review and discussion of pertinent data with the sponsor.  Restarts of ruxolitinib will only be 
permitted in some cases of Grade 3 and 4 events, after review and discussion of pertinent data with  the 
sponsor. 
Sites  will provide information on incidents of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 3/ Grade 4 
hemorrhage events via FAX to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the event.  
The overall incidence of these events will be continuously monitored  by [CONTACT_456], and with ongoing 
data review, could result in a temporary hold for further enrollment, a reduction in the maximum 
allowable dose for subjects in the study , or a protocol amendment to modify dose titration rules. 
Duration of Participation:   
Up to 4 weeks for screening + baseline phases  
Up to 24 weeks for the core t reatment phase   
Up to 132 weeks for the extended treatment p hase (to Week 1 56)

CONFIDENTIAL  Planned Number of Subjects:  Approximately 150 
Study Schedule/Procedures:  
There will be study visits and laboratory -only visits in the study.   
Core Treatment Phase:  
Subjects will have a regularly scheduled study visit at screening , baseline, Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, 
Week 12, Week [ADDRESS_627174] maintained platelet counts > 75  x 109/L since the last hematology assessment.  
Additional blood draws for hematology assessment will be require d if platelet count falls below 
35 x 109/L.   
Subjects will have an MRI of the upper and lower abdomen and pelvis to determine the spleen volume 
at baseline and Week 24.  CT scan will be substituted for subjects who are not candidates for MRI, or 
when MRI is not readily available. Patients Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire will be 
completed monthly.  Measurement of spleen length below the left costal margin will be measured by [CONTACT_488250].  
Subjects will complete an electron ic symptom diary (the Modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment 
Form (MFSAF) v2.0) from baseline thru the Week 24 visits (total of 25 weeks).

CONFIDENTIAL  4. INTRODUCTION 
The four classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include chronic myelogenous leukemia 
(CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis 
(PMF). Myelofibrosis (MF) can present as a de novo disorder (PMF) or evolve secondarily from 
previous PV or ET (post- PV-MF or post ET- MF).  Regardless of whether MF is a primary or 
secondary disorder, it is characterized by a clonal stem cell proliferation associated with 
production of elevated serum levels of multiple inflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines, a 
characteristic bone marrow stromal pattern that includes varying degrees of collagen fibrosis, osteosclerosis and angiogenesis and a peripheral blood smear showing a leukoerythroblastic 
pattern with varying degrees of circulating progenitor cells.  Clinically, MF is characterized by 
[CONTACT_488256], leukopenia or leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia or thrombocythemia and multi-organ extramedullary hematopoiesis most prominently involving the liver and spleen.  
Patients may experience severe constitutional symptoms, sequelae of massive splenomegaly 
(pain, limitations of movement, early satiety and shortness of breath, hepatic obstruction, and splenic infarction), a hypermetabolic state with cachexia, progressive hematopoietic failure, 
progression to leukemia, and premature death. 
The median age at diagnosis is approximately 60 to 65 years.  The incidence of PMF has been 
estimated at 1.5 cases per 100,000 people.  Survival in MF varies with the presence or absence of 
specific risk factors .  A prognostic scoring system based on a time-dependent risk evaluation has 
been developed: the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) for PMF 
(Passamonti  et al 2010), a ge of greater than 65 years, presence of cons titutional symptoms, 
anemia (Hemoglobin  less than 100 g/L), leukocytosis (white blood cell count (WBC) greater 
than 25 x10
9/L), and a circulating blast percentage of 1% or higher were assessed for their 
impact on survival when analyzed as ti me-dependent covariates in a multivariate Cox 
proportional hazard model.  The approach showed that acquisition of anemia over time affects survival with a hazard ratio roughly double that of other parameters; anemia was therefore assigned a score of 2, while the other [ADDRESS_627187] been described: 
Total Risk Score  Risk Category  Median Survival (months)  
0 Low not reached  
1 or 2  Intermediate -1 170 
3 or 4  Intermediate -2 48 
5 or 6  High  18 
For a subset of patients who are younger (generally less than 65 years), otherwise healthy and have a histocompatible donor, allogeneic stem cell transplantation may provide a curative option, 
although with substantial (10- 20%) risks of mortality, (Deeg  et al 2003) .  Drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_99399], 
including hydroxyurea, busulfan, 6-mercaptopurine, anagrelide, thalidomide, lenalidomide, 
interferon, corticosteroids, and erythropoiesis stimulating agents or growth factors, have not been 
shown to improve survival.  Some can increase the risk of leukemic transformation, and/or are poorly tolerated, and all have limited effectiveness in improving splenomegaly and constitutional 
symptoms.  Splenectomy, performed in approximately 10% of the patient cohort reported by 
(Cervantes  et al 2009) , is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Splenic irradiation 

Incyte Corporation    Page 17 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  is also employed to reduce symptoms secondary to splenomegaly, but symptomatic improvement 
is variable and short-lived; moreover, transient and life-threatening pancytopenia and an 
approximate 20% treatment -related mortality have been noted.  
Thrombocytopenia, although not found to be an independent variable in the multi variate analyses 
of prognostic factors proposed by [CONTACT_488257] (Cervantes  et al 2009, Passamonti  et al 2010), is considered to be an adverse risk 
factor by [CONTACT_488258], ( Elliott et al 2007) .  More recently, low platelet count 
(< 100 x 10
9/L), was shown to be a Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)-
independent factor for survival and leukemia- free survival (Gangat  et al 2011).  Apart from 
being an indicator of diminished bone marrow reserve, thrombocytopenia may also be a limiting 
factor with regards to therapy intensity with multiple agents including  ruxolitinib , whose DLT is 
thrombocytopenia.  Therefore, thrombocytopenic patients are often excluded from investigational studies despi[INVESTIGATOR_488226]. 
Within the past 5 years it was discovered that approximately 95% of patients with PV and about 
50% of patients with PMF and ET have a somatic gain-of function mutation in the Janus Kinase 
2 (JAK2)  gene  resulting in substitution of phenylalanine for valine at position 617 (JAK2 
V617F) within the pseudokinase domain  of the encoded protein. JAK 2 is one of four Janus 
kinases along with JAK1, JAK 3 and TYK 2.  Together the Janus kinases are responsible for transduction of cell signaling from Type I and II cytokine receptors families because these receptors do not possess catalytic kinases to activate downstream signal transduction.  Under 
physiologic conditions, the JAKs associate with the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptors in response to cytokine binding.  They then undergo autophosphorylation r esulting in 
conformational changes which enable them to transduce intracellular signaling by 
[CONTACT_488259] (STAT) proteins.  The activated STATs translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcription of a number of genes involved in cellular activation, proliferation and 
survival. JAKs associate with the intracellular domain of the Type I and II receptors in pairs, 
which may be homodimers (eg, two JAK2s) or  heterodimers (eg , a JAK 1 and a JAK2).  
Erythropoeitin (EPO), which is responsible for stimulating erythropoiesis, thrombopoietin (TPO) 
which is responsible for stimulating thrombopoiesis and GM-CSF have been shown to signal 
only through receptors which utilize JAK2 homodimers.  A large number of other inflammatory mediators are known to signal primarily through receptors that utilize JAK heterodimers.  It is 
also apparent that MF, as well as ET and even PV occur in the absence of the JAK2 V617F 
mutation.  In a minority of patients other mutations in the JAK - STAT pathway have been 
identified but in many patients the mutations have not been identified yet or don’t exist.  
However it appears that majority of patients with MF have over-activation of the JAK S TAT 
pathway, regardless of JAK2 V617F status.  In MF, excessive cytokine signaling through both

CONFIDENTIAL  4.1. Background Information o n Ruxolitinib T ablets 
4.1.1. Pharmacology Summary 
Ruxolitinib represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (IC 50 = 3.3 ± 1.2 nM) and 
JAK2 (IC 50 = 2.8 ± 1.2 nM) with modest to marked selectivity against TYK2 ( IC50 = 19 ± 
3.2 nM) and JAK3 ( IC50 = 428 ± 243 nM) , respectively.  Ruxolitinib  is inactiv e (ie,  < 30% 
inhibition) against 28 additional kinases when tested at 200 nM.  
In cell -based assays relevant to the pathogenesis of MPNs, such as JAK/STAT signaling and 
growth of the cytokine-dependent tumor cell lines, rux olitinib  demonstrates IC [ADDRESS_627189] is not due to general cytotoxicity, because ruxolitinib  (up to 25 μM) had 
no significant effect on the growth of cells driven by [CONTACT_488260]-ABL oncoprotein.  
Pharmacological data obtained with in vitro  and in vivo model systems supports the potential 
utility of orally administered ruxolitinib  in the treatment of inflammator y diseases such as RA as 
well as malignancies, including MPNs.   See Quintas- Cardama et al  2010 and the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) for additional information. 
4.1.2. Drug Disposition Summary  
Ruxolitinib  has high sol ubility and permeability. It is designated as a Class I molecule in the 
Biopharmaceutical Classification System and exhibits moderate -to-high clearance, volume of 
distribution and oral bioavailability in preclinical species.  The apparent elimination half- life is 
short (< 5 hr) in all species.  The primary clearance pathway is oxidative metabolism and the 
metabolism by [CONTACT_488261]3A4.  In a study 
using 14C-ruxolitinib  in healthy volunteers, unchanged ruxolitinib  was the predominant 
circulating drug -related entity with 2 major circulating metabolites observed, both of which are 
mono-oxidation products.  The metabolites of ruxolitinib  retain varying degrees of JAK -related 
pharmacological activity.   Excretion was fai rly rapid by [CONTACT_488262] < 1% of the administered dose.  Tissue distribution studies in rats indicate 
rapid and complete elimination of radioactivity in most tissues.   Rux olitinib  exhibits high plasma 
protein binding in humans with an unbound fraction of 3.3%.  
PK information is available from single and repeat dose studies in healthy volunteers, an ongoing 
study in subjects with myelofibrosis (MF), and a study in patients with RA.  Rux olitinib  was 
absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], attaining mean peak plasma concentrations within 1 -2 hours after 
administration .  The mean ruxolitinib  Cmax and AUC 0-∞ increased approximately proportional to 
dose over the entire dose range of 5 mg to 200 mg.  The mean terminal phase elimination 
half-life was approximately  3 hours.  There was no appreciable accumulation with repeat dosing.  
Administration of the 25 mg ruxolitinib  with a high -fat, high-calorie meal slowed the absorption 
of rux olitinib , prolonging the mean T max from 1.3 to 2.7 h, and lowered the mean C max by 24% 
but did not significantly affect the AUC compared to fasted administration.  The overall magnitude of the food effect on rux olitinib  exposure is not expected to be clinically important.  
Therefore, ruxolitinib  can be dosed without regards to meals.  PK parameters in patients with RA 
and MF were similar to those seen in healthy volunteers.   
Ruxolitinib  was well tolerated in single dose drug-drug interaction studies with inhibitors and an 
inducer of the CYP P450 family of metabolizing enzymes, when co- administered with 
methotrexate, in subjects with renal insufficiency, and in subjects with hepatic dysfunction.  

Incyte Corporation    Page 19 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  Co-administration of methotrexate does not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of rux olitinib  
while administration of  erythromycin slightly increases AUC by 26%.  Therefore no dose 
adjustments are required when ruxolitinib  is administered together with moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors such as erythromycin, including grapefruit juice, or with methotrexate.  Ketoconazole 
significantly increases the exposure to ruxolitinib  when co -administered with ruxolitinib; it is 
recommended that dosage of ruxolitinib  be decreased by 50% when co -administered with 
systemic ketoconazole, or other potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family of metabol izing 
enzymes.  Co -administration with rifampin significantly decreased the exposure to ruxolitinib; 
however, increases in the relative amount of active metabolites in the presence of this potent inducer of CYP3A4 resulted in nearly identical levels of ove rall JAK inhibitory activity as 
assessed by [CONTACT_488263]-6-induced STAT phosphorylation.  Therefore, there 
is no required dose adjustment when ruxolitinib  is co-administered with rifampin or other 
CYP3A4 inducers, but these agents should be used with caution in combination with ruxolitinib  
and alternative therapy used if available.  
Ruxolitinib  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (as measured by [CONTACT_8668] -6 induced STAT3 
phosphorylation (pSTAT3) ) were similar in subjects with normal renal func tion and with mild, 
moderate or severe renal impairment.  In subjects with end stage renal disease on dialysis ruxolitinib  PK parameters were similar to healthy subjects, whether ruxolitinib  was dosed prior 
to or following a dialysis session, but rux olitinib  pharmacodynamics were prolonged in subjects 
dosed following a dialysis session.  Therefore, ruxolitinib  may be dosed to subjects with varying 
degrees of renal impairment without dose adjustment with the exception of subjects with end 
stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis.  In a hepatic impairment study, there was an 88% 
increase in AUC in mild, 29% increase in moderate, and a 66% increase in severe hepatic disease 
(based on the Childs- Pugh classification) and the terminal elimination half -life ranged from 
4.6 hours in mild, 4.1 hours in moderate, and 5.1 hours in severe hepatic impairment subjects 
compared to 2.8 hours in healthy subjects.  No significant differences in pharmacodynamics 
were observed among subjects with mild or moderate hepatic dysfu nction compared to healthy 
subjects.  In subjects categorized as having severe hepatic impairment, the inhibition of IL-6 
induced pSTAT3 levels appeared to be prolonged following a single dose of ruxolitinib .  In 
subjects with hepatic impairment, it is suggested to reduce the initial starting dose (total daily dose) of ruxolitinib  by 25% to 50% compared to the recommended therapeutic starting dose.  
Subjects should be carefully monitored and the dose titrated accordingly. 
See the IB for additional information regarding the disposition of rux olitinib . 
4.1.3. Nonclinical Toxicology Summary  
Effects noted in multiple dose toxicity studies in mice (up to 4 weeks), rats (up to 6 months), and 
dogs (up to 12 months) were primarily those associated with the mechanism of action of 
ruxolitinib , a potent and reversible inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling.  Decreases in red blood 
cells, reticulocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes have been observed along with lymphoid 
depletion in bone marrow and lymphoid organs.  In addition, in dog s, demodectic mange, 
bacterial pneumonia and viral -induced papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603], expected consequences of the pharmacology 
of JAK inhibition, were noted. 
In a respi[INVESTIGATOR_488228], an adverse decrease in minute volume was noted in 
female but not in male rats at the highest dose, 150 mg/kg.  In a cardiovascular evaluation of

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  ruxolitinib  in dogs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were unaffected at all doses.  
Administration of ruxolitinib  at the highest dose evaluated (30 mg/kg) resulted in an adverse 
lowering of blood pressure along with an increase in heart rate compared to vehicle control.  The 
IC50 for inhibition of the hERG channel was determined to be 131.[ADDRESS_627190] -natal development and maternal function 
study in rats, no adverse effects were noted.  Rux olitinib  passed into the milk of lactating rats 
with an exposure that was 13-fold higher than maternal plasma exposure.  See the IB for additional information. 
4.1.4. Clinical Summary  
Ruxolitinib  has been administered to over 180 healthy volunteers as single, repeat single, or 
multiple doses of up to 10 days duration.  Ruxolitinib has been administered to approximately 
450 subjects with MF for periods of up to > 24 months, and over 100 subjects with prostate 
cancer, multiple myeloma, polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia for periods of up to 
> [ADDRESS_627191] of ruxolitinib  blocking IL -6 signaling and causing neutrophil 
margination on blood vessel walls.  In a repeat dose healthy volunteer study, neutropenia of any 
severi ty grade was seen in 22% of placebo subjects, 11% of subjects receiving 50 mg qd, 67% of 
subjects receiving 100 mg qd, 13% of subjects receiving 15 mg bid, 33% of subjects receiving 
25 mg bid and 67% of subjects receiving [ADDRESS_627192] receiving ruxolitinib  at 50 mg bid (highest dose).  The 
maximum tolerated dose in healthy volunteers was determined to be 25 mg bid and no dose 
limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen at 100 mg qd.  
A definitive QT study was carried out in 50 healthy volunteers, evaluating the effects of single 
doses of 25 mg or 200 mg ruxolitinib  compared with placebo an d 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive 
control).  The overall conclusion was that there appeared to be no adverse impact on ventricular repolarization (no increase in QTcF) and little change in heart rate, QRS duration, and a slight, non-clinically significant, increase in PR interval with the administration of ruxolitinib . 
In an ongoing study in subjects with myelofibrosis (MF) where median time on drug is ~ 15 months (N=154), ruxolitinib  was well tolerated by [CONTACT_488264] (median age 65) 
with advanced  disease.  The DLT was thrombocytopenia.  Initial dose ranging established an 
MTD of [ADDRESS_627193] 5% (8 subjects) of the 154 subjects included in the safety database

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  through December 31, 2009 were restricted to anemia (45 subjects), thrombocytopenia 
(66 subjects), weight increased (11 subjects), diarrhea (10 subjects) and fatigue (8 subjects).  
Both anemia and thrombocytopenia represent JAK-inhibitor induced myelosuppression.  Forty  (40) subjects (26% of study population) had a Grade 3 or Grade 4 decline in platelet count 
during the study (31 Grade 3 events, 9 Grade 4 events).  Subjects with Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia entered the study, in general, with platelet counts less than 200 x 10
9/L, 
although there are exceptions to this trend.  Twenty percent of Grade 3 + [ADDRESS_627194] under half (48%) of Grade 3 + [ADDRESS_627195] subjects, thrombocytopenia was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_488229]/or dose reduction.   
The risk of spontaneous hemorrhage in patients as a result of thrombocytopenia generally does not become manifest until platelet counts fall below 10 to 20 x10
9/L (Slichter  2004).  In Study 
INCB [ZIP_CODE]-251, the lowest platelet counts observed (grade 4 thrombocytopenia events) ranged 
from 6 -22 x 109/L.  There was one patient with associated petechiae and no events of 
hemorrhage in the 9 patients with grade 4 platelet declines.  
There were 2 deaths in study INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 251 where the primary cause of death was related to 
hemorrhage (upper gastric and cerebral hemorrhage).  In the case of upper gastric hemorrhage, 
the patient had emergency surgical repair of a bleeding duodenal ulcer and died of post- operative 
complications.  The PLT count was 447 x 109/L and there was a history of antecedent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_488230] .  The event was considered unrelated to ruxolitinib .  In the case of cerebral 
hemorrhage, the patient had normal PLT count (201 x 109/L), normal coagulation tests, and a 
history of hypertension.  The event was assessed as possibly related to ruxolitinib . 
Other SAEs in study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_627196] been 
examined.   One patient was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a PLT count of  x 109/L and 
ultimately required splenectomy, following which a post-operative hemorrhage was noted in the 
surgical drains.  The patient was discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488231].  Another patient had  epi[INVESTIGATOR_488232] .  No information about PLT counts during the course of the event was  
provided.  A patient suffered from gastrointestinal hemorrhage of unknown source with a PLT count of x 10
9/L.  One patient had hematuria due to  surgery; the PLT count was 
 x 10 /L.  Another patient suffering from splenomegaly developed an intra-abdominal 
hema
toma adjacent to the spleen, with a PLT count of  x 109/L.  One patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488233] a PLT count of  x109/L.  Thus overall hemorrhage events in subjects on 
ruxolitinib  in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_627197] to presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation ( Verstovsek  et al 2010).  
In addition to spleen size reduction, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores and 
symptoms thought to be related to splenomegaly, as well as symptoms related to elevated 
cytokine levels, all show improvement with ruxolitinib  treatment.  As a surrogate marker for 
functional benefit, exercise capacity was assessed with a standardized six minute walk test 
(6MWT).  Ruxolitinib  therapy resulted in improved 6MWT performance after 1, 3 or 6 months 
of therapy.  After an initial small weight loss likely due to resolution of ascites and/or reduction

subjects with low body mass index at entry, ie, cachectic subjects.  
Two Phase [ADDRESS_627198] available therapy in subjects with MF.  In 
both Phase 3 studies, subjects began dosing at 20 mg bid if Baseline platelet count was  
> 200 x 10
9/L and at 15 mg bid for platelet count of 100 x109/L to 200 x 109/L, inclusive.  The 
data was analyzed when the last subject had completed the Week [ADDRESS_627199] 50% of 
subjects remaining in the study had completed the Week 36 visit, and the data base was frozen.  
The primary endpoint was the response rate defined as the percentage of patients achieving a 35% or greater reduction in spleen volume at 24 weeks as measured by [CONTACT_81789], or computerized tomography, comparin g the rates in patients receiving ruxolitinib  or 
placebo.  The primary analysis was recently conducted, and the primary and key secondary 
endpoints were met.  The response rate for spleen volume reduction was 42% in patients 
randomized to ruxolitinib  versu s < 1% in  patients randomized to placebo (p 0.0001).  A 
significantly larger proportion of subjects in the ruxolitinib group achieved a ≥ 50% 
improvement from baseline in the modified MFSAF v2.0 diary total symptom score at Week 24 
compared with the placebo group (45.9% versus 5.3%, respectively, P < 0.0001).  At Week 24, 
the median total symptom scores were 6.6 and 17.6 in the ruxolitinib  and placebo groups, 
respectively.  This represents a median improvement (score decrease) of 6.9 in the ruxolitinib  
group and a worsening (score increase) of 2.0 in the placebo group compared to baseline (Incyte  
confidential data on file).  The safety profile of ruxolitinib  was consistent with previous studies, 
which included reversible thrombocytopenia and anemia .  Platelet  counts declined over the first 
4 weeks of therapy in the ruxolitinib group, however the median count remained in the normal 
range.  Overall, 20 (12.9%) subjects in the INCB018424 group and 2 (1.3%) subjects in the 
placebo group had a new or worsening Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, usually as a single 
occurrence.  As in earlier studies, thrombocytopenia was managed with dose reductions and/or 
interruptions; only [ADDRESS_627200] receiving ruxolitinib discontinued from the study because of thrombocytopenia (Incyte confidential data on file). 
See the IB (Incyte Corporation) for additional details on clinical development of ruxolitinib . 
4.1.5. Interim Analysis Data from Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-258 
In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-258, subjects with platelet counts of 50 to 100 x 10
9/L were enrolled to 
begin admi nistration of ruxolitinib at [ADDRESS_627201] on 
platelet count.  Subjects could then titrate their dose to an appropriate dose that offers benefit (eg, 
symptomatic and/or spleen size improvements) with cautious monitoring to avoid levels of 
thrombocytopenia associated with higher risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.  Ruxolitinib 
administration was interrupted for a platelet count below 25 x 109/L or for Grade  2 or higher 
hemorrhage events. 
The study is currently in the enrollment phase; however, an interim analysis was conducted 
based on a data cutoff when it was expected that at least [ADDRESS_627202] completed 24 weeks of treatment.  At the time of the interim analysis, a total of 50 subjects had enrolled in 
the study.  Of the 50 subjects enrolled, 33 (66.0%) subjects completed the Week 24 visit,

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  8 (16.0%) discontinued prior to Week 24, and 9 (18.0%) subjects remained on study and had not 
yet completed their Week [ADDRESS_627203] subjects were titrated to a ruxolitinib dose of 10 mg BID or higher by [CONTACT_10585] 24 and 20.0% of subjects had a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume at Week 24.  This is consistent with the proportion of subjects in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-351 who had a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume at 
Week 24 who initiated treatment at a dose of 15 mg BID (21.8%), and substantially hig her than 
that observed for placebo-treated subjects in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 351 ( 1.7%).  In addition, 
Mesa  et al ( 2011 ) has shown that a spleen volume reduction of ≥ 10% is associated with 
meaningful improvements in symptoms and other measures of patient- perce ived benefit (Patient 
Global Impression of Change [ PGIC ] and Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form 
[MFSAF v2.0]). 
In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-258, the proportion of ruxolitinib-treated subjects achieving a ≥ 50% 
improvement in TSS at Week 24 was 34%.  This is consistent with the proportion of subjects in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-351 who had a ≥ 50% improvement in TSS at Week 24 who initiated 
treatment at a dose of 15 mg BID (31.4%).  Although this was an unblinded study, the gradual 
time course of improvement is consistent with the gradual dose escalation in the study.  The proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥ 50% improvement in TSS gradually increased over time 
through approximately Week 13, which is consistent with the time that the majority of subjects 
reached [ADDRESS_627204] is related to ruxolitinib titration. 
Subjects also showed improvement based on the PGIC, which is an assessment of overall 
impr ession of treatment benefit.  In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-258 as early as Week 4, 36.6% of 
subjects rated themselves as much improved or very much improved, and at Week 24, 53.7% of 
subjects rated themselves as much improved or very much improved. 
There were no un expected safety signals during this study.  The most common nonhematologic 
adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (28.0%), peripheral edema (26.0%), nausea (24.0%), 
abdominal pain (24.0%), and fatigue (22.0%).  Most nonhematologic AEs were Grade 1 or 2.  
The majority of subjects were able to escalate to a dose of 10 mg BID and maintain platelet counts above 35 x 10
9/L.  Subjects who had dose decreases or interruptions per protocol showed 
recovery of platelet counts.  Based on laboratory values, 8 subjects (16%) had a Grade 4 decreased platelet count (< 25 x 10
9/L).  One subject withdrew from the study because of 
thrombocytopenia.

to 10 mg BID, which provided clinically meaningful reductions in spleen volume and TSS.  
Thrombocytopenia was manageable with dose reduction or dose interruption and mean 
hemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the study.  Although this study is ongoing, data

subjects with MF and lower platelet counts.  
4.2. Trial Rationale  
As noted in the Introduction, the ongoing phase 1/2 study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-251 in MF patients  
examined twice daily dose regimens ranging from 10 mg bid to 50 mg bid, and once daily dosing regimens ranging from 25 mg qd to 200 mg qd; doses of 50 mg bid and 200 mg qd were not well 
tolerated; [ADDRESS_627206] 100  x10
9/L.  However, there is a significant population of MF 
patients who have chronic mild or moderate thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts in the range of 50 x10
9/L to 100 x109/L.  Based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_160142] ( Mesa  et al 2007), 16.5% of all MF 
patients are reported to have PLT counts < 100 x109/L at diagnosis.  According to chart reviews 
of nearly 800 subjects with PMF at the Mayo Clinic, the proportion of subjects with platelets below 100 x10
9 in various r isk categories based on the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring 
system (DIPSS) ranged from 7% for low risk to 32% in intermediate- 2 risk groups ( Gangat  et al 
2011).  While JAK inhibition is clearly, and not unexpectedly, associated with decreasing 
platelet counts, emergent thrombocytopenia is easily detected, and can be managed with dose decreases or brief drug interruptions.  A Phase 1 /2 study with another JAK inhibitor, CYT387, is 
being conducted in subjects with platelet counts as low as 50 x10
9/L (http://clinicaltrials.gov, 
identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Pardanani  et al 2011 ). 
An exploratory analysis of subjects who enrolled in the Phase 1/2 study with platelet counts 
< 150 x109/L who had extended (many weeks) periods of Grade 1 or 2 platelet decline, was 
carried out in order to identify the dose(s) associated with stable platelet counts in the range of 
50 x109/L to 100 x109/L.  Fourteen subjects were identified that fit thes e criteria; 9 of the 
subjects maintained platelet counts between 50,000/µL and 100,000/µL while receiving [ADDRESS_627207] was receiving 10 mg 
PM/5 mg AM, one was receiving 5 mg qd and one was receiving 10 mg qd.  Importantly, 
splenomegaly and/or symptom improvements were maintained in [ADDRESS_627208] that a dose of 5 mg bid, with dose escalation and reductions in response to platelet count response may be 
associated with symptom and spleen size improvements, while allowing platelet counts to be maintained near or above the 50 x10
9/L level.  In the present  study, patients with Grade 1 and 2 
thrombocytopenia, having platelet counts of 50 x109/L to 100 x109/L will be enrolled to begin 
dosing at 5 mg bid, and titrated to an appropriate dose that offers benefit (symptomatic and/or spleen size improvements) balanced with risk (worsening thromboc ytopenia) .   
4.3. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
4.3.1. Potential Risks  
No specific findings in nonclinical repeat dose toxicity studies identify clinical risk s other than 
noting that consequences of immunosuppression may occur.  Hypotension and increases in heart 
rate were noted at a high dose in a cardiovascular preclinical study.  However, these findings 
have not been recapi[INVESTIGATOR_488234] a clinical setting.

Grade [ADDRESS_627211] emerged from the ongoing Phase 1/2 and 
Phase 3  studies are notable, including marked reduction in splenomegaly, improve ment in 
symptoms, performance status and activity level, and reduction in plasma levels of 
inflammatory, prothrombotic and angiogenic cytokines.  In those subjects with prolonged 
exposure to ruxolitinib  (median of 15 months therapy), these positive effects have been 
maintained.   In the present study, it is anticipated that individualized dose optimization from the 
starting level of 5 bid will be associated with reductions in splenomegaly, MF -associated 
symptoms and inflammatory cytokine levels .

5.1. Primary O bjective 
• To determine the effects of ruxolitinib  on spleen volume and symptom burden in 
patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post polycythemia vera -myelofibrosis 
(PPV -MF) and post essential thrombocythemia- myelofibrosis (PET -MF) who have

6.4. Subjects Who Fail to Mee t Screening Criteria 
A subject who has a laboratory test result(s), vital signs, or ECG finding(s) that does not satisfy 
the entrance criteria may have the test(s) repeated once.  These tests may be repeated as soon as 
the investigator believes that the retest result is likely to be within the acceptable range to satisfy the entrance criteria, but must be completed within the 3 week screening phase (Days -28 to -8).  
In this case, the subject will not be required to sign another ICF, and the original subjec t 
identification number will be used.  In the event that the laboratory test(s) cannot be performed within the screening period, or the re- test(s) do not meet the entrance criteria or the subject’s 
medical condition has changed significantly during the scr eening phase so that 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are no longer met, the subject is considered a screen failure, and must 
be withdrawn from the study.  Therefore, sites should consider the testing schedule carefully so 
that any potential retests are accomp lished in the [ADDRESS_627222] is re -screened for participation in the study (except bone marrow biopsy if already 
performed at screening ).  An individual subject may only re- screen once for the study. 
If all screening activities cannot be completed in the screening phase because of an event unrelated to a laboratory finding, ECG finding, or medical history finding, including scheduling 
difficulties at the clinic site, the subject may retain the original subject number and complete the remaining screening activities as soon as possible, within a maximum of 4 2 days ( 6 weeks) from 
the original screening visit date.  A blood draw for hematology and serum chemistry must be 
taken at the time the subject returns for completion of screening activities, and will be used to 
determine eligibility.  

Incyte Corporation    Page [ADDRESS_627223] IGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open label study of ruxolitinib in patients with PMF, PPV- MF, and PET -MF.  The 
study is comprised of 4 phases: 
Screening:  Up to 21 days 
Baseline:  Exactly 7 days  
Core Treatment Phase:  24 weeks   
Extended Treatment Phase:  132 weeks; subjects receiving benefit will continue 
ruxolitinib treatment until Week 1 56  
Follow- up Phase:  All subjects will be followed for safety (eg, reporting of AEs and SAEs) for [ADDRESS_627224] dose of study drug is administered  
Core Treatment Phase : 
During the core treatment phase, t here will be study visits and laboratory-only visits.  Subjects 
will have a regularly scheduled study visit at screening , baseline, Day [ADDRESS_627225] maintained platelet counts > 75 x 10
9/L since the last hematology 
assessment.  Additional, at least  weekly laboratory -only visits to collect hematology lab samples 
will be required if platelet count falls below 3 5 x 109/L; more frequent monitoring is 
recommended if counts fall below 25 x 109/L.  These laboratory visits can occur at the study site 
laboratory, or any local laboratory that can provide the data and appropriate certificates and 
normal laboratory ranges  to the study site for review for subject management in a timely fashion .   
Subjects will have an MRI of the upper and lower abdomen and pelvis to determine the spleen 
volume at baseline and Week  24.  A CT scan will be substituted for subjects who are not 
candidates for MRI, or when MRI is not readily available.  Patients Global Impression of Change 
(PGIC) questionnaire will be completed monthly.  Measurement of spleen length below the left 
costal margin will be measured by [CONTACT_488250].  
Subjects will complete an electronic symptom diary from baseline through the Week 24 visits 
(total of 25 weeks).  Subjects will be trained on the use and care of the diary, and symptom diary 
data will be transmitted automatically each night wirelessly or us ing the diary docking station 
provided to subjects .

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  Extended Treatment Phase:  
Subjects will have a study visit every 12 weeks (eg, Weeks 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 
144, and 156), through Week [ADDRESS_627226]

This is an open label study.  Measurement of spleen volume by [CONTACT_9268] (or C T scan in applicable 
subjects) and determination of thrombocytopenia grade (by [CONTACT_55550]) are objective 
responses. 
7.4. Number of Subjects 
Approximately [ADDRESS_627228].  The Investigator is to notify the IRB/IEC in writing of the 
study’s completion or early termination, and send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor or

CONFIDENTIAL  8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
8.1. Treatment Arms and Study Drug Administration  
All subjects will begin dosing at 5 mg bid ruxolitinib .  Doses should be taken morning and 
evening, approximately 12 hours apart, and without regards to food. 
Dose increases will be allowed for subjects with adequate platelet counts, and mandatory dose 
reductions and interruptions will be requi red for declining platelet counts , declining ANC levels 
or Grade 2 and higher hemorrhage events .  See Section 8.6, Dose Adjustments. 
8.2. Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will bring all bottles of unopened, empty, and opened/partially used study drug with 
them to each study visit.  Investigative site staff will perform a count of returned pi[INVESTIGATOR_488235], and this information will be entered on the eCRF.  Study drug , including all bottles 
of unopened, partially opened or empty bottles cannot be returned to the depot until a monitor 
reviews and verifies all pi[INVESTIGATOR_488236].  
8.3. Randomization and Blinding  
Not applicable, study is open label and single arm . 
8.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
Participation will be for approximately 165 weeks  and 2 days, including the screening and 
baseline phases  (see Section  9.1), core treatment phase (see Section  9.2), extended treatment 
phase (see Section  9.3), and follow-up phase (see Section  9.5). 
8.5. Consideration s for Dose Modifications  
Inhibition of JAKs by a JAK 1/2 inhibitor such as rux olitinib  is associated with 
thrombocytopenia and anemia in subjects with MF.  See the Investigator’s Brochure for 
additional details on hematologic consequences of JAK inhibition.  Platelet count, ANC and 
hemoglobin levels will be assessed on a regular bas is.  Complete blood count (CBC) will be 
monitored more frequently in the first few weeks of the study, and more frequent monitoring 
may be done at the Investigator’s discretion at any time.   
8.6. Dose Adjustment s  
The goal of dose modifications in the study is to permit individual dose optimization for subjects to obtain maximum benefit, while maintaining a stable platelet count >  25 x  10
9/L, and an 
ANC  > 0.5 x 109/L. 
8.6.1. Dose Increases  
Dose increases are optional.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  During the core treatment phase, doses of ruxolitinib may be increased in 5 mg qd increments  
up to a dose of 10 mg bid starting at the Week 4 visit and at subsequent study visits.  Dose 
increases can occur no more frequently than every 4 weeks, and only if: 
• Platelet count was always ≥ 40 x 109/L since the last scheduled study visit 
• Platelet count , if decreased since the last scheduled study visit, i s decreased by [CONTACT_288651] 20% of the platelet count at the last scheduled visit 
• No dose decreases or holds for safety have occurred during the preceding 4- week 
interval  
• ANC > 1.0 x 109/L since the last scheduled study visit. 
• For subjects with prior ≥ Grade 2 hemorrhage events, please see below under 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Restarting with Resolution of Hemorrhage Events 
Doses may not exceed [ADDRESS_627229], in addition, a PGIC score of 3 (minimally improved) to 7 ( very 
much worse) while receiving 10 mg bid.  Such subjects may continue dose escalation to a maximum dose of 15 mg bid.  Note that when a 5 mg qd increment is added, creating a regimen such as 5 mg/[ADDRESS_627230] meets the above dose escalation criteria, or 
per the investigator’s discretion. 
Doses may never exceed [ADDRESS_627231] be held if any of the following occur:  
• Platelet counts decline below 25 x 109/L (dosing must be interrupted immediately.  A 
repeat assessment should be performed as soon as feasible, but follow- up platelet 
values to trigger the restart guidelines from Section  8.6.[ADDRESS_627232] 3 days later).   
• ANC  declines to  < 0.5 x 109/L.   
• Ongoing Grade [ADDRESS_627233] be reduced  for a confirmed  platelet count < 35 x 109/L as follows:  
• An observation of platelets between 25 x 109/L and 35 x 109/L should trigger a repeat 
laboratory measurement of platelet counts.  Dosing need not be adjusted until the 
results of the confirmatory test are known. 
• The reduction will be based on the current dose, and on the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_488237] < 35 x 10
9/L level  and are ≥ 25 x 109/L (see Table 2 ).  
• Subject s who have implemented a dose reduction because of platelets falling below 
35 x 109/L DO NOT nee d to further decrease their dose provided the platelet count 
remains ≥  25 x 109/L even if they remain below 35 x 109/L.   
• Mandatory dose reductions are summarized in Table  2.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Restarting or Re-Escalating with Improving Platelet Counts 
For subjects who had never  previously increased their dose above [ADDRESS_627235] a platelet 
count decline necessitating drug hold, r uxolitinib  may be restarted  as follows:  
• Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the platelet count has risen above 
35 x 109/L. 
• After no less than [ADDRESS_627236] 3 days apart,  of ≥ 40 x 109/L, the dose may be increased to 5  mg bid.  
No further increase in dose is allowed. 
• A second platelet decline below 25 x 109/L will necessitate a second drug hold.  
Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the platelet count has risen above 
35 x 109/L.  No further increase in dose is allowed. 
− The subject may remain on 5 mg qd provided platelet counts remain ≥ 25 x 109/L. 

Incyte Corporation    Page [ADDRESS_627237] a 
platelet count decline necessitat ing drug hold, ruxolitinib may be restarted as follows: 
• Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the platelet count has risen above 
35 x 109/L. 
• After no less than [ADDRESS_627238] 3  days apart,  of ≥ 40 x 109/L, the dose may be increased to a dose up 
to the highest dose that previously qualified for further dose increases according to 
Section 8.6.1 ( Dose Increases ).  For example, if a subject tolerated 10 m g bid 
ruxolitinib and qualified for a dose increase, but the platelet counts fell sharply at the 
increased dose of 10 mg AM/15 mg PM, and drug was halted; the highest dose this 
subject may now use is the previously tolerated dose of 10 mg bid.   
• A second platelet decline below 25 x  109/L will necessitate a second drug hold.  
Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the platelet count has risen above 
35 x 109/L, and may be increased to 5 mg bid after ≥ [ADDRESS_627239] 2 
consecutive measures above 40 x 109/L at least 3 days apart .  No further increase in 
dose is allowed. 
For subjects who previously decreased dose, but never held dose , dose increases using the dose 
increase guidelines in Section 8.6.1 may be implemented  once platelet counts are ≥ 40 x 109/L on 
at least [ADDRESS_627240] began.    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Use of Platelet Transfusions  
Platelet transfusions may be used at Investigator’s discretion to treat thrombocytopenia.  Dosing  
restart or increase decisions may not be based on platelet count values observed within 7 days of 
a platelet transfusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Restarting or Re-Escalating with Improving ANC 
For subjects who had never  previously increased their dose above [ADDRESS_627241] an ANC 
decline necessitating drug hold, ruxolitinib may be restarted as follows:   
• The dose may be restarted at 5 mg qd when ANC levels are > 0.75 x 109/L.   
• After no less than [ADDRESS_627242] 2 consecutive ANC levels 
≥ 1.0 x 109/L at least 3 days apart, the dose may be increased to 5 mg bid.  No further 
increase in dose is allowed.  
• A second ANC decline below 0.5 x 109/L will necessitate a second drug hold.  
Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the ANC is > 0.75 x 109/L.  No f urther 
increase in dose is allowed  

Incyte Corporation    Page [ADDRESS_627243] an 
ANC decline necessitating drug hold, ruxolitinib may be restarted as follows:   
− The dose may be restarted at 5 mg qd when ANC lev els are > 0.75 x 109/L.   
− After no less than [ADDRESS_627244] 2 consecutive ANC 
levels  ≥ 1.0 x 109/L at least [ADDRESS_627245] dose that previously qualified for further dose incre ases according 
to Section 8.6.1 ( Dose Increases ). 
− A second ANC decline below 0.5 x 109/L will necessitate a second drug hold.  
Ruxolitinib may be restarted at 5 mg qd when the ANC is > 0.75 x 109/L, and 
may be in creased to [ADDRESS_627246] 3  days 
apart of ≥ 1.0 x 109/L.  No further increase in dose is allowed. 
In order to provide sufficient data to make the dose restart decisions, it is recommended that 
hematology parameters be obtained at least 2 times weekly for platelet count < 25  x 109/L, or for 
ANC levels < 0.5 x 109/L.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Restarting with Resolution of Hemorrhage Event 
• For Grade 2 hemorrhage events of any causality , dosing may be restarted at the prior 
level once the event is resolved to Grade 0, and its underlying cause has been 
alleviated or resolved, as long as platelet count and ANC do not preclude a restart at 
that dose level .  Restart of dosing after a second Grade 2 hemorrhage event may only 
occur following discussion with the sponsor taking into account causality, resolution of the bleeding and underlying etiology and likelihood of recurrence, in order to reach 
agreement that the potential benefits of a restart at an appropriate dose outweigh risks 
of recurrent hemorrhage.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage events of any causality,  dosing may only be restarted 
provided: platelet count and ANC do not preclude a restart, the event has resolved to 
Grade 0, and the underlying cause has been alleviated or resolved, and following  
discussion with the sponsor taking into account causality, resolution of the bleeding 
and underlying etiology and likelihood of recurrence, in order to reach agreement that 
the potential benefits of a restart at an appropriate dose outweigh risks of recurrent hemorrhage.  Further dose escalations in these subjects will also require discussion 
with the sponsor. 
Note that if more than one finding (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or hemorrhage) was the cause for the dose reduction or interruption, improvements in all parameters must be considered in restarting ruxolitinib and the lowest calculated dose must be used.     
8.6.4. Possible Changes in Study Conduct Because of Frequent Hemorrhage  or 
Thrombocytopenia Events  
Events of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and > Grade 2 hemorrhage will be reported by [CONTACT_488270] a continuous basis, and this data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_488271].  A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will also review this data.  The protocol may be modified 
on the basis of this ongoing safety monitoring.  See Section 11.7, Data  Safety Monitoring for a

CONFIDENTIAL  complete description of study safety monitoring for Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and > Grade [ADDRESS_627247]. 
8.6.5. Management of Anemia 
Subjects with a hemoglobin level < 6.5 g /dL must receive red cell transfusion(s) t o maintain a 
level of ≥ 6.5 g/dL. Erythropoietin (EPO) use is discouraged, but is permitted at the 
Investigator’s discretion, although use is not permitted in lieu of transfusions for hemoglobin 
below 6.5 g/dL. 
8.6.6. Optional Dose Tapering Strategy 
In ongoing cl inical studies with ruxolitinib , exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary disease 
and return of MF symptoms has been occasionally observed in subjects after drug 
discontinuation.  When a decision is made to permanently discontinue ruxolitinib  therapy for  
reasons other than low platelet counts or ANC levels, tapering of ruxolitinib  dosage may be 
considered, based on evaluation of the condition of the subject, current dose regimen and the clinical judgment of the investigator.  Doses of ruxolitinib  may be v ery slowly lowered until the 
subject is completely off drug.  If medically indicated, doses of ruxolitinib  may be temporarily 
restarted after they have been discontinued.  If considered to be medically necessary, the investigator may use any treatment to manage withdrawal from ruxolitinib  including, but not 
limited to, the management of events which may be secondary to discontinuation, and 
interruption or reduction of dose administered of ruxolitinib .  Short-term courses of high-dose 
corticosteroids, equivalent to doses of > 10 mg/day of prednisolone have been used to moderate the withdrawal of ruxolitinib  and may be considered as part of a tapering strategy.  
Corticosteroids may be started prior to, or concurrent with, ruxolitinib  tapering in anticipation o f 
the possibility of occurrence of withdrawal symptoms.  When a decision has been made to discontinue the subject with utilization of a tapering strategy, regardless of the use of concomitant medications, safety data will continue to be assessed in accordance with the 
protocol.  An end of study and subsequent follow-up visit must be scheduled.  
8.6.7. Procedures  for Interruption  of Study Medication  
In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of 
adverse experiences that  may have an unclear relationship to study drug .  Except in cases of 
emergency, it is recommended that the Investigator consult with the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or other representative of the Sponsor) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons ot her 
than protocol mandated medication holds for platelet or ANC  counts.  Additionally, the 
Investigator must notify the sponsor’s medical monitor and study project manager via email 
before restarting study drug that w as temporarily discontinued for an adve rse experience.  
8.6.8. Procedures  for Permanent  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
In the event that any subject discontinues the study drug and subsequently withdraws from the 
study prior to completion, regardless of reason, reasonable efforts should be made to have the 
subject return for an early termination visit and have the end -of-treatment procedures completed 
as described in Section  9.4. 

Incyte Corporation    Page [ADDRESS_627248] may be withdrawn from the study, if, in the investigator’s expert medical judgment, 
the subject is non- compliant with the study requirements.  Subjects may be withdrawn at the 
discretion of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the investigator.   Subjects must  be discontinued from study drug and withdrawn from the study for the following 
reasons:  
• In the Investigator’s medical judgment, further participation would be injurious to the 
subject’s health or well -being  
• Positive urine pregnancy test, confirmed by [CONTACT_488272] (serum human chorionic gonadotropin) test results 
• Consent is withdrawn 
• Termination of th e study by [CONTACT_456], local health authority, or IRB/IEC. 
• The subject requires splenic irradiation. 
• The subjects exhibits leukemic transformation (as evidenced by [CONTACT_488273] 20%, or peripheral blast counts of at least 20% lastin g at least 
8 consecutive weeks ). 
• The subject cannot maintain platelet counts of at least 25 x 10
9/L over a given [ADDRESS_627249] possible dose of 5 mg qd. 
• The subject experiences 3 or more Grade 2  hemorrhage events . Note withdrawal after 
a second Grade 2 hemorrhage event may occur following the sponsor and investigator 
review of pertinent data.  
• The subject experiences 2 hemorrhage events of ≥ Grade 2, at least one of which is 
Grade [ADDRESS_627250] is withdrawn from the study:   
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.   
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s medical record and 
eCRF.   
• The end -of-treatment/early termination visit should be performed. 

Incyte Corporation    Page 40 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  • All subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up evaluation or 
until study drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline or are deemed 
irreversible, whichever is longer.  
8.8. Concomitant Medications and Measures  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the CRF.  Any prior medication 
received up to [ADDRESS_627251]’s medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the CRF.   
8.9. Restricted and Prohibited Medications  and Measures  
8.9.1. Restricted Medications  and Measures  
The following medications have restrictions on use or doses that may be used during this study: 
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_488239] 81 mg per  day is not permitted.  Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(81 mg/day or less) is permitted. Acetaminophen and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory 
agents (eg, ibuprofen, NSAIDs ) may be used at over -the-counter doses.  Subjects 
receiving over -the-counter NSAIDs should not exceed the recommended dose and 
should be encouraged to use gastroprotective agents (antacids, H2 antagonists, or proton pump inhibitors).   
• Inducers of CYP3A4 ( Appendix 8) may be used with caution, and investigators 
should seek other options if available. 
• Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( Appendix 8) may be used with caution.  Differences in 
individual sensitivity and variation in potency of inhibition of various CYP enzymes 
may re sult in the need for a reduced dose of ruxolitinib during a period of 
concomitant medication use.  If required for safety, the study drug dose may be 
reduced from bid to qd in these circumstances.  The sponsor’s medical monitor may 
be consulted for advice when using these agents. 
• Use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone or telithromycin, voriconazole or posaconazole, see Appendix 8) and use 
of fluconazole should be avoided, and if used, a 50% ruxolitinib dose reduction is 
recommended along with frequent platelet monitoring during the period of co-
administration.  Based on the low overall bioavailability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063], there are no restrictions on topi[INVESTIGATOR_261278]. 
• Hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonists (eg, erythropoietin) may be used at investigator’s discretion  in certain circumstances as described in Section  8.6.5, 
Management of Anemia.   
• If concomitant administration of an anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication is indicated, 
caution and enhanced monitoring is required.  History of thrombocytopenia, and any 
concurrent ruxolitinib-related thrombocytopenia should be a factor in the choice of 
anticoagulant and dose.  Medications that interfere with coagulation or inhibit platelet 
function are listed in Appendix 9. 

Incyte Corporation    Page 41 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 A mendment 2  09 AUG 2013  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.9.2. Prohibited Medications  and Measures  
• Any prior or concomitant use of another JAK inhibit or. 
• Any investigational medication other than the study drugs.  Use of such medications 
within [ADDRESS_627252] dose of study 
drug and during the study through the follow-up visit is prohibited.   
• Systemic co rticosteroid doses greater than the equivalent of 10 mg prednisolone per 
day are not permitted, unless use is part of a ruxolitinib dose tapering strategy (see 
Section  8.6.6 Optional Dose Tapering Strategy).  
• Romiplostim or eltrombopag are not permitted beginning with the baseline visit (Day -7) through the final dose of ruxolitinib .  
• St John’s  Wort  and rifampin are not permitted at any time during participation in the 
study.  
• Use of h ydroxyurea, interferon, thalidomide, busulfan, lenalidomide, anagrelide, or 
any investigational medication used to treat MF is not permitted at any time 
beginning on Day -14 up until the time that ruxolitinib  therapy is permanently 
discontinued.  Use of androgens to treat anemia is perm itted.

a For blood samples drawn at baseline, Day 1, Week 4, and Week 24, subjects should arrive in a fasted state after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours or since midnight.  Lack of 
fasting will be noted on the eCRF page regarding blood sampling, but this will not constitute a protocol violation or deviation.  
b Extended treatment phase visits will occur at Weeks 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144 (eg, every 12 weeks).  Subjects will have laboratory -only visits to collect 
hematology samples 6 weeks after the Week 24 visit (eg, Week 30), then after each extended treatment phase visit (eg, Weeks 42, 54, 66, 78, 90, 102, 114, 126, 138, and 150).  
Additional hematology a ssessments will be required if the subject has a dose modification or as clinically indicated.  
c Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry should be taken as close as possible to Day 1.  If, on the baseline assessment of serum chemistry and hematology 
parameters, an exclusionary value is observed, the test may be repeated once, no more than [ADDRESS_627262] maintained platelet counts > 75 x 10

CONFIDENTIAL  9.1. Screening + Baseline Phase  
The screening + baseline phase may not exceed 28 days (4 weeks), with the exception of del ays 
caused by [CONTACT_488275], see Section  6.4).  The length of the screening visit for a given 
individual subject will be determined by [CONTACT_488276] [ADDRESS_627263] baseline evaluation (ie, must discontinue prior MF therapy by  
[CONTACT_2006] -14).  Subjects who are not currently taking any drugs to treat their MF may complete all 
screening activities in a few days, and proceed to the baseline phase. 
9.1.1. Screening  Assessments  
Prospective participants will be scheduled for a screening visit by [CONTACT_6624].  A subject number 
will be assigned by [CONTACT_488277] (IVRS).  All procedures for screening 
and baseline must be completed within the 21-day screening + 7 -day baseline phase, except as 
noted in Section 6.4.  The following procedures will be performed: 
Obtain informed consent before any study specific procedures are conducted.  
• A subject number will be assigned by [CONTACT_54537].  
• Review of eligibility criteria including discussion of methods known to be at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy ( Appendix 3).  
• Review of medical history, prior medication history and prior history of medications 
used to treat MF (see Section 8.8, Prior and Concomitant Medications).  Record 
medication histories on the eCRF. 
• Review of transfusion history.  Complete transfusion history should be recorded 
where possible, but must include at least the 12 weeks prior to Screening.  The history 
should be recorded on the eCRF. 
• Confirm that all drugs, used to treat underlying MF disease will be  discontinued by 
[CONTACT_2006] -14, so that at least [ADDRESS_627264] dose of 
medication(s) used to treat MF and the baseline MRI (or CT scan in applicable subjects)  and diary dispensing.  Prior MF medication(s) may be discontinued in one 
of the 3 following ways: 
1. Prior to and independent of considerin g enrollment in this study (prior to signing 
the ICF).  These subjects can proceed to the baseline visit as soon as screening 
activities are completed, [ADDRESS_627265] 7 days for drug 
discontinuation prior to baseline (total screening time elapsed = 21 days).

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  • NOTE:  The timing for the screening hematology blood samples should take 
the possible discontinuation of a prior MF therapy into account, in order to 
allow time for possible recovery of low platelet count values caused by [CONTACT_488278].  It is suggested that the hematology blood sample be taken 
around Day -8, eg, at the end of the possible wash-out period for prior 
therapy.  
• Complete Screening Symptom Form.  
• Record adverse events.  
• Comprehensive physical examination including body weight and height. 
• Measurement of spleen length below the costal margin by [CONTACT_23302].  
• Vital signs  
• ECOG status assessment.  
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).  
• Bone marrow biopsy for confirmation of MF diagnosis.  NOTE:  a bone marrow 
biopsy at screening or baseline is required if  a biopsy w as not previously obtained 
within the prior 2 months or if all data from the samples are not available for review 
by [CONTACT_488279] [ZIP_CODE]-258.  The prior data will need to be 
entered into the eCRF for this study, with explanation as to the origin of the data (date of biopsy).   
• Blood sampling  for the following laboratory tests (see Appendix 4):  
− Serum chemistry tests  
− Hematology  
− Coagulation tests  
− Serum pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only)  
− Serolog y tests for HIV and hepatitis  
9.1.2. Baseline Assessments 
The results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to determine if the subject continues to meet the eligibility requirements as specified in the protocol.  Subjects who have signed the ICF and meet all the entry criteria (see Section 6) may be enrolled in the study, and 
will be contact[CONTACT_488280]. Subjects will be reminded by 
[CONTACT_488281] a rrive for the baseline visit where blood draws for lipid profile will be 
taken after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_627266] baseline assessment 
(Day -7).  The MRI (or CT scan in applicable subjects) should be conducted on the first or 
second day to allow ample time for the central imaging laboratory to verify scan quality.  Blood 
samples for hematology and serum chemistry should be taken as close as possible to Day 1, but 
in ample time for the results to be returned from the central  laboratory (or in the case of 

Incyte Corporation   Page 47 of 92

chemistry and hematology parameters, an exclusionary value is observed, the test may be 
repeated once, no more than [ADDRESS_627267] observation.   
The following procedures will be performed during the 7- day baseline period and prior to 
enrollment for all subjects:  
• Confirm that the subject continues to m eet all eligibility criteria.  
• Update medication history and concurrent medications; confirm that all drugs used to 
treat underlying MF disease have been discontinued for at least 7 days.   
• Update transfusion history status. 
• Record adverse events . 
• Conduct a comprehensive physical examination.  
• Measurement of spleen length below the costal margin by [CONTACT_23302].  
• Vital signs.  
• ECOG status assessment.  
  
• Bone marrow biopsy (only if not performed at screening and no prior biopsy data are 
available to the Investigator for review ). 
• Blood sampling  for the following laboratory tests (see Appendix 4): 
− Serum chemistry tests  
− Hematology  
− Coagulation tests  
− Lipid panel 
  
  
  
• MRI of the upper and lower abdomen and pelvis will be performed, to assess spleen volumes.  CT scan may be performed if subject is not a candidate for MRI, or if MRI is 
not readily available.  The MRI (or CT scan in applicable subjects) should be performed 
on the first or second day of the baseline period (ie, Day -7 or Day -6), and the site 
radiologist should send the scan to the central imaging laboratory that same day.  Scans 
can be sent by [CONTACT_488282] (ftp) or by [CONTACT_488283] a CD -ROM by [CONTACT_094] -paid 
mailer provided for the study.  The MRI central reader will assess the quality of the scan and will send a notice of acceptance via FAX and/or email to the site within [ADDRESS_627268] can begin dosing.  If a notice of “non- acceptance” is received by [CONTACT_1275], the subject must have a repeat MRI (or CT in applicable subjects) prior to 

Incyte Corporation   Page [ADDRESS_627269]’s abdominal anatomy.   
− NOTE: the first MRI may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_627270] dose of study drug.  
− In the case where the MRI is delayed for scheduling or other issues, or a repeat 
MRI is required because of scan quality issues, a repeat hematology assessment 
should be completed 2 to 7 days prior to the planned Day 1. 
• Distribution of modified MFSAF v2.[ADDRESS_627271] the device on the docking station (also 
provided), for automatic data t ransmittal each night after completing the questions.  
Subjects will be instructed to leave the device in the docking station when not answering 
the questions so that the unit remains fully charged.  Subjects will receive training on the 
device by [CONTACT_488284].  Subjects will bring the device with 
them to Study Visits on Day  1, Week 4, Week 8, Week [ADDRESS_627272] at these same visits for continued use each night.  Subjects 
will return the device and the docking station for the final time at the Week 24 Visit, so 
that all data can be archived.  All subjects will complete the diary through Week 24.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. End of Treatment (± 5 days)  
If a decision is made that the subject will withdraw from study participation, the end-of-
treatment visit (EOT) should be conducted.  If the EOT  Visi t coincides with a regular study visit, 
the end -of-treatment evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, the data should be 
entered in the end of treatment visit in the CRF.  The subject should be encouraged to return for 
the follow-up visit.  The following will be performed: 
• Review concomitant medications.  
• Review transfusion status. 
• Record adverse events . 
• Perform complete physical examination.  
• Measurement of spleen length below the costal margin by [CONTACT_23302].

9.5. Follow -Up Phase  
The follow-up phase is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, 
which should occur 30 to 37 days following the EOT visit (or following the last dose of study 
drug if the EOT visit was no t performed).  If no follow -up visit is performed the follow-up phase 
is considered to be [ADDRESS_627284] return for the follow-up visit, and report any AEs that may occur dur ing this 
phase.  The following procedures will be performed: 
• Review concomitant medications.  
• Record adverse events .

9.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits for laboratory assessments may be conducted anytime at the Investigator’s 
discretion.   
 
10. STUDY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES  
10.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening , 
after informed consent has been signed.  Height and body weight measurements will be performed ; body mass index will be calculated automatically in the eCRF.  Complete transfusion 
history should be collected at the screening visit where possible, but must include at least 
[ADDRESS_627285] the information in the subjects chart (site may use a blank reminder card for the specified visit). 
10.3. Safety Assessments  
10.3.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events wi ll be monitored from the time the subject  signs informed consent.  Subjects 
will be instructed to report all AEs during the study and subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjec ts will be 
asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling?"   All AEs (serious and 
nonserious) must be recorded on the source documents and case report forms regardless of the 

Incyte Corporation   Page 57 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  assumption of a causal relationship with the study drug .  The d efinition, reporting, and recording 
requirements for AEs are described in Section 11. 
10.3.2. Physical Examination 
A comprehensive physical examination will be performed at the times indicated on the Table of 
Assessments ( Section 9).  The comprehensive physical examination will include the following 
organ or body system assessments: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; 
cardiovascular; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities, lymph nodes, assessment for edema and/or 
ascites, measurement of weight and a brief neurological exam.  Height will be measured at the Screening visit only.  Physical exams must be performed by a medically qualified individual 
such as a licensed physician, Physician’s Assistant  or advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners as 
local law permits.  Clinically significant findings will be recorded in the eCRF .   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Targeted Physical  
A targeted physical examination will be a symptom- directed evaluation.   The targeted physical 
examination will include assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_488286], AE, or other findings as determined by [CONTACT_18370].  The targeted physical examination should also include an assessment of the subject’s weight.  
10.3.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) will be collected on the 
days and times noted in the Table of Assessments ( Section  9).  Vital signs will be taken with the 
subject in the sitting position after [ADDRESS_627286].  Vital signs will be recorded in the eCRF . 
10.3.4. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be collected on the days and times noted in the Table of Assessments ( Section 9) and recorded in the eCRF . 
10.3.5. Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
All [ADDRESS_627287]. 
The screening ECG will be interpreted by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or another appropriately trained 
individual at the site.  If ECG abnormalities that are clinically meaningful are present, they will 
be recorded on the eCRF.  Normal ECG findings or non- clinically meaningful abnormal ECG 
findings will not be recorded on the eCRF , other than data indicating the ECG was performed .  
Twelve- lead ECGs may be conducted during the study at the Investigator’s discretion.  ECGs 
that are identified as abnormal and clinically meaningful compared to the Screening assessment  
should be reported as AEs.  For such AEs, the findings of the abnormal ECGs and the 
corresponding baseline ECG findings must be reported in the eCRF, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_488241].  For Sponsor:

chemistry  and hematology.  Appendix [ADDRESS_627289] of laboratory tests that will be 
performed.  Please refer to the laboratory manual for further details and specifications for sample 
handling, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology assessments, including complete blood count (CBC) with manual differential will 
be performed by [CONTACT_488287] , and may be performed at this same 
laboratory, or at a local laboratory identified by [CONTACT_488288] -only 
visits as outlined in Table  4, and any other t ime additional hematology monitoring is deemed 
necessary.  The investigator is responsible for obtaining the data from such local laboratories, as 
well as the normal lab ranges used by [CONTACT_64383].  A standardized local laboratory range will 
be used in analysis of hematology lab data. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemistry  
Chemistry labs will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy and Fertility Testing 
Blood will be collected during screening  for females of childbearing potential to conduct a 
pregnancy test.  Females of non-childbearing potential are defined as women who are: 
• At least 55 years of age with history of amenorrhea for 1 year    OR 
• Are surgically sterile for at least [ADDRESS_627290].  Pregnancy status will be documented at each visit on the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serology 
Serology l abs will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  
10.4. Efficacy Assessments  
• Imaging.  The primary measure of spleen size will be by [CONTACT_9268] (or CT scan in 
applicable subjects).  MRI of the upper and lower abdomen and pelvis will be 
performed at baseline and Week  24.  MRI will be performed with a body coil because 
the objective is to measure organ volume, not to find very sm all lesions.  MRIs will 
be read initially by [CONTACT_488289], and send all 
scans (MRI or CT) to the central imaging laboratory the same day, if at all possible.  
The scans from an individual subject will be read by a central reader.  Spleen and 
liver volume will be obtained by [CONTACT_488290] [ADDRESS_627291] is not a 
candidate for MRI (because of the presence of metal clips in the body, or because of claustrophobia, for example), or if MRI is not readily available.  CT scans will be 
similarly processed by [CONTACT_488291].  Procedure 
specific training for scanning and image capture will be provided by [CONTACT_310840]. NOTE:  The same method (MRI versus CT) must be used for both visits for a given 
subject unless a new contraindication to the use of MRI (eg, pacemaker insertion) occurs.   
• Spleen length.  Spleen length will be assessed by [CONTACT_488292] 3.  Investigators will be provided with a soft centimeter ruler so that palpabl e 
spleen length is measured in centimeters and not in finger breadths.  The edge of the spleen shall be determined by [CONTACT_23302], and measured in centimeters, using a soft ruler, from the costal margin to the point of greatest splenic protrusion.  Spleen le ngth 
must be recorded on the eCRF. 
10.5. Symptom and Quality of Life Assessments  
• Symptom Diary.  Symptoms of MF will be assessed using a symptom diary 
(modified MFSAF v2.0 diary).  Subjects will be issued a hand-held device on which 
to record answers to queries regarding MF symptoms.  Symptoms assessed will 
include filling up quickly/early satiety, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, 
inactivity, night sweats, itching, and bone/muscle pain.  The modified MFSAF v2.0 
diary will be completed by [CONTACT_488293] - 7 (first day of 
Baseline), and continuing to the Week 24 visit (25 weeks total).  Subjects will bring 
the device to the study site at Study visits on Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and 
Week 16, so that the device charging can be verified,  and to download accumulated 
data.  NOTE:  subjects who will have overnight stays associated with their Study 
Visit must also bring their docking station so that their device can be fully charged at 
all times, and so they can complete the evening diary ent ries.  The device will then be 
returned to the subject at these same visits for continued use each night.  The subject 
will return the device and the docking station for the final time at the Week [ADDRESS_627292] ions for the administration of the 
modified MFSAF v2.0 diary will be provided in a Reference Manual.  Spanish translations of the modified MFSAF v2.0 diary will be available.   
• Patient Global Impression of Change will be administered at each visit beginning with Week 4, and consists of a single question to which the subject responds with 
answer on a scale of [ADDRESS_627293] agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy or 
fathering a child  in order to participate in the study ( Appendix 3). 
10.9.2. IVRS /IWRS  Procedures  
An IVRS system will be used to assign subject numbers and to dispense study drug.  Procedures 
to be followed will be provided in an IVRS manual. 
10.9.3. Study Drug  Administration  
Subjects will take their dose of ruxolitinib  morning and evening, approximately [ADDRESS_627294] the assigned bottles from their stock that c orrespond to the number provided 
by [CONTACT_488294].  The investigator will enter the bottle numbers in the 
eCRF.  At subsequent medication dispensing visits, the investigator or designee will follow the 
same procedures as described above.  Full details will be provided in the IVRS manual. 
10.9.5. Assessment  of Study Drug  Compliance  
Compliance will be calculated by [CONTACT_13099] r based on the drug accountability documented by 
[CONTACT_488295]/designee (tablet counts).  The objective is 100% 
compliance and investigators and their staff should evaluate compliance at each visit, and take 
appropriate steps to optimize compliance.  For the purpose of subgroup analyses, subjects with at 
least 80% compliance over the total duration of dosing from the first day of dosing to the analysis of the study will be considered to be compliant. 
10.9.6. Distribution of  Subject Rem inder Cards and Diaries  
Subjects will be provided with subject reminder cards at each visit.  The subject reminder cards 
will indicate the date/time of the next visit, and will also remind the subject when they should not take their morning dose of study drug, and when they should arrive for the visit after an 
overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_627295] meal (certain visits only).

CONFIDENTIAL  11. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definitions and Reporting  
An Adverse Event (AE) for the purposes of this protocol is defined as the appearance of (or 
worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that 
occur after a subject’s signed informed consent has been obtained.  Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs 
or symptoms, are considered clinically meaningful , require therapy (eg , hematologic abnormality 
that requires transfusion), or require changes in study drug(s).  
Adverse Events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in the Adverse 
Events section of the CRF. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the medical history section of the CRF.  Adverse Event  monitoring should 
be continued through the follow-up visit or for at least [ADDRESS_627296] dose of study 
treatment, whichever comes later .  Adverse Events (including lab abnormalities that constitute 
AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying 
signs and symptoms.  When a clear diag nosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should 
be reported as a separate AE. 
Adverse Events  will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v 4.03.  If CTC AE grading is not used for a study, the severity of mild, 
moderate, severe, and life-threatening, or G rades 1 - 4, will be used. CTCAE G rade 5 (death) 
will not be used in this study; rather, information about deaths will be collected as an outcome of the event.  The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject 
during the screening process after signing informed consent and at each visit during the study.  
Adverse Events  may also  be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_488296], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other 
assessments.  As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -4) 
• Reasonable possibility that AE is related to the study treatment: (no, yes)  
• Reasonable possibility that AE is related to a study procedure: (no, yes) 
• Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam 
• Action taken with respect to study medication  (none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)  
• Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown) 
• Whether it is serious, as per Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) definition provided in 
Section 11.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting requirements, see Section 11.3.2. 

Incyte Corporation   Page 64 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If a concomitant  medication or non- drug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded on the AE CRF  as well as the Prior/ Concomitant 
medications  CRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment sh ould be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study medication , the interventions required 
to treat it, and the outcome.  
Disease progression should not be regarded or reported as an AE itself , unless it is associated 
with a separate AE. 
11.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
11.2.1. Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (are considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, re quire concomitant therapy or require changes 
in study treatment), should be recorded on the AE CRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather 
than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory 
abnormalities that meet the cr iteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to 
normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal laboratory or 
test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to 
separately record the lab/test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) event, as per CTCAE , does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it 
meets  the definition of serious, as defined below , and/or as per investigator’s discretion.  A dose 
hold or medication for the lab abnormality may be required by [CONTACT_488297] 8.[ADDRESS_627297]  abnormality as a SAE . 
11.3. Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1. Definitions  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as one of the following:  
• Is fatal or life -threatening (ie, immediate risk of dying)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is clinically meaningful , (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or 
require s potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above).  Cons idered meaningful by [CONTACT_488298], be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be 
considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  

Incyte Corporation   Page 65 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488242] :  
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition.  
− Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened si nce signing the  informed 
consent. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s general condition . 
− Any SAEs tha t are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the 
SAE is a primary outcome measure, and whether there has been a clear agreement 
with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is 
collected elsewhere. 
11.3.2. Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
subject has signed  the informed consent form ( ICF) and until ( at least ) the Follow -up Visit or 
[ADDRESS_627298] has stopped study treatment  (whichever comes later)  must be reported 
to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_627299] been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying 
medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form.   The I nvestigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each speci fic 
study medication  (if there is more than 1), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send 
the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] 24 hours to the Sponsor (or designee).  The investigator must assess if there is a Reasonable possibility that the SAE is r elated to the study 
treatment: no (unrelated) , yes (related ). 
SAEs related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant medications/drug delivery systems are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package 
insert.  

Incyte Corporation   Page 66 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  The telephone and facsimile  number of the Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_122473], specific to the study , are 
listed in the investigator folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form 
and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report form documentation at the study 
site. 
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was 
sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report.  Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression 
of the original event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated , and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation or if 
study medication was interrupted or discontinued. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure for the study medication 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Sponsor’s study drug, a Sponsor’s associate 
may urgently require further information from the Investigator for reporting to Health 
Authorities .   
The Sponsor may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all Investigators 
involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.  If the study is open- label, 
no special unblinding procedures are needed for exceptional circumstances or medical emergencies.  
11.4. Emergency Unbl inding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable, study is open label. 
11.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE, unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_488243] a contraceptive medication or method.  
The procedures that will be followed based on whether a pregnancy is confirmed by a positive serum or urine test result are listed below:  
• Investigator and subject must notify each other immediately 
• Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately  
• Study medication must be discontinued immediately  
• Subject must be withdrawn from the study 
• Perform  the required End-of- treatment Visit evaluations  
• Investigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow -up report 
forms to the Sponsor 

Incyte Corporation   Page 67 of 92 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  • A ser um pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine test result.  (The 
serum test should be performed at the investigative site to ensure the test will be 
performed promptly and the result available immediately for review.) 
If a negative serum test do es not confirm the urine test result, then: 
• The Investigator will use his/her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the 
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine if it is in the subject’s best interest to 
resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject during maternal or paternal 
exposures to study medication  must be reported within [ADDRESS_627300] -feeding are collected f or regulatory reporting and

11.6. Warnings and Precautions  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study protocol indicated that special 
warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided Investigator 
Brochure.  Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in 
the form of Investigator Notifications  (INs) .  This information will be included in the subject 
informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed.  
11.7. Data Safety Monitoring  
11.7.1. Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed.  It will consist of qualified individuals who are not involved with the conduct of the study.  The establishment, composition, roles, duties and responsibilities of the DMC will be addressed in an approved DMC charter.  
The timing of data review by [CONTACT_488299], but at a minimum, will 
include review of safety data with an emphasis  on events of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage 
at least [ADDRESS_627301] been enrolled into the study. 
11.7.2. Reporting of Grade 4 Thrombocytopenia Events and >  Grade 2 Hemorrhage 
Events During the Study  
The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in a myelofibrosis patient 
population with platelet counts of 50 to 100 x 10
9/L.  As these patients are potentially at higher 
risk for greater degrees of thrombocytopenia and bleeding, events of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  and > Grade [ADDRESS_627302] one dose of study drug up to the 
follow-up visit (or at least [ADDRESS_627303] dose of study drug is taken) must be reported.  
The notification form (supplied by [CONTACT_3211]) will require the site to provide information regarding 
dosing history, platelet count, event description and any other information pertinent to the event.   
11.7.3. Safety Reviews  
As ruxolitinib has been studied extensively in the myelofibrosis population in P hase II and III 
trials, its safety profile is generally well characterized in patients with platelet counts above 
100 x 10
9/L.  Because this trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in a 
myelofibrosis patient population with platelet counts of 50 to 100 x 109/L, there will be a review 
of safety with an emphasis on events of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage at regularly scheduled intervals corresponding to when:

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 258 Amendment 2   09 AUG 2013 
CONFIDENTIAL  A two -sided alpha of 5% will be used.  With a sample size of 150, the critical correlation that is 
needed to reject H0 is 0.16. if the absolute value of the observed correlation is 0.16 or higher, H 0 
will be rejected.   In order to keep the overall alpha at 5%, a sequential testing procedure will be 
used: First we will test the correlation with % change in spleen volume, and only if the null 
hypothesis of no correlation can be rejected will we continue to test the correlation with % 
change in Total Symptom Score.  
Safety Endpoints:  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_190060], duration and severity of adverse events, performing physical examinations, collecting vital signs, collecting laboratory 
data for hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation parameters, and lipid panel through 
Week  156. 
Change in platelet count from baseline to each visit where the variables are measured will be tabulated with su mmary statistics.  
Proportion of subjects with new onset of Grade [ADDRESS_627312] functions of time to onset of the above two safety 
measures will be estimated using life table method.  
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA
®) preferred term and by [CONTACT_9313].  Severity of AEs will be bas ed on the 
CTCAE scale as indicated in Section 11.1.1. 
The subset of AEs that are considered by [CONTACT_488304]- related AEs.  If the Investigator does not specify the relationship of 
the AE to study drug, the AE will be considered to be treatment- related.  The incidence of AEs 
and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using sum mary statistics (eg, means and 
frequencies), and no formal statistical comparisons among the treatments are planned.  
Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (body 
temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure and heart rate) at each assessment time.  Vital sign results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities according to the criteria shown below; subjects exhibiting clinically notable vital sign abnormalities will be listed.

baseline  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% improvement in total symptom score as measured 
by [CONTACT_300447] v2.0 diary at Week 24 compared to baseline  
Long -term efficacy of ruxolitinib will be assessed by [CONTACT_488305], as measured by [CONTACT_23302], and change in PGIC score from baseline to each visit where the variables are measured through Week 156.  The percent change in spleen volume at 
Week 24 compared to baseline , the percent change in Total Symptom Score as measured by [CONTACT_488306] v2.0 diary at Week 24 compared to baseline, the proportion of subjects with ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume at Week 24 compared to baseline, proportion of subjects with 
≥ 10% reduction in spleen volume at Week 24 compared to baseline, and the proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% improvement in total sympt om score as measured by [CONTACT_300447] 
v2.0 diary at Week 24 compared to baseline will be tabulated with summary statistics.  Change  
and percentage change in spleen length from baseline as measured by [CONTACT_488307] 156 will be tabulated with summary statistics.

CONFIDENTIAL  12.3. Interim Analysis  
Interim data review focused on thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage events will occur as described 
in Section 11.7 Data Safety Monitoring. 
12.4. Selection of Sample Size 
Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled.  Using an alpha of 5% (two-s ided), this sample size 
gives a power of 96% to reject the null hypothesis of no dose- effect correlation if the true 
correlation is 0.30.  The power is 87% if the true correlation is 0.25, and the power is 69% if the 
true correlation is 0.20.  These calcul ations are based on ( Cohen 1988, Formula 12.3.4). 
In addition, the mean percent change of spleen volume measured by [CONTACT_9268], and mean percent 
change in Total Symptom Score from baseline to Week 24 will each be estimated wi th a 95% 
confidence interval.  With 150 subjects, the half-length of the 95% confidence interval of the spleen volume change from baseline to Week 24 is about 3%.  This is b ased on the Phase III 
study (INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-351), where the standard deviation of the percent change of spleen volume 
from baseline to Week 24 was 19%.  
12.5. Level of Significance  
All confidence intervals will be 95% and tests will be performed at two sided 0.05% level.  Since this is an exploratory study, no multiplicity adjustment will be perfo rmed.

to 86°F).  Stability studies will be conducted on clinical batches to support the clinical trial.   
13.2. Study Drug Accountability, Handling , and Disposal  
Respons ibility for drug accountability at the study site rests with the Investigator; however, the 
Investigator may assign some of the drug accountability duties to an appropriate pharmacist or 
designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_147117].  
The Investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study medication  until the end of the study.  The Investigator or designee must 
maintain records that document: 
• investigational product delivery to the study site  
• the inventory at the site  
• use by [CONTACT_488308][INVESTIGATOR_4382]/unit counts from each supply dis pensed  
• return to the Investigator or designee.   
These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers (if available), and the unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.   
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the protocol.  The Investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the correct study medication  specified. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  At the completion of the study, the Investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating 
procedures.  If local procedures mandate site destruction of investigational supply, prior written 
approval must be obtained from Incyte.

Fibrosis Grade  Description  
0 Scatt ered linear reticulin with no intersections corresponding to normal 
bone marrow 
1 Loose network of reticulin with many intersections, especially in 
perivascular areas  
2 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally wi th only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal 
osteosclerosis  
3 Diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis  
Note:  Fibrosis density should be asses sed in hematopoietic areas.

Bone Marrow Biopsy Pathology Reporting Guidelines 
The following should be assessed: 
• Assessment of cellularity.  
• 500-cell differential of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], (if collecte d) correlated, if possible, with data from 
appropriate marrow biopsy section. Percentage of pronormoblasts, blasts, 
normoblasts, myelocytes, metamyelocytes  
• Blast percentage, indicating what cellular types are being considered as blast 
equivalents, and the degree of maturation and dysplastic abnormalities within the 
neoplastic population should be described. 
• Characterization of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte morphology. 
• Characterization and gradation of fibrosis within hematopoietic cellular areas. 
• Diagnostic  interpretation with specific mention of (expected) absence of an 
infiltrative or granulomatous process 
• Pathologist’ s diagnosis (PMF, PPV- MF, etc.)

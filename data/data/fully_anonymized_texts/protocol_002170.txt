Title of Study:  An Open -Label, Multiple Dose, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of QR -110 in Subjects with Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) due to 
c.2991[PHONE_11942]A>G Mutation (p.Cys998X)  in the CEP290  Gene  
Study Centers:  Participation of approximately 3 study centers  planned  
Phase of Development:  Phase 1b/2  
Study Period:  Anticipated to be approximately [ADDRESS_756003] Participation:  13 months  (Screening 28 days; study period 12 months)  
Rationale:  Leber ’s congenital amaurosis (LCA)  is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease 
resulting in blindness, often in early childhood. In subjects with LCA due to the 
p.Cys998X mutation in Centrosomal Protein of 290 kDa ( CEP290 ), visual symptoms  
are usually detectable before 1 year of age  and further deterioration  over time has also 
been reported ( den Hollander 2008 , Yzer 2012 ). Patients show severe vision 
disturbances from an early age and slow progressive loss of remaining vision  
(Cideci yan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 ). There are currently no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_576444] p.Cys998X mutation in CEP290  (subsequently referred to 
as the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation) and a large unmet medical need exists .   
The CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation results in aberrant splicing of CEP290  with mutant 
messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and truncated protein production in affe cted 
individuals. QR -[ADDRESS_756004] aberrant splicing in CEP290  gene, enabling production of 
fully functional RNA and protein.  
Objectives:  Primary:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered via intravitreal  
(IVT)  injection in subject s with LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation   
Secondary:  To evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics of QR -[ADDRESS_756005] s with LCA 
due to  the CEP290 p.Cys998X mutation  
 
Number of Subjects (planned):  12   
The final number of subjects is dependent on whether any dose levels are expanded by 
[CONTACT_1578] ( DMC ) and Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Study Design  The first -in-human study of QR -[ADDRESS_756006]: QR -110

 be assigned to receive a specified dose level of QR -110 (loading dose and maintenance 
dose) and will receive that dose throughout their participation, while they are monitored 
for safety. No intrasubject dose escalation is planned. Up to 3 dose levels of Q R-110 
will be evaluated. Dose escalation decisions and initiation of dosing in pediatric 
subjects (6 to <18 years of age) will be determined by [CONTACT_576475].  The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor 
will also review all available safety data  at key study time points (eg,  prior to the first 
subject in the first adult cohort (Cohort A1) receiving each sub sequent dose of study 
drug).  
QR-[ADDRESS_756007] will receive up 
to 4 doses of QR -110 in their wors e eye (as defined by [CONTACT_576476] , 
subsequently referred to as treatment eye)  every [ADDRESS_756008] the same visual acuity , the 
Investigator should determi ne the eye with the worse visual function  as the treatment 
eye, according to other measures of ophthalmic function  (Full-field Stimulus Testing 
[FST] or mobility course score ). If the visual function  is the same per the Investigator’s 
assessment, then the treatment eye will be determined at Investigator discretion. No 
placebo nor sham injections will be administered in the contralateral eye .  
The contralateral eye and the subject’s own baseline measurements will serve as 
controls.   
Subjects who do not meet stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_576445]  (Section  4.2.2 ). Subjects who meet stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_576446].  
The DMC  and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor may decide to de -escalate the dose, hold the 
dose (delay or skip), or discontinue study drug for an individual subject, in consultation 
with the Investigator . Subjects who discontinue study drug will continue to be followed 
for safety and efficacy.  
An extension study , which would permit continued dosing of eligible subjects who 
complete PQ -110-001, is planned .  
Dose Escalation  
Specifics of the dose escalation plan are descri bed in detail in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . It is 
planned to dose  at least  [ADDRESS_756009] dose escalation will occur.  Dosing will be staggered such that:  
• The first [ADDRESS_756010] 2 weeks apart  
• At least [ADDRESS_756011] dose safety and tolerability data on the previous 
cohort  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_576477]  
• Dosing and dose escalation of pediatric  cohorts will be initiated following 
DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor review and will follow that of the 
corresponding adult cohort by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_756012]  dose, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_576478] . 
A complete discussion of the rules regarding timing of doses for individual subjects is 
presented in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Pediatric subjects will only receive a given dose level of QR -[ADDRESS_756013]: QR -110

course , oculomotor instability and Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_576447] [ PLR]) will be measured a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_756015]’s first dose of study drug to evaluate 
intrasubject variability  (Screening and predose on Day 1) . Measures of retinal anatomy 
(infrared imaging, and Optical Coherence Tomography [OCT] ) and electr oretinogram 
(ERG ) will  be measured a minimum of [ADDRESS_756016]’s first dose of study 
drug. Any predose a ssessment may be repeated if the results are considered unreliable 
or of unacceptable quality by [CONTACT_576479].  In the case of r epeat assessments, the measure reflecting the average of the 
measures  will be considered the Baseline value.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility  criteria will be enrolled into the study  and will receive 
their first dose of study drug  on Day 1. QR -[ADDRESS_756017]’s treatment eye in accordance with the procedures outlined by [CONTACT_76159]  (Avery 2014 ). 
Subjects will be monitored clinically for increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) and 
signs of inflammation  and endophthalmitis  during the post -injection period . 
Subjects will be eva luated the day after  each administration of study drug  for safety 
monitoring  (all doses)  and to enable collection of serum samples for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis    
Subjects will return to the study center to complete safety assessments at 7 days , and 1

 Statistical Methods:  Baseline  demographics and disease characteristics,  safety and efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_576481] . Continuous 
efficacy endpoints will be summarized and may be analyzed using appropriate 
parametric or nonparametric inference tests. Serum concentrations of QR -110 will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_317230]. To determine the PK profile of IVT 
injection s at the different dose levels of QR -110, the following PK parameters will be 
calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
• AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last 
observed concentration C last (obs) using formula: 
AUC 0-∞=AUC last+C last(obs)/λz, if feasible.  
• AUC 0-tlast: Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration 
greater than lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be calculated  based on 
the last observed concentration  using the linear trapezoidal method.  
• Cmax, C0: The maximum and minimum serum concentrations will be taken 
directly from the data.  
• Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.  
• T1/2 (if measurable serum l evels are obtained): The terminal elimination half -
life will be estimated by [CONTACT_105] -linear regression analysis of the terminal 
elimination slope, if feasible.  
• CL: Serum clearance will be estimated using the formula: CL = Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
• Vd (if measurable serum l evels are obtained and an elimination rate constant 
(λz) is estimable): Apparent volume of distribution at steady state of the drug 
will be determined from trough levels.  
Any p values that will be calculated according to the analysis plan will be interpreted in 
view of the exploratory nature of the study.  Details on statistical analyses will be 
included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
ProQR Therapeutics (ProQR) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_576452]  (AON)  product, 
QR-110, for the treatment of patients with Leber ’s congenital amaurosis (LCA)  due to the c.2991 
[PHONE_11942]A>G mutation (p.Cys998X  or IVS26[PHONE_11942]A>G ) in the C entrosomal Protein of 290kDa 
(CEP290 ) gene . Leber ’s congenital amaurosis is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease 
resulting in blindness, often in early childhood. In patients with LCA due to the p.Cys998X 
mutation  in the CEP290  gene (subsequently referred to as CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation ), visual  
symptoms are usually detectable before 1 year of age  and further deterioration over time has also 
been reported  (den Hollander 2008 , Yzer 2012 ). Patients show severe vision disturbances from 
an early age and slow progressive loss of remaining vision ( Cideciyan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 , 
McAnany 2013 ). There are currently no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_576453]290  p.Cys998X  mutation  and a large unmet medical need exists. The primary goal of the 
development plan for QR -[ADDRESS_756035] one CEP290  allele containing the CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation, resulting in 
functional vision restoration or preservation . The intended route of administration is intravitreal 
(IVT) injection.  
2.1 Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis  
Leber ’s congenital amaurosis is a non -syndromic retinopathy  that affects both cone an d rod 
photoreceptor cells of the retina. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, reported to be the most 
severe and one of the earliest onset form s of vision loss in children, with detection of disease 
symptoms as early as  the first year of life. The symptoms and signs include severe and early 
vision loss, sensory nystagmus (involuntary eye movement s), abnormalities of  pupil  reactions , 
oculo -digital sign, and nondetectable photoreceptor electrical signals on electroretinogram 
(ERG). There are  approximately 20 genes identified to date in which mutations are causative for 
LCA (den Hollander 2008 , Estrada -Cuzcano 2011 , Kmoch 2015 ), and the LCA classification is 
based on the disease causing gene . The most frequently mutated LCA gene is CEP290 , with 
mutations accounting for about 15% to 30% of LCA cas es (Coppi[INVESTIGATOR_3689] 2010 , den Hollander 
2008 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 , Stone 2007 ).  
The CEP290  gene is located on the long ( Q) arm of chromosome [ADDRESS_756036] frequently 
occurring CEP290  mutation associated with retinal dystrophy  in Caucasians , especially in 
European countries and the [LOCATION_002] (US), is a change in intron 26 of the CEP290  gene 
(p.Cys998X) ( Stone 2007 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 , Littink 2010 ). This mutation 
creates a cryptic splice donor site in intron 26 which results in the inclusion of an aberrant exon 
(exon -X) of 128 base s in the mutant CEP290  messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This cryptic 
exon introduces a premature stop codon, predicted to render CEP290 a truncated protein. The 
mutation has been found in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity in patients with CEP290  
LCA ( Cideciyan 2007 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 ). Both the homozygous and 
heterozygous genotypes result in a similar clinical presentation. The CEP290  p.Cys998X

 mutation appears to be hypomorphic in nature, with wild -type transcripts present in peripheral 
tissues, explaining the non -syndromic nature of th e CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation ( Parfitt 2016 ).

to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutat ion exhibit progressive retinal degeneration and substantial loss 
of rod photoreceptors in the peripheral retina; however, sparing of foveal /macular  cone 
photoreceptors has been observed.  Such cone photoreceptor sparing is noted in some patients by

specific retinal function. Importantly, age does not seem to be strictly associated with disease 
severity ( Cideciyan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 , Pasadhika 2010 ).  
The phenotype of LCA due to  mutations in CEP290  is severe . However, in a cohort of Dutch 
patients, Yzer et al (2012 ) concluded that patients usually have a relatively normal optic disc, 
mild or moderate attenuation of vessels and a relatively preserved posterior pole, suggesting that 
anatomy i s preserved. There is evidence of sparing of some photoreceptors in the macula of 
individuals with LCA carrying CEP290  mutations, which may allow for therapeutic intervention.

 Restoration of protein expression to wild -type levels has the potential to delay , cease , or possibly 
to reverse disease progression ( Chacon -Camacho 2015 ). 
2.3.1 Rationale for Open -label Design in Patients  
Intravitreal injection is a well -established route of administration wit hin ophthalmic indications; 
however, rare but potentially serious complications to IVT injections exist, including acute onset 
endophthalmitis, pseudo -endophthalmitis, cataract  and retinal detachment. Although the risk of 
serious complications is small, it  is well -documented ( Artunay 2009 , Fagan 2013 , Falavarjani 
2013 ). Therefore, placebo injections will not be administered in this study to preserve subject 
safety.  
Use of sham injections to mask su bjects to treatment assignment in studies of products 
administered via IVT injection eliminates the risk of complications due to injection in the 
contralateral eye. Sham injections that closely mimic the active injection can effectively mask 
participants t o treatment assignment; however, the masking effect is less pronounced in the case 
where a single subject would receive both the real and sham injections, one in each of their eyes 
(Glassman 2012 ), as would be required in LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation.  
This study will be an open -label study and sham injections will not be used. Masking of 
participating subjects is of particular importance when subject effort or perception could bi as 
evaluation of study endpoints; this is true for the assessment of subjective endpoints such as 
visual acuity ( Glassman  2012 ). However, many assessments are objective tests ( Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_576454] [PLR], OCT, oculomotor instability  [OCI] , ERG , and infrared  imaging ) which are not 
related to subject responses. A central reading center will be used for several of the 
ophthalmologic assessments, including PLR, OCI, Full Field Stimul us Testing ( FST), ERG, 
OCT and infrared imaging, which will be reviewed and interpreted by [CONTACT_576483]. Mobility course scoring will also be reviewed and calculated by a masked evaluator. 
Furthermore, this study will evaluate safety and  tolerability as the primary endpoint. Measures of 
safety will be monitored and severity and causality determined by [CONTACT_737]. Taken  
together, the risk of the introduction of bias to the determination of safety from the participant is 
low and sham injections will not reduce bias introduced by [CONTACT_4718].  
Subjects will receive QR -110 as a unilateral IVT injection in their worse eye (see  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Treatment of the worse eye is common practice in the development of 
ophthalmic products ( Bainbridge 2008 , Ghazi 2016 , Jacobson 2012 , Maguire 2009 ). Unilateral 
injection serves as an additional means to ensure safety, as visual function is driven by a 
subject´s better eye.  Unless other wise specified, both safety and efficacy evaluations 
 will be based on the assessment of the treat ment  eye 
in comparison to baseline measures and to the untreated  eye (referred to hereafter as the 
contralateral eye) . As there is no approved therapy for the treatment of LCA due to the CEP290  
p.Cys998X mutation, no suitable comparator currently exists. The contralateral  eye, therefore, 
serves as a control and removes the biases due to the absence of a relevant comparat or, or the 
Investigational Product: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page [ADDRESS_756041] to the intraocular tissues of the eye ( AAO 2015 ). Intravitreal 
injection is used in several products for the  chronic treatment of ophthalmic diseases (eg, 
Lucentis®, Eylea ™, Macugen®) and the risk of complications is low when injections are 
performed by [CONTACT_576484] ( AAO 2015 ). 
Since IVT injections themselves carry a low risk of serious complications , independent of the 
product administered , dose levels to be investigated in the study are calculated to be 
pharmacologically efficacious doses. Evaluation of up to 3 dose levels of QR -110 is planned. 
Inclusion of up to 3 dose levels enables investigation of a potential dose response relationship for 
QR-110. Based on the chemistry of the molecule, PK data from toxicology studies, and what is 
known of other oligonucleotides approved for IVT injection (Macugen®, Vitravene®), systemic 
absorption is anticipated to be low.  
Each subject  will receive up to [ADDRESS_756042] s with the potential opportunity for efficacy . A single dose design is not considered 
acceptable in this population because subjects would be exposed to the risks associated with IVT 
injection without the possibility of being able to derive any (sustained) benefit. To ensure subject 
safety in this multiple dose design, an independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) will 
review all available safety data prior to each dose escalation , prior to inclusion of pediatric 
subjects,  and prior to the first subject receiving each subsequent dose of QR -110 (doses 2, 3, and 
4). Therefore, the study consists of a single initial dose, with DMC  review of cumulative study 
data and a positive DMC recommendation prior to continuing to each subsequent dose.

The proposed starting dose and 
escalation scheme for PQ -110-001 is considered conservative.  
The proposed do sing regimens to be studied are as follows:  
• Low dose:  160 µg loading dose, followed by [CONTACT_428329] 80 µg maintenance doses   
• Middle dose:  320 µg loading dose, followed by [CONTACT_428329] 160 µg maintenance doses

ProQR Therapeutics   Page [ADDRESS_756045] on disease. Due to severe nystagmus 
in many subjects with LCA due to the  CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation, it is anticipated that 
consistent, quantitative calculation of the volume of retained ONL across subjects may be a 
challenge in this population ; therefore, eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_576485], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator.  
Since disease severity does not seem to clearly correlate with age, inclusion of subjects in the 
first-in-human trial should be guided by [CONTACT_576486] a therapeutic 
benefit. The high u nmet medical need warrants early therapeutic intervention in those patients 
with sufficient preserved vision and retinal anatomy in which a major clinical benefit (restoration 
or improvement of vision or delay in visual loss) could potentially be expected.  Therefore, 
treatment with QR -110 is justified in those patients with LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X 
mutation who present detectable ONL, irrespective of age.   
2.5.1 Inclusion of Pediatric Subjects  
Symptoms of LCA due to the  CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation occur in young pediatric patients; 
symptoms are usually detected before [ADDRESS_756046]: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page [ADDRESS_756047] safety and due to the complexity of  study assessments. A  staggered approach has 
been selected such that pediatric subjects  (pediatric patients include those 6 to less than 18 years 
of age) will only start treatment following review of safety and tolerability data from adult 
subjects  (adult subjects include those ≥18 years of age) . 
In pediatric subjects at least  6 years  of age , the average volume of vitreous is similar to that of 
adult subjects , as referred in Bhardwaj et al (2013)  and Zadnik et al (2004) . Intravitreal 
administration of anti -Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A agents is used to treat newborns in 
cases of Retinopathy of Prematurity and no i ssues  specific to the pediatric population  have been 
identified  in connection to the IVT injection (Mintz -Hittner 2008 , Nazari 2010 ). For a product 
given via IVT injection, there is no evidence to suggest that the safety profile would differ in 
adult patients as compared to  pediatric patients at least 6 years of age. Toxicity studies in 
juvenile animals are summarized in the  QR-110 IB, Nonclinical Studies . 
For the purposes of an early phase clinical study  such as PQ -110-001, it is essential that 
participating subjects be able to complete all necessary safety and efficacy assessments; 
therefore, specifying a minimum age for subject eligibility  is appropriate. The psychophysical 
tests used in low vision popu lations are difficult for children younger than [ADDRESS_756048] should be accompanied by a study staff member. Pain should be minimized (eg, use of 
indwelling catheters for blood draws or use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481202] ), in accordance with 
local institutional practices  (Directive 2001/20/EC ).

ProQR Therapeutics   Page [ADDRESS_756050] -in-human study of QR -110 will be an open -label, multiple dose, dose  escalation study 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered  via IVT injection in subjects with 
LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation. Subjects will be assigned to receive a specified 
dose level (loading dose and maintenance dose) of QR -110. No intrasubject dose escalation is 
planned. Up to 3 dose levels of QR -110 will be evaluated. Dose escalation decisions and 
initiation of dosing in pediatric subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_576489]. 
4.2.1 Study Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed according to the eligibility criteria.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study . On Day 1, subjects will 
undergo a second set of predose baseline measures as specified in the SOE   and will 
subsequently  receive their first dose of study drug. The data obtained from these two predose 
measures will serve to inform the level of intrasubject variability in study assessments (see 
Section  7.2 for more details on the screening process).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Administration  
Subjects will receive study drug via unilateral IVT injection in accordance with the procedures 
outlined by [CONTACT_576490] ( Avery 2014 ) in their worse  eye as defined by 
[CONTACT_178744] (subsequently referred to as treatment eye) and will be assessed for safety and 
tolerability at follow u p visits. If both eyes have the same visual acuity , the Investigator should 
determine the eye with the worse visual function, according to other measures of ophthalmic 
function  at Screening (FST  or mobility course score) , as the  treatment eye . If the visual function 
is the same per the I nvestigator’s assessment, then the treatment eye will be determined at 
Investigator discretion .

Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time ( ie, discontinue study drug and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A subject who withdraws consent will 
always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator should follow 
up on AEs outside o f the clinical study  to ensure subject safety; however, no data on such events 
will be collected for study purposes . 
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her subject number  cannot be 
reused. Withdrawn subjects may be replaced (s ee Section  10.2.2 ). 
4.2.4 Discontinuation of  the Study  
The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  will evaluate the safety and tolerability data as 
described in Section  4.2.2  and Table 3 and thereafter on an ongoing basis to recommend if the 
study should continue or cease, or if any modifications should be made as to how subjects are 
treated or managed.   
In the case of overwhelming efficacy  as determined by [CONTACT_576494]  (see 
Section  10.9), the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  may make a recommendation to 
discontinue the study.

performed on sample s with abnormal dipstick results .  
C4, Hemolytic compl ement 50 (CH50), INR, ESR and C Reactive Protein (CRP) will also be 
assessed.  
For female subjects  of child bearing potential , a serum pregnancy test is required at Screening. 
Urine pregnancy tests are acceptable for subsequent time points.  
Subject eligibi lity is determined based on Screening laboratory values. If any relevant changes in 
the subject’s medical history occur between Screening and Day 1, the Investigator should repeat 
laboratory assessments prior to the subject’s first dose of study drug to co nfirm eligibility.  
Repeat l aboratory tests are permitted to confirm potentially spurious values  or false positive 
results , at the discretion of the Investigator. Repeat analysis results for any laboratory 
assessments that are eligibility criteria should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
prior to subject inclusion.

Adverse event s include:  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_576508] -specified AE reporting period  
(as specifi ed in Section  9.4.1 ) 
• Adverse event s not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the

• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions ( eg, invasive

regardless  of the relationship to study drug. An SAE is any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE. This definition implies that the subject, in the view of the 
Investigator, is at immediate risk of death from the event as it oc curred. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Inpatien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010], except for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576469]: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 53 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 • Persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. This serious criterion applies if a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect is diagnosed in a child born to a female subject, or a female partner 
of a male subject exposed to the study drug  
• Other important medical events. Medical and scientific judgment should determine 
whether an AE should be classified as serious in other situations, such as im portant 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in the definition above.  
All AEs that do not meet any o f the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious AEs.  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache)  (See Section  9.3.1 ). “Serious” is a regulatory definition 
and is based on subject or event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that 
pose a threat to a subject’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs a nd SAEs on the 
AE eCRF and SAE form.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_756086] meet 3 criteria:  the event is serious, there is a c ertain degree of probability 
that the event is a reaction to the study drug  being researched and the nature and severity of the 
reaction are not in agreement with the product information (ie, the reaction is unexpected as per 
the reference safety informati on). All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported as required to the Competent 
Authorities and to the Ethics Committee  (EC) /Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) of the 
countries and centers  concerned.

   02-Aug-2018  
 9.3 Assessment of Adverse Events   
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the severity and causality of A Es. 
9.3.1 Assessment of Severity (Intensity) of Adverse Events  
On the AE eCRF , the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to 
describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades 
are defined as follows:  
• MILD: Does not interfere with subject's usual function.  
• MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.  
• SEVERE: Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.  
As described previously in  Section  9.2.2 , note the distinction between the severity and the 
seriousness of AE. A severe event is not necessarily a  serious event.  For example, a headache 
may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified 
as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs , listed above in Section  9.2.[ADDRESS_756088]: QR -110

ProQR Therapeutics   Page 55 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 9.3.2 Assessment of the Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will make a ca usality assessment about the relationship of each AE to study 
drug. To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, Investigators should apply 
the following general guideline:  
Not Related:   The AE has an etiology other than the study drug ( eg, preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has 
no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug ( eg, cancer diagnosed 
[ADDRESS_756089] dose of study drug).  
Possibly Related:   An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug, follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug, but that could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Probably Relat ed:  An AE that is clearly related to the study drug or its administration (ie, an 
event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_45418]’s clinical state) . 
Definitely Related: The AE is clearly related to the study drug ; a re -challenge confirms the 
association (not required or desirable in some circumstances but provides strong evidence when 
it happens).  
For all AEs and SAEs, Investigators will make separate assessments of causality about the 
relationship of the  event to study drug and to drug administration (ie, IVT  injection ). 
Note:  The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process and will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record, AE eCRF, and SA E 
form if applicable. Adverse events recorded without the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship to study drug will be followed up until causality is assigned.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_756090] the outcome of AEs and SAEs using the following criteria:  
• Recovered/resolved:  The subject  has fully recovered from the event, with no residual 
effects observable.  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered from the event, but with 
residual seq uelae effects observable.  
• Not recovered/resolved:  Effects of the event are still present.

Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 56 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 • Recovering/resolving:  The subject  has improved, but has not fully recovered from the 
event . 
• Fatal:  The death is related to the event . 
• Unknown:  The outcome of the even t is unknown to the reporter ( eg, subject  was lost to 
follow -up).

medical record , AE eCRF, and/or SAE form, and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with 
protocol instructions.  
9.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All significant medical conditions including signs/symptoms of the underlying diagnosis found 
during the screening  period and up to initiation of dosing (Visit 2) will be captured as medical 
history.  Any event/condition related to participation in the study  or study procedures  but not 
related to underlying or concomitant disease  that is  noted after Screening  up to the date of first 
dose will be captured as a non -treatment emergent AE. 
Any event/condition noted once the subject  receives their first dose of study drug will be 
captured as an AE. All AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until at least 
[ADDRESS_756092]’s EOS visit , whichever is 
later. At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject  to report to the 
Investigator any subsequent AEs /SAEs  that the subject ’s personal physician believes could be 
related to prior study treatment.   
Adverse event s and SAEs related to study drug that persist >  [ADDRESS_756093] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or participation is not the cause of 
the AE/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF 
and SAE form (if applicable) and in the subject ’s medical recor d to facilitat e source data 
verification. For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], facsimile, 
electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE repo rt (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or 
autopsy report).   
9.4.[ADDRESS_756094]  evaluation 
time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
Investigational Product: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 57 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 “How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
Age appropriate non -directive questions should be employed for eliciting AEs from pediatric 
subjects. Non-directive questions may also be used to elicit AEs from parents/caregivers of 
pediatric subjects, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_756095] medical terminology/concepts when re cording AEs or SAEs on 
the eCRF and/or SAE form . Colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided . Serious 
adverse events must also be recorded on the AE eCRF . Only one medical concept should be 
recorded in the event field on the AE eCRF and SAE form (if applicable).  
a. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should also be entered as separate AEs. For example, if  severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, both diarrhea and dehydration should be entered as AEs on the eCRF , and if also 
serious , on the SAE form.  
b. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject  evaluation 
time poi nts. Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF un less their severity 
increases. If a persistent AE becomes more severe  or occurs more freque ntly, it should be 
recorded again on the AE eCRF  with the increased severity grading .  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject  evaluation time p oints and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded individually on the A E eCRF.  
c. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be recorded as AEs on the  eCRF and 
SAE form  (if applicable) .  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should  be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an  elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia” . 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recor ded as AEs on the eCRF and SAE form (if applicable), unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.

 d. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Secti on 9.4.1 ), 
regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and SAE form and reported to the 
Sponsor w ithin 24 hours of event knowledge .  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as a single medical concept. For example, if death resulted from respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518], the AE recorded shou ld be “Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064]”, and the outcome of the AE would be 
“Death”.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
record “unexplained death” on the AE eCRF and SAE form.  
e. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisti ng medical condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or chara cter of  the condition worsen s during the study. When recording such events on 
an AE eCRF and SAE form (if applicable), it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] ( eg, “more frequent 
headaches”).

If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject  becomes pregnant while the female 
subject or the male partner is receiving study drug  or within  [ADDRESS_756096] dose of study  
drug, a Pregnancy Report form should be completed and faxed to  the Drug Safety designee 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy, using the fax numbers listed in the Study 
Reference Manual . 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, will be reported on a Pregnancy Report form and 
faxed to the Sponsor according to the instructions in the Study Reference Manual . If the abortion 
meets seriousness criteria (see Section  9.2.2 , Serious Adverse Event Definition), this information 
will be captured on the AE eCRF  and SAE form.  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or to a female partner of 
a male subject  exposed to the study drug  should be recorded and reported as an SAE.

 10.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a Phase 1 b/[ADDRESS_756100] s as indicated in  Table 3  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), for a maximum number of subject s up to a total of N=18. The decision to add 
subject s is based on DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor review of safety and tolerability and not 
based on efficacy; hence, exploratory efficacy analyses will not impact the DMC  and Sponsor 
Medical Monitor review of accumulating safety data and the potential for additional subjects 
above 12.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_756101] being replaced.  The decision for 
replacement will be made by [CONTACT_576512].   
10.3 Analysis of  Populations  
Safety Population : the population for safety analysis will consist of all subjects  who receive any 
QR-110 or pre -medications required for the study.  
Efficacy  Evaluable  Population : the population for efficacy (clinical activity) analysis will consist 
of all subjects  who receive any QR-[ADDRESS_756102] baseline  efficacy 
observation or measurement . 
Per Protocol Efficacy Population : this population will cons ist of all subjects in the Efficacy 
Evaluable Population  with the except ion of  subjects with major protocol deviations who will be 
excluded. The list of major protocol deviations for exclusion from this population will be 
completed prior to database lock.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population : the population for PK analyses will consist of all subjects  
who receive QR-[ADDRESS_756103]: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page [ADDRESS_756104]  disposition will be summarized for the  safety population by [CONTACT_7169]. The number and 
percentage of subjects  enrolled in each study center will be presented  by [CONTACT_1617] 
(North America and Europe) .  
The number and percentag e of subjects  who receive QR-[ADDRESS_756105] recently collected  
and/or the average of the measure s (eg, for ophthalmic assessments performed two or more 
times)  prior to the first dose.  
10.5 Treatment Compliance  
All doses are observed and admi nistered by [CONTACT_464]. Treatment compliance will be 
determined by [CONTACT_576513] . 
10.6 Safety Analyses  
10.6.1  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an event that was not prese nt prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug and present after the first dose or if it represents the 
exacerbation of an event that was present prior to the first dose.  
Adverse events  noted during the study will be coded to system organ class es (SOCs) and 
preferred terms (PTs)  using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) 
dictionary. The overall incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_576514]. Deaths, AE severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug and study 
discontinuation due to AE will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_7169] . An AE will be considered drug -
related if the Investigator indicated the event is at least “possibly” related or if the relationship is 
missing. Adverse events with missing  start dates, but with stop dates overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_576471]. All AEs will be listed in subject  listing , 
and summarized by [CONTACT_576515] . If a subject  reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most 
severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAE s, and the most severe of 
the treatment -related events will be included in the summary table s of TEAEs .

10.7 Pharmacokinetics Analyses  
To determine the PK profile of IVT injections at the different dose levels of QR-110, the 
following PK parameters will be calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
• AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration (Clast (obs) ) using formula: AUC 0-∞=AUC last+Clast(obs)/λz, if feasible.  
• AUC 0-tlast: Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration greater than 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration using the linear trapezoidal method . 
• Cmax, C0: The maximum and minimum serum conce ntrations will be taken directly 
from the data.  
• Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.

 • T1/2 (if measurable serum levels are obtained) : The terminal elimination half -life will 
be estimated by [CONTACT_105] -linear regression analysis of the terminal elimination slope, if 
feasible.  
• CL: Serum clearance will be estimated using the formula: CL = Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
• Vd (if measurable serum levels are obtained  and an elimination rate constant (λ z) is 
estimable ): Apparent volume of distribution at  steady state of the drug will be 
determined from trough levels.

11.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Data Collection and Study Monitoring  
An eCRF w ill be used for this study. Study center personnel will be trained and authorized to use 
the system in compliance with  the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  21CFR Part 11 , 
International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and local 
regulations,  before recording data on eCRFs. All corrections to eCRFs will be made by 
[CONTACT_55795], and the changes will be automatically logged in the audit trail of the system  
(time and date stamps and the user entering or updating data) . Electronic CRFs should be 
completed for every subject  screened or enrolled in the study . All subject s screened for the study 
who sign an Informed Consent Form or assent document will be assigned a subject s creening 
number that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The subject s creening number 
will be a unique  4-digit subject identifier : a 2-digit site number and a consecutive [ADDRESS_756109] withdraws consent or is a screen 
fail. At the study’s conclusion, a Portable Document  Format file will be created for each study 
center containing thei r subjects ’ data submitted on eCRFs. In the event of an audit or regulatory 
authority inspection, copi[INVESTIGATOR_576472]. The  Investigator will ensure that the 
eCRFs are accurate, complete, and completed in a timely fashion. The Investigator w ill ensure 
that source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
transcribed on the eCRFs are  retained according to storage guidelines ( Section  13.4). Separate 
source records are require d to support all eCRF entries. The eCRF is not to be used to document 
data without prior written or electronic records.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects  and study centers , a clinical data 
management review will be performed on subject  data. During this review, subject  data will be 
checked for consistency, omissions, a nd any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be 
reviewed for adhe rence to the protocol and  ICH GCP. To resolve any questions arising from the 
clinical data management review process, data que ries will be sent to the study center . 
Corrections or updates to the data resulting from queries should be ma de on th e eCRF. All 
changes will be automatically documented in the software’s audit trail, including the reason for 
change.  
The Investigator will  electronically  sign and date the  indicated places on the eCRF. These 
signatures will indicate that the Investigator i nspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF and 
agrees with the content.

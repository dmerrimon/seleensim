Enrolling 
Participants:  Participants will be recruited and enrolled at the UNC Weight Research 
Center in Chapel Hill, NC.  
Description of 
Study Intervention:  The intervention will be delivered through weekly in -person  or virtual  individual 
sessions ; a mobile i phone app that integrates diet, weight, and physical activity ; and 
continuous blood glucose data , to support self -regulatory behaviors. In the first 
weekly session, partic ipants will be oriented to the intervention and provided with 
their self- monitoring tools. They will be encouraged to weigh and track physical 
activity  with a wearable activity monit or, “Red” foods  (using a simplified dietary self-
monitoring approach that classifies foods in a “Traffic Light approach” , weight using 
a wifi- enabled digital scale,  and blood glucose  daily (Abbot Freestyle Libre 
Continuous Glucose Monitor) . The y will be taught to use self -regulatory techniques 
for weight management and glycemic control. Similar to blood glucose self-
regulation, participants are taught to compare the number on the scale each day to 
a standard or goal (weight loss goal) and, depend ing upon the comparison, make 
changes to their diet (i.e., Green foods or Red foods) and physical activity (i.e., 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) or sedentary behavior  (SB)) as 
needed. All participants will be given an initial weight loss goa l of 5%.  
Study Duration:  Approximately 12 months – participants will be accrued on a  rolling basis.   
Participant 
Duration:  Up to 4 months (screening and enrollment + 12 -week intervention + follow -up 
assessment ).

  9 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents a global public health crisis and is as sociated with increased rates of 
morbidity, mortality, and medical expenditures  (1). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_31215], rates 
do not appear to be subsiding (2,3). Of those living with T2D in the U.S., nearly 90% are overweight or 
obese (NIDDK). Modest reductions in weight (> 5%) have been shown to reduce symptoms, improve 
glycemic control, and reduce or eliminate pharmacotherapy regimens (4 -6). Rates of conversion f rom 
prediabetes (impaired glucose) to diagnosed t ype [ADDRESS_30575] few decades (7,8). In  the [LOCATION_002],  approximately 84 million adults (more than 1 out of 3) have 
prediabetes;  however,  90% of people with prediabetes don’t know they have it.  Risk factors for 
prediabetes include overweight and lack of physical activity. While not everyone who is obese develo ps 
type 2 diabetes, obesity greatly increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] t ype 2 diabet es.  
 
In a 2017 Consensus Statement by [CONTACT_31255], the authors recommend weight loss of 5 -10% for those with T2D 
whose BMI is > 25 kg/m2 through comprehensive lifestyle in tervention ( 9). Comprehensive lifestyle 
interventions are the gold standard in the behavioral treatment of obesity and diabetes ( 10). These 
evidence -based interventions inclu de diet and physical activity prescriptions to reduce energy intake 
and increase e xpenditure; employ a variety of behavioral techniques to support these changes; and 
include in -person support from a multi -disciplinary team of interventionists. Changes in d iet and activity 
as well as weight loss are essential for glycemic control in T2D.  Lack of glycemic control leads to cardio - 
and micro -vascular complications that can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality.   
 
Glycemic control is generally meas ured using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1 c), which evaluates longer-
term (~over 3 m onths) management of blood glucose (BG) with a goal of <7% ( 11). More intensive daily 
monitoring of BG is associated with better glycemic control; however, few individuals with T2D not 
taking insu lin follow a structured self -monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)  regimen. Studies show that 
patients with T2D often lack the knowledge and skills to interpret BG information to make the necessary 
behavior  changes to improve glycemic contr ol (12,13 ). Use of SMBG has mixed results in the limited 
trials that have been con ducted (1 4); however, there is evidence that it can be effective when patients 
monitor multiple times daily and are taught how to use the information (1 5). Therefore, optimiz ing 
SMBG with state -of-the-art know ledge of how it may be enhanced by [CONTACT_31256]. In particular, incorporating SMBG in a 
lifestyle intervention may contextualize glucose levels more specifically, provide relevance to self-
regulatory behaviors, increase feelings of self- control , and, thereby, improve ongoing self- management 
of T2D.  
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30576] 
applying for future NIH funding. The study will establish the feasibility  of recruiting this population, 
integrating blood glucose self- monitoring data into the weight loss intervention  and adaptation of the 
Traffic Light mo nitoring approach for weight loss in adults living with impaired glucose . These data and 
experiences, if promising, combined with data from prior studies, will position the team to apply for an 
R01 to demonstrate the initial efficacy of the intervention in  a larger study population.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
  
Comprehensive lifestyle interventions are intensive and typ ically result in average weight losses of 8 -
10% (1 1). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_31216], 30% or more of participants do not respond to treatment (i.e., 
lose 5% of initial body weight, which has been shown to confer clinically significant improvements in 
disea se risk and outcomes) ( 16). There are many hypothesized reasons for non -response to treatment, 
including non -adherence to diet and exercise prescriptio ns and poor self -monitoring. Self- monitoring is 
a cornerstone in behavior change interventions ( 17) that , while effective, can be burdensome. Non -
adherence may be due to psychological factors such as lack of feelings of control over disease 
management, low  self-efficacy for change, or feelings of deprivation; cognitive factors such as 
intervention complexity and burden; and physical factors such as hunger or discomfort with physical 
activity. Effective interventions must promote sustainable changes in behav ior which are reinforced by 
[CONTACT_28045]’s self- efficacy for engaging in the behaviors and positive rein forcement for attaining 
desired outcomes.  
 
Self-regulation of behavior is an intervention approach to manage weight and to control blood glucose. 
Self-regulation involves having a goal, having access to information about whether the goal is being 
achieved , and if not, taking steps to restore equilibrium. Self- regulation has been widely applied to type 
[ADDRESS_30577] their diet, exercise, or insulin d ose to 
reduce the discrepancy. Self -monitoring of blood glucose has been achieved by [CONTACT_31257], although emerging technologies including continuous self -monitoring and flash self-
monitoring are becoming more widespread and ass ociated with tighter control ( 18).  
 
Those who can adhere to self -monitoring are more likely to master se lf-regulation. In one study, 
patients with diabetes reported  a fairly high willingness to self- monitor, which authors relate to the 
controllability of the disease ( 19). Being able to see the impact of one’s behaviors on outcomes of 
interest (i.e., weight a nd glucose) may increase feelings of control and self- effica cy and provide the 
internal rewards that will sustain the behavior changes desired. We have successfully applied self-
regulation in the context of weight loss and weight gain prevention interventi ons with the use of daily 
weighing to regularly assess outco me to inform diet and physical activity behaviors. Across the 
interventions, there was a high acceptability of daily weighing as a behavior change tool ( 20-23).

Protocol  28 May  2020 
  11  
Diet self- monitoring is consisten tly associated with weight loss success across behavioral in terventions 
(17), however, self -monitoring decreases over time. Diet self -monitoring traditionally consists of 
recording the types, amounts and nutritional content (typi[INVESTIGATOR_31217]) of all foods and 
beverages consumed daily for the durat ion of intervention. In a six -month weight loss study, self -
monitoring adherence peaked at week [ADDRESS_30578] 
shown adherence decline by 5 weeks ( 24-28). While mobile technologies introduced in the past [ADDRESS_30579] with the majority of patients generally sedentary ( 29,30 ). 
Interventions that use trac kers (i.e., pedometers and accelerometers) to self -monitor p hysical activity 
have been effective in increasing physical activity in patients with T2D. However, comprehensive 
lifestyle interventions have similar rates of non -adherence to physical activity r ecommendations as 
dietary recommendations with only a subset  of participants reaching recommended levels of MVPA 
(31). Emerging research suggests that reducing sedentary behavior in T2D also benefits glycemic control 
(32,33 ).  
 
Self-monitoring blood glucos e (SMBG) is an established treatment protocol in type [ADDRESS_30580] 
reductions in HbA1c of 0.17% compared to no SMBG and a 0.27% reduction with structured compared 
to non -structured SMBG (1 5). Given the effectivenes s of structured monitoring, the International 
Diabetes Feder ation recently supported structured monitoring for patients with non -insulin treated T2D 
as key component of care (3 4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_31218], clinical practice suggests that even if patients 
are monitoring BG, many do not use the information to modify t heir lifestyle or medications due to lack 
of knowledge or skills around self- management (1 3,35). Given the value of self -monitoring not only BG 
but also diet, physical activity and weight, an inte rvention that teaches the skills to self -regulate 
behaviors based on glucose and weight measurements could enhance improvements in glycemic 
control.  
 
Diet, physical activity and weight loss directly affect blood sugar and vascular outcomes and the [ADDRESS_30581] 150 minutes of 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (preferably > 175 minutes which has been significantly 
associated with weigh t loss in Look AHEAD  (6) is also recommended.  
 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30582] 
published trials using daily weighing for weight loss (2 2) and for long term weight gain prevention ( 21). 
Both of these trials demonstrated significant benefit f rom the daily weighing interventions compared to 
controls.  
 
We have also pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a Red foods monitoring approach using mobile phones in mothers of preschool 
children. The Smart Moms study was a [ADDRESS_30583] control group. The primary focus of  the 
study was on limiting children’s sugar -sweetened beve rages, but mothers were also given dietary goals 
to help them lose weight, which included limiting caloric beverages to 8 fl. oz. per day and limiting “red 
foods” from the Traffic Light Diet to half of their baseline level of intake. To encourage adherence  
throughout the study, they engaged in a simplified form of self -monitoring that consisted of tracking 
their beverages, the number of times (not servings or calories) they consumed a “Red” food from  the 
Traffic Light diet, and their weight daily in a small paper diary. They submitted their weekly totals via 
text message at the end of each week, which were used to create personalized feedback on their 
progress. Mothers also accessed lessons on a mobile -optimized website and received [ADDRESS_30584] 2.4 kg at 6 months compared 
to a 0.9 -kg gain in the control group (p < .01) ( 36). This Red foods monitoring approach was well 
received  and will be adapted to the needs of type 2 diabetes in th is study.  
 
Another pi[INVESTIGATOR_31220]. The WELL Body study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of tw o 6-month 
interventions that used wireless scales, with or  without activity trackers, and focused on daily self-
weighing (DSW) to promote weight gain prevention among African American breast cancer survivors. 
African American women (n=35) were randomized t o one of three groups: 1) DSW + activity tracking 
(INT+); 2) DSW (INT); or 3) delayed intervention control (CON). Intervention participants received a 
wireless scale and activity tracker (INT+ only) that transferred objective data to a mobile app and websi te, email lessons on weight control, and tailored feedback  on objective weight (and activity data). 
The intervention encouraged use of DSW as the primary self -monitoring strategy to prevent weight gain. 
Participants in the INT+ group additionally were enco uraged to track their physical activity daily. At 6 
months , 62.5% of intervention participants were at/below baseline weight; those who weighed 6 -7 
days/week (n=10; 42%) lost more weight than those who weighed <6 days/week ( -4.9±6.3% vs. -
0.3±2.6%, p=0.02) . Intervention groups maintained weighing frequency over t he study period,  
with no decreases from week 1 to 24 (INT+, p=0.41; INT, p=0.14). Both intervention groups endorsed 
being very likely to continue DSW after the program and had favorable experiences  with the scales, 
trackers and DSW (easy to do, easy to re member, helpful, positive) ( 20).  
 
In this study, we will explore the feasibility of daily monitoring of BG  and weight , self -monitoring of 
diet using the simplified Traffic Light system, self-monito ring of physical activity using a Fitbit 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  13 tracker, and appr opriate displays of data  in the app  to facilitate comprehension and decision making  
to meet the needs of this patient population . It is hypothesized that the positive feedback achieved 
through the s elf-regulation loop results in improvements in feelings of control and goal attainment, 
which reinforce behaviors over time, resulting in sustainable behavior change  and weight loss . 
  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
Emotional distress or Embarrassment (infrequent) . We believe that potenti al psychological risks to 
participants are small. It is possible that some participants may find questions included in the 
questionnaires to be slightly emotionally distressing or embarrassing.  Additionally, a participant may be 
embarrassed if friends, fam ily, or acquaintances find out that the person is participating in or not 
successful in the program. However, these instances should be mild and rare to infrequent as they have 
the right to ref use to answer any questions. Participants will be encouraged to  contact [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_31221] a result of study participation. As 
this is a voluntary study, a participant is free to exit the st udy at any point if they feel uncomfortable or 
do not want to c ontinue.  
  
Breach of confidentiality (infrequent).  We expect a breach of confidentiality to be rare or infrequent. 
Most communication during the study period will take place via telephone, dire ct emails, or through the 
smartphone app either to deliver ques tions, conduct assessments, or remind participants to complete 
questionnaires. We do not anticipate any risks of harm as a result of these communications, however there is always a possibility that their scale data, tracker data, or activity in the app will be intercepted.  
  
Steps to Ensure Confidentiality of Participants:  All data records related to a participant’s involvement in 
this research study will be stored in a locked file cabinet and/o r in encrypted files on servers that adhere 
to the University p olicy on storage and transmission of sensitive data. Participant identity on these 
records will be indicated by [CONTACT_31258], and the information linking these numbers with participant identity  will be kept separate from the research records. In addition, all research databases will have 
password -controlled  access, and this will be controlled by [CONTACT_31259].   
  
The Fitbit API [INVESTIGATOR_31222]' scale, activity trac ker, and Fitbit app. During 
the consent process, participants w ill consent for the data from their specific device IDs to be accessed 
by [CONTACT_31260]. They will need to enter their Fitbit username [CONTACT_31311]. The study smartphone app uses a Standard OAuth 2.0 
security model for logging in to Fitbit. The study uses temporary access tokens that are stored only on 
the user's device and is not stored on our servers. Therefore, Fitbi t usernames and passwords will not be 
stored in any way with th is study. Instead, the weight and tracker data will be connected to participants 
by [CONTACT_31261]. Data are transmitted on 
secure servers that adhere to the University of North Carolina at Chap el Hill policy on Sensitive Data. The 
risk of breach of confidentiality over the Fitbit websites will be partly subject to each individual’s 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  14 comfort in sharing information in their individual p rofile. To further minimize the risk of breach of 
confidentiality, all participant activities on the Fitbit websites will be voluntary. Consent forms will also 
clearly communicate the risk of this type of disclosure to participants.  
  
There are no major ph ysical risks associated with participation in the study, which involves using a smart 
scale, activity tracker and glucose monitor, or the data collection visits.  
  
1. Risks of physical activity:  Infrequent risk. It is possible that participants may increas e their physical 
activity in response to data and feedback view ed on the activity tracker. There may be some risk to 
increasing physical activity, including, but not limited to, injuries to the muscles, ligaments, tendons,  and 
joints of the body. Other ris ks include abnormal blood pressure, fainting, dizziness, disord ers of heart 
rhythm, exacerbation of exercise -induced asthma symptoms, and very rare instances of heart attack, 
stroke, or even death. To help ensure safety, information on exercise safety will be provided to all 
participants.  
  
Minimization of risks:  To e nsure medical readiness to begin physical activity, participants will complete a 
physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR -Q). The PAR -Q assesses for the following medical 
conditions: heart problems, chest pains, faintness or dizzy spells, high b lood pressure, bone,  or joint 
problems such as arthritis that has been or could be aggravated by [CONTACT_14759], prescription medication 
use, and other medical reasons why exercise would not be advisable. Participants endorsing yes to any 
items on the PAR -Q (exp erien ce of heart problems, frequent chest  pains, faintness or dizziness, bone or 
joint problems, on prescription medications for blood pressure or a heart condition) will be excluded from the study.   
 
We also will monitor any major musculoskeletal problems  that develop during the intervention ( e.g.,  
broken bones) using a medical events questionnaire at [ADDRESS_30585] safe participation will be instructed to stop exercising until the problem resolves and their 
physician approves resumption of physical activity.  
  
Participation is fully voluntary, and we will ask participants to report any problems to the study 
researche rs. 
  
2. Risk of wearable devices:  There is also the possibility of minor skin irritation associated with wearable 
devices.  
 Minimization of risk: We will recommend taking the device off occasionally, not wearing it too tightly, 
and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_31223] y. If participants experience skin irritation, we will suggest that they contact a

  15 3. Risk of using a phone while driving:  It is d anger ous to pay attention to a cellular phone while driving, 
walking,  or doing any activity that requires attention.  
  
Minimization of risk:  We will strongly recommend that participants exercise good judgment on this 
while participating in this study and w ill ask that they not open the application or view any notifications 
or messages while they are driving.  
  
4. Risk of CGM:  There is a small risk that the adhesive used to attach the sensor to the arm will cause 
skin irritation.  
 
Minimization of risk: Through in structions on usage of the CGM will be provided to the participant at the 
beginning of the study. Proper placement and care will be emphasized and, if irritation does occur, 
participants will be instructed to discontinue use of the sensor and ale rt the stu dy staff.  
  
5. Risk of finger stick:  Approximately [ADDRESS_30586] 
method used to obtain blood for routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31224]. The participant may experience pain 
when the lancet goes in to their f inger. Other than this momentary pain, the discomfort of finger stick 
should be minimal. However, in about 10% of the cases a small amount of bleeding under the skin will 
produce a bruise (hematoma). A small scar may persist for several weeks. Th e risk of local infection is 
less than 1 in 1,000.  
  
Minimization of risk:  Staff are trained in the sanitary collection of blood using gloves, preppi[INVESTIGATOR_31225], having the participant apply pressure to the finger after the finger stic k and 
appl ication of a bandage if needed.  
  
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
This study may help researchers understand the acceptability of CGM in a pre -diabetes and T2D 
population and determine if incorporating daily monitoring of BG within the context of a behavior al 
weight loss intervention promotes self -regulation and adherence to lifestyle changes necessary for 
weight loss. Given the widespread prevalence of T2D and obesity, this study could inform larger trials 
that could lead to clinical recommendatio ns. 
 The b enefits of participation in a short -term program that includes weighing, increasing physical activity, 
and dietary changes may include weight loss and short -term improvements in activity and eating. 
Increased physical activity and healthier eatin g can also  lead to other improvements in health, such as 
improved cardiovascular outcomes. Better glucose control (over time) could result in fewer vascular 
complications.  
2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during weekly individual coaching sessions.

  22 All participants will be required to obtain consent from their primary care provider in order to 
participate.  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
During this study, participants are asked to:  
• Refrain from using over -the-counter medications , dietary supplements, and prescribed 
medications for the purposes of weight loss; however, they will not be withdrawn if use is reported. Medication usage will be assessed at the pre- enrollment screening and change in 
medications, as  well as adverse medical events, will be assessed at the 12 -week study visit and 
documented in the Medical Events questionnaire.
  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not subsequently assigned to the stud y intervention or entered in the study.   An example of a screen failure 
would be a participant who comes for the baseline assessment and does not meet the eligibility criteria (such as a BMI or HbA1c that is out of eligible  range).   
If the participant does  not meet inclusion criteria, staff will inform the individual  that they do not meet 
criteria for this particular study and ask if they would be interested in being contact[CONTACT_31263].  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Recruitment  
Participants meeting diagnostic  criteria for Type 2 diabetes (no t treated by [CONTACT_12617]) and prediabetes 
will be recruited from the community through informational listservs, as well as through the UNC Health 
Care system using lists generated by [CONTACT_31264].  
  
If needed, we will use the UNC Informationa l listserv and boosted Facebook posts to advertise as well. 
Interested participants will be directed to a web page with study information. If they wish to determine 
their eligibility, they will complete an online REDCap screening questionnaire. Participant s initially 
eligible on the web screen will be contact[CONTACT_31265].  
 All recruitment advertisements will encourage potential participants to visit a website with study 
information (purpose, eligibility criteria, time commitment, and in centives). The recruitment website 
will also have a link to a preliminary online screening questionnaire, which directs participants to a 
secure REDCap survey. Initial screening of basic eligibility and demographics will be done online, 
including questions  on age, race/ethnicity, height, weight, basic health history, type [ADDRESS_30597]: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30598] the individual by [CONTACT_31266]. Individuals who are ineligible will be 
notified via email.  
  
All individuals who respond to our advertising will be eligible for enrollment independent of gender and 
race/ethnicity. As women a re generally over- represented in weight control studi es, we do not anticipate 
having inadequate representation by [CONTACT_31267]. Also, given the diversity of the patient population in the UNC system and similar (if not higher) rates of overweight among minorities,  access to participation will 
not be limited for  thes e groups.  
  
Enrollment  
Once an individual has been deemed potentially eligible to participate, they will be invited to the clinic 
for an orientation to the study where study staff will provide further in formation about the study and 
allow the potential participants to ask questions. This procedure, whereby [CONTACT_31268] a chance to determine if the study is a good fit for them, has been effective in our past studies for high 
rates of retenti on. If the individual decides to participate, they will provide informed consent for 
participation. They will have their height, weight, and HbA1c measured and complete questio nnaires. 
After completion of the baseline assessments, the in-person individual sessions will begin.  
 
COVID -19 Modifications:  
Orient ation sessions were delivered via Zoom after March 15, 2020. If the individual decides to 
participate, study staff will send an email link to the Informed Consent Form for the study participant to 
review  and electronically sign in REDCap. Once the consent is signed, the online study questionnaires 
will be deployed to the  participant. Once questionnaires are complete, the participant will be scheduled 
to attend the baseline assessment visit at the clinic a nd to attend the kickoff session.  
  
Incentives  
Partic ipants will receive $15 for completing the baseline assessment and $[ADDRESS_30599]: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0

goal (weight loss goal) and, depending upon the comparison, make changes to their die t (i.e., G reen 
foods or Red foods) or physical activity (i.e., moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) or sedentary behavior  (SB)) as needed. All participants are given an initial weight loss goal of 5%.  
 
Dietary Intervention   
Participants are guide d to follo w a Traffic Light Diet approach where  foods are categorized into Green, 
Yellow , and Red categories. Users are encouraged to increase Green foods, moderate Yellow foods, and 
limit Red foods. Foods in the Green category include fruits, vegetables and certain  very lean proteins . 
They are low in calories, fat , and sugar , and rich in nutr ients. The high volume, water content and fiber 
in fruits and vegetables and the protein from the lean meats and egg whites in this category help 
promote satiety while consuming fewer calories. The Yellow category includes moderately lean proteins, 
legumes , low fat dairy, whole grains, starchy vegetables, and low fat dressings. These foods are higher in 
calories than green food but are still a good source of nutrients. Red foods are high in calories, fat, 
and/or sugar and are not a good source of nutrients.  The goal in the Traffic Light Diet is to increase 
Green foods and to limit Red foods. This emphasis on increasing healthful eating has been hypothesized 
to reduce feelings of d eprivation and hunger ( 37,38 ). In the Traffic Light approach followed in this s tudy, 
users are allowed unlimited Green foods  and are not given a specific  target for Yellow food servings.  
 Each participant is given a personalized Red foods limit , which is determined by  [CONTACT_31269]. The 
intent of the goal is to  result in  a caloric reduction  of [ADDRESS_30601] the option to set a goal for Green and/or Yellow foods and have the participant 
monitor those in the app , and/or to re duce the participant ’s Red Food limit  if weight loss is not

then daily goal increases by 5, to 20 min/day. But if participant only go t 60 min, then their daily 
goal for the new week would stay at 15 min/day  
 
Intervention app  
During the first individual session, the interventionist will work with the participant to download the app 
onto the participant’s smartphone, familiarize them with the app, and set personal goals for weight, diet 
and physical activity, and BG monitoring.  
• Weight Goal and Monitoring: Participants will be provided a Withings Wi- Fi Smart Scale digital 
scale and instructed on setup and procedures for daily weighing.  
• Dietary Goal and Monitoring : Interventionists instruct on the Red foods list and monitoring of  
Red foods in the app. They will be instructed on portion size estimation and self -monitoring best 
practices (timing proximal to consumption). During the first we ek, participants will be advised to 
monitor all of their foods  and work towards meeting their daily Red food goal.  
• Physical Activity Goal and Monitoring: Participants will be provided with a Fit bit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_31226] f or data transfer. They will receive a weekly physical

Protocol  28 May  2020 
  26 activity goal b ased on baseline physical  activity reported on the online screener . Participants will 
also be advised on using the Fit bit to monitor sedentary time and to target sedentary behavior 
throughout the day.  
• BG Goals and Monitoring: Participants will be provided with an Abbott Freestyle  Libre device , 
which is a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) unit. Recent advances in technology have 
made CGM much less invasive and simplified, thereby [CONTACT_31270] g for a better pi[INVESTIGATOR_31227] e burden that previous CGM units 
presented. The interventionist will work with the participant to set goals for monitoring and 
ensure comprehension of CGM procedu res. Study participants will be instructed on placement 
of the CGM sensor on the back of the a rm. The sensor is worn for 14 days continuously, and 
then replaced. T he participant will scan the sensor using a handheld device  or iPhone  at 
different points thr oughout the day (upon waking, before meals, 1 ½ -  2 hours after meals, but 
no less than every 8 hours ) and to “mark” eating and activity events in the scanning device or 
iPhone app . The data will be uploaded to the Freestyle Libre system . The study interventionist 
will have access to the data through a web -based portal and will review this informat ion with 
the participant at weekly coaching sessions. Participants will be taught to interpret their blood 
glucose information and to use it to inform diet and ph ysical activity behaviors.   
• Feedback: The app provides graphic al feedback comparing goals to b ehaviors and a weekly 
feedback message from the counselor that encourages adherence to the goals of daily weighing, 
monitoring and meeting Red foods and physical activity goals. For the purposes of this study, more rigorous intervention feedback will be de livered by [CONTACT_31271].  
 
Behavioral Lessons  
A standard behavioral intervention based on the DPP (used by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tate effectively in both  face to 
face and Internet formats) will be adapted for this protocol. Behavioral weight control approaches are founded on teaching skills and providing the support necessary to enable participants to adhere 
to the diet and physical activity prescription in their intervention. For the dietary intervention, 
materials will be adapted to reflect the T raffic Light Diet focus and modules for decreasing sedentary 
behavior will be added to those for increasing MVPA. Materials will be adapted with a focus on T2D. 
Additional materials and activities will be added specifically on self- regulation of weight and  BG in 
relation to diet and physical activity behaviors . Lessons will be presented within the app. Brief 
review of the content will be done  during individual sess ions to assess comprehension and to 
explore personal applications.  
 
Coaching Support  
Individual counseling sessions will be semi -structured and led by [CONTACT_31272]’s level or higher 
interventionists trained in behavioral weight control. Sessions will occur week ly (12 sessions) and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] [ADDRESS_30603] 4 weeks of the study, all sessions will be conducted at the 
UNC Weight Research Program clinic. Participants will be encouraged to attend in -person sessions 
for the duration of the study,  how ever they will be given the option to complete the remaining 8 
sessions through phone or video chat (Zoom) if desired.  (Note: the remote mode of delivery became 
the primary delivery mode due to COVID -19 restrictions. )   
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30604] TRAINING AND TRACKING  
 
To ensure intervention fidelity, study meetings  will be held weekly. At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss issues relevant to study progress, including en rollment, participant safety (adverse 
events), participant retention, and protocol compliance. Summaries of the team meeting minutes will  be 
available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_31273] a nd the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight of the Office of 
Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, or th e North Carolina TraCS Institute Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND  BLINDING   
This is a single arm study. Therefore, randomization is not applicable.  
 
Due to the size of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_31229] -[ADDRESS_30605] will review self- monitoring 
records with the participant, set weekly goals, review behavioral lesson content introduced in the app,  
facilitate problem solving of any barriers the participant is having, and adapt treatment 
recommendations based on the  needs of the participant.  
  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
For this protocol, participants will be discouraged from using over -the-counter medications and dietary 
supplements, and prescribed medications  for the purposes of weight loss ; however, they will not be 
withdrawn if use is reported.  Medication usage will be assessed at the pre -enrollment  screening and

7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINU ATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  Participants 
will be withdrawn from the study should they experie nce greater than minimal risk as described in 
section 2.3.  
In addit ion, an investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance, unless varying compliance is an aspect of the 
study objectives   
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130] (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
• Participants who become pregnant during the study , as weight loss is contraindicated.  
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued co llection of follow -
up study data would not be in the best interest of the participant or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not p reviously 
recognized) that precludes further study partici pation  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case 
Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do n ot receive 
the study intervention may be replaced.   Subjec ts who sign the informed consent form, and are 
randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from 
the study, will not be replaced.  
The research team will provide continuous monitoring of participant safety an d periodic reporting to the 
UNC IRB as required, including any Unanticipated Problems/Severe Adverse Events that may have 
occurred during the study. Data safety and monitoring activities continue un til all participants have 
completed trials and until all p articipants have been followed to the point at which study -related 
adverse events would likely no longer be encountered.

8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Note: Refer to the Schedule of Activities 1.3 for the timing and frequency of assessments.  
  
Screening and Orientation  
Screening, orientation, and enr ollment procedures are described in section 5.5. At each point , study 
staff will confirm eligibility, as described. The participant has the choice to discontinue participation at 
any point. If participation is discontinued by [CONTACT_31274], scre ening information will be held 
for the duration of the study and identifiers will be destroyed after the study is complete. Reasons for 
ineligibility will be retained for descriptive purposes.  
 
Physical Measurements  
Weight (kg) (primary outcome) : Participants will be weighed wearing shorts and without shoes using a 
calibrated digital Tanita scale. Trained study staff will conduct these measurements following a standardized protocol. Two measures will be completed and the average of the two will be used.  If the 
difference between the two measures exceeds 0.[ADDRESS_30609] measure will be taken.  
  
Height (cm) : Height will be measured at baseline using a wall- mounted stadiometer (Country 
Technology Inc, WI). Two measures of height will be taken and the average of  the two will be used. If the 
two measures are not within 0.[ADDRESS_30610] measurement will be taken  
  
BMI:  Height and weight will be used to calculate BMI.  
  
HbA1c  will be measured with a fingerstick and analy zed on a point of care unit (Afinion Alere).  
   
REDCap  questionnaires:  
Demographics.  Participants will provide demographic information at baseline. They will provide age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, weight, and smoking history. (Baseline only)  
 
Diabetes Specific Locus of Control.   
We will administer an 18 -item q uestionnaire consisting of three domains measuring diabetes -specific 
internal locus of control, powerful other locus of control, and chance locus of control (39).

align with our population and research aims  (41).  
 
Personal Diabetes Questionnaire.  This questionnaire will be used both as a secondary outcome to test 
the effect of the intervention as well as an assessment tool to inform the  counselor at baseline in order 
to personalize the intervention. The following scales will be used: Weight Change Readiness  Dietary 
Knowledge and Skills, Diet Decision Making, Eating Problems. Diet Barrie rs, Physical Activity, and 
Exercise Barriers. This i s a validated measure of diabetes self- care behaviors, perceptions and barriers  
(42).  
 
Technology Acceptance Model -Continuous Glucose Monitoring.  This survey assesses usability and 
predictors of adherence to using the CGM device. Subscales include perceiv ed reliability, information 
overload, technology -related self- efficacy, usefulness, ease of use, attitude, visibility of body change, 
and intentio n. We have added an item to assess helpfulness with weight management (in addition to 
blood sugar control)  (43). 
  
Program Satisfaction . Participants will be asked to complete a post -treatment program evaluation. 
Questions will ask about participants’ perc eptions and experiences with the intervention and may 
provide valuable information about how to modify the pro grams for future use in this population. 
Participants will be asked to report their overall satisfaction with the intervention they received. Addi tional satisfaction questions will assess specific treatment components including the topi[INVESTIGATOR_31230]- monitoring. Post -intervention only . 
  
Feasibility Measures . Adherence to digital scale use; activity tracking and physical activity patterns 
captured by [CONTACT_31275]; Blood Glucose monitoring and outcomes ; Red food monitoring; and attendance 
at individual counseling sessions will be tracked.  
 
Medical Events.  Adverse medical events and changes to me dications will be assessed at 12 weeks  (staff 
administered).  
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
Safety managemen t in this study is intended to achieve 4 objectives: 1) to minimize the occurrence of 
adverse effects; 2) to effectively manage adverse events as they relate to the study; 3) to identify when 
the intervention should be suspended because of concerns for par ticipant safety; and 4) to determine 
when the intervention may be resumed after having been suspended.  
  
Should any concerns arise during data col lection, they will be addressed immediately by [CONTACT_31276] [INVESTIGATOR_31231] . Though unlikely, should any concerns arise after data

  33 collection, subjects will be given the study coordinator's contact [CONTACT_31277] [INVESTIGATOR_31232]. Any concerns that arise over the 
course of the study will be recorded and aggregated as part of the feasibility data and shared with the 
research team and the IRB as n ecessary.  
 
We do not anticipate that any questions, anthropometric measurements, observations will cause 
disco mfort or embarrassment, but participants may stop or refuse collection of data at any time. 
Participants will be informed of potential safety risks in the informed consent.  
 The research team will provide continuous monitoring of participant safety and periodic reporting to the 
UNC IRB as required, including any Unanticipated Problems/Severe Adverse Events that may have occurred during th e study. Data safety and monitoring activities continue until all participants have 
completed trials and until all partic ipants have been followed to the point at which study -related 
adverse events would likely no longer be encountered.  
  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENT S AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
  
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
This protocol uses the definition of adverse event  from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered 
intervention -related . 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE ) 
A possible SAE is any event that may meet the fo llowing criteria (complete one SAE form for each 
event):  
a. An event that was life threatening, or placed the participant at immediate risk of death  
b. An event that caused persistent or significant disability or  incapacity (lasted at least one month 
and changed  the participant’s life)  
c. An event that required or prolonged a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. A pregnancy that resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
e. Death  
f. An event that caused other significant hazards or poten tially serious harm to research subjects 
or others  
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  34 8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity .  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment a nd do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a parti cipant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term “severe” do es not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, 
assessed by [CONTACT_9152] -trained clinician based on temporal relat ionship and his/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty a bout causality will be graded using the categories below.   
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
proced ures and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study procedures and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possib ility that the study procedures caused the event, 
there is no te mporal relationship between the study procedures and event onset, or an 
alternate etiology has been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
A clinician with appropriate expertise in behavior and physiological adaptation will be responsible for 
determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previou sly described for the study procedures.  
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQU ENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study assessment visits a nd individual coaching sessions.  
 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  35 All AEs, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the appropriate adverse events 
form. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relatio nship to study procedures (assessed only by [CONTACT_31278] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will 
be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs  will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duratio n of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_31233].  
 
Kristen Polzien will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained 
until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.   At each study 
visit, the study team  will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.   Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The research tea m will report to the UNC IRB as required, including any Unanticipated Problems /Severe 
Adverse Events that may have occurred during the study. Data safety and monitoring activities continue until all participants have completed the trial and until all participants have been followed to the point 
at which study -related adverse events would likely no longer be encountered.

Protocol  28 May  2020 
  36 8.4 UNANTICIPA TED PROBLEMS  
  
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_31279] (OHRP).   OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participant s or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents,  such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant populati on being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related ” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Sugge sts that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical , psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanatio n of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DC C/study 
sponsor/funding agency within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event   
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor/funding agency within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator becoming aware of the problem

study intervention.    
The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol:  
• Participant informed consent  
• Physician's consent  
• Online screener  
• Telephone screener  
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
If the participant is deemed eligible and decides to participate, the participant will complete the consent 
form on -site or the study staff will send a link to the study participant to read and electronically sign the 
consent in REDCap.  
  
All participants are required  to obtain consent to participate from t heir Primary C are Provider.

Protocol  28 May  2020 
  41 To ensure confidentiality of participants, all survey data and scale/tracker/dietary records related to a 
participant’s involvement in this research study will be stored in encrypted files on servers that adhere 
to the University policy on storage and transmission of sensitive data. Particip ant identity on these 
records will be indicated by [CONTACT_31258], and the information linking these numbers with participant 
identity will be kept separate from the research records. In addition, all research databases will have 
password -controlled  access, and this will be controlled by [CONTACT_31259].  
  
All data records related to a participant’s involvement in this research study will be stored in a locked file cabinet and/or in encrypted files on servers that adhere to the University policy on storage and  
transmission of sensitive data. Participant identity on these records will be indicated by [CONTACT_31258], 
and the infor mation linking these numbers with participant identity will be kept separate from the 
research records. In addition, all research databas es will have password -controlled  access, and this will 
be controlled by [CONTACT_31259].   
 
The Fitbit API [INVESTIGATOR_31235] t o access data from participants' scale, activity tracker, and Fitbit app. During 
the consent process, participants will consent for the d ata from their specific device IDs to be accessed 
by [CONTACT_31260]. They will need to enter their Fitbit username [CONTACT_31312]. The study smartphone ap p uses a Standard Auth 2.0 
security model for logging in to Fitbit. The study uses temporary access tokens that are stored only on the user's devic e and is not stored on our servers. Therefore, Fitbit usernames and passwords will not be 
stored in any way with this study. Instead, the  weight and tracker data will be connected to participants 
by [CONTACT_31280] e app setup process. Data are transmitted on 
secure servers that adhere to University policy on Sensitive Data. The risk of breach of con fidentiality 
over the Fitbit websites will be partly subject to each individual’s comfort in sharing information in the ir 
individual profile. To further minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality, all participant activities on 
the Fitbit websites will be voluntary. Consent forms will also clearly communicate the risk of this type of 
disclosure to participants

10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). The noncompliance may be 
either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, 
corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].   
  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:   
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3   
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1   
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_30621] (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator will be responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.

10.2 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
During the 12 -week study, participants will monitor their blood glucose using the Abbott Freestyle Libre 
Continuous Glucos e Monitoring system. For the CGM, a representative of the device manufacturer 
(Abbott) will train research staff to instruct study participants on the use of the device. The device is 
commercially available and measures blood  sugar without the need for fin ger sticks. It involves 
placement of a sensor on the upper arm and use of a scanning device to "read" the sensor.  Use of the 
device is considered ‘off -label’ for individuals without diabetes.  
  
The study interventionists in t his study are trained in  behavi oral weight control, have served this role in 
weight control interventions in the lab for 5 –  15 years, and are Master’s  or PhD level in Health Behavior, 
Nutrition (and Registered Dietitian), or Exercise Physiology.

CONCISE SUMMARY  
This is a research study to test the effectiveness of a weight loss program that uses digital tools to 
help adults with t ype [ADDRESS_30641] their height, weight and HbA1c measured.  They will complete  
questionnaires about their health and lifestyle at the beginning of the study and again at the end 
of the study (after 3 months).  These procedures will take approximately 30 minutes.  
Parti cipants will visit the clinic to get their digital tools (study a pp, a digital scale, an activity 
tracker and a Continuous Glucose Monitor, which is a small sensor worn on the back of the arm 
continuously and replaced every 14 days) and meet with a study c oach who will teach them how 
to use the tools and to get started making changes to their physical activity and diet.  This first 
visit will take 2 hours.  Participants will use the tools for 12 weeks.  Each week, participants will 
meet (remotely) with the study coach who will review their progress and set goals for the coming 
week.  These visits will take 30 -45 minutes.   
 
Some participants will be invited to complete a 1 -1 1/[ADDRESS_30642]: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0

app or from a computer.  For each of these devices, you will give permission for the research study staff to have access to your data.     
 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  53 Study staff will help you set up the Fitbit, install the study’s smartphone app on your iPhone, and 
will give you instructions on how to set up the scale at home. They will also instruct you on using your glucose monitoring system.  In addition, staff will give you instructions on making changes to your diet and physical activity to help you lose weight and manage your blood sugar.   
12-week Study Period : During the [ADDRESS_30645].  It is anticipated that you will spend no more than 10- 15 minutes per 
day tracking your foods and using the study app. You may receive text  messages throughout the 
study for various reasons, which may include reminding you to sync your Fitbit, track your 
foods, or return to the study app if you haven’t used it in a few days. You will receive no more than [ADDRESS_30646] r emotely (video 
conference “zoom” or phone call).  There will be a total of [ADDRESS_30647] 30 – 45 minutes.   
Final Assessment :  After the 12 weeks of the weight loss program, you will repeat the measures 
you completed at the beg inning of the study.  This will include a set of online questionnaires that 
will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and a final weight and HbA1c measurement. The measurements will take no more than 15 minutes.  If you complete your final assessment, you will be able to keep your Fitbit and scale.  You will be asked to return the CGM scanner.  
You may be invited to complete a 60- 90 minute interview about your experience during the 
study.  If you decide to participate in the interview, you will sign an additional consent form and will receive an additional incentive.  
What are the possible benefits from being in this study ?  
Research is designed to benefit society by [CONTACT_31283]. You may also expect to benefit by [CONTACT_31284]. Your participation may help you lose weight, and c ould experience 
improvements in physical health associated with weight loss and making healthier choices. However, there is no guarantee that any or all of the se changes will occur as a result of you 
participating in this study.    
What are the possible ri sks or discomforts involved from being in this study?  
There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks. You should report any problems to the researcher.  
 
Risks of Increasing Physical Activity. 
There may risks associated with increasing physical activity, including, but not limited to, injuries to the muscles or joints of the body. Other risks include abnormal blood pressure, fainting, dizziness, disorders of heart rhythm, exacerbation of exercise -induced asthma 
symptoms, and very rare instances of heart a ttack, stroke, or even death. To help ensure your 
safety, the study will follow guidelines and safety recommendations for physical activity set forth by [CONTACT_31285]. The study will provide you with information 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30648] to start becoming more physically active is to begin slowly and build 
up gradually. During this study, you will receive information on exercise safety. These are not intended to be a substitute for consultation with your personal physician and/or health care 
provider. You may want to talk with your doctor by [CONTACT_31286]. You should report any problems to the researchers.  
 
Risks associated with Questionnaires  
As part of the  study, you will be asked about personal factors related to your weight related 
behaviors and hea lth. You may feel uncomfortable while completing the surveys, because of the 
personal nature some of the questions. You can elect not to share this private inf ormation. You 
should contact [CONTACT_31287] a 
result of study participation. 
 
Risk of Breach in Confidentiality 
This would mean that a person or persons outside the study team will find out that you are participating in this study and/or access the information you share with the study. This is a very rare possibility. In -person assessments will take place in our study offices. The only study data 
stored on your phone will be foods you have tracked in your food log that have not yet been transferred to the study server (i.e. your food log is s tored on your phone when you do not have 
an internet connection, but is transferred to the server as soon as you receive access to an internet connection and t hen deleted from your phone). Though the likelihood is very rare, it is possible 
that your data c ould be accessed by [CONTACT_31288]. In addition, there is a possibility that others may see your smartphone communications, including notifications or messages when the application is open, or s ee an 
open webpage while you are completing online questionnaires. If you would like, you may set up 
a passcode on your mobile phone to help prevent unauthoriz ed access to your device, text 
messages, and research data. Additional information on how your st udy records will be kept 
private is written below.  
 Fitbit: You will also receive a Fitbit activity tracker. This device requires use of the companion Fitbit w ebsite and smartphone app. This is protected by a unique user login and password. 
Though you will need to enter your Fitbit username [CONTACT_31314], we will not store your Fitbit username [CONTACT_31315]. In your Fitbit account settings, you will give permission for your Withings scale data to sync to your Fitbit account.  All website information on your ac tivity and weight data that are accessed by [CONTACT_31289].   The risk of brea ch of confidentiality over the Fitbit website will be partly subject to your comfort 
with sharing information on your individual profile. Fitbit will have access to the data that you 
choose to track within the Fitbit app/website and the information you choose to include on your individual Fitbit profile, but they will not have access to any other information about you that is collected as part of the research study.

data that you choose to track within the app/website and the information you choose to include on your individual profile, but they will not have access to any other  information about you that 
is collected as part of the research study.    
 
Risk of Wearing Fitbit Ac tivity Tracker  
There is also the possibility of minor skin irritation associated with wearable devices. We recommend taking it off occasionally, not weari ng it too tightly, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_31245]. 
You should regularly clean your wearable device —especially after working out or sweating. 
Rinse the wearable device with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do NOT use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, or household cleaners which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate skin. Alwa ys dry the wearable device well before putting it back on. 
If you start to experience skin irritation on your wrist, we suggest you remove the device and contact a member of the study team to discuss the issue and determine whether you would like to 
continue participating in the study.  
Risk of CGM : There is a small risk that the adhesive used to attach the sensor to the arm will 
cause skin irritation.     Yo u will be provided with instructions on how to properly place the 
sensor.  If excessive irritation does occur, you should remove the sensor and contact [CONTACT_464].   
Risk of finger stick:   When you complete your baseline and follow -up assessment, you will  have 
your HbA1c measured.  Approximately [ADDRESS_30650] method used to obtain blood for routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31224]. You may experience 
a small amount of pain when the lancet goes in to your finger.  Other than this momentary pain, the discomfort of finger stick should be minimal. However, in about 10% of the cases a small amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise (hematoma). A small scar may persist for several weeks. The risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1,000.  The site will be cleaned with an alcohol wipe prior to the fi nger stick to minimize this risk.  
There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks. You should report any problems to the researcher.  
 
What if you are a UNC employee?  
Taking part in this research is not a part of your University duties, and refusing will not affect your job.  You will not be offered or receive any special job- related consideration if you take part 
in this research.  
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type [ADDRESS_30651] you anythin g to be in this study?  
It will not cost you anything to be in this study.  
What if we learn about new f indings or information during the study?  
You will be given any new information gained during the course of the study that might affect 
your willingness t o continue your participation. While you are continuously tracking your blood 
sugar, you may see previ ously unknown high or low blood sugar epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Both you and your 
coach will have access to this information on a daily basis. This information could benefit you so that you can work with the study coach and/or your primary care provider to better manage your blood sugar. 
Will I receive any other clinical results?  
Other clinically relevant results of this research will be communicated with you.  You will receive a report of your weight and HbA1c (which measures longer -term blood sugar 
management) at the b eginning of the study and at the end.  
 
How will information about you be protected?  
The study team will store any personal information you provide, your Wi -Fi scale and tracker 
data, and your location data in secure databases that comply with the Universi ty of North 
Carolina’s policies on sensitive information storing and transmission.  T his means that there are 
very strong protections in place to keep your information from being accessed by [CONTACT_31290]. Any information that you share on paper forms will be stored with an ID that does not identify you personally and will be kept in locked file cabinets only accessible to study staff.  Information you share through online questionnaires uses a secure server that complies with the University security policies.  You will be asked to voluntarily allow the study team to access your Fitbit data through the Fitbit website by [CONTACT_31291]. The study staff member who helps set up your devices will allow you to create and enter your Fitbit username [CONTACT_31316]. 
Your usernames and passwords will not be stored by [CONTACT_31292].  
 You will not be identified in any report or publication about this study. We may use de -identified 
data from this study in future research without additiona l consent  
 Although every effort will be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of such records, incl uding personal information.  This 
is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever require d, UNC -Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by 
[CONTACT_31293].  In some cases, your information in this research study could be review ed by [CONTACT_31294], research sponsors, or 
government agencies (f or example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety.  
 
Will you receive results from research involving your specimens?  
You will receive the results of your  HbA1c tests.  T he use of your samples may result in 
commercial profit.  You will not be compensated for the use of your samples other than what is described in this consent form. 
 What will happen if you are injured by [CONTACT_31295]?  
All research involves  a chance that something bad might happen to you.  This may include the 
T2 Connect: Adaptation of a Digital Weight Loss Intervention Promoting Self -regulation for Use in Type 2 Diabetes  Version 3.0 
Protocol  28 May  2020 
  57 risk of perso nal injury. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_31246], you might develop a reaction or injury

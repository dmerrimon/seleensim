Translational Neuroscience Optimization of GlyT1 Inhibitor  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_215943] D’Souza, MD  
 
Purpose:  Schizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability, principally because current treatments lack 
substantial efficacy for treating cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). Deficits in N -
methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) function are thought  to contribute to CIAS by [CONTACT_342179].  Enhancing NMDA receptor function via the glycine site may reduce 
cognitive deficits. Glycine transporter -1 inhibitors (GlyT1Is) act by [CONTACT_337880] s ynaptic glycine levels and increasing 
glycine occupancy of the high- affinity (glycine B) coagonist site of NMDA -receptor (NMDA -R) thus enhancing 
NMDA -R function. However, with higher doses of Glyt1Is there is a plateauing and/or worsening of effects 
suggest ive of an inverted ‘U’ dose response regulation of NMDA -R function. This study is designed to test the 
efficacy of two doses of active PF- 03463275 (40 mg, 60 mg) versus placebo in combination with cognitive 
remediation (CR) for the treatment of CIAS.  
 Aims :  
• Aim #1: To test  the efficacy of treatment with  two doses of PF- 03463275 (40 mg or 60 mg versus 
placebo) combined with CR to enhance cognitive function in chronic, stable, antipsychotic treated 
patients with schizophrenia as measured by [CONTACT_342180] (MCCB).  
• Aim #2:  To test the efficacy of treatment of 40mg or 60mg controlled release PF- 03463275 BID 
combined with Cognitive Remediation (CR)  in reducing the deficits in LTP observed in schizophrenia.  
 Background:  Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating illness with a prevalence of approximately 1% in the 
general population worldwide, affecting over 3.0 million individuals in the US. The World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease 2000 ranked schizophrenia as the fifth leading cause of years lived with a disability. 
Cognitive deficits, for which there are currently no proven treatments, contribute significantly to disability 
associated with schizophrenia. As stated by [CONTACT_342181], there is an urgent need to  develop effective 
treatments for cognitive impairments of schizophrenia (CIAS)  (6). The purpose of the cur rent project is to 
employ translational neuroscience approaches to optimally evaluate the efficacy of the glycine transporter -1 
inhibitor (GlyT1I), PF -03463275, that has not been fully tested and to thereby [CONTACT_342182].  
 
Computerized Cognitive Remediation is associated with improvement in cognitive test performance in 
schizophrenia patients:   We (Johannesen, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) have completed testing of [ADDRESS_423924] -size (Cohen’s d) comparisons across 
MATRICS cognitive tests from baseline to the first 4- week follow -up. Small to medium effect -sizes were 
observed across most cognitive domains in subjects receiving visual training (InSight), exceeding published practice effects (
5) on MATRICS tests  as well as effects of the auditory training (Brain Fitness) condition on all 
measures with the exception of NAB Mazes, BVMT, and WMS -III Spatial Span. These effects were obtained 
using the same visual training software (InSight, Posit Sci ence) and training intensity (5 sessions/week x 4 
weeks) as the trial proposed in the current application, therefore, we are confident that our design will have the 
same efficacy in those receiving CR + placebo and predict enhanced efficacy in the CR + act ive GlyT1I 
condition. Retention and training compliance have been excellent with 100% follow -up and subjects completing 
96%, on average, of all scheduled InSight training sessions using the incentive payment schedule described in 
this application.   
 
Human visual cortex neuroplasticity (LTP) is a biomarker of NMDA -R dependent neuroplasticity:  As reported 
by [CONTACT_342183], 2012, (13) data collected on a small sample of subjects in our laboratory show the expected 
post- stimulation enhancement of N100 ERP amplitude in healthy (aged 51, 34, 27) but not schizophrenia 
(aged 56, 32, 24) subjects (Fig. 7).  
 
Treatment with the combination of Cognitive Remediation and Glycine Site agonist in schizophrenia patients is 
both safe and feasible:  In a POC study, we (D’Souza et al) have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of 
combining pharmacotherapy with CR in patients with schizophrenia. Chronic, stable, antipsychotic treated 
patients (n=104) with schizophrenia received the glycine site agonis t D-Serine or placebo and CR for 12 weeks 
in a double- blind  randomized manner. Both interventions were well tolerated with a ~90 % completion rate 
(62). These results demonstrate our capacity to successfully recruit , engage and retain sufficient patients as 
proposed in this study, and also demonstrate the feasibility of combining pharmacotherapy with CR.  
 
Significance:  Schizophrenia has been ranked by [CONTACT_38375]’s Global Burden of Disease 
[ADDRESS_423925] patients with schizophrenia 
(52), precede the onset of illness, range from moderate to severe (53), are strongly correlated with functional 
outcome (54, 55) and predic t disability and vocational functioning better than positive symptoms (55). While the 
available antipsychotic treatments address the positive symptoms of the disorder, they do not reduce cognitive 
deficits. In fact, there are no approved treatments for  the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In summary, 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_342167] a significant step 
forward in the treatment of this major disorder

 Recruitment: Subjects for both phases of this study will be recruited by [CONTACT_342186], by [CONTACT_342187]. All advertisements and flyers will be reviewed and approved before use by [CONTACT_342188]. In the event 
that a subject responds to an advertisement, they will be contact[CONTACT_20238]. Subjects who contact [CONTACT_342189] a face -to-face meeting. Furthermore, the research team will reach out to local mental 
health facilities (including the Connecticut Mental Health Center) through “lunch and learns”, etc. for patient 
referrals. A lunch and learn is a meeting that research staff schedule with clinicians and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342170]. In the 
event that subjects are referred from clinics or mental health facilities, research staff will require that the subjects’ clinician contacts the subject first and then refers the s ubject to the research clinic.  
 The investigators and study personnel may work with the mental hygiene clinic to conduct pre-
screening chart reviews to determine potentially eligible subjects for this study. If a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder seems eligible, their primary clinician will be approached for a referral 
for screening. Subjects will not be contact[CONTACT_43417].  
 Informed Consent:  Subjects who may meet entry criteria will be invited to meet with the research staff, who 
will fully explain details, risks and procedures as outlined in the consent form. To ensure understanding of the 
study, the subject will be asked questions about the study procedures and the risks associated with 
participation. This process generally takes about one hour. If it appears that the study subject does not fully 
understand the study, the Principal Investigator (PI) may decide that the subject is not suitabl e for participation. 
If the subject is still interested after all questions have been answered, he/she will be asked to sign the 
informed consent form. Subjects will be informed that they can decline to participate in the study without 
penalty and will be given the opportunity to withdraw from the study prior to analysis of their data. A copy of the 
consent form will be provided to all subjects.  
 Great care will be taken to ensure that the subject is able to give informed consent. If any concern arises 
that the study subject did not fully understand the study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_342171]. This process will involve careful explanation of the consent form by a member 
of the research staff and a post - test to ensure understanding of the procedures and risks of the study. The 
subject will be required to get 75% of all questions and all the asterisked critical questions correct on a consent questionnaire in order to participate .  
 For patients with schizophrenia, family and/or non -research clinicians will be involved in the process when 
available. The patient’s primary clinician i.e. non- research clinician (if applicable) will be required to assent to 
patient’s participation. Th is is standard procedure for this clinic with all studies that involve patients.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Research Design:  This is a double- blind, placebo -controlled, within subject POC study of stable patients with 
schizophrenia randomized to either placebo or active PF- 03463275 twice daily in addition to their antipsychotic 
(except clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for [ADDRESS_423928] week of each treatment will 
represent a lead in period to evaluate the effects of medication alone on LTP and to confirm  compliance and 
tolerability. All subjects will receive cognitive remediation in addition to placebo/active PF- 03463275 for 
approximately 4 weeks each study period.  
 Per the P.I.’s discretion,  up to  14 days may be  added to a treatment period to account for extenuating 
circumstances, such as departmental closures or scheduling conflicts, which would otherwise inhibit 
completion of a period within the intended  5 weeks per study period (see procedures table, Appendix:  Table 1 ). 
For the aforementioned reason, if the subject does not successfully complete a study procedure, he or she may be asked to  repeat said procedure, a decision that will be made at the discretion of the principal 
investigator.   
 
Screening: Subjects will first undergo a phone screen to initially determine eligibility. Information collected 
during the phone screen w ill only be used in the event that the subject continues to participate in the study.  
After determining initial eligibility, research staff will provide a brief description of the research and the subject 
will present to the clinic for the screening procedures described below.  
Part I of the screening will consist of consenting and procedures necessary for medical and psychiatric 
clearance (i.e., SCID, labs, EKG, physical). Part II of the screening process will consist of history verification, and testing (i.e., assessments of intelligence and cognition). However, the procedures may need t o be divided 
differently between screening visits in cases where subjects have limited time to dedicate to the screening appointments.  Screening procedures take approximately [ADDRESS_423929]:  
1. The subject will receive a full, written explanation of study procedures and sign a consent form. The 
subject will be required to successfully complete a questionnaire that will help us confirm their 
understanding the r isks of this study before participation. They will be given two attempts and they will 
be required to answer all questions correctly. Any questions will be answered and a physician or nurse 
will be available to answer any medical questions.  
2. Subjects will r eceive a detailed evaluation including a medical history and a physical examination.  
3. A psychiatric evaluation and a Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM -IV (non- 0patient) for 
healthy controls will be conducted.  
4. Laboratory tests will include urine t oxicology and EKG.  
5. A 10-mL blood sample will collected at screening for CYP2D6 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_342172]. The whole blood will be transported to Joel Gelernter’s laboratory for standard CYP2D6 analysis.  
 
6. Intelligence will b e measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS -IV)  and will be 
added as a covariate in the neuropsychological data analysis.  
7. Handedness will be confirmed via the Edinburgh Handedness Scale  
8. Subjects will meet with a study doctor for cogni tive assessments.   
9. Subjects will be asked to identify a collateral source of information at the beginning of the screening 
process (explicitly stated in the consent form) and sign a release of information providing us permission 
to contact [CONTACT_342190].   A family member, significant other, spouse is preferred.  We then contact [CONTACT_342191] t might disqualify the subject or suggest risk to the subject. In 
instances where there are discrepancies between the information provided by [CONTACT_342192], we usually disqualify subjects.  
10. Subjects will be asked to refrain from all  illicit drugs, alcohol, caffeine and other medications for [ADDRESS_423930] days.  
 
Randomization to PF- 03463275:  Subjects will be randomized to one of two doses of the glycine transporter 
inhibitor (GlyT1I) PF- 03463275 (40 mg or 60 mg) and placebo twice daily in addition to their standing 
antipsychotic dose for two treatment periods  each lasting approximately 5 weeks. Treatment periods will be 
separated by a washout period lasting approximately 3 weeks.  Randomization will be strati fied by [CONTACT_342193] e Intelligence Quotient (WTAR estimated  FSIQ  71 -90 and >91).  Other 
variables of interest e.g., cognitive test performance (MCCB composite score), BDNF genotype, BDNF levels 
(low, medium and high), antipsychotic dose, that cannot be stratified because of  sample size limitations will be 
examined post -hoc. The dose of PF- 03463275 has been determined based upon sub -study 1: doses that 
produced  at least 10% occupancy and attenuation of Ketamine effects on  fMRI response to a spatial working 
memory task will be used in Sub- Study 2.  
 
MCCB: The MCCB (5) consists of [ADDRESS_423931] scores and percentiles for each of seven 
cognitive domains. Domains assessed include: speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working m emory 
(verbal and vis ual), verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The 
MCCB was developed by [CONTACT_342194], under NIMH contract, as a broad yet sensitive 
measure to assess cognitive change in treatment studies. The battery includes alternate test forms for 
repeated administrations. The MCCB will be administered at baseline and follow -ups. Change on the MCCB 
composite score will be calculated to assess for the overall effect of treatment, with c hange in specific cognitive 
domains including verbal and visual learning and short -term/working memory examined as exploratory 
analyses.    Visual LPT Paradigm: A visual LTP procedure ( 13, 74) will be administered as a probe of visual cortical 
neuroplasticity. In brief this paradigm consists of six experimental blocks, each of 2 min duration (Figure 12), administered during elec troencephalographic (EEG) recording. The first two blocks serve as basel ines, during 
which subjects complete a visual target detection task. A central fixation cross is replaced by [CONTACT_342195] (Figure 11, panel A) at pseudorandom order with duration of 33ms and average stimulus -onset asynchrony 
(SOA) of 1216ms (jittered 1075- 1340ms); a circular checkerboard (10.5 x 10.5cm, subtending 6
o of visual 
angle) or blue square checkerboard (17.5 x 17.5cm, subtending 10o of visual angle) against a white 
backgr ound. Each block consists of [ADDRESS_423932] presented 90% (standard) and 
the blue square checkerboard 10% (target). Subjects are instructed to keep their dominant index finger on a 
response key button and to respond as quickly as possible to the blue square checkerboard. This target 
detection task i s used to maintain alertness to the visual stimuli and target trials are not included in analysis of 
LTP. Baseline blocks are followed by a 2- minute period of visual high- frequency sti mulation (HFS), in which the 
circular checkerboard is presented alone at  a rate of 8.87Hz (113ms mean stimulus onset asynchrony; 1000 
presentations). Subjects are instructed to fix their gaze on the centrally presented “flickering” stimuli and to 
relax whi le remaining as still as possible. This rate of high- frequency stimulati on is designed to induce 
potentiation, analogous to the tetanizing stimuli in classic LTP procedures, and produces a prominent ~9Hz visual steady state response over posterior -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l electrode sites. Subjects are instructed to close their eyes 
for a [ADDRESS_423933] blocks.  
 
Risks and Benefits:  
1. Screening:  Healthy control subjects (HCS) and schizophrenic subjects (SZS) will undergo a Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM -IV conducted by a res earch assistant and a psychiatric evaluation by [CONTACT_342196][INVESTIGATOR_342173]. The diagnostic interviews may cover issues, 
which are stressful to a person, for example, questions regarding the experience of paranoid thoughts 
or social isolation. Thus, SZS may experience some distress of worsening of psychiatric symptoms.  
2. Loss of Confidentiality:  Participation in research may involve a loss of privacy and confidentiality. 
Therefore, extensive measures are in place to protect the  confidentiality of subjects.  
3. Treat ment with PF -03463275:  In clinical trials in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia, 
common risks reported include fatigue, thirst, somnolence, insomnia, headache, akathisia, tremors, nausea, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbances inc luding abdominal pain, nausea, 
constipation and diarrhea. Visual disturbances include the brightening of vision and perception of 
flashing lights and one patient with schizophrenia also reported blurring of vision. These were transient 
and not associated w ith any visual changes on further testing. Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tachycardia and 
hypotension (in one subject) were noted, but resolved without any medical intervention. One patient with schizophrenia had ventricular systoles and was noted to have a [ADDRESS_423934]/ALT levels and one subject had elevated 
glucose level attributable to treatment with PF -03463275. Thorough screening and frequent 
assessments for adverse events (See Section XI I) are in place to mitigate the risks.  Certain foods and 
medications may interfere with the metabolism of PF- 03463275 and result in very low or high drug 
levels. This may result in loss of efficacy or increased risk of adverse events. Subjects will be adv ised 
to avoid these medications and this wi ll be confirmed at each study visit. These include: Drugs or 
foods/food products that inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, 
amiodarone, cimetidine, clarithromycin, diltiazem, erythrom ycin, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, troleandomycin, and verapamil, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mibefradil, grapefruit and grapefruit juice). Drugs that induce CYP3A4 will also be excluded (for e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin and rifabutin).  
4. Long Term Potentiation -  Event Related Potentials:  There  are minimal risks associated with 
EEG/ERP recording. Traditionally, scalp abrasion has been used to improve signal impedance at the 
electrode si te. The EEG/ERP system used in this laboratory is a high- impedance system and does not 
require scalp abrasion t o obtain clean recording. A conductive gel is applied, which can be easily 
washed out of the subject’s hair with warm water. A shower facility for hair washing and sterile linens 
are available in the laboratory. Electrode caps and sensors will be washed and sterilized between subjects to minimize the risk of transmitting infection.  
5. Cognitive Remediation : There are no known physical risks associated with computer -based cognitive 
remediation. Fatigue and frustration during training are possible. If this occurs, subjects will be 
encouraged to take breaks, during which they can drink coffee or halt training for the day. Research 
staff will monitor subjects during training and may advise them to seek further treatment if symptoms 
worsen as a result of participation in the study.  
a. Reduction of Risk: Subjects will be encouraged to maintain the pace of cognitive exercises and 
not to be worried about performance. They will be encouraged and reassured. If they need a 
break, they will be encouraged to take one  and return. The cognitive remediation in this study 
allows for a flexible training schedule. If subjects appear to be getting distressed, they will have the opportunity to talk with one of the investigators and m ay even be asked to return for the 
session.  At the Learning Based recovery center, [CONTACT_342201] has enormous experience using 
cognitive remediation in patients with schizophrenia. Overall, this is tolerated very well and subjects usually find it very motivating and helpful. Some of the behavioral quest ions may be 
distressing to patients. This risk is discussed in the consent process and subjects will be reminded that they can stop at any time and can choose not to answer. In case of marked 
worsening of symptoms , they will be evaluated by a psychiatrist,  referred to their usual 
outpatient treater. Further, if indicated they may be escorted to the ER for an evaluation or 
admission as clinically indicated.  
 SAFETY  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  The safety data is reviewed after every test day, during weekly research 
team meetings, and w ill be suspended or modified if indicated.    
Adverse events will be graded in severity as follows:  
0 No a dverse event or within normal limits  
1 Mild adverse event  
2 Moderate adverse event  
3 Severe adverse event resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
4 Life-threatening or disabling adverse event  
5 Fatal adverse event  
The expected effects of Ketamine will not be recorded as adverse event s. 
Adverse events > level 3 will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours. Other adverse events will be reported to the IRB in a timely manner, using the following predefined causal relationships:  
i. Definite: Adverse event(s) will clearly be related to investi gational agent(s) or other intervention 
ii. Probable: Adverse event(s) will likely be related to investigational agent(s)  
iii. Possible: Adverse event(s) may be related to investigational agent(s)  
iv. Unlikely: Adverse event(s) will doubtfully be related to investigati onal agent(s)  
v.  Unrelated: Adverse event(s) will clearly not be related to the investigational agents(s)  
Serious, unanticipated and related adverse events will be reported to VA -HSS and Yale HIC.  
 
Informed Consent : Subjects who meet entry criteria m entioned above will be invited to meet with the research 
staff, who will fully ex plain risks and procedures as outlined in the consent form.  After reviewing this 
information and answering questions, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. The informed 
consent form (see attached), which will be given to the participating s ubjects, explains all the information

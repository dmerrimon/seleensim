Title:
A Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of 
Nem olizumab (CD14152) in Subjects with Moderate -to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis 
Investigational Product :
Nem olizumab (CD14152)
IND Number:
117122
Study Centers:
Approximately 150 study centers are planned in Europe, America s, and Asia -Pacific .
Phase:
3
Objectives:
Primary objective :The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab (CD14152) 
after a 16-week treatment period in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe atopic 
dermatitis ( AD)not adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969].
Secondary objective :The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance 
treatment with nemolizumab (CD14152) for up to an additional 32 weeks.
Study Design:
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel -group study in adult and 
adolescent subjects w ith moderate -to-severe AD. Eligible subjects must have a documented history of 
inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_197427] (s).
Approximate ly 750 total subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive either nemolizumab (CD14152 ) 
or placebo , stratified by [CONTACT_22789] (Investigator ’sGlobal Assessment [IGA];moderate :
IGA =3; severe: IGA = 4) and peak pruritus numeric rating scale ( PP NRS )severity (PPNRS ≥7; 
PPNRS < 7).A minimum of 2 50 subjects will be ran domized in each PPNRS strata .Clinical 
responders at Week 16 (ie, the end of initial treatment/beginning of maintenance) will be re-
randomized (1:1:1) to different treatment regimens (injections every  4 weeks [ Q4W]orevery 8 weeks 
[Q8W]of nemolizumab [CD14152 ]or placebo Q4W ). 
Subjects will apply  a moisturizer at least once daily , beginning at screening . Subjects will also be 
provided or prescribed background topi[INVESTIGATOR_696455] (including a medium -potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_191964] [TCS]for the body and a low-potency TCS or topi[INVESTIGATOR_73199] (TCI) for 
sensitive areas such as the face, neck, intertriginous areas, etc for use throughout the study. If deemed to 
be medically necessary by [CONTACT_093] (eg, to control intolerab le AD signs /symptoms), rescue 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_696456] ,except during the run-in period (ie, at least 
2 weeks [14 days] before Day 1 /baseline ).

treatment , maintenance, and follow -up(unless the subject is a non- respon derat Week [ADDRESS_944972] up to 28 w eeks). Refer to Figure 1 for an overview of the treatm ent/study
design.
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review and monitor subject safety throughout 
the study , and an independent adjudication committee ( IAC) w ill review all asthma -related events 
throughout the study . Details on the IDMC and IAC, including the plan of analysis for outputs ;the 
composition of the committees ;andthe procedures, roles, responsibilities ,and communications are 
provided in the respective IDMC and IAC charter s.
Screening Period (Screening to Initial Randomization/ Baseline)
The screening period (approximately 2-4 weeks before planned Day 1/baseline ) will evaluate subject 
eligibility and introduce standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_696457] a run -in period of at least 2 weeks 
(ie, 14 days )before Day 1/baseline .
Initial Treatment Period ( Baseline/Day 1 to Week 16 Pre-dose)
The initial treatment period is defined as Day 1 /baseline through Week 16(before the Week 16dose,
with last dose at Week 12).Eligible subjects w ill be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 at b aseline to receive 
subcutaneous injections of nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo Q4W .
Subjects will continue to use b ackground topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] ,which should be adjusted according to the 
disease activity and tolerability, including tapering when signs and symptoms improve, discontinuation 
when lesions clear, and restarting if signs and symptoms recur, based on investigator clinical judgment.

Maintenance Period ( Re-Randomization: Week 16toWeek 48)
The maintenance period is defined as Week 16(maintenance baseline) toWeek 48. All nemolizumab
(CD14152) -treated subjects (ie, group 1) who are clinical responders at Week 16will be re- randomized 
(1:1:1) to study medication , as follows: g roup 1A,nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg Q4W ; group 1B,
nemolizumab 30 mg Q8W ;or group 1C ,placebo Q4W.
Clinical responders are defined as : 
IGA of 0 (clear )or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16
OR
Eczem a Area and Severity Index (EASI )-75at Week 16
All placebo -treated subjects (ie, subjects in group 2 from theinitial treatment period ) who responded to 
placebo during the initial treatment period will continue to receive placebo Q4W in the maintenance 
period . 
Subjects who receive rescue therapy will be considered non -responders.
Based on the phase 2b results (Protocol 114322), it is estimated that 15% of subjects will drop out from 
the initial treatment period. Assuming a 45% responder rate in active treatment and 12% with placebo, 
approximately 216subjects will participate in the maintenance period (190 nemolizumab and 26 placebo 
subjects).

CONFIDENTIALBackground topi[INVESTIGATOR_696460], 
beginning at screening :
Medium -potency TCS therapy for non-sensitive areas :Subjects will apply the authorized medium -
potency TCS background therapy in areas of the body  where use of medium -potency TCS is 
considered safe (eg, trunk and extremities) ,beginning within the screening period and ≥14 days 
before Day 1(ie, run-in).Refer to the current version of the pharmacy manual for a listing of 
permitted medium -potency TCS medications that are commercially available in planned countries.
Low-potency TCS or TCI therapy for sensitive areas: Subjects will apply an authorized background 
therapy (ie, low -potency TCS or TCI) to areas of the body considered TCS -sensitive (eg, face, neck, 
intertriginous areas) or in cases where medium -potency TCS is not tolerated , beginning within the 
screening period and ≥ 14 days before Day 1(ie, run-in).The investigator may select either low-
potency TCS or TCI for each subject, per investigator discretion. The subject may only apply  one
medication to each affected area; concomitant use of low -potency TCS and TC I on the same lesion 
is not permitted. Refer to the current version of the pharmacy manual for a listing of permitted low-
potency TCS and TCI medications that are commercially available in planned countries.
Subjects will apply a thin layer of authorized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_696461] a 
frequency that is necessary to ensure disease stability and prevent AD flare but which does not exceed 
the daily frequency recommended in the product labeling . Refer to the current version of the pharmacy 
manual for the authorized topi[INVESTIGATOR_696462].“As needed” 
(PRN) use of TCS or TCI is not permitted. Only topi[INVESTIGATOR_696463]. 
Background therapy useshould be adjusted to the disease activity and tolerability ofthe subject, 
including tapering when signs and symptoms improve ,discontinuation when lesions clear, and 
restarting if signs and symptoms recur , at the discretion of the investigator.
Rescue Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298366] ( eg, to control intolerable AD signs/symptoms ), 
rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_696464]-in 
period. Subjects receiving rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_696465]-in period are not eligible to participate in the
study. 
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy should not be prescribed 
within the first 2 weeks after baseline (ie, Week 2) to allow  a minimum  time for study drug exposure in 
the presence of background therapy. 
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue therapy. Subjects 
requiring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should return to the clinic (unscheduled visit) for 
investigator assessment of efficacy before starting rescue therapy.
Rescue treatments are only treatments that directly treat AD (mainly those that are approved or are 
standard of care) and include topi[INVESTIGATOR_696466]. R escue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]:
Higher potency of TCS ( equivalent to class I-II accor ding to the U nited Statesclassification)2
Oral corticosteroids
Biologics (including their biosimilars)
Systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants /immunomodulators
Phototherapy

CONFIDENTIALPrimary Endpoint :
The 2co-primary endpoints will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for 
randomiz edstratification variable s (IGA severity and PP NRS).
Key Secondary E ndpoints :
All key secondary endpoints will be analyzed similar to the analysis of prim ary endpoint using a stratified 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.
Secondary Endpoints during Initial Period
Binary endpoints will be analysed with the same method as prim ary endpoint using non-responder 
imputation.
Continuous and QoL endpoints will be analy zed using an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) including 
treatment group and randomization stratification factors as factors and appropriate baseline values as a 
covar iate,if applicable. Missing values will be imputed using MI under MAR assumption. In addition, 
EASI, PP NRS,  will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach, including terms of treatment group, stratification factors, and appropriate baseline 
values. An unstructured covariance will be used to model the within -patient errors in the analysis. A 
linear contrast will be used, within the MMRM framework, to estimate difference between nemolizumab
and placebo. Treatment difference betw een nemolizumab and placebo will be estimated along with 
associated 95% confidence intervals.
Secondary Endpoints during Maintenance Period
All secondary endpoints during the maintenance period w ill be descriptively summarized .
Multiplicity Adjustment: 
The primary comparison of interest is nemolizumab 30mg compared to placebo for theco-prim ary 
endpoints in both population s(baseline PP NRS 4; baseline PP NRS 7). 
To control the type I error at 5% significance level, a serial gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_696472]. 
The co-primary endpoints will be tested at 2.5% significance level for each population. If both co-prim ary 
endpoints are statistically significant at 2.5% significance level, the key secondary endpoints will be 
tested sequentially following hierarchical testing procedure using the pre-specified order of endpoints 
for each population. The comparisons for key secondary endpoints will be made sequentially, and the 
subsequent tests will be stoppedwhen no stati stical difference is found.
Other secondary endpoint comparisons will not be adjusted for multiplicity.

CONFIDENTIAL6INTRODUCTION
6.1 B ackground & Rationale
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease estimated to occur in 
10% to 20% of the population1and up to 25% of children.2The disease is 
characterized b y pruritus (itching), xerosis (skin dryness) ,and eczematous lesions 
whose features include ery thema, infiltration/papulation, oozing with crusting, 
excoriations, and lichenification. Approximately  60% of AD patients have another 
concomitant atopic condition (eg, asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy ) and AD often 
constitutes the fi rst step of atopic march (progression from 1 atopic disease to 
another). Although not a life- threatening disease, AD has a marked negative impact 
on patients’ quality oflife (QoL), and depression and anxiety  have been reported as 
comorbidities in AD patie nts.3Existing literature suggest that the prevalence of AD is 
highest in young children and graduall y reduces with age. Prevalence is higher in 
developed countries.
The overall lifetime prevalence of AD has increased over the past [ADDRESS_944994] 
countries ,there has been an increase in AD prevale nce over a 5 -to 10 -year period .4In 
the [LOCATION_002] (US) , the prevalence of AD in children has been reported between 
10% and 13% in 2 studies.5,6Many  environmental and geographic factors were shown 
to contribute to incidence rate and severity  in both studies. These variables included 
urban living, household income, parental education level, and race.
The majority  of AD cases can be regarded as “mild”, with 10% to 20% of patients 
suffering from severe eczematous skin lesions, although the percentage of individuals 
experiencing severe disease appears to be higher in the adult AD population.7Whereas 
the prevalence of moderate -to-severe AD is up to 71% in adults suffering from AD, the 
prevalence of moderate and severe ADin children with AD was found to be 14% and 
2%, respectivel y.8Evaluation of AD data collected through the US 2007 National 
Survey  of Children’s Health showed that 67% of pediatric AD patients had mild

heterogeneous treatment outcomes, including common side effects such as actinic

disease temporarily , should be avoided due to an overall unfavorable risk -benefit

both sedating and non -sedating medications) have been studied in the management of 
AD but there is insufficient evidence of treatment benefit. Cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, azathioprine, or my cophenola te mofetil may  be considered when 
systemic treatment is required.24Most of these sy stemic immunosuppressants, except 
cyclosporine, have not been appr oved for the treatment of AD and are used off -label 
in both adults and pediatric patients. Cy closporine is approved for treatment of severe

after nemolizumab administration, after which the drug gradually disappeared over a 
half-lifeof approximately  2 weeks.
6.2.2 Phase 2a Multi -Dose Safety and Efficacy Study
The safet y, tolerability , and e fficacy  of nemolizumab monotherap y was evaluated in 
264 moderate -to-severe AD subjects who were inadequatel y controlled b y or 
intolerant to topi[INVESTIGATOR_696482] a phase 2a study (CIM003JG) .30,32The study  included 
a 12-week ,randomi zed, double -blind, placebo -controlled period (Part A) and a 52-
week extension (Part B). At Week 12, various doses of nemolizumab (0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 
mg/kg ,or 2.0 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously  every  4 weeks (Q4W) were 
statistically  significantly  more effe ctive than placebo in reducing pruritus visual 
analogue scale (VAS) score, with 0.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg doses being more 
effective than 0.1 mg/kg. No additional benefit was observed with the 2.0 mg/kg 
Q4W or every  8 weeks ( Q8W )doses compared to 0.5 mg/kg Q4W.
During the entire stud y (Parts A and B), AEs that occurred in 5% or more of the 
nemolizumab -treated patients (all groups pooled) were nasophary ngitis, AD, 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], 
headache, peri pheral edema, and impetigo. The majority of AEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity . No clinically  relevant findings were observed during the study  
for laboratory  tests, vital signs, ph ysical examination ,or electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Pharmacokinetic assessments after subcutaneous injections of various doses showed a 
dose-proportional increase of nemolizumab serum concentrations after repeated

6.2.3 Phase 2b Dose -Ranging Study
The phase 2b stud y was a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel -
group, dose -ranging study  to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of various doses of 
nemolizumab in moderate -to-severe AD subjects with severe pruritus ( peak pruritus 
numeric rating scale [ PP NRS ]≥ 7). 
A total of 226 adult subjects were randomized ( 1subject in the placebo group was 
randomized but not treated): 57 subjects were randomized to placebo an d 169 subjects 
were randomized to nemolizumab arms (55 subjects to 10 mg, 57 subjects to 30 mg ,
and 57 subjects to 90 mg). There were 176subjects ( 77.9%) who completed the 
treatment and 44subjects (19.5%) who discontinued the study . Overall, all 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar in all treatment groups.
At the Week 24 visit, a greater percent change reduction in Eczema Area and Severity  
Index (EASI )was observed with the nemolizumab 30 -mg dose ( least squares mean 
difference vs placebo = 16.7%) and the difference was statistically  significant (95% 
confidence interval [ CI]= -30.2, -3.2; p < 0.05) compared to placebo. The 
nemolizumab 10 -mg dose showed marginally  significant difference vs placebo ( least 
squares mean difference = 13.6%; 95% CI = - 27.3, 0.0; p = 0.05). However, the 
difference between the nemolizumab 90- mg dose and placebo did not achieve 
statistical significance.
The secondary  endpoint of Investigator’s Global Assessment ( IGA)success 
(clear/almost clear and 2 -point reduction) was not statistically  significant at Week 24 
(25.5% in nemolizumab 10 mg, 36.8% in 30 mg, 22.8% in 90 mg ,and 21.1% in 
placebo). However, the difference was statistically different for the 30 -mg dose 
compared to placebo at Week 16 (33.3% vs 12.3%; p = 0.008). The PP NRS 
responder (PP NRS improvement ≥ 4) rate was statistically  significant (p < 0.05) for 
the nemolizumab 10 -mg and 30 -mg doses at Week 24, and all nemolizumab doses 
were statisticall y significantly  superior to placeb o at Week 16 ( p< 0.05). 
Nemolizumab demonstrated an early  onset of action in pruritus as earl y as Week 1. I n 
addition, the proportion of EASI -75 responders was statistically  significantly  greater 
for nemolizumab 30 mg at Week 24 and for both the 30 -mg and 90-mgdoses at Week 
16 compared to placebo (p < 0.05) . The sleep disturbance NRS was highl y 
statistically  significant for all 3 nemolizumab doses at Week 24 (p < 0.001) vs 
placebo.
Among all nemolizumab doses, the 30 -mg dose showed statistically  significant and 
greater difference compared to placebo for all AD and pruritus endpoints at Week 16.

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_696485] . Trea tment options are however ,
limited for patients with moderate -to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequatel y 
controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910].
Results of previous clinical studies in adults demonstrated that treatment with 
nemolizumab had a marked effect on AD, pruritus, and pruritus- related sleep loss. 
Improvements in the s ymptoms of AD were consistent with the observed 
improvement in sleep qual ity (evaluated subjectively ) and QoL (evaluated using 
Dermatology  Life Quality  Index [DLQI ]). Continuous treatment for up to 64 weeks 
led to improvements in overall AD severit y, evaluated with various validated scales 
commonly  used in dermatology  clinical trials (ie, EASI , SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 
[SCORAD ],and I GA). Nemolizumab was also well tolerated overall when used as 
monotherap y or concomitantly with a TCS. 
Based on the currentl y available information on nemolizumab and the risks associated 
with bi ologic agents in general, the potential risks of nemolizumab treatment include 
local or s ystemic IRRs, newly diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma , 
exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, and skin or non- skin infection s.The following 
specific risk-minimizati on and safet y follow -up measures have been planned in this

PEF and ACT assessments at all visits starting with the visit in which the 
diagnosis was confirmed. Subjects with a medical history of asthma will be 
referred to the ph ysician managing their asthma if ACT ≤ 19, PEF < 80% of the

reported during the course of the stud y.
b. The exclusion criteria of this clinical study  (ie, restricting entry  of subjects with 
recent/cur rent infection sor known/suspected immunosuppression or unusually  
frequent, recurrent, severe, or prolonged infections ) will prevent non-eligible
patients from receiving nemolizumab. As no data are available in pregnant or 
breastfeeding women, these patien ts are not eligible for this study . Patients who

permitted including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccination.
c.A slight trend of dose -dependent increase of peripheral edema was reported in the 
nemolizumab phase 2a study  (CIM003JG). Most events were mild (11 of 21), no 
case was serious, and none resulted in premature treatment discontinuation; no 
case was associated with renal or cardiac AEs. The EASI values and thymus and 
activation -regulated chemokine (TARC) levels were relativel y higher in subjects
with peripheral ede ma indicating that peripheral edema might be related to more 
severe AD. There were a few subjects repo rting peripheral edema in the p hase 2b

CONFIDENTIAL6.5 Dose Selection Rationale
Based on the outcome of the phase 2b dose -ranging stud yin adults , the 30- mg dose 
(with 60-mg loading dose), when administered Q4W , provided the best benefit/risk 
ratio of the [ADDRESS_945006] body  weights in 
the phase 2b stud y, the 30 -mg dose (with 60 -mg loading dose) provided a comparable 
observed exposure with respect to the bod yweight -based dose of 0.5 mg/kg tested 
during the phase 2a study .
Adolescent subj ects will be enrolled after the sponsor confirms the safet y of the 30 -
mg Q4W dose in adolescents in a separate clinical study  (Protocol 116912).
The current study  includes a 32 -week maintenance period whereby  [CONTACT_696536] 30 mg Q4W at Week 16 will be re -randomized (1:1:1) to [ADDRESS_945007]. The nemolizumab 
30 mg Q8W regimen is proposed to evaluate whether a clinical response can be 
maintained with a lower dosing frequency . 
PK/pharmac odynamic ( PD)modeling was perfor med on three clinical endpoints 
(EASI, IGA, and PP NRS) to support selection of the additional Q8W dose regimen 
for Phase [ADDRESS_945008] acebo for all clinical endpoints, indicating a 
benefit with active treatment over placebo in both dose regimens (Q4W and Q8W) . 
While higher efficacy  on all clinical endpoints was observed with the Q4W dose 
regimen, it was evidenced that subcutaneous nemoli zumab Q8W for 16 weeks will 
maintain clinical benefit compared to placebo . 
PK/PD modeling provides the rationale to evaluate and compare thesafet y and 
efficacy  of Q4W and Q8W dosing of 30 mg nemolizumab in the maintenance phase 
of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].

CONFIDENTIAL8INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan : Description
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel- group 
study  in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD. Eligible subjects 
must have a documented history  of inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_197349] . 
Approximately  [ADDRESS_945009] once daily and an
authorized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_52201] y (including a medium- potency  TCS for the 
body  and a low-potency  TCS or a TCI  for sensitive areas such as the face, neck, 
intertriginous areas, etc) for use throughout the study . If deemed to be medically  
necessary  by [CONTACT_093] ( eg, to control intolerable AD signs /symptoms ), rescue 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_696456], except during the run- in 
period (ie, at least 2 weeks [14 day s] before Day  1/baseline) .
The study  consists of 4 periods over approximately  60 weeks: screening (including 
run-in), i nitial treatment, maintenance, and follow -up ( unless the subject is a non -
responder at Week 16, at which their participation could last up to 28 weeks ). Refer t o
Figure 2for an overview of the treatment/ study  design.
An IDMC will review and monitor subject safet y throughout the stud y. The IDMC 
will provide recommendations on the safet y of subjects. Details on the IDMC, 
including the plan of analysis for IDMC outputs, the composition of the IDMC, the 
procedures, roles, responsibilities and their communications are provided in the 
IDMC charter.
Screening Period (Screening to Initial Randomization/Baseline)
The screening period (approximately  2-4 weeks before planned Day 1/baseline) will 
evaluate subject eligibility  and introduce standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_696488] 
a run -in period of at least 2 weeks (i e, 14 day s) before Day 1/baseline.
Subjects may be rescreened once unless the reason for screen failure is related to disease 
severit y inclusion criteria (IGA, EASI, BSA, and PP NRS). The latter subjects are not 
permitted to rescreen.
Initial Treatment Period ( Baseline/Day  1 to Week 16 Pre-dose)
The initial treatment period is defined as Day 1/baseline through Week 16 ( before the
Week [ADDRESS_945010] dose at Week 12). Approximately  750 total subjects will be 
randomized ( 2:1)to receive either nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo, stratified by  
[CONTACT_420980] y (IGA;moderate :IGA = 3;severe :IGA =4) and PP NRS 
severit y [PP NRS ≥7; PP NRS < 7). A minimum of 250 subjects will be randomized 
in each PP NRS strata. Table 4 summarizes study  drug dosing during the initial 
treatment period .

Maintenance Period (Re -Randomization: Week 16 to Week 48)
The maintenance period is defined as Week 16(maintenance baseline) to Week 48. All 
nemolizumab (CD14152) -treated subjects (ie, group 1) who are clinical responders at 
Week 16will be re-randomized (1:1:1) tostudy medication , as follows: group 1A, 
nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg Q4W ; group 1B, nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg 
Q8W ;or group 1C, placebo Q4W (Table 5). 
Clinical responders are defined as: 
IGA of 0 (clear )or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16
OR
EASI -
75 at Week 16
All placebo- treated subjects (ie, subjects in group 2 from the initial treatment period) 
who responded to placebo during the initial treatment period will continue to receive 
placebo Q4W in the maintenance period . 
Subjects who receive rescue therapy will be considered non -responders.
Based on the phase 2b results (Protocol 114322), it isestimated that 15% of subjects 
will drop out from the initial treatment period. Assuming a 45% responder rate with 
active treatment and 12% with placebo, approximately 216subjects will participate in 
the maintenance period (1 90 nemolizumab and 26 placebo subjects).

CONFIDENTIAL8.2 Discussion of Study Design
8.2.1 Study Design
This study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of nemolizumab (CD14152) in adolescent 
and adult subjects with AD. The rationale for the general study  design is based upon the 
prior phase 2b design conducted in adult subjects with AD , with background TCS therap y. 
The r ationale for the nemolizumab dose/dose regimen is provided in Section 6.5. 
Eligible subjects for this clinical study  will be adolescents and adults with moderate -to-
severe AD whose disease isnot adequately  controlled by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_12969]. The study 
population is selected based on the current unmet need in the management of AD in 
pediatric populations, the mode of action of nemolizumab (CD14152) , and the need to 
understand the safet yand long-term exposure of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the 
adolescent and adult population. The inclusion criteria for IGA, BSA ,and EASI  are 
consistent with the disease severit y targeted in the study  and in nemolizumab (CD14152) 
studies in adults: An IGA of 3 or 4 corresponds to moderate or severe AD,respectivel y; 
BSA of at least 10% is usually  observed in these more severe AD patients .An EASI 
threshold of 1 6is generally  recognized to be representative of moderate -to-severe AD and 
is consistent with the published analyses correlating IGA and EASI assessments in patients 
with AD.33,34Finally , subjects with associated pruritus are targeted because of prior studies
with nemolizumab (CD14152) andits marked effect on pruritus. Specifically, subjects with 
a PP NRS score of ≥ 7 were included based on the population evaluated inthe phase 2b 
study ; a lower PP NRS threshold of ≥ 4 was selected for this study  based on anticipated 
benefits for subjects with less severe pruritus as wel l.
The study  includes a 16- week initial treatment period , a 32- week maintenance period, and 
an 8-week follow -up period ( ie, 12weeks after last study  drug administration )for subjects 
who decline or are not eligible to enter the LTE study . A 16-week treatment is considered 
adequate to evaluate the safet yand efficacy of nemolizumab based on the results of the 
phase 2b study  (114322) and other registrational studies for the treatment of AD. The 
maintenance period will compare the maintenance of effect of 2 nemolizumab dosing 
regimens (30 mg Q4Wand30 mg Q8W) compared to placebo. The nemolizumab 30mg 
Q8W regimen is proposed to evaluate whether a clinical response can be maintained with 
a lower dosing frequency .Subject swho are clinical responder s at Week 16 w ill be re-
randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 maintenance treatment groups.

5.AD involvement ≥ 10% of BSA at both the screening and baseline visits.
6. Peak (maximum) pruritus NRS score of at least 4 .0at the screening and baseline visit.
Screening PP NRS score will be determined by a single PP NRS assessment (score 
ranging from 0 to 10) for the 24-hour period immediately  preceding the screening visit.
Baseline PP NRS score will be determined based on the average of daily PP NRS scores 
(score ranging from 0 to 10) during the 7 days immediately  preceding baseline 
(rounding is not permitted). A minimum of 4 daily  scores out of the 7 days immediately 
preceding baseline is required for this calculation.

according to instructions provided in the current version of the pharmacy  manual and the 
instructions for use. Study medication preparation should be conducted in a secured and 
clean area with limited access to only  designated personnel at the time of the preparation. 
Good hy giene practices and clean techniques must apply  at alltimes.
Differences may be detectable during the study drug reconstitution process between active 
and placebo ,but active and placebo appear similar after reconstitution is complete 
(approximately  10 minutes). Throughout the study , a pharmacist (or other qualified 
personnel) will prepare study  medication for injection, including confirmation of complete 
reconstitution, prior to delivery of stud y medication for injection. T he pharmacist (or other 
qualified personnel) preparing study  medication should not be involved with any study 
assessments and should not discuss any aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the 
subject/caregiver or study staff involved in subject interviews or study  assessments. 
The study  drug does not contain preservatives. From a microbiological point of view, the 
preparation of the stud y drug has to be done as close to subject administration as possible, 
and the study  drug sh ould be used immediatel y (less than 1 hour) after reconstitution. I f 
not used immediately , the study  drug has to be used within 4 hours maximum after 
reconstitution stored at room temperature (below 30°C) and only  if the preparation has 
taken place appl ying strictly  good hy giene practices and clean techniques to ensure 
controlled aseptic conditions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Injection
All study  drug injections will occur at the study  center, following instructions provided in

Randomization
Upon confirmation of eligibility  for a given subject to participate in the study, a unique 
randomization number will be assigned to that subject via IRT at the baseline visit .
Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive treatment of nemolizumab (CD14152) Q4W 
or placebo. Randomization wil l be strati fied by  [CONTACT_696546] y (IGA=3 , IGA=4) and

Subjects who were randomized to nemolizumab in the in itial period and achieved clinical 
response (EASI -75 or IGA 0/1) at Week 16 will be re-randomized (1:1: 1) to receive 
nemolizumab Q4W ,nemolizumab Q8W ,or placebo via IRTin the maintenance period .
8.4.6 Selection of D oses in the Study
The 30-mg dose (Q4W or Q8W) proposed for this study  is supported b y the results of the 
nemolizumab phase 2b study  (114322) and other supportive data .Refer also to Section
6.5for further details.
8.4.7 Dose Modification
Dose modification of the study  drug will not be permitted during the clinical study . 
Any inadvertent dose modification (s)should be reported to the s ponsor/CRO. 
In the event of a missed dose (ie, temporary  discontinuation of the study  drug), it will be 
documented in the CRF that the drug has not been administered at the study  visit, 
together with the reason (eg ,for safet y). Subjects will be asked to return to the study  
center s for all remaining visits and complete all study  assessments and procedures as 
described in Section 8.1.2 .
Dosing frequency  is scheduled for Q4W , based on the baseline/Day  [ADDRESS_945042] injection. Future visits should be scheduled

Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur onl y in case of a 
medical emergency  or in the eve nt of a serious medical condition that necessitates 
identification of the study drug for the welfare of that subject, as judged b y the 
investigator . The emergency  unblinding process utilizes I RT to allow the investigator to 
have unrestricted, immediate, an d direct access to the subject’s individual study  
treatment. When possible (ie, when the health of the subject is not immediately  at risk) , 
the investigator or sub-investigator is encouraged to consult with the m edical m onitor and 
the sponsor before breaking the blind.
If emergency  unblinding is required:
•Only  the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.
•Only  the affected subject will be unblinded.

(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product . This includes an exacerbation of pre- existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction ,or the significant wo rsening 
of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the CRF under 
specific efficacy  assessments . 
Note(s) : 
Any new sign or s ymptom reported b y the subject that appears after accidental or 
intentional overdose or misuse should b e reported as an AE.
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be reported on the AE form, instead of 
signs, s ymptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values. 
Pregnancy  is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be monitored and 
reported as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Each worsening of a chronic disease from the screening visit should be reported 
as a new AE.
The investigator or designee will report all AEs that occur from the time the I CF is signed 
until the end of the study . The sponsor/CRO should be informed if the investigator 
becomes aware of an y safety  information that appears to be drug related, even after the 
subject has completed the clinical study .
At each post -enrollment visit, the investigator (or sub-investigator) will question the 
subject about AEs using an open non -persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs ( for 
example ,“Have you noticed an y change in your health since the last visit?” ).Directed 
questioning and examination will then be performed as appropriate.

drug(s) or not, will be recorded immediatel y in the source document and described on the 
Adverse Event Form (“AE Form ”) along with the date of onset, severit y, relationship to 
the study  drug(s), and outcome, without omitting any requested and known information. 
Additional information will be requested u nder certain circumstances.
Adverse events assessed as related to the treatment or study  procedure will be monitored 
until they  have resolved or reached a stable condition. Other AEs will be monitored until 
the last visit if they  have not resolved or reac hed a stable condition. 
The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical 
records, information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment 
and follow -up of the subject. If necessary , the investig ator will contact [CONTACT_423]’s 
personal ph ysician or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99391].
Assessment of Severity
Each AE will be assigned a category  by [CONTACT_3470]:
Mild : A n AE that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort ,
and does not interfere with every day activities.
Moderate : A n AE that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal every day 
activities; intervention may  be needed.
Severe : A n AE that prevents normal every day activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually  needed.
If there is a change in severity  of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between 
the occurrence of the AE, and exposure to the study  drug (ie, nemolizumab or placebo) 
and/or study  procedure (eg, injection, topi[INVESTIGATOR_99383] y, blood sample 
collection). Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering 
all relevant factors i ncluding the pattern of the reaction, temporal relationships, relevant 
medical history , and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent diseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey  in general that there 
are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (I CH E2A, Section IIIA 1).

provide a diagnosis of an AE when reporting the abnormal laboratory  value.
Subjects should be reminded to be well h ydrated before all visits for phlebotomy  
purposes. Subjects should fast for at least [ADDRESS_945065] be available before the baseline visit. Laboratory testing conducted in a nonfasting

infection or to cause conversion from latent to active TB in some circumstances. Because 
of this, subjects willbe screened for active or latent TB before entry  into this study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Active TB is a disease caused by  [CONTACT_690766] b y either a smear or culture taken from any source 
in the person’s bod y which tests positiv e for TB or by [CONTACT_99423]. Individuals 
with active TB are s ymptomatic, depending upon the location of the disease (most 
commonly  in the lungs but also possibly  in the brain, kidney s, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or elsewhere), and 
can spread the infection to others. 
Latent TB is said to exist when an individual is infected with M tuberculosis , as 
evidenced b y a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay ,39such as QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold, but is asy mptomatic and has no evidence of active infection on screening pathology  
or radiographic tests. Such individuals do not pass the disease to others and should 
commence a course of prophy lactic antimy cobacterial treatment to eliminate the infection 
and commit to completing the course of treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis Screening
Ideally, as part of the medical history , the subject should be asked if they  have presented 
with active or latent TB in the past and whether they  have received a b acillus Calmette -
Guérin ( or BCG) vaccination. They  should also be asked if they  have been in contact 
[CONTACT_696559], such as travel to TB 
endemic regions, close contact [CONTACT_690768], or workplace risk (eg, 
prison, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]). 
Asubject who tests positive for latent TB (with a positive QuantiFERON- TB gold test)
should be referred to the subject’s treating ph ysician for appropriate follow -up. If the 
result is indeterminate , the test may  be repeated once . If confirmed indeterminate, the 
subject should then be managed as though he/she has a positive test result.

No interim an alysis is planned.
Week 16 Analysis: Primary  anal ysis may be carried out once all subjects have completed 
the We ek [ADDRESS_945085] access to the unblinded data before the completion of 
the trial in order to avoid introducing bias tothe remaining study  data .
10.1.9 Handling of Missing Data
Theprimary method to impute the missing values will be as follows:
Continuous Endpoints: For continuous endpoints during initial period , the MI under 
MAR assumption approach and the MMRM approach will be used to handle the missing 
data for the selec tedsecondary  endpoints. QoL endpoints (eg, D LQI/cD LQI, EQ -5D, 
PIQ) may beimputed using last observation carried forward ( LOCF ), where applicable.
Binary Endpoints: All missing values will be treated as a non-responder for the binary  
endpoints. To assess the robustness of non- responder anal ysis, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_696521]. TheMI under MAR assumption, LOC F, and OCwill be used as 
sensitivity  anal ysis to impute the missing values for the primary andkey secondary
endpoints.
Use of rescue therapy : All efficacy  data , except OC, will be set to missing after rescue 
medication is used. In OC analy sis, no observed data after subject has received rescue 
treatment will be excluded. There will be no imputations for missing data.
10.1.10 Sensitivit y Analyses for Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints

Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_55616] b y converting non -responders due to

Multiple imputation (MI) methods for missing data: The MI imputation will be 
carried out as follows.
1.Imputation Phase
a.A 50 imputed datasets with a monotone missing pattern will be created 
using SAS MI  procedure based on the observed data (Markov- Chain -
Monte -Carlo method, MCMC). The seed to be used is 118169 (the 
Protocol number). Pattern of missing data will be evaluated and it is 
expected that the pattern of missing data will be monotonic. For non -
monotone missing data patterns, MCMC method of MI procedure will be 
used to impute enough data so that the remaining missing data is 
monotone.
b.Each of the imputed datasets will be used to generate 50 complete 
datase ts, usin g the following approaches:
i.Ordinal data (eg, IGA score): A logistic regression method to 
impute the ordinal missing data, including treatment, 
randomization strata, and assessments from earlier time points as 
covariates. Response or total score ofthe subjects will be derived 
using these imputed data. 
ii.Continuous data (eg, EASI score): A linear regression model 
including treatment, randomization strata, and assessments from 
earlier time points as covariates will be used to impute the score. 
Respons e or total score of the subjects will be derived using these 
imputed data. 
2.Analy sis Phase: The analy sis will be conducted using the complete datasets.
a.Binary endpoint: The complete datasets will be modelled for the endpoint 
using CMH method as per anal ysis described in Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_945086] 
error will be calculated.
b.Continuous endpoint :The complete datasets will be anal ysed using 
ANCOVA including treatment group and randomization stratification 
factors as factors and appropriate baseline values as a covari ate, if 
applicable . LSMean s in each treatment arm, difference and standard errors
will be calculated.
3.Pooling Phase: The results from the anal ysis phase will be combined as follows. 
a.Binary endpoint: The results from the CMH analysis of the multiple 
imputed datasets will be combined using the Rubin (1987) and Li et al 
(1991) approach t o produce pooled CMH statistics and p -value. Proportion

Diagnosis
Features to be considered in diagnosis of patients with atopic dermatitis:
ESSENTIAL FEATURES ; must be present:
Pruritus 
Eczema (acute, subacute, chronic):
oTypi[INVESTIGATOR_696528] -specific patterns* 
oChronic or relapsing history
*Patterns include :
1)Facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children; 
2) Current or prior flexural lesions in any age group; 
3) Sparing of groin and axillary regions.
IMPORTANT FEATURES ; seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis:
Early age of onset 
Atopy
oPersonal and/or family  history
oIgE reactivity  
Xerosis
ASSOCIAT ED FEATURES ; these clinical associations help to suggest the diagnosis of 
AD but are too non- specific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820]:
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_73263] (eg, facial pallor, white dermographism, delay ed blanch 
response)
Keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785] / pi[INVESTIGATOR_664327] / hy perlinear palms / ichthy osis 
Ocular / periorbital changes
Other regional findings (eg, perioral changes / periauricular lesions) 
Perifollicular accentuation / lichenification / prurigo lesions
EXCLUSIONARY CONDITIONS ; it should be noted that a diagnosis of AD depends 
on excluding conditions such as:
Scabies
Seborrheic dermatitis
Contact [CONTACT_8748] (irritant or allergic)

COVID -19 Pandemic
This guidance applies during the COVID- 19 pandemic, as defined by  [CONTACT_99439]/or 
local authorities. The updates summarized below are relevant to the referenced sections 
of the protocol.
Section 6.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_945106], including 
general environmental risks (eg, being outside the home, possible contact [CONTACT_99442]) and study -related activities (eg, interaction with study staff). 
Potential new subjects with known or suspected COV ID-19 infection are ineligible for 
study  enrolment until the infection has resolved. Furthermore, potential new subjects in a 
high-risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. 60 y ears and older or with comorbidities), 
should be temporaril y deferred until the COVID -[ADDRESS_945107] COVID -19 Pandemic below. 
Subjects with a known or suspected COVID -19 infection will immediately discontinue 
study  drug; instructions for resuming treatment are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and 
below in Guidance for Existing Subjects. Known or suspected COVID- 19 infection will 
also be followed as an AESI .

[CONTACT_690784] (e.g. being outside home, possible contact [CONTACT_99442]) and study -related activities (e.g. interaction with study  staff).
For potential subjects in the low -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. less than 60 
years of age and without comorbidities), the risks and benefits of participation in 
the study  should be assessed on a case by  [CONTACT_413]. 
If at the time of screening, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject will not 
be willing and able to reach the investigational site and comply  with all of the time 
commitments and requirements of the clinical study  protocol, the subject should
not be considered for enrol lment. The subject may be rescreened at a later time.
Pre-screening phone calls should be conducted to exclude potential 
candidates/subjects who display possible symptoms of COVID -19 or are at high 
risk of having been exposed to COVID-19.
-Guidance for Enrolled Subjects:
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the clinical investigational site 
and complete all study  procedures, the following measures should be taken:
-Implement and document in the subject records regular 
communication with the subject between visits to attempt to ensure 
early detection of potential signs/s ymptoms of COVID -19 infection, 
and provide adequate advice, as per local medical practice and public 
health guidelines for suspected COVID -19 infection. Please refer to 
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; https://www.cdc.gov/ 
coronavirus/2019 -ncov/sy mptoms -testing/s ymptoms.html)/European 
CDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid- 19/questions-
answers )/local disease prevention agency  and applicable local 
guidelines for assessment of subjects’ COVID -[ADDRESS_945109] before the 
scheduled visit. 
-Discontinue study  drug administration in case of confirmed or 
suspected COVID -19 infection until the infection is resolved. See

investigational site according to the instructions in the protocol, 
pharmacy  manual and instruction for use, including preparation of 
study  drug b y an independent pharmacist or other qualified personnel.
- ACT (for subjects with medical history  of asthma )and PEF (all 
subjects) can be performed according to the protocol .
oExceptionally , if sites cannot perform PEF safel y on site, the subjects 
should perform it at home prior to the onsite visit, on the same day . 
See section below for remote PEF testing instructions.
-All other safet y assessments are to be performed as per protocol: 
physical exam, vital signs, ECG, laboratory  assessments, pregnancy 
test, monitoring of AEs and concomitant medications .

TITLE A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Insulin Treated Patients 
with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and With Hypercholesterolemia at High 
Cardiovascular Risk Not Adequately Controlled on Maximally Tolerated LDL-C Lowering Therapy (ODYSSEY DM – Insulin) 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational - Multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3b 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary Objectives 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with 
placebo in the reduction of calculated low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin and with hypercholesterolemia at high 
cardiovascular risk not adequately controlled on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy 
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin 
Secondary Objective 
x To demonstrate that alirocumab is superior in comparison to placebo in its effects on other lipid parameters at Weeks 12 and 24 
(ie, measured LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
[non-HDL-C], apolipoprotein B [Apo B], total cholesterol [TC], 
lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
triglyceride (TG) levels, triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRL), 
apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo C-III), and LDL particle number and size) 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of alirocumab administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection in insulin treated patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and 
with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk not adequately 
controlled on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy. 
Patients, unless they are statin intolerant, will be taking a stable, maximum 
dose/regimen of statin therapy that is tolerated by [CONTACT_102], based on the 
Investigator’s judgment, with or without other lipid modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMT). 
Randomization will be unbalanced (2:1, alirocumab:placebo) 
The study will be a multinational, multicenter study. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_179591] (ie, Type 1 diabetes versus Type 2 
diabetes). Recruitment of patients with Type [ADDRESS_211242] been 
randomized or the end of the targeted recruitment period (summer 2016),

SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 4 Alirocumab will be administered subcutaneously with a starting dose of 75 mg 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 
150 mg Q2W at Week 12 if the LDL-C at the Week 8 visit is 70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L). Patients who have an LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at the 
Week 8 visit will continue with alirocumab 75 mg every two weeks until the 
end of the double-blind treatment  period. 
The study consists of: 
x A screening period of up to 3 weeks; 
x A double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks; 
x A safety observation period (off-treatment) of 8 weeks after the end 
of the double-blind treatment period. 
Note, the Investigator will need to document in the case report form (CRF) any adverse events (AEs) that have occurred within [ADDRESS_211243] dose 
of IMP that (s)he is aware of. A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order 
to ensure documentation of any AEs occurring during this period.       
Patients should be on a stable diet for glucose and lipid management 
throughout the entire study duration from screening to the Week 24 visit. 
There shall be no significant changes in nutritional composition of the diet or in the quantity/pattern of food consumed. Patients must be receiving 
treatment for diabetes in accordance with local/regional standards of care. 
Statin dose and dose regimen as well as dose and dose regimen of other lipid 
modifying treatment(s) (if applicable) should be stable for [ADDRESS_211244] the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization 
until after the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient as per the 
Investigator’s judgment. At the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 24 visit), the Investigator will continue to manage the patient’s lipi[INVESTIGATOR_179557]. Any lipid values after randomization (eg, if 
done for patient safety) should be redacted in the source documents and not 
shared with the Sponsor. 
Duration of study treatment will be [ADDRESS_211245] injection 
administered at Week 22.  
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work 
at each visit; in addition phone visits are scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32. Week 8 is a critical visit because it will be the only scheduled visit where an LDL-C 
value for uptitration will be available.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis Population: Randomized population includes any patients who have been allocated to a 
randomized treatment regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or 
not. 
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the ITT population, defined as 
all randomized patients who had an evaluable primary efficacy endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be considered evaluable when both of the 
following conditions are met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
x A least one calculated LDL-C value is available within one of the analysis windows up to Week 24. 
The mITT population (otherwise referred to as the on-treatment population) is defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose or part of dose 
of the double-blind IMP injection and had an evaluable primary efficacy 
endpoint during the efficacy treatment period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be considered evaluable during the efficacy 
treatment period when both of the following conditions are met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
(electronic 
Clinical Trial Protocol  08-Jul-2015 
SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: [ADDRESS_211254] one calculated LDL-C value is available during the efficacy 
treatment period and within one of the analysis windows up to Week 
24. 
The efficacy treatment period will be defined as: 
x The time period from the first double-blind IMP injection up to [ADDRESS_211255] one dose or partial dose of IMP. The safety population will 
be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Separate analyses will be performed for Type 1 diabetes patients on one 
hand and Type 2 diabetes patients on the other hand. However, some 
endpoints may also be analyzed on the pooled data (Type 1 and Type 2 
diabetes patients together). These analyses will be defined later in the 
statistical analysis plan. 
Primary Analysis: 
The percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_211256] model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 
to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for 
by [CONTACT_56412]. 
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group 
(placebo versus alirocumab), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20, 
Week 24), treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed 
covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Alirocumab will be compared to placebo using appropriate 
contrasts, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference will be 
provided. 
Analysis of key secondary endpoints and other efficacy 
endpoints: 
A hierarchical procedure (concerning key secondary endpoints only) will be 
used to control the type I error and handle multiple endpoints. If the primary 
endpoint analysis is significant at the 5% alpha level, secondary endpoints will 
be tested sequentially, using the order defined in section “Key Secondary 
endpoints”.  
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution, will 
be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint with 
the continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline 
value-by-time point interaction. Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated 
to have a non-normal distribution will be analyzed using multiple imputation 
approach for handling of missing values followed by [CONTACT_179598]. Binary 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach for 
handling of missing values followed by [CONTACT_51621]. 
Analysis of diabetes-related endpoints and other 
endpoints: 
Descriptive analyses will be performed concerning diabetes-related endpoints 
and other endpoints such as anti-alirocumab antibodies.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 12 Safety analysis: 
Safety analysis (TEAEs, AESIs, product complaints, laboratory parameters, 
vital signs) will be descriptive, based on the safety population. The safety 
analysis will focus on the TEAE period defined as the time from the first 
double-blind dose to the last double-blind dose of IMP +70 days (10 weeks). 
Timing of the analyses: All the efficacy data will be available for final analysis at a cut-off date 
corresponding to the Week [ADDRESS_211257] patient.  All the safety data will 
be available at the end of the study (Week 32). If needed for the purpose of 
scientific communication, both the efficacy and safety analyses will be 
performed at the Week 24 cut-off date and an update of the safety analysis at the end of the study.  If analyses are not needed at Week 24, then there will 
be only a one time analysis at the end of the study. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  The duration of the study is approximately 9 months to include a 3-week screening period and 24-week treatment period and an 8 week safety 
observation period.
 
Patients with an SAE or an AESI should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death.

b Physical examination and Vital signs:  Height, Weight, HR, and BP. Abnormal vital signs are to be recorded as AEs only if they are medically relevant: symptomatic, requiring corrective 
treatment, leading to discontinuation of IMP and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
c Injection-training prior to randomization is performed with placebo. Investigators will have the option of providing a second p lacebo for alirocumab for patients who require additional 
self-injection training.  The first double-blind injection is administered at the site by [CONTACT_76409] a trained designated p erson with double-blind study treatment kit allocated by [CONTACT_54537]. Further 
training with double-blind treatment can be done at an additional unscheduled visit(s), as per patient or Investigator’s judgme nt. If a designated person changes during the course of the study, 
then the person will be trained using placebo. 
d For kit dispensation:  Along with kit dispensation, the treatment administration package should be given as well as the Patient diary and injection instruction manual, as needed. 
e Patients will be asked to additionally keep a log of the daily insulin dose for 7 days prior to each visit (including daily bas al dose and daily prandial dose, as applicable). 
f Safety evaluation: Adverse Events (AEs), and product complaints regardless of seriousness or relationship to alirocumab treatme nt, will be collected from the time the patient signs the 
informed consent form (ICF) until the end of the study (Week 32). 
g LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula. If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), then the central lab will r eflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) the 
LDL-C rather than calculating it. 
h Hematology includes: complete blood cell count (CBC) including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, red blood ce ll distribution width (RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with 
differential count, and platelets.  Chemistry includes: plasma glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phos phorous, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, albumin, and GGT, Hepatitis C antibody (at screening, Week 24 and in case of transaminases elevation), Hepatitis B antigen (screening only).  Note that 
any Hepatitis C antibody that returns abnormal during the study will need to be followed by [CONTACT_179599].  TSH values s hould be performed at screening for patients who are on thyroid 
hormone replacement only.  
i Samples to be collected only if required per judgment of the Investigator. The only exception is plasma glucose which must be c ollected at Week 0. 
j Liver panel: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin 
k Pregnancy status should be checked by [CONTACT_179600].  Pregnancy sta tus shall be assessed at Week [ADDRESS_211261].

Background on Patient Populations 
This study will include adult patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy with 
hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular (CV) risk that is not adequately controlled on a 
maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid modifying therapy (LMT).   
Type [ADDRESS_211274] diabetes ( 1), most of whom will die from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( 2, 3, 4). Compared to people without diabetes, those with diabetes 
are at higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_179558], develop asso ciated clinical complications and at an earlier 
age, and have shortened life expectancy by [CONTACT_2902] 6 to 7 years ( 5, 6, 7). In addition to the high 
human cost of disease, CVD contributes greatly to the overall healthcare expenditure in these 
patients ( 4). 
The development of CVD in people with diabetes is a progressive process and insulin requiring patients with Type 2 diabetes are at even higher risk than those at an earlier stage of disease ( 5). 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179559] a major risk factor for macrovas cular complications in individuals with diabetes. 
In Type 2 diabetes, the dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179560] a range of lipid abnormalities including elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglycerides (TG), and reduced high 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ( 8).While an elevation of LDL-C may be variable, 
patients often present with an elevation of sma ll, dense LDL particles which are particularly 
atherogenic. These disturbances, particularly that of LDL-C elevation, contribute to the greater 
CV risk observed in those with diabetes compared with those without ( 8). Low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol is identified as the primary target of cholesterol lowering therapy ( 9) and is accepted 
as a valid surrogate endpoint ( 10, 11, 12). 
Multiple clinical trials with statins and subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes (done primarily in patients with Type 2 diabetes) have demonstrated that significant reductions in CV 
events can be achieved through lowering of LDL-C ( 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). The benefits of 
further intensification of LDL-C lowering, which in cluded patients with diabetes, were recently 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_179603] a statin ( 19).Greater reductions in LDL-C produce greater 
reduction in CV events, and comparative data of intensive versus standard statin treatment suggest that the lower the LDL-C level, the greater the benefit in patients at high CV risk ( 20, 21, 22, 23). 
Data from a meta-analyses including over [ZIP_CODE] patients with diabetes suggests that, for each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) decrease in LDL-C patients with diabetes experienced a 9% reduction in 
all-cause mortality and a 13% reduction in vascular mortality over a mean follow up period of 4.3 years ( 18). 
The specific LDL-C target differs depending on the guidelines consulted and the severity of risk experienced by [CONTACT_102], but they generally recommend a target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in patients with Type [ADDRESS_211275] a 50% LDL-C reduction

dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179562]-optimally treated ( 25, 26,  27), or may be intolerant to statin therapy, due 
to troubling side effects,  and may go on to experience additional CV events. For example, in the 
latest EUROASPI[INVESTIGATOR_179563], although 79% of those with diabetes were on a statin, 47% had an 
LDL-C above target ( 26). Similarly, in the cohort of statin-treated diabetes patients in the DYSIS 
survey, 41.3% had an LDL-C above target ( 27). 
Type [ADDRESS_211276] common chronic autoimmune disorders with age-adjusted 
incidence from 0.1 per 100 000 people per year in China to 40.9 in Finland. In the US, around 15 000 children and a similar number of adults are diagnosed every year. Aside from the enormous psychological and health burden on the individual patients, the disease costs the health-care system an estimated US $14.9 billion annually ( 28). Type 1 diabetes is associated with 
a substantially increased risk of premature death as compared to general population. Among persons with diabetes who are younger than 30 years of age, excess mortality is largely explained 
by [CONTACT_179604], including diab etic ketoacidosis and hy poglycemia, while CVD 
is the main cause of death later in life ( 29). A recent study showed that for Type 1 diabetes 
patients with on-target glycemic c ontrol, the risk of death from CV causes was more than twice 
the risk in the general population ( 30). Type 1 diabetes may also be accompanied by [CONTACT_90124][INVESTIGATOR_179564], particularly when renal dysfunction is 
present. Although the majority of participants in  statin trials had Type 2 diabetes, there was no 
evidence that the effects of statin therapy on LDL- C lowering or major vascular events in people 
with Type 1 diabetes differed from that in those with Type 2 diabetes; indeed, the reduction in major vascular events in people with Type 1 diabetes was statistically significant ( 18). 
Background to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type [ADDRESS_211277] (IMP) in this study is alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to 
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein. Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma it directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its degradation. The increased degradation of LDLRs leads to a reduced LDL particle removal and, therefore higher LDL-C circulating levels. Blocking PCSK9 binding to the LDL-R can potentially bene fit patients with hype rcholesterolemia by 
[CONTACT_56420]-C levels ( 31, 32, 33 , 34, 35). 
Summary of select clinical studies with alirocumab 
As of [ADDRESS_211278] step analysis completed, with 10 evaluating alirocumab admin istered every 2 weeks (Q2W regimen) and 2 
evaluating alirocumab administered every 4 weeks (Q4W regimen). These studies evaluated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients, patients with a range of CV risk but predominately high and very high risk, and patients not taking statins including statin intolerant 
patients.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 26 Phase 3 studies that evaluated Q2W regimen – efficacy results  
Ten studies that were completed or had a first step analysis evaluating 75 mg Q2W (with possible 
up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at Week 12) and 150 mg Q2W as initiation dose/dose regimen were performed.  Averaged across the various studies, Alirocumab use resulted in a mean -45.6 to -
48.9% reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 in studies that investigated the up-titration 
regimen and -60.4% in studies that solely investigated 150 mg Q2W dosing, whereas control rates were 0.5 to 4.2% (placebo) and -19.3 to -22.3 (ezetimibe). Superiority in LDL-C reduction was demonstrated in all placebo-controlled studies with alirocumab administered as add-on to a maximally tolerated dose of statin. Superiority in LDL-C reduction was also demonstrated in all ezetimibe-controlled studies, with a lirocumab being administered as ad d-on to statin, or to LMTs 
other than statin, or in monotherapy. Overall, absolute reductions in LDL-C in the range of -40 to -90 mg/dL (-1.03 to -2.33 mmol/L) were observed in the alirocumab treatment arms. 
LDL-C reduction observed at Week [ADDRESS_211279] studies, for the reduction in lipoprotein a (Lp[a]). Modest but consistent reductions in fasting TGs and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment. 
Phase 3 studies that evaluated Q4W regimen – efficacy results 
Two studies EFC13786 and R727-CL-1308 (first-step analysis), have evaluated the 150 mg Q4W 
and 300 mg Q4W, respectively, as initiation dose regimen with a possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W. For both studies, LDL-C reduction was observe d at Week 4 was maintained over time up to 
Week 24. As with Q2W dosing, changes in Non-HDL-C, Apo B, and TC showed good correlation 
with LDL-C. 
The R727-CL-1308 (CHOICE I) study included patients with and without concomitant statin.  In 
both of these populations, there were statistically significant effects in favor of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W with possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W for both co-primary efficacy endpoints (percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 and to averaged Weeks 21 – 24). For LDL-C reduction, the least square (LS) mean treatment difference for alirocumab versus placebo at Week 24 was -52.4% and -58.7% for the no concomitant statin population and concomitant statin population, respectively.  The results obtained at Week [ADDRESS_211280] assessed the sole contribution of the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen. Approximately 15% of patients treated with Q4W dosing who received at 
least 1 injection after Week 12 were up-titrated to Q2W dosing. 
The EFC13786 (CHOICE II) study included a vast majority of statin intolerant patients with many 
on background ezetimibe therapy. At Week 24, a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference for alirocumab (150 mg Q4W with possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W) versus placebo of -56.4% was achieved for LDL-C reduction. The results obtained at Week 12 showed a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference of -44.9%, whereby [CONTACT_56421] [ADDRESS_211281]

treated with Q4W dosing who received at least [ADDRESS_211282] been exposed to 1 or more doses of alirocumab.  
 
. 
Phase 2 and phase 3 safety results 
Safety data was analyzed from pooled phase 2 and phase 3 studies with a Q2W dosing, which 
included a total of 5234 patients, of which 3340 patients were treated with alirocumab at a dose of 75 or 150 mg Q2W.  
In the placebo-controlled and ezetimibe-controlled pooled studies, no dose relationship was noted 
for any adverse events (AEs) and there was no evidence of a pattern in the type of AEs observed. 
The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), at least 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse ev ent (SAE) and any TEAEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation were similar between the alirocumab and control groups.  
There was no safety signal observed with neurol ogic events and neurocognitive disorders, ALT 
increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, diabetes mellitus, and ophthalmologic 
disorders in the alirocumab-treated group overall, but more cataracts (2.1%) were noted in patients treated with alirocumab who achieved 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL compared to those treated with alirocumab who did not meet this criterion (0.6%). 
The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with alirocumab were local injection site 
reactions (6.2% patients in the alirocumab group versus 4.2% in control groups in the global 
pool). Injection site reactions, influenza and pruritus were identified as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions (eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis) have been reported from clinical studies in patients receiving alirocumab. 
The analysis of the safety data with Q2W dosing did not suggest a safety signal as of 
[ADDRESS_211283] longer, in the alirocumab group.

(1.81 mmol/L) and who, at baseline, have required, in addition to lifestyle modification, statin 
treatment with or without other LMT in order to achieve their LDL-C treatment goal, or who are 
statin intolerant. There is interest  in the impact of lipid lowering therapy on measures of glycemic 
control as evidence has accumulated and suggests that  the use of statin therapy is associated with 
an increased risk of diabetes. This is particularly true for people with risk factors for diabetes. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179565], th e absolute risk is quite small. 
On average, it has been estimated that treatment of 255 people over a period of 4 years will result in 1 additional case of diabetes. 
When balancing the benefit of therapy, treating the same number of people would prevent 
5.4 vascular events ( 36). While this risk impacts patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes, it 
suggests that lipid lowering treatment could modu late glycemia. In fact, evidence suggests that it 
may be transmembrane cholesterol transport that imparts the added risk as a reduced prevalence 
of diabetes has been found in patients with fa milial hypercholesterolemia as compared to patients 
without the disease (37). As a result, understanding the impact of alirocumab on glycemic control in patients with diabetes is of interest. 
In the Phase 3 program, involving a total of 5293 study participants, limited information is 
available in patients with diabetes who are treated with insulin and in those patients with Type 1 diabetes. Focusing the target population on patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin will provide additional information on this potential treatment group, both from an 
efficacy and safety point of view (concomitant use of insulin and a monoclonal antibody). In addition, this study will provide useful information on the use of alirocumab in patients already 
familiar with self-injection. 
It should be noted that all patients, except those with statin intolerance, will be on the maximum 
dose/regimen of statin that is to lerated by [CONTACT_102], based on th e Investigator’s judgment, with 
or without other LMT. Those patients who are on statins and/or other LMTs at randomization should continue the treatments unchanged throughout the study. 
Alirocumab will be evaluated at a dose of 75 mg Q2W with an increase of dose to 150 mg Q2W if 
LDL-C values at Week 8 are not <70 mg/dL.  
It is possible that some patients in the alirocumab arm may attain LDL-C levels well below 
70 mg/dL. Persons with genetic mutations such as heterozygous form of hypobetalipoproteinemia 
linked to Apo B mutations or loss of function PCSK9 mutations have very low LDL-C levels 
throughout life and have low vascular risk, and no apparent adverse effects ( 35, 38, 39, 40).

Conclusion on the benefit risk assessment with alirocumab 
Based on the clinical data available to date, treatment with alirocumab has demonstrated a 
significant LDL-C lowering effect and was generally well tolerated in a population of hypercholesterolemic patients  with non-familial hypercholeste rolemia (non-FH) or with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH), including patients with a history of intolerance to statin. The efficacy on LDL-C was associated with consistent results in total 
cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and Apo B/Apo A-1 ratio. Reductions in Lp(a) and TG and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment.  There was no safety signal observed with neurologic events and neurocogn itive disorders, ALT increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated 
CV events, diabetes mellitus, and ophthalmologic disorders. 
Injection site reactions, influenza (upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]), and pruritus were identified as 
ADRs. Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions (eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis) have been reported from clinical studies in patients receiving aliroc umab. Alirocumab lowered LDL-C be low 25 mg/dL in some patients. 
 
The benefit of alirocumab on CV morbidity and mo rtality has not yet been determined and is 
under investigation in the on-going ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.  
This study is being undertaken to evaluate the risk  benefit profile of alirocumab in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin, given the high CV risk of this population. Since no study in the 
ODYSSEY program (ie, the alirocumab clinical trial program) has specifically focused on 
patients with diabetes and that it included a limited number of patients on insulin these data 
should provide important information concerning the efficacy and safety of alirocumab when used concomitantly with insulin in this high risk group.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a Phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of alirocumab administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection in insulin treated patients with 
Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and with hypercholesterolemia at high CV risk not adequately controlled on maximally to lerated LDL-C lowering therapy. Th e study will be multinational and 
multicenter. The study consists of a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks, and a safety observation period of 8 weeks. 
Patients, unless they are statin intolerant, will be taking a stable, maximally tolerated dose of 
statin therapy with or without other lipid modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMT). Statin dose and dose regimen as well as dose and dose regimen of othe r lipid modifying treatmen t(s) (if applicable) 
should be stable throughout the entire study duration including for 4 weeks prior to the screening 
period, during the screening period, and from screening to randomization. Patients should be on a 
stable diet for glucose and lipid management throughout the entire study duration from screening to the Week 24 visit. Patients should be receiving treatment for diabetes in accordance with local/regional standards of care. 
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_179605] (ie, Type 1 diabet es versus Type 2 diabetes). 
Recruitment of patients with Type [ADDRESS_211287] been randomized or the end of the targeted recruitment period (summer 2016), whichever comes first. 
Alirocumab will be administered subcutaneously with a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W for 12 weeks 
with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W at Week 12 if the LDL-C at the Week 8 
visit is 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). Patients who have an LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at the 
Week [ADDRESS_211288] the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization until afte r the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient, as 
per the Investigator’s judgment. 
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work at each visit; in 
addition a phone visit is scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32.

Sterile alirocumab drug product will be supplied at a concentration of 75 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL 
in an aqueous buffer, pH 6.0, containing sucrose, histidine, and polysorbate 20, both as 1 mL volume, in an auto-injector (also known as prefilled pen). 
Sterile placebo for alirocumab will be prepared in the same formulation as alirocumab without the 
addition of protein as 1 mL volume in a prefilled pen, for the patients to perform injection training, as well as for those in the placebo treatment arm. 
During the screening period, the patient (or another designated person) will have to perform a 
placebo self-injection training, using a prefilled pen, before the first administration of IMP.   
For those patients randomized to alirocumab, the initial dose is 75 mg administered 
subcutaneously once Q2W. The dose will be increased in a blinded fashion to 150 mg Q2W at 
Week 12 for patients randomized to alirocumab if the Week 8 LDL-C value is 70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L).   
Those patients randomized to place bo will be administered their injection subcutaneously Q2W 
throughout the duration of the 24-week treatment period. NOTE: in order to ensure the continuity of the study treatment without interruption (only in the 
event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the prefilled pen), contingency alternatives are: 
x in case of disruption of the 150 mg prefilled pen only, if the use of 75 mg prefilled pens is 
maintained, patients will need to administer 2 injections as follows: 
- 2 injections of 75 mg as 1 mL each in a prefilled pen for patients receiving the 150 mg 
dose 
- 1 injection of 75 mg as 1 mL in a prefilled pen plus 1 injection of placebo as 1 mL in a 
prefilled pen for patients receiving the 75 mg dose 
- 2 placebo injections as 1 mL each in a prefilled pen for patients receiving placebo 
OR 
x in case of disruption of either 75 mg or 150 mg or both prefilled pens, patients will be switched to the use of prefilled syringes of placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg, with one injection 
of 1 mL for each of these doses 
Should this occur, the alternative IMP will be maintained until the end of the study.

A prefilled pen training guide (aut o-injector training guide) w ill be provided to the sites and 
instructions for use (auto-injector for use) will be provided to the patient. Each administration of 
IMP will consist of 1mL subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of upper arm 
(ie, deltoid region). If another concomitant drug is  being injected at the same site planned for the 
IMP injection, then the patient should be advised to use an alternate location for administration of the IMP. 
The IMP could be administered by [CONTACT_6270]-injection or by [CONTACT_56435] (such as a 
spouse, relative, etc). In case a designated person is due to inject alirocumab to a patient during 
the study, it must be ensured that this person has been adequately trained prior to administering 
the injection. Anyone that plans to administer the IMP must be trained by [CONTACT_5984]. 
Instructions should be provided to the patient (or another designated person [such as spouse,

study. Close supervision and feedback should be given at the first visit, and other visits as needed.  
The used prefilled pen will be discarded in a shar ps container which will be  provided to patients. 
It is recommended that the subcutaneous IMP injections be rotated within an anatomical area (eg, 
right thigh, then left thigh or right abdomen, then left abdomen). Patients also have the option to inject in a different anatomical area (eg, thigh then abdomen or the outer area of upper arm, etc) during the study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
The treatment code will be unblinded by [CONTACT_179613] (S[LOCATION_003]R), ie, any 
Serious Adverse Event that is both unexpected (per the specific section of the CIB) and 
reasonably associated with the use of the IMP acco rding to either the judgment of the Investigator 
and /or the Sponsor. 
Refer to Section  10.[ADDRESS_211306] unblinding by [CONTACT_179614]  8.3.2 
(Randomization code breaking during the study) for unblinding an AE under exceptional 
circumstances when knowledge of the Investigational Medicinal Product is essential for treating the patient. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lipid parameters 
Lipid parameter values from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit, run by [CONTACT_6626], will not be communicated to the sites so that they cannot deduce the treatment group of their patients based on LDL-C level attained.  The sponsor’s operational team will not have access to lipid parameters associated with patient identification un til after the final database lock 
has occurred. For safety purposes, TG alerts for TG values 500 mg/dL any time after 
randomization will be sent to the Investigator ( Section  8.8.1 and Section  9). 
At the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 24 visit) the Investigator will continue to 
manage the patient’s lipi[INVESTIGATOR_179570]. Any lipid values after 
randomization should be redacted in the source documents and not shared with the Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-alirocumab antibodies 
Patient anti-alirocumab antibody re sults will not be communicated to the sites while the study is 
ongoing. 
The sponsor’s operational team will not have access to anti-alirocumab antibody results associated 
with a patient identification number until afte r the final database lock has occurred. 
The lab technicians involved in the determination of patient anti-alirocumab antibody titers are 
excluded from the operations team and a pro cess will be set up to prevent any potential 
unblinding.

Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_179616] (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS), depending on which system is 
used for the site, and/or by [CONTACT_179617]. However, it is preferable to contact [CONTACT_179618]. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking, and report this information on the appropriate page of the e-CRF.  
Note that when documenting the reason for unblinding, the Investigator must not provide any 
detail regarding the nature of the IMP. The Investigator should not divulge IMP detail to the Sponsor’s representative or to any staff members until database closure. Furthermore, when completing forms (eg, AE, SAE), the study treatment should not be disclosed on the forms.   
The code-breaking material will be also kept at the entity responsible for the “24 hour alert 
system”; but this system should be used in very exceptional cases only (ie, unavailability of 
IVR/IWR system or inability to contact [CONTACT_18615]/or site staff). However, the preferred 
option is to unblind using IVRS. The Investigators will be informed by [CONTACT_179619]-breaking material. A patient card, including the relevant “24 hour alert system” telephone number will be provided to every patient who will participate in the study. Unblinding may also be performed by [CONTACT_179620] (ie, for some SAEs that are both related and unexpected). 
If the code is broken, the patient must permanently discontinue IMP administration.

(alirocumab 75 or 150 mg kits, or placebo kit) will be packaged in accordance with this list. The Trial Supply Operations Manager will provide the randomized list of treatment kit numbers 
and the Study Biostatistician will provide the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment allocation system provider. Then, this centralized treatment allocation system provider will generate the patient randomization list according to which it will allocate the treatments to the 
patients. 
Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or alirocumab during the double-blind 
treatment period. The randomization ratio alirocumab:placebo will be 2:1. For each randomized patient, there will be several corresponding treatment kit numbers (resupply visits), which will be allocated through the centralized treatment allocation system. Th e randomization is stratified by 
[CONTACT_179591] (ie, Type 1 versus Type 2). 
The treatment kit numbers will be allocated using the centralized treatment allocation system on 
randomization visit (Day 1, Week 0), and then at Week 12 as re-supply visits, and at unscheduled visits if needed.

The window period for Week 0 is +3 days.  The window period for Weeks 8, 12 and 24 is 
±3 days. The window period for Weeks 4, 20, and 32 is ±7 days. 
For all visits after Day 1/inclusion visit, if one visit date is changed, then the next visit should take 
place according to the original schedule as outlined in the Study Flow Chart (Section  1.2). 
Blood sampling 
All blood sampling, including the blood sampling for determination of lipid parameters (eg, TC, 
LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non-HDL-C, Apo A, Apo B, Apo C-III, Lp(a), LDL particle size and 
number) and also for plasma glucose should be performed in the morning, in fasting condition (ie, overnight, at least [ADDRESS_211319] and refrain from smoking), and before IMP injection for all site visits throughout the study. Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding the blood sampling are discouraged. 
Note: if the patient is not in fasting conditions, the blood sample will not be collected and a new 
appointment will be given to the patient for the day after (or as close as possible to this date), with instructions to fast (see above conditions).

Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in sitting position under standardized conditions, 
approximately at the same time of the day, on the same arm, with  the same apparatus (after the 
patient has rested comfortably in sitting position for at least 5 minutes). Values are to be recorded 
in the e-CRF; both systolic BP and diastolic BP should be recorded. At the first screening visit, BP should be measured in both arms. The arm with the highest diastolic pressure will be determined at this visit, and BP should be measured on this arm throughout the study. This highest value will be recorded in the e-CRF. 
Heart rate will be measured at th e time of the measurement of BP. 
Notes: in case of high BP values, the Investigator is responsible for the optimization of the 
patient’s treatment to achieve BP targets as defined by [CONTACT_13144]/regi onal standards of care. 
Body weight and height 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same scale should be used throughout the study. 
Height needs to be measured, as self-reported heights are not acceptable.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.  
(electronic 
Clinical Trial Protocol  08-Jul-2015 
SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: [ADDRESS_211336](s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_179639]. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and 
Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be recorded by [CONTACT_179640].  
Temporary treatment discontinuation is defined as one or more scheduled injections that are not 
administered to the patient as decided by [CONTACT_737]. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_211337](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinua tion is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pati ent not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_211338] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or 
e-CRF. Patients should discontinue IMP for the following reasons: 
x Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
x Acute injection reaction of clinical concern. 
x SAE (or non-serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction considered related 
to IMP. 
x At patient request. 
x If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP (eg, laboratory abnormalities, please refer to decision tree in Appendix C ). 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
x Any code breaking requested by [CONTACT_737]. 
x Patient receives double-blind treatment prior to randomization

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 64 Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation (within 24 hours 
if possible), before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient.   
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should still continue the study and undergo all visits and procedures as described in Section  1.[ADDRESS_211339], as soon as possible, an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at EOT visit (this should take place within 5 days of treatment 
discontinuation, if possible) and then resume the original study schedule until end of study. 
If after treatment discontinuation, the patient refuses to resume the original study schedule until 
the end of the study, then if possible, the patient should undergo an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the EOT visit (it should take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible). The patient, at a minimum, should then be followed-up for at least [ADDRESS_211340] 10 weeks after the premature discontinuation. 
All definitive discontinuation of study treatment should be recorded by [CONTACT_179641]. IVRS/IWRS should be notified 
when a patient prematurely discontinues study treatment. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_211341] 
the patient (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_179642] s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how the primary endpoints of patients who are lost to 
follow-up will be considered. 
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179576] (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important ev ents is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse 
- ALT >[ADDRESS_211342] + total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_211343] or  asymptomatic ALT increase >[ADDRESS_211344] 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) that needs to be monitored, documented, and managed 
in a pre-specified manner described in the protocol ( Appendix B ). 
For this study, the AESI are:  
x Increase in ALT: 
ALT [ADDRESS_211345] (if baseline ALT <ULN) Or ALT 2 times the baseline value (if baseline 
ALT ULN) (Appendix C ). 
x Allergic events. 
- Allergic drug reactions and/or local injection site reactions deemed to be allergic by 
[CONTACT_737] (or have an allergic component), that require consultation with another 
physician for further evaluation of hypersen sitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s 
medical judgment should be reported as an AESI. 
x Pregnancy: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient or the partner of a male patient (if permitted 
by [CONTACT_179643]) during the study or within [ADDRESS_211346] should be discontinued.   
- The follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.   
x Symptomatic overdose with IMP: 
- An overdose (accidental or in tentional) is an event suspected by [CONTACT_56453] (not based on systematic injection counts) and 
defined as at least twice of the intended dos e within the intended therapeutic interval 
(ie, 2 or more injections are administered in <7 calendar days), to be reported using the Term “symptomatic OVERDOSE (accident al or intentional), indicating the

appropriate symptomatic  treatment instituted. 
- The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE/SAE forms.  
- Of note, asymptomatic overdose should be reported as a standard AE.  
x Neurologic events: 
- Neurologic events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a 
specialist should be reported as an AESI. If the event does not require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist, it should be reported as a standard AE. 
x Neurocognitive events 
- All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI 
[IP_ADDRESS] Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions that are considered  by [CONTACT_56482]-allergic events and 
that are related to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be 
further characterized by [CONTACT_179644], pain, etc. If the patient experiences a local injection site 
reaction with no signs or symptoms except for erythema/redness, and/ or swelling, and the 
diameter of the erythema/ redness, or swelling measure <2.5 cm, no AE for local injection site reaction needs to be reported as this is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a clinically important finding. However, if the patient has a reaction of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes with activity, then it should be considered as a clinically relevant finding and should be reported as an AE with a corresponding grade of moderate or severe, in accordance with Appendix E .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Device deficiency 
A device deficiency is any inadequacy related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety 
or performance of the medical device including malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
Product Complaints: 
x A product complaint is defined as any written, electronic, or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qua lity, durability, reliability, safety, efficacy or 
performance of a product after it is released for distribution. Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_179645]. 
x All product complaints must be reported on a product complaint form when there is a reason to suspect a problem with the device. 
x In case of a product complaint associated with the occurrence of an AE, the AE must be documented on an AE page in the CRF.

are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the CRF. 
x All product complaints associated or not to an AE are to be recorded immediately on the corresponding products (study medical device) complaints pages and reported to the local 
Complaint Service immediately (within 24 hours). 
x Whenever possible, a diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of 
symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with 
respect to IMP, corrective tr eatment/therapy given, additiona l investigations performed, 
outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_179577] e is a reasonable possibility that the AE 
was caused by [CONTACT_179646](s).  
x The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations for certain events, such as SAEs/AESI, will continue beyond the last planned 
visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_179647].  
x When treatment is prematurely  discontinued, the patient’s obs ervations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485], if possible. 
x Laboratory or vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or

10.4.5 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, documented, and managed according to the related flow chart in Appendix C . Reporting instructions are provided in 
Appendix B . 
x Neutropenia 
x Thrombocytopenia 
x Increase in ALT 
x Acute renal insufficiency 
x Increase in CPK (other than cardiac-related) and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_179578] B  and Appendix C , 
especially in situations where the abnormality persists or when there is no clear explanation for the observed abnormality. However there may be situations where these algorithms are not entirely applicable; therefore, the Investigator may use his/her best judgment. Also, in some situations, the Sponsor may wish to discuss with the Investigator. Examples where these algorithms may not be applicable include, but  are not limited to, the following situations: 
x Patients with known stable, low or borderline neutrophil count at baseline 
x Patients with known stable, low or borderline platelet count at baseline 
x Patients with impaired renal function at baseline 
The Investigator should attempt to have a diagnosis for the observed finding and should use his/her best judgment as whether to or not enroll such patients, and if the patient is enrolled, how to best monitor these baseline abnormalities throughout the study.  
Additional examples where these algorithms may not  be applicable include, but are not limited to, 
the following situations: 
x Patients with ALT increase for which the abnormality resolves following statin dose 
reduction or statin discontinuation

In addition, discontinuation caused by a laboratory abnormality can be either permanent or 
temporary, depending on the particular case. There is no requirement for permanent treatment discontinuation in every case of the general guidance for the follow-up of selected laboratory abnormalities mentioned in Appendix C . 
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
x All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (S[LOCATION_003]R), to the regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators. 
x All SAEs that are expected and at least reason ably related to the IMPs to the regulatory 
authorities, according to local regulations. 
The AESIs listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] will be reported to those regu latory authorities who require 
such reporting.  
In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected as indicated  in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be considered unexpected. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (local injection site reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed-up as per the Investigator’ s medical judgment. Specific e-CRF screens are 
to be filled in. Information on cla ssifying the reaction are given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and on 
reporting these reactions is given in Appendix B .

Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc. should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs. An unschedul ed assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver 
panel should be obtained. An additional blood sample will have to be drawn for PK and anti-alirocumab antibody analyses (adequate inst ructions will be provided to the site by [CONTACT_179648]).

The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients who have an evaluable primary efficacy 
endpoint.  
Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
[CONTACT_17628]. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is evaluable when the two following conditions are met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
x A least one calculated LDL-C value is available within one of the analysis windows up to 
Week 24. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified intent-to-treat population 
The modified ITT (mITT) population (otherwise referred to as the on-treatment population) is 
defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose or part of a dose of the double-blind IMP and have an evaluable primary efficacy endpoint during the efficacy treatment period. 
Patients in the mITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
[CONTACT_17628]. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is considered as evaluable when the two following conditions are 
met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
x At least one calculated LDL-C value is available during the efficacy treatment period and 
within one of the analysis windows up to Week 24. 
The efficacy treatment period is defined as the time period from the first double-blind IMP 
injection up to [ADDRESS_211353] one dose or part of a dose of the double-blind IMP. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received (placebo or alirocumab). 
The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) period defined 
as the time from the first double-blind dose to the last double-blind dose of IMP + 70 days

The extent of study treatment exposure and co mpliance will be assessed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_179650]. 
In order to ensure the continuity of the investigational treatment for the patients without 
interruption (only in case a disruption occurs in the availability of device components or during production of the prefilled pen), back-up plans may be implemented as described in Section  8.1. 
In that case, exposure to initial device and back-up device will be summarized and impact on

missing or incomplete data.  
Compliance will be assessed using the following parameters: 
x The injection frequency will be defined for e ach patient as the average number of days 
between 2 injections, that is: (last dose date – first dose date)/(number of injections -1). 
This parameter will be summa rized descriptively (N, Mea n, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
The percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_211355] model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for by [CONTACT_56412].  
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (placebo versus 
alirocumab), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20 and Week 24), treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Model assumptions for normality will be explored prior to the analysis testing. 
This model will be run using SAS Mixed procedur e with an unstructured correlation matrix to 
model the within-patient errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood 
method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation. This model will provide baseline adjusted LS means estimates at Week [ADDRESS_211356] errors (SEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To compare the alirocumab group to the placebo group, an appropriate contrast statement will be used to test the differe nces of these estimates, at the 2-sided 
0.05 level. Separate analyses will be performed for Type 1 diabetes patients on one hand (alpha risk = 0.05) and Type 2 diabetes patients on the other hand (alpha risk = 0.05). 
Let μ0 and μ1 be the population means of the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C 
at Week 24 under placebo and alirocumab, respectively. The null hypothesis that will be tested is: 
 
H0 : μ0 = μ 1 
versus 
H1 : μ 0  μ1 
Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed via sensitivity analyses detailed in the SAP, 
including different methodologies for missing data (multiple imputati on and potentially pattern

evaluate the robustness of the results regardless of the way to assess LDL-C. Correlation of calculated LDL-C with measured LDL-C will be explored graphically as deemed necessary. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Method for controlling the overall type-I error rate when testing the key secondary efficacy endpoints is described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
For key secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section  9.2.1) and other efficacy endpoints 
(described in Section  9.2.3), descriptive summaries and analys es will be performed in the ITT 
population or mITT population depending on the estimand used.  
For descriptive summaries, percent change from baseline in calculated LDL C, C, HDL-C, TG, 
and non-HDL-C will be provided at each time point for each treatment group. All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled will be assigned to analysis windows defined in the SAP in order to provide an assessment for these time points. Laboratory assessments other than the ones provided by [CONTACT_56491]. The time profile of each parameter will be plotted by [CONTACT_179651].  
Similar tables (with either percent change from ba seline or absolute change from baseline for the 
ratio) and plots will be provided for other efficacy endpoints: Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio 
Apo B/Apo A-1, Apo C-III, Lp(a), TGRL, LDL-C particle size, and LDL-C particle number. For TG and Lp(a), summary statistic s will include Q1 and Q3, and me dians (instead of means) by 
[CONTACT_179652].  
Multiple types of measurements ar e planned to be analyzed during differing time points in the 
trial, specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution (eg, percent 
change in calculated LDL-C), continuous measurements expected to have a non-normal distribution (eg, TG), and binary measurements (eg, proportion of patients reaching LDL-C <70 mg/dL). 
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution

(eg, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_101787][a]) will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the 
primary endpoint. Specifically, the model will contain fixed categorical effects of treatment 
group, planned time points to Week [ADDRESS_211358] a nonnormal 
distribution (ie, TG and Lp[a]), will be analyzed using a robust regression model (ie, 
ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M-estimation option) with treatment group as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. Missing values will be addressed using a multiple

SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: [ADDRESS_211359] regression model. The 
treatment group combined means will be provided with respective SE estimates. The combined mean difference between the treatment groups will be provided with the SE, 95% CI and p-value. 
Binary endpoints 
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  9.[ADDRESS_211360] and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. 
Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation appro ach which will be described in 
the SAP. The variables in the multiple imputation m odel will at least include the same variables as 
used in the logistic regression model. Treatment effects will be compared and the combined odds ratio estimate between the treatment groups, with their corresponding 95% CIs and p-value will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic regression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in [ADDRESS_211361]), the Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach would be used for handling of missing values and 
an exact conditional logistic regression would be performed to compare treatment effects. The LOCF imputation method will consist of using the last value obtained up to the Week 24 analysis window (or Week 12 as applicable) to impute the missing week 24 value (or Week 12 respectively). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity considerations 
In order to handle multiple key secondary efficacy endpoints, the overall type-I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_2224] a sequen tial inferential approach. Statistical significance of the primary 
parameter at the 0.[ADDRESS_211362] key secondary parameter (refer to order of list in Section  9.2.1).  
Inferential conclusions about successive key secondary parameters require statistical significance of the prior one. This fixed hierar chical approach will ensure a stro ng control of the overall type-I 
error rate at the 0.05 level.  
No further adjustments will be made for other efficacy endpoints for which p-values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose only. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. No formal inferential testing will be performed. Summaries w ill be descriptive in nature. 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rules: 
x The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first injection 
of double-blind IMP.

x The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_56493]/thresholds based on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_179653]. 
x PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment 
period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the 
numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage. 
x Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time 
from first dose of double-blind IMP injection to the last dose of double-blind IMP 
injection + [ADDRESS_211363] for total bilirubin. 
The incidence of liver-related AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The selection of 
preferred terms will be based on standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) Hepatic disorder. Time to 
liver-related treatment discontinuation and time to liver death may also be provided based on hepatic disorder SMQ. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) (sorted by 
[CONTACT_56496]), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group.

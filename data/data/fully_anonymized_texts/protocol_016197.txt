Study Significance/Background  
Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the intravenous administration of complete and balanced nutrition ; it has transformed 
nutritional support for patient s who cannot maintain adequate nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract.1  PN is 
associated with a number of significant infectious and metabolic complications including parenteral nutrition -
associated cholestasis (PNAC) which can lead to parenteral nutrition -associated liver disease (PNALD).  Both 
are considered among the  most  challenging complications associated with prolonged PN administration.   PNAC  
is generally accepted to occur when the direct  bilirubin rises above 2 mg/dL after other potential etiologies of 
direct hyperbilirubinemia have been eliminated.2-5  The reported incidence of liver dysfunction in children on long 
term PN in the literature ranges from 7.4% to 84%; this variety is attributed  to study heterogeneity – the patient 
population studied, the definition of liver dysfunction  used and different risk factors associated with the 
development of liver disease  itself.6,7  
 
Well-characterized risk factors for the development of PNAC  include prematurity, low birth weight, repeated  
infectious/septic ep isodes, a lack of enteral feeds, delayed initiation of enteral feeds and the length of time on 
PN.8-[ADDRESS_303408] risk 
factor for mortality.13 
 
Parenteral nutrition is made up of amino acids, dextrose, intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE), micronutrients, fluids , 
and electrolytes.  In addition to the patient -related factors listed above which are known to contribute to the 
development of PNAC , the IVFE component of PN , and specifically soybean -based emulsions, have  been shown 
to be an independent causative factor in the development of PNAC .14,[ADDRESS_303409] been undertaken to minimize t he effects of IVFE on 
the liver; these strategies include soybean -based IVFE  reduction  or the use of alternative IVFE such as marine  
oil-based emulsions or combination fat emulsions.  Data supporting these approaches, however, have been 
based on retrospective or uncontrolled studies thus limiting the strength of the supporting evidence.   Further, 
soybean based fat emulsions remain the only approved IVFE products for use in pediatric patients in the United 
States.  
 
The standard dosing for IVFE in neonates is 3 g/kg/day.  The development of PNAC  while on this dosing regimen 
often leads prac titioners to reduce the IVFE  dose  in an attempt to reverse or  keep the liver dysfunction and 
fibrosis from progressing.   The data supporting IVFE reduction (IFER)  focus on the efficacy of this modification 
after the first signs of PNAC  have developed rathe r than as a preventative approach.  The benefit of IFER  was 
first described in the adult literature in 1982 but it was not until 2000 that a similar approach was reported in a 
pediatric population with severe cholestasis.17,18  In this report by [CONTACT_249545] ( defined as a plasma bilirubin ≥ 30 µmol/L) .  Patients were 
subsequently noted to have a marked decline in bilirubin levels.18  A prospective study by [CONTACT_249546] .19,20  In this single -center study , patient s 
who developed PNAC ( defined as a direct bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL) on standard soybean -based IVFE at a dose of 
3 g/kg/day were switched to a restricted regimen of IVFE at a dose of 1 g/kg/day twice a week.  These infants  
were then compared to a well -matched historical control s who were maintained on standard IVFE dosing 
regardless of bilirubin level.  Thirty -one patients were included in the study group and were noted to have a 
significant decline in their serum direct bi lirubin levels over time when compared to the control group.   
Specifically, the IFER  group was found to have a downward trend in bilirubin whereas the standard cohort was 
found to have increased bilirubin levels across study weeks (estimated slope -0.73 mg /dL/week c ompared to 
0.29 mg/dL/week; p= 0.0017).   In addition, the number of patients achieving resolution of PNAC was significantly 
greater in the IFER  group com pared to the control group (n=13 vs. n= 3; p=0.013).  It is important to note that 
eight patien ts in the IFER  group developed mild, reversible essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) which was 
Standard IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD  
 
 3 defined as a triene:tetraene ratio ≥0.05.  No physical manifestations of EFAD were observed in this group, 
however, and those who developed EFAD had their IVFE  dose increased to 1 g/kg/day three times a week.  If 
EFAD persisted the IVFE dose was increased to 2 g/kg/day .  Increased IVFE  dosing  led to resolution of EFAD  
in all patients.  No significant differences in growth parameters were noted between  groups.  
 
A reduction in the dose of soybean -based emulsion has also been studied as a preventative approach.   In a 
study by [CONTACT_249547], neonates requiring long -term parenteral nutrition support, defined as ≥21 days 
of therapy, were divided into two groups:   those receiving IVFE at a dose of 1 g/kg/day (n = 2 9) and those 
receiving IVFE at  dose s between 2 and 3 g/kg/day (n= 32).[ADDRESS_303410] bilirubin >2 mg/dL for ≥2 consecutive weeks.  
The incidence of cholestasis was not significantly different between the groups with 15/29 (52%) developi[INVESTIGATOR_249525] 14/32 (44%; p=0.61) in the standard IVFE group.   The time to 
cholestasis was als o similar between groups.  In this study, once cholestasis developed patients were 
expeditiously transitioned to full enteral feeds or to a marine  oil-based fat emulsion.  Limitations of this study 
include its retrospective nature, slight diffe rences betwe en the study groups and unclear indications for the 
different IVFE  doses between groups.  
 
A retrospective study was recently published which compared the development of cholestasis in surgical infants 
treated with 1 g/kg/day of IVFE  relative to a historica l cohort who received standard dosing.[ADDRESS_303411] 2 week s were administered  
a soybean -based fat emulsion at a dose of 1 g/kg/day.  A total of [ADDRESS_303412] do se soybean -based IVFE  (2 to 3 g/kg/day) at the same 
institution from [ADDRESS_303413] a signif icantly lower incidence 
of PNAC  (defined as a serum bilirubin  ≥2 mg/dL for a minimum of [ADDRESS_303414] 2  measurements):  
22% compared to 43% (p=0.003).  IFER was also associated with a reduction in the peak direct  bilirubin levels 
observed (p<0.0001).  Overall, infants treated with standard dosing were 1.77 ti mes more likely to develop PNAC  
than those treate d with IFER  (CI 1.17 – 2.68; p=0.007).  Growth parameters were not different between groups.  
Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and the lack of data regarding the development of EFAD 
in the IFER  group.  
 
In the first known study of its kind, Rollins et al recently published pi[INVESTIGATOR_249526] a prospective, randomized trial 
comparing IFER  to standard IVFE  dosing in surgical neonates.23  In this study 28 surgical patients ≥[ADDRESS_303415] 2  weeks  were randomized to reduced (1  g/kg/day) or standard (3 
g/kg/day) IVFE .  Because this was a feasibility study it was not powered to detect significant differences between 
the groups.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_249527] , infants who received  the reduced dose were obse rved to have  lower overall 
direct  bilirubin levels ( p=0.04).  Subjects randomized to standard dosing had a 13 -fold higher median increase 
in total bile acids compared to a 2 -fold inc rease  in the reduced group (p=0.02).  While weight  z-scores increased 
more  in the standard group (p=0.006), average weight gain was similar between the groups (23.7 g/day in the 
standard group and 20.8 g/day in the reduced group).  No patient in the reduced IVFE  group developed cli nical 
or laboratory -proven EFAD which was assess ed using triene:tetraene ratios.  
 
These studies of IFER  reveal important  but occasionally conflicting  findings relevant to the administration of  a 
reduced dose  of IVFE  and its effect on the prevention and treatment of PNAC .  Each study has limitations and 
because of their occasionally differing conclusions, questions remain regarding the optimal dose of IVFE s to 
promote growth and  optimize brain development while preventing the development of PNAC  and its progression 
to irreversible liver disease .  These qu estions include the optimal dose of IVFE, the timing of the initiation of 
IFER , short - and long -term outcomes related to IFER  as well as the safety associated with this treatment 
approach.  These questions will be best answered in a well -designed prospective study that randomizes patients 
to IFER  and standard dosing in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy in main taining adequate 
growth while reducing the development of PNAC  and without leading to EFAD . 
 
Essential fatty acids are known to be important for neurodevelopment. Specifically, docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),  and long -chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are 
important for neural development and visual development within the first year of life.[ADDRESS_303416] IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD  
 
 4 linoleic and alpha -linolenic acid s are converted to AA and DHA and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_249528] 
(e.g. breast milk or enteral formulas).  However, for PN -dependent patients, essential fatty acids must be 
provided through IVFEs. The optimal dose and type of IVFE is a topi c of current investigation, and the effects of 
exogenous supplementation via  the intravenous or enteral route on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_249529].25  The balance between providing these essent ial nutrients during infancy and preventing the 
development of PNAC has  led to concerns regarding the possible effects on neurodevelopment.  In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_249530] , the association between IFER treatment and poor 
neurodevelopmental outcomes was evaluated.26  Of the IFER -related variables analyzed (mean IVFE dose, 
IFER duration, and development of EFAD), none were found to be predictive of poor neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.  However, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_249531], relied on  parent -reported outcomes, and wa s 
limited by [CONTACT_133206].   Further data is needed to confirm the effects of early IFER on neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.   
 
 
Primary Hypothesis  
IVFE reduction (IFER)  during the administration of neonatal parenteral nutrition will lead to a significant decrease 
in the rate of rise of direct bilirubin  (mg/dL/week)  when compared to standard therapy.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses  
1. The t ime to development of PNAC, when present, will be longer with IFER  when compared to standard 
IVFE  therapy . 
2. IFER will not be associated with a significant increase  in failure to thrive (as assessed by  [CONTACT_249548] ) or the development of  essential fatty  acid deficiency  (EFAD)  when compared to standard 
IVFE  therapy . 
3. Neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDOs), when assessed at [ADDRESS_303417] IVFE therapy.  
 
Specific Aims  
1. To determine whether neonates and infants receiving PN with IFER (1 g/kg/day) will have lower rates of 
rise of direct bilirubin compared to those receiving standard IVFE therapy (3 g/kg/day)  
2. To compare the time to development of PNAC in neonates  and infants  receiving PN with IFER  (1 
g/kg/day) compared to those receiving PN with standard IVFE administration ( 3 g/kg/day)  
3. To determine if IFER results in normal growth and essential fatty acid (EFA) parameters by [CONTACT_249549], length, head circumference  (weekly)  and EFA profiles (every 2 weeks  in the IFER group ) during 
the treatment  period.  
4. To compare NDOs at 12 and 24 months of corrected gestational (2 weeks) age of those treated with 
IFER with those treated with standard IVFE doses using a  combinatio n of neurodevelopmental screening 
tools (e.g. Bayley Scales of Infant Development, MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory, etc.) 
aimed at capturing several developmental domains such as motor, cognition, speech and language, 
sensory, and behavior.  
 
Study Definitions  
Subjects will be considered “on treatment” from the time of randomization until 7 days after PN has been 
discontinued, but not to exceed a total of 84 days.  Subjects will be considered “on study” until they 
complete their neurodevelopmen tal testing at 24 months corrected gestational age (2 weeks).  
 
Study Design  
This is a multi -institution, prospective , randomized study evaluating  IVFE dose  reduction on the development of 
PNAC as a proxy measure of PNALD in neonates requiring prolonged PN .  The definition of PNAC will be that 
used predominantly in the literature – a direct bilirubin level of ≥2 mg/dL , documented on two occasions  [ADDRESS_303418] required parenteral nutrition for more than 2 weeks .  Eligible neonates will be 
randomized into two treatment arms:  standard IVFE administration (3 g/kg/day) or IVFE reduction (IFER)  
(1 g/kg/day).   A total of 60 subjects (30 subjects per arm) will be included in the study. The study will evaluate

No preference will be given to sex, race or ethnic background during the enrollment of subjects into the study.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Birthw eight <1kg   
2. A metabolic pathway defect which is associated with liver dysfunction in the neonatal period including: 
hereditary fructose intolerance, galactosemia due to transferase deficiency and neonatal tyrosinemia, 
and/or disorders of lipid metab olism  
3. A history of h epatic insufficiency as defined by [CONTACT_5640] a biopsy with cirrhosis and/or a marked aberration 
in synthetic function (defined by [CONTACT_249552] (INR ≥2.0) with no evidence of a systemic 
coagulopathy and no administration of an anticoagulant ) 
4. Primary or secondary liver disease , including hepatitis,  as defined by [CONTACT_249553] 
(INR ≥2.0)or elevation of liver function tests (AST and ALT) greater than twice the upper limit of the age -
adjusted norm  
5. Congenital obstruction of the hepatobiliary tree (e.g. biliary atresia, choledochal cyst)  
6. History of PNAC or a direct bilirubin >2 mg/dL at any time prior to enrollment/randomization  
7. Renal failure (as defined by a creatinine >1.5 mg/dL)  
8. Use of extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation (ECMO), as hemolysis from the ECMO circuit may cause 
a mixed hyperbilirubinemia unrelated to the development of PNAC  
9. Documented active infection which may be communicable, including infectious hepatitis or human 
immunodeficiency virus  
10. Previous  receipt of choleretic agents (e.g. ursodiol, phenobarbital, cholecystokinin).  This is done in order 
to avoid the use of an agent which may reduce cholestasis and the development of PNAC.

Removal from Study Pro tocol After Init iation of Study  
The following criteria may require study removal:  
1. Parent o r guardian request for removal  
2. Transfer  to a non -study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
3. Develop ment of  multiple nutritional problems which are unable to be managed (e.g. more than mild 
undernutrition, irreversible undernutrition, hyperglycemia, or hypertriglyceridemia refractory to 
intervention)  
      4.   At the discretion of the PI  
 
[INVESTIGATOR_249533].  Consent will be obtained in 
person whenever possible.  In the rare circumstance that a parent or legal guardian cannot be present in person , 
consent will be obtained via telep hone.  We expect this to be an unusual occurrence as subjects  can be 
randomized up to 72 hours  after PN initiation . 
 
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized within 72 hours of PN initiation .  Stratified, equal within -center randomization will be 
performed after consent is obtained.  Group assignment will be determined by  a random permutation of blocks 
of randomly determined sizes of 2 or 4.  Randomization will be stratified based on gestational  age (<32 and ≥32 
weeks gestatio n).  Enrollment and randomization will occur as early as feasible after identification of subjects 
who meet eligibility criteria.  Randomization MUST occur within [ADDRESS_303433]’s family members, the statistical team and those administering the neurodevelopmental tests will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  Blinding  of families and those evaluati ng neurodevelopmental outco mes is 
particularly important as these are subjective assessments which we do not want to be biased by [CONTACT_249554].  Adequacy of blinding will be assessed at the end of the initial [ADDRESS_303434] has been assigned to.  Assessment  of the adequacy of 
blinding will be performed and changes made if blinding of parents is deemed to be suboptimal.  It is not possible 
to blind the inpatient care team and the investigators as the remainder of the PN formulation (dextrose, protein) 
must be  adjusted to deliver adequate ca loric needs to the subjects base d on their IVFE treatment assign ment.  
The lack of blinding during this phase of the study will not influence the short -term outcomes as they  are discrete 
measurements that cannot be biased by  [CONTACT_249555].  
 
Standardization of Parenteral Nutrition Across St udy Centers  
The following guidelines for parenteral nutrition administration have been established to provide uniformity 
among study site s.  Each site will follow these guidelines.  
 
Energy  
Total caloric delivery will range between 100 -120 Kcal/kg/ day when PN is the only source of calories  
Total non -protein caloric delivery wil l not exceed 100 Kcal/kg/day  when PN is the only source of calories  
 
Carbohydrate  
Dextrose infusion rate (DIR) will b e increased in the following manner, provided there is no aberration in the 
serum glucose levels:  
Day 1  DIR 4 -8 mg/kg/min  
Day 2 and beyond  Advancement of DIR by 1 -2 mg/kg/min per d ay to a goal of 11 -18 mg/kg/min  
Standard IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD

For study subjects 0 -30 days old the maximum DIR will be 16 mg/kg/min  
For study subjects >30 days old the maximum DIR will be18 mg/kg/min  
 
If hyperglycemia develops (defined as serum glucose >150 mg/dL), subjects will be managed in accordance with 
standard guidelines28 
1. Confirmatory point of care glucose test performed  
2. If confirmatory glucose >150 mg/dL, the DIR will be reduced daily in increments of 1 -2 mg/kg/min as 
tolerated until the serum glucose normalizes  
3. Insulin will only be administered if hyperglycemia has not b een controlled by [CONTACT_249556], in the form of neonatal IV amino acids solutions, will be initiated on the first day of PN at the highest 
delivery possible based on the following ranges : 
Body weight:  <1.5 kg  1.5 – 2.5 kg  >2.5 kg  
Protein Needs (g/kg):  3.4 – 4 3.2 – 3.8 2 – [ADDRESS_303435] Arm :  IVFE to begin at 1 g/kg/day on the first day of PN and advance by 0.5 -1 g/kg/day to a maximum 
of 3 g/kg/day.  
 
IFER arm :  IVFE administration to begin and remain at 1 g/kg/day for the duration of the study unless inadequate 
weight gain/growth occurs and/or the subject develops  EFAD.  
 
Hypertriglyceridemia  
If hypertriglyceridemia develops (serum triglycerides (TG)>250 mg/dL), subjects will be managed as follows:  
1. Repeat laboratory measure to confirm diagnosis  
2. Screen for carnitine deficiency (if present, supplement as appropriate)  
3. If confirmatory TG >250 mg/dL, then:  
 
TG 250 -400 mg/dL 
AND glucose >150

AND g lucose ≤150 
mg/dL  TG ≥400 mg/dL AND

mg/dL.  If IVFE is held for ≥7 days with continued TG levels ≥250 mg/dL, restart IVFE at 0.5 g/kg/day  
 
Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (EFAD)  
The detection of EFAD  will be assisted by a biochemist and expert in the area of lipid biology . 
 
The IVFE dose will be adjusted if subjects develop EFAD .  EFAD will be defined by [CONTACT_249557]:  
1. Clinical evidence of EFAD deficiency (i.e. scaly skin)31,32  
2. Triene:tetraene ratio of >0.20  
3. Arachidonic acid (ARA), (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels below normal  as defined by 
[CONTACT_249558], the IVFE dose will be increased in 0.5 g/kg/day increments based on biweekly essential 
fatty acid profiles until resolved.  
 
Cycled Parenteral Nutrition  
Study subjects will not recei ve cycled parenteral nutrition (i.e. parenteral nutrition administered over less than 24 
hours per day) during the study period, as cycled PN has been shown to decrease the development of PNAC 
and may represent a confounder.33,34 
 
Adjustment of Parenteral Nutrition if Inadequate Weight Gain Occurs  
(Lipid Restricted Group Only)  
 
Subjects with inadequate weight gain that cannot be attributed to other physiologic causes (e.g. low urine sodium, 
low hematocrit, insufficient respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]) will be managed according to the protocol described below.  
 
Indicators of acute and chronic malnutrition will be assessed using z -scores.35  For the purposes of the initial 12 
weeks, subjects will only be assessed for acute  malnutrition as chronic malnutrition occurs after 3 months.   Z-
scores will be obtained using the Peditools.org calculator  (https://peditools.org/ ).  Fenton scores36 will be used 
for infants born <37 weeks gestation, until 50 weeks gestation, at which time the WHO scores will be used, using 
corrected gestational age.  WHO scores37 will be used for infants born at ≥37 weeks gestation.   Z-scores will be 
documented for b irth anthropometrics.   Z-scores will be assessed at 1 month of age and weekly thereafter 
(allowing 1 month before reassessment to account for natural weight loss at birth in addition to weight loss from

Monit oring and Follow Up of Subjects  
Monitoring during the 12 week treatment period includes the amount and type of parenteral and enteral nutrition  
(total calories, expressed as k cal/kg/day, and amounts of parenteral protein and IVFE, expressed as  g/kg/day, 
type of enteral formula (e.g. breast milk, formula) . Clinical diagnoses, clinical occurrences other than adverse 
events , clinical complications , and drugs listed on the medication form will be recorded . If a patient goes home 
on PN prior to the end of 12 weeks from randomization, data will be collected according to standards of that 
institution.  
 
Infants completing the initial 12 week period will be monitored according to the institution’s standard of care 
during the remainder of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  Subjects who are cholestatic at the termination of the initial [ADDRESS_303439] IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD

Neurodevelopmental Outcome Measures  
After the initial 12 week treatment period , study subjects from both treatment arms will be evaluated at 12 months 
and 24 months (corrected age) in order to assess the influe nce of early IFER treatment on neurodevelopmental 
outcomes.  Early outcome assessments are typi[INVESTIGATOR_249536] a corrected age of approximately [ADDRESS_303441] assessment with an 
instrument such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley -III) and deve lopmental survey instruments.  
While there is evidence that a number of common survey screens lack validity when conducted below [ADDRESS_303442] been shown to be reliable and valid measures 
of behavioral risks.40-44  For the purposes of this study the 12 month assessment is included to examine the 
possibility with our target population of very early i dentification of developmental lags and predictors of risk.  
These assessments are crucial in order to investigate whether an association exists between reducing the dose 
of IVFE during a critical period of growth and brain development (i.e. the neonatal a nd infant period) with long -
term neurodevelopmental outcomes.   
 
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID -III):[ADDRESS_303443] scales, of 
which three scales and ass ociated subscales are utilized for the purposes of this study:  cognitive, language 
(receptive and expressive communication) and motor (fine motor and gross motor).   
 
The MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI):[ADDRESS_303444] 
widely used parent report measure of language development.  The CDI includes two versions: Words and 
Gestures for ages 8 -16 months and Words and Sentences for children ages 16 -30 months.  Scores are reported 
as percent iles compared to age -standardized norms.  
 
Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA):43,44,47  The 42 -item BITSEA is a parent report 
measure of social -emotional and behavior problems in children ages 1 -3.  The Problem Index includes 
internalizing, externalizing and dysregulation problems.  The internalizing scale has items that assess 
depression , anxiety and negative emotionality.  
 
Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS):48,49  The GMFCS is a five level classification system that 
assess the gross motor function of children with and at risk for cerebral palsy, from infancy through age 12.  It 
differentiates chil dren into one of five levels of functioning, based on the child’s current gross motor ability, 
limitations in function, and need for assistive technology.  
 
Behavior Assessment System for Children – Second Edition Preschool, Parent (BASC -2 Preschool Parent ’s 
version):50  The BASC -2 PRS -P is a 134 item questionnaire that assesses psychological status and adaptive 
behavior.  The parent/caregiver rates the occurrence of behaviors using a 4 -point rating scale. The profile yields 
eight clinical scales (hyperactivity, aggression, anxiet y, depression, somatization, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_249537], withdrawal and 
attention problems) and four adaptive scales (adaptability, social skills, activities of daily living and functional 
communication) as well as four composite scores (externalizing problems, internali zing problems, adaptive skills 
and the Behavioral Symptoms Index).  
 
These neurodevelopmental tools will be evaluated on the following schedule:

We recognize that neurodevelopmental outcomes may be influenced by [CONTACT_249560].  Such factors may include duration of parenteral nutrition, 
duration of IFER, mean IVFE dose, pe rcent nutrition obtained via the enteral route compared to the parenteral 
route, type of enteral intake (i.e. breast milk), the development of essential fatty acid deficiency, as well as early 
intervention programs, attendance at daycare/preschool, and soc ioeconomic status.  As such, we will evaluate 
study subjects every 6 months (  30 days)  and collect the following data, which will be used in final statistical 
analyses to evaluate predictive variables on neurodevelopmental outcomes:  
1. Current parenteral and  enteral nutrition parameters  
2. Current IVFE dose/mean IVFE dose over course of previous 6 months  
3. Essential fatty acid profiles  (if available, according to each institution’s standard of care ), evaluating for 
development of essential fatty acid deficiency  
4. Attendance at early intervention programs and/or daycare/preschool  
 
Monitoring for Adverse Event s  
The study coordinator and investigators at each site will monitor for adverse reactions. Although generally very 
well-tolerated, the administration of PN with Intralipid ® 20% is associated with a number of adverse events.   
 
 
Determination of Expectedness:  
Adverse events will be classified as expected or unexpected. Expected adverse events include those listed in 
the clinical protocol, the package insert for PN with Intralipid ® 20%, and those events listed in the informed 
consent document.  
 
These may include, but are not limited to:  
1. Line complications including:  
a. Catheter -related blood stream infection (CRBSI)  
i. Defined as:  A laboratory -confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI) where central line (CL) 
or umbilical catheter (UC) was in place for >[ADDRESS_303446] for >[ADDRESS_303447] be fully met on the day of discontinuation or the next day51,52 
ii. This is in distinction to a catheter -related blood stream infection (CRBSI) whose definition 
requires removal of the catheter51 
b. Need for catheter replacement  
2. Hyperglycemia > 300 mg/dL  
3. Hypertriglyceridemia >400 mg/dL  
4. Development of essential fatty acid deficiency   
5. Moderate undernutrition (decreased in z -score by >[ADDRESS_303448] deviations) to severe undernutrition 
(decreased in z -score by >[ADDRESS_303449] deviations)  
6. Thrombophlebitis  
7. Hyper coagulopathy  
8. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 k/mm3) 
 
 
Determination of Relatedness:  
 
Generally, the definition of an adverse event  could include worsening of a pre -existing condition and investigators 
could be asked to make the distinction  between exacerbation of a pre -existing condition and an event related to 
the study protocol when recording and reporting adverse event. However, due to the nature of the population 
being studied, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_249538].  
 
Standard IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD  
 
 15 Based on clinical information, an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_249539], 
unlikely to be related, possibly related, definitely related or insufficient information  to Intralipid® 20% 
administr ation or other study procedures . Usual effects from the  subject’s  condition that are considered by [CONTACT_34147] [INVESTIGATOR_249540]® 20% administration or other study procedures will be noted in the 
subjects’ medical records but will not be reco rded or reported as an adverse event for this study. Examples 
include emesis, reflux and pain due to an expected surgery/procedure.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events that occur from the time of consent until the patient completes [ADDRESS_303450]’s study binder . 
 
Only adverse events considered to be possibly related to Intralipid® 20% administration or other study 
procedures  will be reported to the sponsor, the IRB, the FDA, and the DSMB.  
 
 
Severe Adverse Event Reporting  
Although no serious adverse reactions are anticipated, study participants will be monitored, and any such events 
will be recorded and reported to the appropriate regulatory committees. These include : 
 Death while on the study  
 Any study -related event that pr olongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Any study -related event that requires an operative procedure  
 
Mortality will be defined as a death occurring at any time during the child’s admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The cause 
of death, autopsy findings and whether the subject was o n study drug at the time of death will also be recorded.  
 
All adverse events will be graded as follows in their relation to IFER:  definitely not related, unlikely to be related, 
possibly related, definitely related or insufficient information.  All cases rated as possibly or definitely related will 
be defined as an SAE. These SAEs will be reported to the University of Michigan Sponsor -Investigator within [ADDRESS_303451] 
reporting policy. As per 21 CFR 312.32(c), the sponsors will also notify FDA and all participating investigators in 
an IND safety  report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
 
Data Safety Mon itoring Board  
An independent data safety monitoring committee will be established to monitor the study for safety and to 
determine if a statistical difference has been achieved between the two groups for the primary outcome measure 
at interim data analyses.  The data sa fety monitoring committee will review the data at the halfway point of the 
study to assess the safety and efficacy of the study to that point.  If safety issues are revealed the study 
investigators and each site’s IRB will be notified immediately.  The dat a safety monitoring committee will also 
ensure that adverse events are promptly reported to the FDA, and all participating investigators will be notified 
as well of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpec ted. 
 
Sample Size Determination  
The sample size was calculated  for the primary outcome (rate of rise of direct bilirubin)  using previously published 
data as well as our clinical experience.22,[ADDRESS_303452] dosing group (2 -3 g/kg/day) will be 0.55 mg/dL, 1 mg/dL, 1.5 mg/dL and 
2 mg/dL corresponding to a slope of 0.125 mg/dL/week over [ADDRESS_303453] estimated that the mean bilirubin levels at 
baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks in the minimization group (1 g/kg/day) will be 0.45 mg/dL, 0.5 mg/dL, 
0.45 mg/dL and 0.5 mg/dL (a slope of roughly zero).  The standard deviation of the bilirubin measurements at 
Standard IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD  
 
 [ADDRESS_303454] 85% power to detect the change in slopes as being significant at the 0.05 l evel, 79% power to detect a 
difference in means overall between groups and 88% power to detect the general change in means over time 
across the two groups.  When the sample size is increased to 20 subjects per group, the above power numbers 
increase to 95% , 90% and 96%, respectively.  If 30 subjects are recruited per group this design will allow for a 
33% attrition rate by [CONTACT_249561] [ADDRESS_303455] 
our primary outcome measure.  
 
Of the secondary outcomes, sample size was also calculated for the incidence of cholestasis.  Assuming an 
incidence of 50% in the standard group and an in cidence of 10% in the minimization group, with alpha = 0.05 
and power of 80%, a sample size of 23 is required for each group.  Regarding the other secondary outcomes, 
our sample size is large enough to allow for establishing trends which may then highlight  avenues for future 
research.  
 
Planned Statistical  Analysis  
All data analysis will be directed and performed by  a statistician  through the Center for Statistical Consulta tion 
and Research at the University of Michigan ( http://cscar.research.umich.edu/about/ ).  Data will be analyzed using 
SAS software release 9.3 for Windows (Copyright, SAS Institute Inc., SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product 
of service names ar e registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  All study 
subjects  will be included in the statistical analysis in an intent -to-treat manner.     
 
Descriptive statistics using standard statistical tests (e.g. Student’s t -test, paired sample t -test, Wilcoxon rank 
sums tests, Fisher’s exact tests, Chi -square test, McNemar’s test, etc.) will be used  throughout the statistical 
analysis of data.  Logistic  regression will be used to compare differences between groups . Because septicemia 
can exacerbate PNAC, we will include the incidence of septicemia as a covariate in our analysis. Septic epi[INVESTIGATOR_249541] n cons istent with sepsis during the [ADDRESS_303456]’s  weekly bilirubin value.   The number of septic epi[INVESTIGATOR_249542] 
a Poisson regression analysis (or possibly a negative binomial regression if there is more va riability than 
expected for a Poisson distribution), with the total time on PN as an offset, allowing us to compare the rate of 
occurrence of septic epi[INVESTIGATOR_249543].  
 
Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measure  – change in  direct bilirubin as a function of time (mg/dL/week) between the two 
groups  – will be evaluated using a linear mixed model analysis to compare the slope of total bilirubin levels 
between the standard and reduced groups. This model will allow us to examine the degree of variability between 
subjects in the rate of change over time, and  will take this variability into account in the model by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a 
random effect for the slope of time for each subject as well as a random intercept for each  subject.   
 
Seco ndary Outcome Measures  
1. Time to PNAC (direct bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL) and time to severe PNAC (direct bilirubin ≥4 mg/dL)  
The time to development of a first occurrence of PNAC and of severe PNAC will be evaluated using survival 
analysis.   Initially, we will compare the two groups using Kaplan -Meier curves, but the eventual analysis will 
take into account important covariates, such as development of sepsis, average IVFE dose and percentage 
of calories from enteral feeds using a Cox proporti onal hazards survival analysis.   We will test whether the 
proportional hazards assumption is met for the analysis by [CONTACT_249562]/decr ease over time.  
The effect of important time -varying covariates (e.g., septic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ) can also be taken into account using a 
Cox model.

 [ADDRESS_303457]  to 
allow for individua l variability in average values as well as  a random slop e to allow for variability in the rate of 
change over time across subjects .  Important covariates, suc h as gestational age (< 32 weeks gestation vs. 
≥32 weeks gestation) and birth weight will also be used as covariates in this analysis.  
 
5. Neurodevelopmental Outcomes  
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID -III):[ADDRESS_303458] reliability ranging from .86 t o .91.  Validity -related studies 
indicate relatively high correlations (.72 -.79) with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence – 
Third Edition (WPPSI -III)53 and wi th the Preschool Language Scale – Fourth Edition (PLS -4)(.71-.83).54 
 
The MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories  (CDI):[ADDRESS_303459] wid ely used parent report measure of language development.  The CDI includes two versions:   Words 
and Gestures (ages 8 -16 months)  and Words and Sentences (ages 16 -30 months ).  Scores are reported as 
percentiles compared to age -standardized norms.

covariance str ucture will be chosen based on a comparison of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes 
Information Criterion (BIC).  This will allow us to adjust for correlated measures within a subject and possibly for 
unequal variances across times points and a cross groups.  Each measure will be compared between the groups 
at each time point, controlling for important demographic variables, such as gestational age, diagnosis, bilirubin 
(total and direct), as well as  a time -varying covariate for development of es sential fatty acid deficiency.  
Importantly, we will also evaluate the influence of three IFER -related variables on neurodevelopmental 
Standard IV lipid dosing compared to IV lipid minimization for the prevention of PNAC/PNALD  
 
 18 outcomes:  mean IVFE dose, duration of IFER and the development of essential fatty acid deficiency.  Since 
total and dire ct bilirubin are expected to be highly collinear , we will use only one of these predictors and compare 
the models using AIC and BIC to decide which  is a better predictor of the particular outcome being assessed.  
   
A logistic regressio n with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach will be used to compare the binary 
outcomes between  groups.  
 
Intent to Treat  
All statistical analyses will be performed using an intent to treat approach.  
 
Potential Confounding Variables : 
Nutritional intake:   Differences in nutritional intake alter the risk of PNAC  as any amount of enteral nutrition has 
been shown to enhance rehabilitation .[ADDRESS_303462] 
milk, which contains pro teins necessary for optimal brain development, may be a confounding variable and will 
be accounted for in the final data analysis.  PN duration (with or without IFER) may also affect 
neurodevelopmental outcomes and will be included as a covariate in the st atistical analysis.  
 
Variation in IVFE dose:   The IVFE dose may vary depending on the clinical status of the subject (e.g. elevated 
TG, EFAD, direct bilirubin ≥2.5 mg/dL, nutritional and/or fluid status).  Every attempt will be made to maintain 
dosing wit hin the assigned treatment arm.  Based on previous experience using IFER at the University of 
Michigan, hypertriglyceridemia and EFAD are exceedingly rare occurrences , therefore , the IVFE dose is not 
expected to be adjusted frequently based on these findin gs.  Statistical analysis will account for differences in 
IVFE  dose by [CONTACT_249563]/IFER as a covariate.  
 
Critical medical incidences:   As differences in the degree of medical illness between groups may adversely  affect 
the development of PNAC, a number of complications will be examined as secondary outcome measures 
including sepsis and mortality rates as well as days in the neonatal intensive care unit.   
 
Occurrence of sepsis:   Because sepsis may lead to increased levels of  direct bilirubin and may worsen PNAC, 
the occurrence  of sepsis is being recorded and a marker of morbidity.

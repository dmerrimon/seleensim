All subjects will be instructed to take 1 capsule in the morning and another approximatel y 12 hours later 
in the evening.
Duration of treatment: Up to 12 weeks
Objectives: 
Primary:
xTo evaluate the efficacy of trad ipi[INVESTIGATOR_522470] 12 in the daily nausea severity scores.
Secondary:
xTo evaluate the efficacy of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053] r elative to placebo in change from baseline in number 
of days at “0” nausea .
xTo evaluate the efficacy of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_522471] e to placebo in change from baseline of other 
individual symptoms associated with gastroparesis.
xTo evaluate the efficacy of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_522472].
xTo evaluate the efficacy of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_522473].
xTo explore the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. 
Overall Design:
This is a multi center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study to be conducted in the United 
States. Up to eight hundred (800 ) subjects diagnosed with gastroparesis, who satisfy the selection criteria 
for the study, will be eligible for one of two groups. Group 1 will ente r the Evaluation Ph ase of the study 
and Group 2 will enter the Open Label phase of the study.  Patients eligib le for Group 1 will be randomized 
to one of t wotreatment groups. Randomization will be str atified by [CONTACT_522476] (idiopathic or 
diabetic), a nd enrollment for either of the etiologies will be capped at 60% of the total sample size. Patients 
eligible for Group 2 will enter the Open Label Phase of the study.
The study includes two phases: the screening phase and  the evaluation phase. The screening phase 
includes a screening visit to evaluate subjects’ prelimin ary eligibility for the study. During the screening 
phase, subjects will collect diary data for at least [ADDRESS_677732] be reviewed in order to determine eligibility for enrollment into the evaluation phase. Data review 
will be performed prior or at Visit 2. Patients who to  meet all Group 1 eligibility criteria will 
randomized onto double blind treatment in the evaluation phase . Patients who meet Group 2 criteria or 
do not meet symptom criteria for ra ndomization but still meet all other eligibility criteria, will be offered
open label treatment in the open label arm of the e valuation phase. When enrollment goal is reached for

CONFIDENTIALgroup 1, group 1 enrollment will be closed and all subseq uent  patients in screening will be evaluated for 
group 2 eligibility only. 
The Evaluation Phase includes 12 weeks of double blind randomized treatment of placebo or tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
(85mg bid, approximately 12 hours apart )f o r  G r o u p  1  or open label tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (85mg bid, approximately 
12 hours apart)  for Group 2. Daily diaries will be co mpleted during all phases. Clinical evaluations and
safety assessments will occur at Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10, and 
Week 12 .
Following the End of Study Vi sit (Visit 8) patients can opt -in to a one- day optional pharmacokinetic (PK) 
study where one additional do se of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_522474]-dose and, 1, 2, 
4, 6, [ADDRESS_677733] dose to assess drug lev els. This optional PK Visit can occur 1- 14 days after Visit 8.  
Primary Endpoint: 
Change from baseline to Week 12 in daily individual nausea severity scores (0=no ne, 1=very mild, 2= 
mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe)
Criteria for evaluation:
Efficacy :
Efficacy assessments will include: 
xGastroparesis Core Symp tom Daily Diary (GCSDD)
xPatient Assessment of GI Disorders –Symptoms Severity Index (PAGI-SYM)
xGlobal Assessment of Gastroparesis
xPatient Rated Change in Gastroparesis Symptoms
xPatient Global Impression –Change (PGI-C)
xPatient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders –Quality of Life (PAGI-QOL)
xGastroparesis Treatment Benefit Survey (GTBS)
xClinician Global Impression –Severity (CGI-S)
Safety: 
xSafety and tolerability assessments will inclu de the recording of adverse events (AEs), 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluati ons, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.
xThe Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale (C- SSRS) will be used to assess suicidal behavior and 
ideation.
Sample Size Discussion: 
Based on a two -sided t-test with the 5% significance level, the planned sample size of 100 subjects per 
arm provides 95% power to detect a mean difference of 0.[ADDRESS_677734] deviation of 1.25 in each treatment group.

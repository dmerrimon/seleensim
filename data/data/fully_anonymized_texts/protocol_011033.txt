6. CONDITIONS
6.1. Study Administration
All study activities will be performed under the supervision of the investigator in 
accordance with the protocol requirements, and with adherence to Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH E6 R2).
Only study subjects who signed the informed consent form and meet all entry criteria 
will be enrolled and randomly assigned to a study group.
6.2. Identity of Experimental Condition 
The Experimental Condition involves the use of a novel smartphone application. This 
application provides a digital diagnostic score to calculate healthspan and biological age, 
along with AI and group community-based coaching dynamics. Subjects will be 
assigned a 4-6-week (28-[ADDRESS_1067254] testing day)  
progressive protocol designed to implement lifestyle changes and solidify adherable 
practices including the following:
● 
Daily practice of intermittent fasting, eating within a time restricted eating 
window ranging from 8 to 12 hours. 
● 
Increased daily steps.
● 
Increased awareness of hydration practices.
● 
Journaling
● 
Adherence to a lower carbohydrate, higher -protein diet.
● 
Improved exercise habits.
● 
Stress management 
● 
Sleep habits 
● 
Improved lifestyle risk factors, like smoking and alcohol intake 
The above factors are individualized based on subject responses to questionnaires within 
the application. An AI-based coach and application algorithms will then send users push 
notifications to improve adherence to their new lifestyle factors as well as provide 
feedback for their logged data entries. Specifically , the application users will be required 
to connect the Pro2col application with either the Apple Health or Google Fit application 
so that necessary data can be transmitted between these applications without user input. 
The application creates a personalized protocol by [CONTACT_777137]. For 
example, if a user reports walking between 4,001-5,000 steps daily , their program will 
start them at 4,000 steps in week 1, gradually increasing each week until they reach the 
program's goal (e.g., 10,000 steps). Below are the key elements used to generate an 
individualized protocol, with specific goals for this user:
Steps Goal
: 10,000 Steps
12
Incremental Approach: Starting from the user's baseline, steps will gradually increase 
each week to reach the target of 10,000 steps over a 4-6-week period (28-[ADDRESS_1067255] testing day).
Example:
Week 1: Starting at the baseline (e.g., 4,000 steps)
Week 2: 5,200 steps
Week 3: 6,400 steps
Week 4: 7,600 steps
Week 5: 8,800 steps
Week 6: 10,000 steps
Calorie Goal
: Moderate Fat Loss
Caloric intake will be reduced on average by 250 calories from basal calorie needs.
Hydration Goal
: Subjects will have a target water consumption goal of 10 Cups of 
Water
Incremental Approach: Starting from the user's baseline (e.g., 5 cups), water intake will 
increase each week until reaching 10 cups over 6 weeks.
Example:
Week 1: 5 cups
Week 2: 6 cups
Week 3: 7 cups
Week 4: 8 cups
Week 5: 9 cups
Week 6: 10 cups
Eating W indow
: 8 Hours
Incremental Approach: The eating window will decrease each week until it reaches an 
8-hour window over 6 weeks.  For example if they are currently eating 16 hours per day 
(for example 6 am to 10 pm), we would modify as such:
Example:
Week 1: 16-hour eating window
Week 2: 14-hour eating window
13
Week 3: 12-hour eating window
Week 4: 10-hour eating window
Week 5: 9-hour eating window
Week 6: 8-hour eating window
Subjects will also be awarded with points within the application for hitting their goal. 
6.3. Identity of Contr ol Condition
Subjects randomly enrolled in the control group will be given materials published by 
[CONTACT_14808] (AHA) and [LOCATION_002] Department of Agriculture

They will receive daily updates, notification, and education regarding healthy habits 
such as exercise, hydration, and improved nutrition practices. An AI coach will be 
responsible for providing instructions and feedback to all application users.
7.4. POST -TESTING
16
Subjects who complete the 4-6-week (28-[ADDRESS_1067259] testing day) intervention and continue to be eligible for this study will then complete 
post testing. Subjective questionnaires will be provided to assess items such as current 
activity levels, nutrition habits, and lifestyle factors related to health and wellness. 
Enrolled and randomized subjects will also receive a blood pressure cuff and digital 
scale to record blood pressure and bodyweight/body composition, respectively . 
Moreover , subjects will complete electronic calculations to estimate their healthspan and 
biological age. Finally , subjects will perform three physical fitness tests, including:
● 
Timed one mile walk/run
● 
Push-ups (or modified push-ups for women) to exhaustion
● 
Chair get-ups to exhaustion
Finally , upon completion of the study (or early withdrawal), subjects will be directed to 
delete the investigational application from their smart device, and no further data will be 
collected.
 
7.5. Subject W ithdrawal and Early T ermination
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor for safety , 
behavioral, or administrative reasons. Every effort should be made to document the 
subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request the subject return for a final visit, and if applicable, follow-up with 
the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events.
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, no further evaluations will be performed, and no additional data will 
be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.

– An assessment of the subject’ s health status 
prior to enrollment to ascertain appropriateness for study participation based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
● 
Adverse Event Reporting – 
Investigator examination of the subject and notation 
of any observations made by [CONTACT_777139] a potential adverse event.
8.2. Assessment of Safety
Self-reported and observed adverse events.
19
9. ADVERSE EVENT REPOR TING
9.1. Introduction
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected 
causal relationship to the INP(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both 
to determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria 
for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to the 
Sponsor or its designated representative. For all adverse events, sufficient information 
should be obtained by [CONTACT_777140]. For 
adverse events with a suspected causal relationship to the experimental product, 
follow-up by [CONTACT_637913] 
a level acceptable to the investigator , and Sponsor concurs with that assessment.
9.2. Reporting Period
Serious adverse events 
require immediate notification within 
[ADDRESS_1067260] ID, Name [CONTACT_777148] , SAE, and Name [CONTACT_777149]. 
All adverse events (serious and non-serious) must be collected on the subject’ s case 
report form (CRF) from the time the subject signed informed consent through the last 
subject visit.
9.3. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
associated with the use of an investigational product in human subjects. The event need 
not necessarily have a suspected causal relationship with the treatment or usage.
Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to:
● 
Clinically significant symptoms and signs
● 
Changes in physical examination findings
20
● 
Hypersensitivity
Additionally , they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:
● 
Product misuse
● 
Product dependency
● 
Extravasation
● 
Study related procedure (e.g., resistance training protocol)
9.4. Serious Adverse Events
A medical device adverse event is serious when both of the following criteria are 
fulfilled:
● 
The event involves patient/subject/consumer contact
● 
The event results in:
−
 
Death
−
 
Serious deterioration in state of health. This includes:
o
 
Life-threatening illness or injury
o
 
Permanent impairment of a body function
o
 
Permanent damage to a body structure
−
 
Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure
−
 
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967]
9.5. Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the 
adjectives MILD, MODERA TE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of 
the adverse event. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as 
follows:
MILD
Does not interfere with the subject's usual function.
MODERA TE
Interferes to some extent with the subject's usual function.
SEVERE
Interferes significantly with the subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A 
severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe 
(interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified 
21
serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
22
9.6. Causality Assessment
The investigator ’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events 
(serious and non-serious). An investigator ’s causality assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the INP caused or contributed to an 
adverse event. If the investigator ’s final determination of causality is unknown and the 
investigator does not know whether or not INP caused the event, then the event will be 
handled as “related to INP” for reporting purposes. If the investigator's causality 
assessment is "unknown but not related to INP", this should be clearly documented on 
study records.
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study 
procedures, the investigator must record this suspected causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with 
the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.
10. 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
10.1. Sample Size Determination
The targeted sample size of 50 participants was determined by [CONTACT_777141] a 
meta-analysis involving 206,873 participants (Staiano et al., 2024). This analysis 
demonstrated that digital health interventions led to improvements in physical activity 
(+1,329 steps/day), reduced sedentary behavior (−7 hours/week), and increased 
vigorous exercise (+1 hour/week). Using these values, we conducted a power analysis, 
which identified an effect size difference of 0.8 between the control and experimental 
groups for average changes in habits like daily steps. This analysis confirmed that a 
sample size of 50 subjects would be suf ficient.
https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1 186/s13063-015-0950-[ADDRESS_1067261] deviation, and 95% confidence intervals of the mean. All outcome 
measure data will be reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Relative and absolute 
changes between groups for all outcomes will be reported and analyzed for statistical 
significance using paired 
t
 tests. Additionally , effect sizes will be calculated as Cohen’ s 
d
g
 
[ADDRESS_1067262] deviation times a correction factor [1]. Statistical significance will be set 
at 
p 
< 0.05 and all analyses will be performed using SPSS V ersion 28.0.

conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) as applicable, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).
The Sponsor representative may review source documents to confirm that the data 
recorded on CRFs/eCRF is accurate. The investigator and institution will allow 
Sponsor ’s representative or its agents, and appropriate regulatory authorities, direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study site may be subject to review by [CONTACT_21980] 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed 
by [CONTACT_2728] , and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during 
any in-person monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections, and that sufficient 
time is devoted to the process.

The investigator is encouraged, however , not required to maintain additional source 
records on matters respective to the subject’ s safety and wellbeing not already captured 
on the CRFs/eCRF or source template.
Black or blue ink must be used on all data collection requirements. All errors and 
omissions must be crossed out by [CONTACT_3553] a single line, and the date and initials of 
the correction or addition of correct information must be provided. Use of white-out or 
write-overs will not be permitted. All study related records will be kept in a secure and 
locked location and shall only be accessible to the assigned study personnel during the 
conduct of the study , and to the regulatory authorities in the event of an inspection.
All raw and analyzed data files will be stored electronically on a private Google Drive 
folder that is accessible only to study staff. This folder is password protected and 
requires permission for outside entities to access its files.
12.3. Case Report Forms / Electr onic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
[ADDRESS_1067264] parties, except for authorized representatives of the sponsor or 
appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the sponsor .
It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion, review and approve all CRFs. 
CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_198429] . These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true and accurate.
At all times, the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs. In cases where the 
source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s chart, the information collected on 
the CRFs must match those charts.
12.4. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor , the 
investigator agrees to keep records including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original 
signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be retained 
by [CONTACT_178473], local regulations, or as specified in the 
Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer .
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study , the 
Sponsor should be prospectively notified of the event, and the location of study records.
The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another 
investigator , another institution, or to the Sponsor .
13. PUBLICA TION OF STUDY RESUL TS
Publication of study results by [CONTACT_637921], as appropriate. Results from this study may be published in the form of oral 
or written presentations at scientific meetings or as one or more peer-reviewed journal 
articles, with Sponsor ’s prior approval, otherwise shall be kept strictly confidential. In 
these cases, no information on individual subjects will be revealed.

for improving lifestyle behaviors. npj Digit. Med. 7, 179 (2024).
[ADDRESS_1067265]’ s healthspan will be calculated using a proprietary algorithm housed within the 
prime health application. Briefly , subjects will answer a number of questions regarding their 
daily health habits, activities, and attitudes. These data will then be placed into a 
mathematical equation that uses data and statistics from numerous published studies 
regarding longevity and mortality risk. The outcome number is a subject’ s estimated 
“Healthspan,” which describes their remaining healthy and active years of life. Importantly , 
this number can increase or decrease based on a subject’ s reported lifestyle changes at the 
end of the intervention period.
Biological Age
The subject’ s biological age will be estimated using the same proprietary formula used to 
estimate Healthspan. Briefly , biological age is dif ferent from chronological age, which 
simply reflects the number of years an individual has spent on Earth. Biological age, on the 
other hand, takes healthy lifestyle factors into account that may prematurely age individuals 
past their chronological age. Conversely , active and healthy users may find that their 
biological age is lower than their chronological age.  Importantly , this number can increase 
or decrease based on a subject’ s reported lifestyle changes at the end of the intervention 
period.
Lifestyle Risk Factors
These risk factors are assessed by a number of questions pertaining to lifestyle habits that 
the subject must answer when enrolling in the application. As also extracted from the 
questionnaire. 
Energy and V itality 
These outcome measures are subjective reports based on subject responses to specific 
questions within the application’ s questionnaires.
Strength and Endurance
Application users will be required to perform three objective performance tests to get 
accurate estimates of their healthspan and biological age. These performance tests include:
Upper Body Str ength
: Upper body strength will be assessed using the push-ups to failure 
protocol. Users will be instructed via the application on correct form and technique for 
push-ups specific to their gender . They will then perform as many push-ups as possible 
before reaching concentric muscle failure. This number will be reported to assess their 
upper body strength.
Endurance
: Endurance will be assessed using a one mile walk time. Subjects will perform 
this assessment at their own determined pace, which is obviously restricted by [CONTACT_777143] . Running is allowed, but not all subjects will be able to run the full mile. Thus, 
walking is allowed in this assessment.
Lower Body Str ength
: Lower body strength will be assessed by [CONTACT_777144]-ups to concentric 
muscle failure. Briefly , subjects must use a chair or a related sturdy surface that reaches the 
height of their patella. They must fully sit and return to start for each repetition. They will 
29
continue to perform get-ups to concentric muscle failure. This number will be reported to 
assess their lower body strength.
Body Composition
Body composition will be measured using a previously validated digital scale (RENPHO 
Smart Scale ) that will be delivered to participants upon enrollment in the study . The scale 
uses bioelectrical impedance to estimate body composition. This involves a low level 
electrical current being sent through the body; the user cannot feel, hear , or otherwise sense 
this electrical current. The rate at which the current passes through the body is then input 
into an algorithm to estimate body composition based on known electrical current rates in 
human body tissue.
Body composition will also be estimated by [CONTACT_777145] 
a corresponding algorithm. 
Blood Pr essur e 
Blood pressure will be measured using a previously validated electronic blood pressure cuf f 
(Oklar Cuf f Model C02) that will be delivered to participants upon enrollment in the study . 
The blood pressure cuf f is capable of executing blood pressure measurements with minimal 
input from the user . Blood pressure is reported as systolic over diastolic, and the user will 
input these numbers into the application questionnaire.
Daily Steps
Daily steps will be assessed using communication between the Pro2col application and the 
user’s Apple Health or Google Fit application. Apple Health and Google Fit both collect 
daily step counts by [CONTACT_777146] , gyroscopy , and global positioning systems (GPS) 
and these data will be transferred to and housed within the Pro2col application.
Depr ession 
Symptoms of depression will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9). This questionnaire is a previously validated tool that collects information about 
depression symptoms in users. The user answers nine questions relating to depression 
symptoms on a scale of 0-3, with 0 representing no issues at all, and 3 representing 
experiencing the symptom nearly every day. The user’s total score is a summation of their 
responses, and is scored as follows:
1-4 Minimal depression
5-9 Mild depression
10-14 Moderate depression
15-19 Moderately severe depression
20-27 Severe depression
Importantly , users who score ≥ [ADDRESS_1067266] 
referrals. Subjects will be encouraged to speak with their primary care physician if they are 
30
concerned about their score. An email script will be crafted to provide further information 
for this instance.
Quality of Life
Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_777147] 36-item Short Form survey 
(SF-36). The SF-36 houses a number of questions pertaining to various factors of quality of 
life. Subjects will answer questions in a variety of manners, from simple “yes” or “no” 
responses to Likert-adjacent scaled responses that allow the subject to select the answer that 
best corresponds to their attitudes and beliefs. The scoring instructions for the SF-36 can be 
accessed in the .pdf linked

Protocol Version # 9:  3 Protocol Date: 3/27/19 1.0 Background  The timely use of effective antibiotics can markedly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial infections, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU).  However, in this setting, much antibiotic use is empi[INVESTIGATOR_29121], and administered to patients with non-bacterial or non-infectious causes of inflammation that do not respond to antibiotics. This widespread empi[INVESTIGATOR_179762]-drug resistant organisms and antibiotic-associated adverse events, such as C. difficile infections.  De-escalation of broad-spectrum empi[INVESTIGATOR_179763], slow the development of antibiotic resistance, and reduce complications associated with antibiotic therapy.  Thus, antibiotic de-escalation is an important goal of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Specific tests and pathways to predict which patients have bacterial infections and those that would benefit from antibiotic therapy would accelerate de-escalation and greatly facilitate antimicrobial stewardship efforts.  Procalcitonin (PCT) has been investigated as a biomarker for critically ill adult patients with bacterial infection, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.  Following bacteria-induced activation of monocytes and adherence of monocytes to endothelial surfaces, procalcitonin is expressed and secreted. PCT levels have been shown to rise rapi[INVESTIGATOR_179764], and PCT levels are more specific for bacterial infections than CRP or total white blood cell count.  PCT rises approximately [ADDRESS_211545]-guided algorithms for antibiotic cessation (refer to section 3.0), a high proportion of providers (up to 50%) chose not to follow algorithm guidance for subjects randomized to the PCT-guided group.  Thus, although PCT appears to be a useful guide for safe antibiotic de-escalation in the ICU, the ideal method for implementing the test and integrating it into clinical care in order to maximize its impact in the pediatric population is unclear.  Notably, none of the prior trials evaluated PCT-associated outcomes in critically ill children nor integrated PCT testing into antimicrobial stewardship activities.  PCT will be available for routine clinical care across all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179765] 2017. To better understand the role of PCT in patient management, we will complete a pi[INVESTIGATOR_179766].  We propose the evaluation of a PCT testing and treatment algorithm on patient outcomes in the pediatric ICU, a setting in which PCT-guided antibiotic de-escalation has not been previously studied.   The proposed project will evaluate whether a procalcitonin (PCT) testing and treatment algorithm, implemented through daily antimicrobial stewardship audit and feedback, can promote early and safe antibiotic de-escalation in the pediatric ICU.  We will conduct a pragmatic, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing antimicrobial use and outcomes among children admitted to the ICU who receive either: 1) Routine laboratory testing and treatment with antimicrobial stewardship review (control), or 2) PCT testing 
  
Protocol Version # 9:  4 Protocol Date: 3/27/19 and treatment with antimicrobial stewardship review (intervention).  In both arms, baseline daily review of antimicrobial management by [CONTACT_179783].  In the intervention arm, the stewardship provider (S.K.) also will recommend PCT testing and antibiotic modifications using a PCT-based treatment algorithm (Fig 1). This research is not to determine if PCT is a good test; this has already been established and evaluated as part of the FDA approval process. This pragmatic outcomes trial is evaluating if use of the PCT, implemented together with antimicrobial stewardship program oversight, improves the quality of care we can provide for children at VCH.  We hypothesize that patients in the intervention arm will have shorter duration of antibiotic therapy and similar outcomes, as compared to patients in the control arm.  Specific Aims 1. Compare antimicrobial utilization among children in the ICU who receive standard-of-care testing plus stewardship vs. PCT-based treatment plus stewardship. We will compare days of antibiotic therapy in the first [ADDRESS_211546]-based treatment plus stewardship.  We will compare mortality, length of stay, recurrence of infection, and antibiotic-associated adverse events (rash, myelosuppression, renal impairment, hepatotoxicity, C. difficile infection) between the study arms.  We will test the hypothesis that outcomes and safety will be comparable between the study arms.  3.[ADDRESS_211547] infections and/or sepsis.  Baer et al (PLoS One, 2013) demonstrated that antibiotic courses could be safely and significantly shortened for pediatric patients with pneumonia from 6.[ADDRESS_211548] level guidelines: discontinuation of antibiotics was encouraged upon clinical stabilization and when PCT values fell below 0.25 μg/L or, for patients with initial PCT values > 10 μg/L, when levels decreased below 90% of the initial value.  In a recently published randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of 1575 adult ICU patients, de Jong et. al (Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2016) demonstrated that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment, with antibiotic de-escalation when PCT level fell to 80% of its peak value or to 0.5 μg/L or lower, could safely and significantly shorten antibiotic

Subjects will be enrolled if they:   • Are prescribed or administered antibiotics in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 1 calendar day of enrollment.   • Are admitted to the pediatric ICU (units 5A or 5C) • Have parents or legal guardians who provide informed consent, or provide consent themselves if 18 years of age or older • Provide assent if >7 years of age  Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:   • Are not prescribed antibiotics in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] • Receive intravenous antibiotics within 7 days prior to identification for study enrollment • Primary or secondary immune deficiency • History of malignancy, bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant • A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis • Neonates < 34 weeks gestation • Patients receiving treatment for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, mediastinitis, or other invasive infection, for which long durations of antibiotics are needed. • Do not provide informed consent/assent  5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  The study will begin after PCT becomes available at VUMC, and after IRB approval. Enrollment will occur over 16 months..  Eligible subjects will be identified on admission to an intensive care setting by [CONTACT_179785] a clinical pharmacy surveillance platform (Sentri7).  Investigators will obtain consent (for all subjects) and assent (for subjects >7 years of age) by [CONTACT_179786] a private room, using the IRB-approved consent and assent forms. Privacy will be assured, Subjects will be permitted [ADDRESS_211550] of care treatment in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]. Investigators will complete a combined consent-authorization document.  Enrolled subjects will receive either: 1) Standard of care testing and treatment with antimicrobial stewardship review (control), or 2) PCT testing and treatment with antimicrobial stewardship review (intervention).   
  
Protocol Version # 9:  6 Protocol Date: 3/27/19 6.0 Study Procedures  Study Design The proposed study is a prospective randomized controlled trial among children admitted to the ICU setting at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (VCH).  Enrolled subjects will receive one of two management strategies:  1) Standard of care with antimicrobial stewardship review (control), or 2) PCT testing and treatment with antimicrobial stewardship review (intervention). All subjects in both arms will have baseline audit of antimicrobial orders with feedback to providers by [CONTACT_179787].  For subjects in the intervention arm, the stewardship team will additionally recommend PCT testing and treatment per algorithm (Fig 1). PCT will be used in conjunction with clinical status and exam, and results of radiographic and laboratory studies, to make medical decisions about antibiotic therapy. The PCT will never be used as the sole basis for making decisions to modify or stop antibiotic therapy.  The antibiotic stewardship clinicians will review all enrolled subjects (in control and intervention arms) and provide recommendations regarding antimicrobial therapy. The ultimate decision to obtain PCT testing and/or adhere to the PCT algorithm or stewardship recommendations will be at the discretion of the ICU attending physician.  Preliminary discussions with ICU faculty have revealed that they are highly supportive of the proposed study, and would be willing to adhere to the study protocol.  Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship Directed PCT Testing and Treatment Algorithm The antimicrobial stewardship team currently performs daily prospective audit and feedback for all patients admitted to VCH who receive antibiotics, providing in-person recommendations regarding antimicrobial modifications to providers as needed.  This will continue in the standard of care arm.  Current standard of care includes obtaining blood cultures, with or without CRP or other laboratory studies, and administering one or more broad spectrum antibiotics such as cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048], pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]-tazobactam, and vancomycin for a minimum of 48 hours. Prior to study initiation, the antimicrobial stewardship team will perform targeted education to ICU providers (attending physicians, residents and nurse practitioners) on the benefits and limitations of PCT use.  A PCT-based algorithm to guide clinician decisions about antibiotic escalation or de-escalation will be disseminated to ICU providers (Fig. 1), displayed in ICU workrooms, and available on the intranet.  PCT levels will be measured daily for the initial [ADDRESS_211551] a stewardship provider (S.K.) review their records daily and make in person rounds in the ICU to strongly encourage provider adherence to the PCT testing and algorithm-based management.  De-escalation of antibiotics will be recommended if the PCT level falls by 80% or more of the peak PCT level, or when the PCT level is less than or equal to 0.25 µg/L (Fig. 1). Continuation or escalation of antibiotics will be recommended if PCT level is greater than or equal to 0.5 µg/L, or increased as compared to previous peak PCT level.  These levels are comparable to those used in previously cited studies.  Laboratory Analysis The [COMPANY_002] Procalcitonin test is a diagnostic test that is FDA approved for use in adults and has been approved by [CONTACT_179788]. It will be available

Study Timeline The VUMC clinical laboratory PCT validation is complete. This protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_179789].  Provider education, and PCT clinical algorithm development is complete.  We estimate that we will attain the target sample size within [ADDRESS_211554] and manuscript preparation will be completed in the year after the study closes.  7.0 Risks  Risks include those associated with routine blood draws – pain, redness, soreness, bruising, or infection may occur at the needle stick site. Rarely some people faint.  We plan to offer EMLA cream to subjects prior to blood draws.  A maximum of [ADDRESS_211555] testing and/or adhere to the PCT algorithm or stewardship recommendations will be at the discretion of the ICU attending physician. All subjects in both arms will have baseline audit of antimicrobial orders with feedback to providers by [CONTACT_179787]. For subjects in the intervention arm, the stewardship team will additionally recommend PCT testing and treatment, with recommendations to initiate or expand antibiotic use at PCT levels > 0.5 ug/L and to stop antibiotics when PCT levels decrease by >80% from peak concentration or to an absolute value < 0.25 ug/L.   Multiple studies to date have demonstrated that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic de-escalation algorithms are as safe as standard of care management in the adult ICU setting.  As such, we do not anticipate increased risk of infection relapse rates or

These parameters will be monitored throughout the study and adverse events will be recorded and reported as detailed below.  8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others  Clinical adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. Serious adverse events include death, or other life-threatening complications like hemorrhage.Adverse drug/device events include if the PCT test result leads to premature cessation or de-escalation of antibiotics and causes harm to the patient, as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_179769].  Serious adverse device events include if PCT test results lead to premature antibiotic cessation, resulting in death, as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_179769]. All adverse events, adverse drug events, serious adverse events, and serious adverse drug events will be recorded by [CONTACT_179790], the VUMC IRB (in accordance with the Vanderbilt IRB Procedure III.L.1 – v.17.  ) and the FDA as required.     9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  Subjects can withdraw from the study at any time.  10.[ADDRESS_211556] 80% power to detect a difference in antibiotic duration of at least 2.[ADDRESS_211557] with a two-sided Type 1 error rate of 0.05.  Per clinical pharmacy data, the average duration of an antibiotic course per patient in VCH ICUs is 4 days, thus a difference of 2.0 days would be clinically significant.  11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  Data and specimens will be coded and protected according to institutional policies and protocol.  Blood samples will be run on the day that they are obtained, and will only be stored afterwards according to routine laboratory protocol.  Any blood that is obtained with routine clinical care on admission to the pediatric ICU but not used for the study will be discarded in an appropriate biohazard container within [ADDRESS_211558]-protected master key with protected health information, and each patient case/medical record will have a unique identifier code and the master key will be the only link between the clinical records and the corresponding laboratory data. In addition, recorded patient identifiers (MRN, name, DOB) will be kept with the master key only. All other clinical data will be recorded in a

Nevertheless, broad-spectrum antibiotics were recommended for initial empi[INVESTIGATOR_179774] (ie, before the susceptibility patterns of the responsible pathogens became known) of severe sepsis or septic shock, and for most severe infections. Notably, investigators were encouraged to start antibiotics as soon as possible in patients with severe infections, like septic shock, community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-asso cia ted pneumonia, or bacterial meningitis.20,21 A n t i b i o t i c  d e - e s c a l a t i o n  w i t h  n a r r o w e r -spectrum  antibiotics was strongly recommended, when possible, on the basis of culture results from specimens obtained at infection onset.For the procalcitonin group, blood samples were obtained at inclusion, at each infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_179775] 28, and every morning for patients receiving antibiotics. Procalcitonin concentration was assessed in every centre with time-resolved ampliﬁ ed cryptate-emission technology (Kryptor procalcitonin, Brahms, Hennigsdorf, [LOCATION_013]) and functional assay (detection concentration 0∙06 µg/L). Total procalcitonin-assay im-preci sion was reported by [CONTACT_179791] 10% at 0∙20 µg/L and less than 6% at more than 0∙30 µg/L. The same reagents were used in all study laboratories throughout the study period; two quality-control materials were run daily with the lowest mean measurement of 0∙25 µg/L (total imprecision range 5∙8–8∙8%) and the highest mean measurement of 10 µg/L (4∙7–4∙8%). Measurements were obtained 7 days per week and results were transmitted to the treating physician within 2 h after blood was drawn. This method was used to measure procalcitonin concentration for patients in the control group from four of the seven centres (data were not available for the other three centres), but results were not sent to the treating physicians and were used for our analysis only.Data collection and deﬁ nitionsAt admission to the intensive care unit, data collected were: age, sex, pre-existing comorbidities, previous location before admission, admission category, reason for admission, SAPS II, the presence and type of organ dysfunction using the sequential organ-failure assessment (SOFA) score,22 and use of mechanical ventilation. Additionally, at inclusion and during follow-up we recorded: SAPS II (at inclusion only), SOFA score and type of organ or system failure (at inclusion and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28), vital signs, daily need for mechanical ventilation, source of infection when known, results of microbiological cultures, and adequacy of the initial empi[INVESTIGATOR_179776].

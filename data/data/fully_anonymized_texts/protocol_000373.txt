DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES to Protocol v. 3.0 
The protocol was amended per recommendation of FDA to state that all Injection Site 
Reactions, serious and non -serious, will be recorded as Adverse Events.  
Changed text is indicated by [CONTACT_246038] (deleted text).  
Section. 6.4   Injection Site Assessment  
Positive events will furthermore be recorded as AEs . only if they are determined to be 
Serious Adverse Events.  
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES to Protocol v.2.0  
The protocol was amended to clarify discrepancies between the schedule of procedures 
(Tables 7.1 and 7.1.1) and the text, to correct minor errors and to add a Visual Analog Scale 
for evaluation of injection site pain.  
Changed text is indicated by  [CONTACT_662747] (new text) or strikethrough  (deleted text). In 
addition to the changes shown below, clarifications, minor editorial and formatting changes 
have been made.  
Section 4.[ADDRESS_894521]’s lifestyle. Female subjects should be 
surgically sterile (had a bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with 
no menses prior to Screening and a serum follicle stimulating hormone in the 
postmenopausal range at Screening), or, if of child be aring potential, must be non -
lactating and willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for [ADDRESS_894522]’s lifestyle. 
May also consider including wording on male sterilization (vasectomy) and sole male 
partner of female subject sterilization (vasectomy).  
Reason for change: The deleted text was included in error in the original protocol . 
Section 6.2.2 Medical History  
The medical history will include: disorders of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; neoplastic 
and hematological disorders; infectious diseases; disorders of the cardiovascular system 
including hypertension and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], each with duration; disorders o f the 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  5                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; disorders of the kidney and urinary tract; disorders of the 
gastrointestinal system; disorders of the immune system, connective tissue and joints; 
endocrinology and metabolism with a subcategory for diabetes including year of 
diagnosis, treatment, complications including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy; 
neurological disorders; and finally alcohol, illicit drug and smoking history including 
duration in years and 20-pack equivalents a day  number of pack years.  
Reason for cha nge: Correction  
 
Section 6.4 Injection Site Assessment  
A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for evaluation of injection site pain. A 
copy of the VAS is in Appendix 2 . 
 
Reason for change: To provide a standardized measurement of tenderness.  
 
Positive events that are deemed clinically relevant will furthermore be recorded as AEs 
only if the y are determined to be Serious Adverse Events.   
 
Reason for change: Potential injection site reactions are of special interest and thus 
carefully assessed as described above. As asking participants to rate injection site pain 
is a form of solicitation, which results in biased reporting frequencies, non -serious 
injection si te reactions will not additionally be reported as AEs in the present study.   
  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Urine PD  
Additional pooled urine collections will take place at the following intervals:  
• Day 1 0: a 4-hour urine collection will begin after dosing.  
• Day 1 0: from [ADDRESS_894523] b e recorded.  
• Day 2 1 through Day 3: 12 - hour urine collections.  
 
Reason for change: To be consistent with the Schedule of Procedures with regards to 
naming conventions for study days .

Synopsis  
 
Protocol Title:  
EXT608 in Human Healthy Adults; A First -in-Human, Randomized, Double -blind, 
Placebo -controlled, Single Dose Escalation Study  
 
Study Center(s):  
Pharmaceutical Research Associates, Inc.  
[ADDRESS_894525]:   
EXT608 dissolved in a buffered isotonic saline solution  
Starting Dose and Dose Escalation Scheme:  
The starting dose will be 4 µg in a volume of 10 ul.  Up to 6 dosing cohorts are planned 
with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
 
Route of Administration:  
Subcutaneous (SC) injection  
 
Objectives and Endpoints:  
The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of escalating 
dose levels of EXT608 when administered to healthy adult participants as a single 
injection as assessed by:  
1. Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals due to 
treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
2. Frequency and severity of post -dose change from baseline in hematology, serum 
chemistries, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and physical 
examination (E xam) findings [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
3. Percentage of participants with injection site reactions [Time Frame: Day 0 to 
Day 7]  
The secondary objectives are to assess:  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  7                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
1. Single dose PK including AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-48h, AUC 0-28d, AUC 0-≈, Cmax, Tmax, T½, 
ƛz, Cl/F and Vz/F.  
2. Single dose PD by [CONTACT_447] -dose change from baseline in serum chemistries with 
particular attention to Se -Ca, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine. Urinalysis 
will also be performed.  
Furthermore, the exploratory objectives are to assess:  
1. Single  dose Immunogenicity by [CONTACT_14181] -drug antibodies (ADA) and any neutralizing 
subset (NAb),  
2. Single dose effect on vitamin D metabolism by [CONTACT_11084] 25 -hydroxy -vitamin D and 
1,25-dihydroxy -vitamin D concentrations.  
 
Number of Patients:  
Up to approximately [ADDRESS_894526] (DMB) and ratification by [CONTACT_1034].  
Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, first -in-human (FIH), placebo -controlled single 
ascending dose (SAD) study to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EXT608 in 
healthy adult participants. Each participan t will provide written informed consent and 
must meet all of the eligibility criteria prior to being randomized and administered study 
product. Participants who discontinue prematurely will be replaced at the discretion of 
the Sponsor . 
Participants will be enrolled into 1 of up to 6 planned single dose cohorts (designated as 
S1 through S6, respectively) in ascending fashion.  
Each cohort will consist of [ADDRESS_894527] a <10% of maximal effect (E max) 
based on allometric scaling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
will be less than  the threshold derived from 1/[ADDRESS_894528] Level (NOAEL) established in GLP toxicology studies. Up to [ADDRESS_894529] -dosing pending review of safety data including Se -Ca 
and adverse events (AEs) by [CONTACT_24318].  
A potential DLT is defined as any of the following EXT608 TEAEs that occurs during 
the DLT period, graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2):  
• Grade = 3 TEAE  
• Grade = 3 anemia  
• Grade = [ADDRESS_894530]/ALT elevation; and/or  
• Grade = [ADDRESS_894531]/ALT elevation and Grade = 2 Bilirubin elevation  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  8                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
• Grade = 3 QTc prolongation  
• Grade = 3 Hyper - and/or Hypotension  
• Grade = 2 Hyperparathyroidism  
• Grade = 2 Hyperthyroidism  
• Grade = 3 Hypercalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypocalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypophosphatemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypomagnesemia  
• Grade = 3 Creatinine increased  
Dose escalation decisions will be based on the NCI Common Term inology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2) and Se -Ca levels.  
The DMB will review the seven -day safety data in each cohort before aut horizing the 
initiation of the next cohort according to the following decision tree:  
1. No Grade [ADDRESS_894532] on 
Se-Ca will result in the next dose at 2x the previous cohort dose.  
3. A Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in a single (n=4) cohort and the 
absence of prohibitive effects on Se -Ca will  result in an additional cohort at the 
same dose.  
4. A single Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in 2 cohorts at the same dose 
(n=8) cohort and the absence of prohibitive indication of effects on Se -Ca will 
result in a dose escalation to 1.5x the prev ious dose.  
5. Two or more of the same Grade 3 AE within the same cohort suspected related to 
study drug, or average peak Se -Ca > 1.5 mg/dl above the Upper Limit of Normal 
(ULN) range will terminate dose escalation.  
a. If the last dose escalation was 50% and by [CONTACT_118414] 2 cohorts received 
the previous dose for an n=8, the study will stop.  
b. If the last dose escalation was >50%, the next cohort should receive a dose 
2/3x the previous dose.  
Any DMB recommendation that deviates from the decision tree will be ratif ied by [CONTACT_662748].  
The study schematic is presented in Section 3.2. 
Pending the outcomes of the GLP toxicology and other nonclinical pharmacology studies, 
planned dose levels will be administered by [CONTACT_22666].  
A screening visit will take place within [ADDRESS_894533] 72 hours after dosing for safety and PK assessments 
before discharge. The total confinement period will be 4 nights, unless extended for 
management of AEs at the discreti on of the Investigator. The schedule of  events while 
inpatient  is provided in Section 7.1.1 . Follow -up visits to the clinic will occur on/about 
days 5 , 7, 14, 21 and 28. Participants will be monitored closely during the duration of the 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  9                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
study for safety, PK, and PD assessments as described in Section 3.2. The total duration 
of follow -up period may be modified in the final study design based on safety and PK 
data from non -clinical studies, anticipated PK/PD response and extended in individual 
participants as needed to observe their calcium levels return to concentrations deemed not 
needing further follow up.  
Additional/Alternative PK/PD time points may be implemented if the Sponsor determines 
this is necessary to fully characterize the PK profi le of EXT608.

Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND [ADDRESS_894539] participation in the study includ es:  
• Up to a 4 -week screening period  
• Approximately a 5-day inpatient dosing period  
• An additional outpatient monitoring of 25 days, for a total study duration of 
approximately 58 days  
 
Statistical Methods  
Sample Size  
The sample size is not determined fo r inferential testing purposes. The sample size of 
4 participants per cohort (3 active: 1 placebo) is considered sufficient for evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, and PD of EXT608 prior to making a decision about dose escalation 
as Se -Ca is very tightly r egulated and determination of effect based on simulations can 
therefore reliably be made with the small sample.  
 
Statistical Analyses  
AEs will be presented in listings and TEAEs will be summarized. Individual results of 
laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be listed and change from 
baseline will be summarized using shift tables. Individual results of vital signs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized.  
Individual results of quantitative ECG parameters from the 12 -lead safety ECGs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized and analyzed 
consistent with the ICH E14 ( 3).  
All summaries will be performed by [CONTACT_662750]608 dose level. Placebo data 
will be pooled across cohorts. Ph ysical exam findings will be presented in data listings.  
Concentrations of EXT608 will be summarized by [CONTACT_174378]. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be 
presented in a data listi ng. PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_154580]. Dose proportionality will be assessed graphically and using a power model. PD 
will be presented in listings and summarized by [CONTACT_134997].  
Detection of ADA and NAbs will be  presented in listings and summarized by [CONTACT_662751].  
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted as part of this study.  
DMB data packages will be based on the FAS for safety and PP for PK/PD.

1 Background Information  
1.1 Hypoparathyroidism  
Hypoparathyroidism is a rare clinical syndrome that results from reduced or absent 
parathyroid gland function and is characterized by [CONTACT_662753] (Se -Ca) levels, 
elevated serum phosphorus levels, and absent or inappropriately low levels of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) in circulation. Hypoparathyroidism is most often caused by [CONTACT_662754] ( i.e., radiation treatment) of the  parathyroid glands, the presence 
of autoimmune or congenital diseases, or low blood plasma magnesium levels. The low 
production of PTH in hypoparathyroidism patients leads to abnormally low calcium 
levels in blood, and an increase of phosphorus in the blo od. 
PTH is secreted in response to low blood Se -Ca levels. To release more ionic calcium 
into the blood, PTH indirectly stimulates bone matrix turnover, enhances renal tubular 
calcium reabsorption, as well as intestinal calcium absorption.  
Patients with hy poparathyroidism most often present with paresthesia, cramps, or tetany, 
but the disorder may also manifest acutely with seizures, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, 
or cardiac rhythm disturbances. In the postsurgical setting, the presentation can be acute 
with t etany, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tachycardia, and altered mental status predominating. Affected 
individuals are most often diagnosed with low blood calcium, magnesium and PTH 
levels, but high phosphorus levels, and frequently show increased urinary calcium 
excretion, whic h can lead to nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones. Hyperphosphatemia can 
be associated with deposition of calcium -phosphate complexes in other soft tissues.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_894546] of care for hypoparathyroidism includes oral c alcium carbonate 
supplements and active forms of vitamin D. Under restrictions, alternative treatment with 
once -daily injections of Parathyroid hormone (rhPTH (1 -84), Natpara®) has been 
approved by [CONTACT_662755]'t be co ntrolled with 
calcium and vitamin D supplements.  
1.2 Extend Biosciences’ E XT608 
EXT608 is under development as an extended half -life hPTH(1 -34), covalently attached 
to a derivative of vitamin D using the D -VITylation® technology, which results in an 
extended half-life and improved absorption and bioavailability of PTH, aimed at  reducing 
the rate and/or doses of injections. For more information refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure ( 1). 
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), 
and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of EXT608 when administered as a single dose to 
healthy adult participant s. EXT608 has undergone a full non -clinical testing program as 
recommended by [CONTACT_662756]. Data from thi s study are intended to identify and select pharmacolog ically 
active dose levels for subsequent dose ranging and other studies  in patients with 
hypoparathyroidism.  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND [ADDRESS_894547] a <10% of maximal effect (E max) 
based on allometric scaling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
will be less than the threshold derived from 1/[ADDRESS_894548] Level (NOAEL) established in GLP toxicology stud ies. Up to [ADDRESS_894549] clinical study 
conducted in participants with the target indication.  
2.1 Primary O bjective  
The primary objective is to characte rize the safety and tolerability profile of escalating 
dose levels of EXT608 when administered to healthy adult participant s as a single 
injection as assessed by :  
1. Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals due to 
treatment eme rgent AEs (TEAEs) [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
2. Frequency and severity of post -dose change from baseline in hematology, serum 
chemistries, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and physical 
examination  (Exam)  findings [Time Frame: Day 0 up to Day 28]  
3. Percentage of participant s with injection or infusion site reactions [Time Frame: 
Day 0 to Day 7]  
2.2 Secondary O bjective s 
The secondary objectives are to  assess : 
1. Single dose PK  including AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-48h, AUC 0-28d, AUC 0-≈, Cmax, Tmax, T½, 
ƛz, C l/F and Vz/F . 
2. Single dose PD by [CONTACT_447] -dose change from baseline in serum chemistries with 
particular attention to Se-Ca, phosphate, magnesium , and creatinine . Urinalysis  
will also be performed . 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Furthermore, the exploratory objectives are to assess : 
1. Single dose Immunogenicity by [CONTACT_14181]-drug antibodies (ADA) and any neutralizing 
subset (NAb),  
2. Single dose effect on vitamin D metabolism  by [CONTACT_11084]  25-hydroxy -vitamin D  and 
1,25-dihydrox y-vitamin D concentrations . 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND [ADDRESS_894550] -in-human (FIH), placebo -controlled single 
ascending dose (SAD) study to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of EXT608 in 
healthy adult participant s. Each participant  will provide written informed  consent and 
must meet all of the eligibility criteria prior to being randomized and administered study 
product . Participant s who discontinue prematurely will  be replaced at the discretion of 
the Sponsor.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_894551] (DMB) and ratification by [CONTACT_1034].  
Participant s will be enrolled into 1 of up to 6 planned single dose cohorts (designated as 
S1 through S6, respectively) in ascending fashion.  
Each cohort will consist of 4 participant s randomized to receive either EXT608 or 
placebo, whereby 3 will receive a single injection of EXT608 and 1 will receive matching 
placebo.  
3.1.2 Starting Dose  
The starting dose will be 4 µg in a volume of 10 ul.  Up to 6 dosing cohorts are planned 
with no single dose escalation to exceed a 3 -fold dose increment.  
3.1.3 Staggering of Participants after Dose Escalation  (Sentinel Participants)  
For the first cohort, one participant will be dose d initially. A review of safety data, 
including Se -Ca and adverse events (AEs) for the first [ADDRESS_894552] two participants in the 
cohort will be dosed.   
For subsequent cohorts, t his staggering requirement only applies to cohorts for doses 
higher than previous ly experience d in the study.   
3.1.4 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Criteria  
A potential DLT  is defined as any of the following EXT608 TEAEs that occurs during 
the DLT period, graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2):  
• Grade = 3 TEAE  
• Grade = 3 anemia  
• Grade = [ADDRESS_894553]/ALT elevation; and/or  
• Grade = [ADDRESS_894554]/ALT elevation and Grade = 2 Bilirubin elevation  
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  23                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
• Grade = 3 QTc prolongation  
• Grade = 3 Hyper - and/or Hypotension  
• Grade = 2 Hyperparathyroidism  
• Grade = 2 Hyperthyroidism  
• Grade = 3 Hypercalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypocalcemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypophosphatemia  
• Grade = 3 Hypomagnesemia  
• Grade = 3 Creatinine increased  
3.1.5 Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation decisions will be based on  the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 ( 2) and Se-Ca levels . 
The DMB will review the seven -day safety data in each cohort before authorizing the 
initiation of the next cohort according to the following decision tree:  
1. No Grade [ADDRESS_894555] on 
Se-Ca will result in the next dose at 2x the previous cohort dose.  
3. A Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in a single (n=4) cohort and the 
absence of prohibitive  effects on Se -Ca will result in an additional cohort at the 
same dose.  
4. A single Grade 3 AE suspected related to study drug in 2 cohorts at the same dose 
(n=8) cohort and the absence of prohibitive indication of effects on Se -Ca will 
result in a dose escal ation to 1.5x the previous dose.  
5. Two or more of the same Grade 3 AE within the same cohort suspected related to 
study drug, or average peak Se -Ca > 1.5 mg/dl above the Upper Limit of Normal 
(ULN) range will terminate dose escalation.  
a. If the last dose esca lation was 50% and by [CONTACT_118414] 2 cohorts received 
the previous  dose for an n=8, the study will stop.  
b. If the last dose escalation was >50%, the next cohort should receive a dose 
2/3x the previous dose.  
Any DMB recommendation that deviates from the decision tree will be ratified by [CONTACT_662748].  
The study schematic is presented in Section 3.2. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_894556] within 28 days of dosing. Eligible p articipant s for each 
cohort will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU)  [ADDRESS_894557] 72 hours after dosing f or safety and PK assessments

study for safety, PK, and PD assessments as described in  Section 3.2. The total duration 
of follow -up period may be modified in the final study design based on safety and PK 
data from non -clinical studies, anticipated PK/PD response and extended in individual 
participant s as needed to observe their calcium levels return to concentrations deemed not 
needing further follow up.  
Additional/Alternative PK/PD time points may be implemented if the Sponsor determines 
this is necessary to fully characterize the PK profile of EXT608.

6.10    Safety  Variables and Safety Reporting  
6.10.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or 
clinical investigation participant  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does 
not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding, for example), symptom, or di sease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product .  
Adverse events will be collected from the time informed consent is signed and until the 
Follow -Up or Early Termination visit .  
All participants will be queried, using non -leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs 
at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms should be 
identified as one overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for randomized subjec ts will be 
recorded in the eCRF and the subject's source documents. Adverse events for subjects who 
are screened but not subsequently randomized in the study will be recorded only in the 
subject's source documents. The following data should be documented f or each AE:  
• Description of the events  
• Classification of “serious” or “not serious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment giv en 
Adverse events  will be rated a mild, moderate or severe intensity using the following 
definitions:  
• Mild:  “Mild ” events are usually transient and do not interfere with the 
participant ’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  “Moderate ” events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern 
to the participant  and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Severe:  “Severe ” events interrupt the participant ’s usual daily activit ies. 
 
Extend Biosciences, Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  38                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
The causality will be rated in the following categories : 
• Unlikely: An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists 
between the investigational study product  and the reported AE. Other conditions, 
including chronic illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction 
to concomi tant medication, appear to explain the reported AE.  
• Possible: A “possible” relationship suggests that the associatio n of the AE with 
the investigational study product  is unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably 
supported by [CONTACT_145037].  
• Probable: A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal 
association  of the AE with study product  functionality  exists and, in the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely that a causal relationship exists 
between the study product’s  functionality  and the AE, and other conditions 
(concurrent illness, progression or expression of disease state or concomitant 
medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE should be followed until the Investigator has determined and  provided the final 
outcome. The outcome should be classified according to the following categories:  
• Recovered/resolved: Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Resolution of an AE with residual signs or 
symptoms  
• Not recovered/not resolved (continuing): Either incomplete improvement or no 
improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing  
• Fatal: Outcome of AE is death. “Fatal” should be used when death is at least 
possibly related to the AE  
• Unknown: Outcome o f an AE is not known (e.g., subject lost to follow -up) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (the term “life -threatening” here refers to an event in which the 
participant  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Would in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_662743]  
• May require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above

[IP_ADDRESS]  SAE Reporting Procedure  
Serious adverse events will be collected over the same time period as stated above for 
AEs. All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to the  drug. The initial 
report should include at least the following information:  
• Subject’s study ID number  
• Protocol number  
• Description of the event  
• Criterion for categorizing the AE as serious  
• Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug  
Any new informati on should be provided as it becomes available. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_662744], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and any other relevant documents may 
also be requested.  
Appropriate remedial measure should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the subject’s response to these 
measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
followed by [CONTACT_662763]. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be 
employed by [CONTACT_144722].  
The Investigator will be responsible for reporting all SAEs to the Instit utional Review 
Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC). The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting to the 
regulatory authorities.  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of coming to the 
Investigator's attention  Any serious adve rse event that occurs any time after the 
participant  has signed the informed consent form for the study, up to the participant ’s 
final study visit, inclusive, is to be reported to Product Safety within [ADDRESS_894581] . If unable to enter the SAE information in the EDC ( e.g., 
internet connection is down), the report may be reported by [CONTACT_662764] (609) [ADDRESS_894582] be followed up by [CONTACT_662765].

7.2.[ADDRESS_894602]  
A DMB will be formed to monitor safety and dose cohort choices and provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for implementation in the study. The DMB will 
minimally include an independent Safety Monitor, the Medical Monitor, the 
Investigator( s), and an independent statistician as voting members, as well as a non -
voting coordinator. Operational details will be described in a Safety Plan.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_894603] participant of a cohort has completed Day 7 and evaluable data are 
available,  statistics will provide a data summary of the cohort data for the DMB. The 
DMB will meet and decide further actions as described in the Safety Plan.  
 
8 Statistical Methods  
8.1 Sample size  
The sample size is not determined for inferential testing purposes. The s ample size of 4 
participants per cohort (3 active: 1 placebo) is considered sufficient for evaluation of 
safety, tolerability, and PD of EXT608 prior to making a decision about dose escalation 
as Se -Ca is very tightly regulated and determination of effect based on simulations can 
therefore reliably be made with the small sample.  
8.2 Analysis populations  
Two participant populations will be defined. The Safety  of Full Analysis Set population 
(FAS) will be defined as all participants who are randomized. The Per-Protocol  (PP) 
population will be participants for whom evaluable data to and including Day 7 is 
available and with no major protocol violations.   
8.3 Data Analysis  
AEs will be presented in listings and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will 
be summariz ed. Individual results of laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and 
urinalysis) will be listed and change from baseline will be summarized using shift tables. 
Individual results of vital signs will be listed and observed values and changes from 
baseline  will be summarized.  
Individual results of quantitative ECG parameters from the 12 -lead safety ECGs will be 
listed and observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized and analyzed 
consistent with the ICH E14 ( 3).  
All summaries will be performed by [CONTACT_662750]608 dose level. Placebo data 
will be pooled across cohorts. Physical exam findings will be presented in data listings.  
Concentrations of EXT608 will be summarized by [CONTACT_174378]. Individual plasma concentration data versus time will be 
presented in a data listing. PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_662766], Inc.  Confidential  IND 146180  51                  Clinical Study Protocol EXT608 -101, V 3, 24 October  2022   
 
statistics. Dose proportionality will be assessed graphically and using a po wer model. PD 
will be presented in listings and summarized by [CONTACT_134997].  
Detection of ADA and NAbs will be presented in listings and summarized by [CONTACT_662751].  
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted as part of this study.  
DMB d ata packages will be based on the FAS for safety and PP for PK/PD.  
Further details are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
[ADDRESS_894604] Access to Source Data/Documents  
Extend Biosciences, Inc. or agents thereof, the reviewing IRB/EC, and health authorit ies 
from the US or other countries will have access to source documents at the 
investigational site for monitoring, auditing or inspection purposes.  
 
10   Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
10.1   Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_662767].  
Monitoring will be done via on -site visits by [CONTACT_25007], who will review the eCRFs 
and source documents, and via remote review of eCRF entries.  The site monitor will 
make sure that the investigation is conducted a ccording to protocol design, GCP, and 
regulatory requirements.  
Alternatively, due to the ongoing SARS -CoV -2 pandemic, all monitoring may be remote 
using a combination of source documents uploaded to the EDC and other tools for 
viewing site documents, e.g.,  for signed ICFs, for SDV. Further details will be described 
in a Clinical Monitoring Plan.  
10.2   Data Management  
Data will be entered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system at the investigational 
site.   
The data management plan will describe the methods  used to collect, check, validate, and 
process clinical data in detail.  It will also clarify the roles and responsibilities for the 
different functions and personnel involved in the data management process.   
AEs and medical/surgical history will be class ified according to the terminology of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version specified in the Data 
Management Plan).  Medications will be classified according to the latest World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  
Quality  control procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all 
data are reliable and have been processed correctly.  When all data have been coded, 
validated, and locked, clean file will be declared.  Any treatment -revealing data may  
thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.

10.2.1  Audits  
In addition to monitoring, the Sponsor, Sponsor’s representative, US or foreign 
regulatory authorities, and/or the reviewing IRB/ethics committee, may audit the conduct 
of the study.  The auditors must have access to all study documents, the facilities where 
the study was conducted, and the study staff for interviews.  The investigator will contact 
[CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency about an inspection at the 
center.  
 
11   Ethics  
The study will be performed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), and the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaratio n of Helsinki.  
An IRB will approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the informed 
consent form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the 
subjects, before any subjects are enrolled.  The investigator wil l ensure the distribution of 
these documents to the applicable IRB/EC and to the staff of the study site.

Version 3.0, 3FEB2020  Glossary  
 
Term  Definition  
 
Accuracy (error rate)  Rate of correct (incorrect) predictions made by [CONTACT_524231] a  
data set. Accuracy is usually estimated by [CONTACT_524232].  
 
 
 
 
 
ADI-R The Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R) is a structured interview 
conducted by [CONTACT_524233] a parent or 
caretaker who is familiar with the developmental history and current 
behavior of the individual being evaluated and uses standardized 
procedures to code the responses. The interview can be used to asse ss 
children and adults as long as their mental ages are two years or higher.  
Because the ADI –R is an interview rather than a test, and because it 
focuses on behaviors that are rare in non -affected individuals, it provides 
categorical results rather than sc ales or  norms.  
 
 
 
 
ADOS  The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a semi - structured 
assessment of communication, social interaction, and play (or imaginative 
use of materials) for individuals suspected of having autism or other 
pervasive devel opmental disorders. Its goal is to provide standardized 
contexts in which to observe the social -communicative behaviors of 
individuals across the life span in order to aid in the diagnosis of autism 
and other pervasive developmental disorders. Administrati on and coding 
are highly standardized. Therefore, valid assessment requires training.  
 
Aid to Diagnosis  Output that provides a Healthcare Provider (HCP) information that  
drives a diagnosis. An Aid to Diagnosis is not a standalone diagnosis tool.  
 
Algorithm  A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem -
solving operations, especially by a computer. The Device has an 
underlying algorithm based on machine learning  
techniques that provides the output to the provider.  
ASD Autism Spectrum Disorder  
 
Caregiver  The caregiver is often the parent  of the child presenting ASD symptoms 
but may represent the legal guardian or adult in charge of the child ’s well -
being and healthcare  decisions.  
Clinical reference  
standard  Best available method for establishing a subject’s true status with  
respect to a target condition.  
(Machine learning) 
Classification  Process of predicting to which predefined category (or class/label) a new 
observation belongs, on the basis of a training set o f data  
containing observations whose category membership is known.  
Classifier  Algorithm that evaluates unlabeled data and classifies them.

Title  Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid Validation Study  
Sponsor  Cognoa, Inc.  
Study Description  This study seeks to evaluate the ability of the fourth generation Cognoa 
ASD Diagnosis Aid (the “device”) to aid healthcare providers in 
diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Children age >18 to <[ADDRESS_679975] ’s legal guardian. The subject s’ caregivers will complete a 
caregiver assessment and upload two brief videos of the child for 
analysis p rior to their evaluation by a specialist clinician. All participants , 
subject s’ caregivers and HCPs , will be blinded to the results of the 
device. Furthermore, the caregivers, device video analysts, and HCPs 
providing inputs to the device algorithm will be  blinded to each other’s 
input . 
Objective  
 To assess the ability of the device to aid in the diagnosis of ASD by 
[CONTACT_524239], 
consisting of a diagnosis made by a specialist clinician, based on DSM -[ADDRESS_679976] clinicians.  
Endpoints  Primary:  
● Achievement of a composite of positive predictive value (PPV) 
greater than 65% and negative predictive value (NPV) greater 
than 85% for the device in relation to the clinical reference 
standard in the overall study population.  
● Measurement of the proportion of children for whom the 
Device provides no result.    
 
Secondary:  
● Sensitivity of the device in relation to the clinical reference 
standard in the ov erall study population.  
● Specificity of the device in relation to the clinical reference 
standard in the overall study population.

Version 3.0, 3FEB2020   
1 BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurode velopmental disorder that affects communication and behavior.  
 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5), a guide created by 
[CONTACT_524242], ASD 
primarily consists of persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction as well as the presence of 
restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, and/or activities that can persist throughout life.  
 
ASD is said to be a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life and 
is known as a “spectrum” because there is a wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people 
experience.  
 
Symptoms  can include poor eye contact, difficulty reading social cues, failure to develop peer relationships, lack of 
social or emotional reciprocity, delayed speech development, difficulty sustaining conversations, lack of make -
believe play, repetitive motor mann erisms, rigid adherence to routines, restricted interests and hyper - and/or 
hypo sensitivity to sensory input. ASD can have a significant impact on a child’s day -to-day functioning including 
but not limited to impairments in communicating and getting needs  met as well as difficulties with activities of

Reported prevalence rates have been rising steadily since the 1960s and Autism Spectrum Disorders have risen to 
the top of childhood disorders wi th a prevalence rate of 1 in 59 children (Baio, Wiggins, Christensen et al., 2018). 
Multiple environmental, biologic, and genetic factors contribute to the development of ASD (Landrigan, 2010; 
Hallmayer, Cleveland, Torres, et al., 2011; Gaugler, Klei, Sand ers, et al., 2014; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946], Pagnamenta, Klei, et al., 
2010). Also, ASD is reported to occur in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and is approximately 4 times 
as prevalent in boys than girls.  
 
As recognized by [CONTACT_262415] ( CDC ), diagnosing ASD can be difficult, since there is no medical 
test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Healthcare professionals typi[INVESTIGATOR_524225] b y asking questions to caregivers. 
They use the standardized diagnostic criteria for ASD provided in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) and focus on the assessment of a behavioral phenotype, inclu ding 
deficits in social communication, social interactions, and restricted or repetitive behaviors while also considering 
the developmental history as well as the alternate developmental diagnosis that would explain the symptoms.
 
The American Academy of P ediatrics recommends children be screened specifically for Autism at [ADDRESS_679979] for 
Autism in Toddlers -Revised (M -CHAT -R). Many studies show, howev er, that primary HCPs are not screening 
children for ASD per these recommendations due to lack of confidence in the tools and/or lack of time to properly

Version 3.0, 3FEB2020  review results with caregivers (Carbone et. al, 2016). If a primary care provider does suspect a devel opmental 
delay such as ASD, children are often put on watchful waiting until the clinician can be more certain of a problem. 
Moreover, in cases in which a referral for an assessment by a specialist is eventually provided, families may wait 
as long as [ADDRESS_679980], or even 
longer if the family is part of a minority population or lower socioeconomic group (Begeer, Bouk, Boussaid, 
Terwogt, & Koot, 2009). On average, the overall d elay between first concerns arising in caregivers and an ASD 
diagnosis is approximately 3 years (Zuckerman, Lindly, & Sinche, 2015).  
 
This delay in obtaining a diagnosis directly translates into delays in initiating early behavioral intervention. Such 
early intervention in ASD has been shown to have significant positive impact on a child’s development, especially 
when delivered before 36 months (Warren et al., 2011).  
 
Although families report concerns to their child’s physician as early as 1 year of age, the average age of diagnosis 
in the [LOCATION_002] is 4.4 years old and an estimated 27% of children with ASD still remain undiagnosed at [ADDRESS_679981] child learning and development creating lifelong 
disability, not to mention the related increased economic costs on caregivers and society (Dawson et al, 2009; 
Cidav, et al., 2017). Thus, there is a critical need to provide primary HCPs not only with tools to screen and triage 
children for ASD, but also tools that can provide them with higher levels of diagnostic cer tainty than are currently 
available in the primary care setting, thus enabling them to render a diagnosis without referral to a specialist.  
 
Currently there are no FDA cleared or approved medical devices intended to aid in the diagnosis of ASD. 
Behavioral instruments with the highest diagnostic validity, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 
(ADOS) (Lord et al., 2000) and the Autism Diagnostic Instrument Revised (ADI -R) (Lord, Rutter, & Couteur, 1994) 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_85514] a secondary care  setting and can take several hours to administer by a trained specialist. 
The geographic and logistical hurdles in finding a healthcare professional trained to administer these instruments, 
the long duration of the standard exams, as well as the need for administration in a clinical facility, contribute to 
delays in diagnosis and an imbalance in coverage of the population needing attention (Shattuck PT, Durkin M, et 
al. 2009).  
 
Rural communities face even more significant challenges regarding th e availability of diagnostic specialists and 
geographic distance and transportation challenges, which results in delayed diagnosis of ASD, and consequently 
lower outcomes for children in these communities (Antezana, Scarpa, Valdespi[INVESTIGATOR_8614], Albright, & Richey, 2017).
 
To address these challenges, [CONTACT_524260] (scientific founder of Cognoa), then at the Center for Bioinformatics 
at Harvard Medical School, used machine learning techniques to create a [ADDRESS_679982]. Wall’s Lab used data from Autism Speak s’ Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) to create 
the classifier and then used this same database, in addition to two independent sources (a collection of 1654

Consortium), to show a high level of statistical accuracy in correctly classifying children with ASD. The classifier 
was 92% accurate in identifying those who do not have ASD (Wall, Dally, Luyster, Jung, & DeLuca, 2012).  
 
[CONTACT_524261] an d his colleagues continued to apply the techniques of machine learning to each of the observational 
modules of the ADOS. The ADOS is a semi -structured observational tool administered by a trained clinician that is 
focused on first -hand observations of the child. The ADOS module that is administered is determined by [CONTACT_197503]’s level of language (i.e. nonverbal, single words, phrased speech, fluent speech). By [CONTACT_524243], [CONTACT_524261] was able to adjust the risk gen erator to accommodate children across 
the developmental spectrum. He was able to again validate his findings in independent samples and showed a 
high degree of sensitivity and specificity in these archival datasets (Duda, Kosmicki, & Wall, 2014; Kosmicki, 
Sochat, Duda, & Wall, 2015).  
 
Building on the work of [CONTACT_524260], Cognoa has further developed the algorithm/software to render a risk 
assessment for Autism. Cognoa’s first -generation algorithm, developed in 2015 for screening purposes, showed 
better accuracy across a broader age range than other screening tools in a clinical study published in Autism 
Research (Kanne, Carpenter, & Warren, 2018) . Cognoa has continued to advance the development of its machine 
learning platform as the basis for a reliable  diagnostic device to improve the timeliness of autism diagnosis within 
the critical early childhood years (Abbas H., Garberson F., Glover E., Wall D. 2018).

4 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Effectiveness endpoints  
 
The primary endpoints of this study are:  
(1) to achieve a composite of positive predictive value (PPV) greater than 65% and negative predictive value (NPV) 
greater than 85% for the device in relation to the clinical reference standard in the overall study population, and  
(2) measurement of the proportion of all children for whom the Device provides no result.  
 
The secondary end points are:  
(1) sensitivity of the device in relation to the clinical reference standard in the overall study population and  
(2) specificity of the device in relation to the clinical reference standard in the overall study population.  
   
4.2 Safety endpoi nts  
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and reported from enrollment (informed 
consent signature) through completion of the reference diagnosis clinic visit.  
 
[ADDRESS_679985] 6 months. Su bjects’ participation in the study is expected to last [ADDRESS_679986] access to a 
research coordinator, study website,  or app (Cognoa Research app) to learn more about the study, provide 
consent, determine whether their child qualifies, and answer questions to test their comprehension of the study.  
 
All subject s will undergo investigational (Cognoa assessment) and comparator diagnostic assessments for ASD 
using DSM -[ADDRESS_679987], complete a caregiver assessment about the 
child’s behavior and development, and record two brief videos of their child. Caregivers will be given guidance on 
how to record videos. Both the assessment and the videos will be submitted via the Cognoa Research app. Cognoa 
video analysts will analyze the  videos. The primary healthcare provider (HCP) will also answer an assessment 
about the child’s behavior and development. The caregivers, video analysts, and HCPs providing inputs to the 
device algorithm will be blinded to each other’s input.  
 
Once the car egiver assessment, primary HCP assessment, and scored videos have been submitted, the device will 
generate a diagnostic output. The device output will be recorded by [CONTACT_21411] a dedicated study data 
repository. The device inputs and the device output will not be shared with the referring HCP, caregivers, or

will also complete a standardized medical history and physical form (See Appendix), which may be completed  
during the diagnosing clinician visit.  The standardized form and video will be sent to the Cognoa study monitor.  
 
Determination of clinical diagnosis for study analysis purposes ( clinical reference standard ) will consist of a 
specialist clinician diagnos is by [CONTACT_2681] -[ADDRESS_679989] clinician (who is provided wi th the standardized medical history and physical form, and a 
video of the diagnostic encounter). The diagnosing clinician will be instructed to not state any diagnostic 
conclusion, decision on any particular component of DSM -[ADDRESS_679990] clinician.  The 
study monitor will track reviewing clinicians' assessment results , maintaining blinding to all parties . The diagnosis 
for study analy sis purposes is taken as the majority assessment of the three specialists (one diagnosing specialist 
and two reviewing specialists).  
 
Subject s Identification and Recruitment  
If the primary HCP has identified a child at risk for development al delay or learn s of caregiver concern about 
developmental delay the primary HCP or a member of his or her clinical team will inform caregivers about the 
study. Caregivers will be provided with material(s) describing the study and how to learn more and enroll. 
Caregivers may be enrolled in the study by [CONTACT_127009], if available at the site, via a website, or the Cognoa 
Research app.  If caregivers have questions, they can direct them to their primary HCP or his/her staff assisting in 
the study. They can also contact [CONTACT_10577]’s representative for the study. If the caregivers wish to pursue 
enrollment for their child, they will answer questions to determine if the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.  This 
will determine eligibility of the child for the study.  
 
Process of  Consent  
The caregivers of the child will be given access to the consent form. The objective of the informed consent form is 
to ensure that they understand the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits of participating and the voluntary 
nature of their participation. If they have questions, they may reach out to their primary HCP, other research staff 
at the site, or the Sponsor’s study coordinator. A child will not be enrolled in the study if his/her caregivers do not 
sign the consent. Child assent is n ot needed as the child involved will be less than [ADDRESS_679991] s can 
end their participation in the study at any time.

9 ADVERSE  EVENTS  AND ADVERSE  DEVICE  EVENTS  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse even t (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, device users or other persons, whether or not it 
is related to the investigational medical device.  Expected Adverse Device Events (ADEs) may be previously 
identified in nature, incidence, severity or outcome in the study protocol, informed consent document, device 
operator manual, other risk analysis documentation or regulatory application.  
 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, whether related to the use of an investigational device or 
clinical study device, that:  
 
● led to a death;  
● led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
o resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury;  
o resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function;  
o required in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135460];

Version 3.0, 3FEB2020  o resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body structure or a 
body function;  
● led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_680003] (ASADE)  
An anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is  any SAE on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with the device, if that effect, problem, or death was previously 
identified  in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, informed con sent, operator 
manual, other risk analysis documentation or regulatory application; or any other serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_680004] ([LOCATION_003]DE ) 
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is any SAE on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with the device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified  in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, informed consent, operator 
manual, other risk analysis documentation, or regulatory application; or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
In subjects, the ADEs/SADEs include the effects related to the investigational medical device (clinical study device), 
or the procedures involved. For device users or other persons (other clinical staff in the treatment room) 
ADE/SAD E is restricted to the effects related to investigational medical devices. ADEs/SADEs may include the 
effects (1) resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the investigatio nal medical device; or (2) resulting from user error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.

Version 3.0, 3FEB2020  9.2 Recording AEs/ADEs and SAEs/SADEs  
All AEs/SAEs or ADEs/SADEs will be: (1) evaluated and must be recorded in the subject’s study case report forms 
(CRFs); (2) monitored and tracked from the time of the first treatment.  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek informatio n on AEs/ADEs/SADEs by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. AEs/ADEs/SADEs may be observed by [CONTACT_1755]/or 
clinical research staff, elicited from the subject and/or family member or volunteered by [CONTACT_423]. All observed 
and volunteered adverse signs and symptoms, anticipated or unanticipated, regardless of severity or frequency, 
will be recorded in the case histories (medical chart and CRFs). Included in the description should be the nature of 
the sign or symptom, the date  of onset, date of resolution (duration), the severity, anticipated or unanticipated, 
the relationship to study treatment or other therapy, the action taken (if any), and the outcome.   
All SAEs/SADEs, anticipated or unanticipated, must be reported to Cogn oa immediately but not later than [ADDRESS_680005] be recorded in: (1) the CRF and (2) a written report must be submitted to Cognoa 
within five (5) working days after the investigator first learns of the event and is to include a full descrip tion of the 
event and sequelae, in the format detailed by [CONTACT_524254].  
 
9.3 Follow -up of Subjects after AEs  
All reported AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs should be followed until resolution or until the subject’s participation in the 
study end s.  Resolutions of AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs are to be documented on the appropriate CRFs.  All ADEs that 
result in permanent discontinuation from this clinical trial, whether serious or not, should also be reported on the 
subject Non -Completion of Study Form.  
 
10 POTENTIAL  RISKS  / BENEFITS  
10.1  Potential Risks  
Risks related to the study are expected to be minimal.  
 
There are no physical risks of participating in the study. However, one risk could be psychological. Caregiver s may 
feel some discomfort in answering questions about their child’s behavior. Children might also feel some 
discomfort being filmed for the vide o analysis.  
 
Another potential risk is the possible release of sensitive medical, behavioral, or educational information. To 
mitigate the risk of releasing sensitive personal information, we adhere to confidentiality protocols to protect the 
privacy of pe rsonal information. When data is published, it is always anonymous and in a manner so that specific 
families or subject s cannot  be identified.

sample size calculat ion.With a 2:1 randomizat ion of terlipressin to placebo and an 
interim analysis after 50% of the subjects have completed Day  14 or Di scharge, 
300subjects will provide 9089.76% power to detect a statist ically significant 
difference between the groups .
6.  Secti on 6.1.1 was modified as fo llows:
Incidence of verified HRS reversal, defined as the percentage of subjects wi th 
2consecutive SCr values no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL at least 2 hours apart, while on

final dose of study drug).
7.  Secti on 8.1was m odified as fo llows:
Subjects with a baseline SCr level greater than 7.0 mg/dL  will be excluded from  the study .
In thi s study , the threshol d for the upper cut of SCr will be set to exclude subjects with 
SCr> 6mg/dL. The threshold for u pper cut -off of SCr in entry criteria is derived fr om the 
results of pr evious NDA studies. In OT -0401, none of the subjects w ith a baseline SCr level 
greater than 7.0mg/dL achieved HRS r eversal. Subjects w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_36673] ( less than 3.4mg/dL or at least 3.4 mg/dL).
where, across individual studies as well as in the pooled analysis, subjects with SCr of 
≤ 6mg/dL  have shown a m uch greater likelihood of achieving HRS reversal than subjects 
withSCr > 6 mg/dL. Pooling the OT 0401 and REVE RSE studies resulted in 11.1% (1/9) 
of subjects wi th SCr > 6mg/dL  achieving HRS reversal and 37.4% (49/131) of subjects 
with SCr ≤ 6 m g/dL achieving HRS reversal. The aim o f lowering the upper cut off is to 
minimize exposure to terlipressin in subjects wi th high SCr who m ay not receive as much 
benefit to therapy  but still be exposed to the risks of the therapy .Subjects will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_36674] ( less than 3.4 mg/dL or at least 3.4 mg/dL).
Qualifying SCr is a pr ognostic factor for survival and H RS reversal. Excluding subjects 
with a baseline SCr of greater than 6 7mg/dL and LVP at least 4 L within 2 days prior to

Investigational Product , Dosage and Mode of Administration :
Single -use, sterile 6 -mL vials containing 1 mg of lyophilized terlipressin acetate (equivalent to 0.85 mg 
terlipressin free base) wit h 10 mg mannitol as a bulking agent/stabilizer. Each vial will be reconstituted 
with 5mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:
Matching placebo vials (containing 11 mg mannitol) that are identical in appearance to terlipressin for injection 
vials. Each vial will be reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
The following dosing scheme will be utilized for both terlipressin and matching placebo:
Initial Dosing:
Blinded terlipre ssin or placebo will be administered intravenously as a bolus injection over 2 minutes at a dose 
of 1 mg (1 vial) every 6 hours (± 30 minutes).
Dose Modifications:
If SCr has decreased, but by [CONTACT_21316] 30% from the baseline value on Day 4 after a minimum of 10 doses 
of study drug , the dose of study drug will be increased to 2 mg ever y 6 hours (± 30minutes) (8 mg/day). 
The dose should not be increased in subjects with coronary artery disease or in the setting of circulatory 
overload, pulmonary edema, or b ronchospasm. 
If dosing is interrupted due to an adverse event, study drug may be re -started, at the discretion of the 
investigator, at the same or lower dose as per protocol. Study drug will not be restarted if dosing 
wasinterrupted due to cardiac ischem ia or mesenteric ischemia .
If in the investigator’s judgment, a dose increase is not advisable or otherwise justified in the individual 
subject, the reason(s) for not increasing the dose of study drug will be documented on the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF).
Treatment Discontinuation:
Treatment should be continued until 24 hours after a second consecutive SCr value no more than 1.5 mg/dL has 
been obtained, OR up to a maximum of 14 days (maximum of [ADDRESS_36547] reaches 1.5 mg/dL on 
Day 14). 
If on Day  4 (after a minimum of 10 doses ) SCr is at or above baseline value, study drug should be discontinued .
Treatment must be discontinued when the subject is to undergo RRT, liver transplantation , TIPS or vasopressor

If judged by [CONTACT_36688], subjects who demonstrate at least a partial response 
during the initial treatment course ( at least 30% reduc tion in SCr) who develop recurrence of HRS Type 1 
during the study or follow -up period may  be retreated with initially assigned blinded study drug for a maximum 
of 14 days (from the beginning of the retreatment, treatment and study procedures will be ident ical to the initial 
therapy ). To qualify for retreatment the subject must again meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and

5.1 Hepatorenal Syndrome
Hepatorenal syndro me (HRS) T ype 1, a potentially reversible renal failure, is a serious, 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36635], fatal  orphan disease com plicating decom pensated chronic liver disease 
associ ated wi th cirrhosi s (Arroy oet al, 1996; Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015). 
Theestimated [LOCATION_002] (US) annual incidence for HRS T ype 1 ranges between 9,000 
and20,000 pati
ents ( Marrero , 2003; Muir , 2002; Murkerj eeet al, 2002 ;National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36636]  2005 ), establishing it as an orphan disease. The death rate from chronic 
liver di sease and cirrhosis has been rising, while the death rates for other major diseases 
such as stroke, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes have gone down in the past 15 years 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion 2013 ; Maet al, 2015). 
As indicated in the American Associat ion for the Study  of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 
Guidelines, at present, there is no available pharmacological the rapy (ie, approved or proven) 
in the US or Canada for HRS T ype 1 
(Runyo n, 2013) and there remains a significant unmet 
need. 
An increasing body  of knowl edge of  the pathophy siology of HRS T ype [ADDRESS_36569] ion in HRS T ype 1 
(Salerno et al,
2007; European Associ ation for the Study of the Liver 2010). T erlipressin has been 
extens ively  studied as a spl anchnic vasoconstri ctor f or the treatm ent of HRS T ype [ADDRESS_36570] of care for this condit ion wherever the drug is available 
(European Association 
for the S tudy of the Liver 2010 ). Although there has been so me o ff-label use of other 
vasoconstri ctors, a recent study  has shown that the most commo nly used agents 
(ie,combinat ion of midodrine and octreoti de) are not effect ive (Cavallin et al, 2015).
5.2 Terlipressin
Terlipressin is a synt hetic vasopressin analogue that acts as a systemic vasoconstrictor via 
thevascular vasopressin V 1receptors. In HRS patients the strong V 1receptor -mediated 
vasoconstri ctor activit y of terlipressin, particularly in the splanchnic area, increases effective 
intravascular vol ume and mean arterial pressure (MAP), ameliorates renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system  and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivit y, and improves renal blood 
flow. These corrective hemodynamic effe cts culminate in improved renal funct ion, thereby

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 37of 108 Confidential and ProprietaryAfter intravenous ( IV)administration of terlipressin, the glycyl residues of terlipressin 
arecleaved by  [CONTACT_36692]. Thus, terlipressin levels in the blood decrease 
rather rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36637] -vasopressin is released 
gradually  from tissues into the ci rculati on.
Terlipressin is approved in many countries and regio ns outside the US where it has been 
thestandard of care for decades in the treatm ent of subjects with liver cirrhosis and 
esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) ( de Franchis , 2005; Ioannou et al, 2003), and has 
more recent ly beco me a standard of care for the tr eatment of subjects with HRS T ype 1 where 
it is available 
(EASL , 2010). Terlipressin has been approved for the treatment of HRS T ype [ADDRESS_36571] igator ’s Brochure for a summary  of the nonclinical studies with terlipressin.
5.3 Clinical S tudies of Terlipressin in Subjects With HRS T ype 1
Clinical data are a vailable fro m 2 rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies, 
(OT-0401 and REVERSE), a randomized, open- label, active -controlled study  (TAHRS), and 
alarge body of published lit erature studi es in over 800 terlipressin -treated subj ects wi th 
HRS Type1 (Invest igator ’s Brochure ).
5.3.1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Following a 1 -mg IV dose of terlipressin every 6 hours (q6h) in subjects with HRS Type 1 
(OT-0401 and REVERSE studies), terlipressin has a median terminal half- life o f 
approximately  0.9 hours. Although the half -life o f lysine- vasopressin is short (1 to 6 minutes), 
as a result of the slow metabo lic conversio n of terlipressin to lysine -vasopressin the median 
apparent half -life o f lysine -vasopres sin is increased to approximately  [ADDRESS_36572] of terlipressin; maintaining these 
effects for [ADDRESS_36573] igator ’s Brochure for further details.
Terlipressin

Incorpo rating Amendments 1, [ADDRESS_36574] ion is the goal of thera py for HRS T ype 1; improvement in renal 
funct ion is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes and improved prognosis, with or 
without liver transplantation. HRS reversal is a widely accepted, clinically meaningful 
response to treatment for HRS T ype 1, as apparent inexorable, rapid progression o f renal 
failure i s arrested and normal renal function in the setting of deco mpensated liver disease 
isrestored. The primary  endpoint of HRS reversal (1serum creat inine [ SCr]value of no m ore 
than1.5mg/dL) i s the standard endpo int utilized in the literature and HRS treatment 
guidelines ( Arroy oet al, 1996 ;Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015).
The OT -0401 study  (112 subjects with HRS T ype 1 randomized 1:1 to receive terlipressin 
orplacebo, with concomitant albumin administration recommended in both treatment arms) 
demonstrated a si gnificantly higher rate of HRS reversal (34% vs 13%, p =
0.008) in the 
terlipressin treatment group compared to the placebo group. The primary endpo int of 
Treatment Success at Day 14 (an init ial reduct ion of SCr to no more than 1.5 m g/dL followed 
by a confirmatory  SCr m easurement of no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL 48 hours after the init ial HRS 
reversal and an addit ional SCr value less than 2.5 mg/dL  at Day  14, wi thout intervening liver 
transpl ant or di alysis) was also met fo llowing the incorporati on of  addi tional SCr values post 
initial database closure (29% vs 13%, p = 0.037). Furthermore, the prespecified endpo int of 
change in SCr fro m baseline to Day  14 dem onstrated a greater reduction in SCr with 
terlipressin vs placebo ( -0.9mg/dL; p = 0.0008).
In the REVERSE study  (196 subjects with HRS T ype 1 randomized 1:1 to receiv e terlipressin 
or placebo, wi th concomitant albumin administration recommended in both treatment arms), 
there was a trend for greater HRS reversals with terlipressin treatment vsplacebo 
(24% vs15%, p =0.129) . For a number of reasons (for example ,discharge fro m hospi [INVESTIGATOR_36638] ),statistical significance (20% vs 13%, not significant)
was not achieved forconfirmed HRS reversal (an ini tial reduct ion of SCr to no m ore than
1.5mg/dL  followed by a confirmatory  SCr m easurem ent o f no m ore than 1.5 m g/dL 48 hours 
after the ini tial HRS reversal [in the case of hospit al discharge or transplantation before 
[ADDRESS_36575] 22 hours apart]). Although the 
REVERSE study  did not m eet the prespecif ied endpoint of HRS reversal , the prespecified 
endpo int ofchange in SCr from baseline to end of treatment demonstrated a greater reduction 
in SCr wi th terlipressin vs placebo ( -0.6 mg/dL; p = 0.0002). This current study  has been 
designed to address the me thodological obstacl es encountered in the REVERSE trial.

Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Page 39of 108 Confidential and ProprietaryThe open -label, active -controlled study  (TAHRS) and a large body of published literature 
studi es (including [ADDRESS_36576] igations in over 800 terlipressin- treated subjects 
with HRS T ype 1) have consistent ly demo nstrated that terlipressin significant ly improves 
renal funct ion in subjects with HRS Type 1. In T AHRS, the incidence of HRS reversal
wassignificant ly higher in terlipressin + albumin -treated subj ects com pared wi th 
albumin -treated subjects (39.1% vs 8.7%; p = 0.018) and the change in SCr from baseline 
tothe end of treatm ent was -0.7 mg/dL  (p=0.031). Data from the literature studies 
consistent ly showed clinically  relevant improvements in renal funct ion, as m easured

events in this severely ill pat ient populat ion. The most commo nly observed adverse reactions 
in terlipressin -treated subjects were abdominal pain and diarrhea (refer to T able of Adverse 
Drug Reactions in the Invest igator ’s Brochure ). Less commo n adverse reactions wit h clinical 
significance that were reported in terlipres sin-treated subjects include: wheezing, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36639], peripheral ischemia manifested as skin necrosis, peripheral co ldness, livedo reticularis 
and Raynaud’ s pheno menon; intest inal ischemia including ischemic co litis; myocardial 
ischemia including my ocardial infarct ion. The safety  characterist ics of terlipressin in the 
2studi es were consistent with its vasoconstrictor mechanism o f action. None of the events 
leading to discontinuation of terlipressin in eit her study  were fatal  and all resolved afterwa rds.

The safet y characteristics of terlipressin observed in the 3randomized, controlled trials 
isconsistent wi th the established safet y profile of t erlipressin fro m [ADDRESS_36578] -marketing data from the World Heal th

inthe clinical studi es co mpared to the publish ed data.

In general, terlipressin has a well- established safety pro file in the treatment of pat ients with 
HRS T ype1. The safet y risks are predictable and recognizable. The adverse drug reactions 
can be readily managed and reversed by [CONTACT_36695] [INVESTIGATOR_307]-care settings.
5.4 Study Rationale
The purpose of this rando mized, placebo -controll ed study  is to confirm the efficacy and safety 
of terlipressin in the treatment of subjects with HRS T ype 1 to provi de data to support 
regul atory  approval  of the New Drug Application ( NDA ). Efficacy will be assessed through 
the primary  endpoint of verified HRS reversal ; other important efficacy parameters will be 
assessed including short -term durabilit y of verified HRS reversal, magnitude of SCr lowering 
effect and effects in important subgroups (eg, systemic inflammatory  response syndrome 
[SIRS] subgroup). Safet y data will be collected and incorporated into the overall safet y 
assessment of terlipressin. Methodol ogical obstacles encountered in the REVERSE trial that 
reduced i ts abilit y to show stati stical significance on the primary  endpoint have been 
addres sed in this trial design.
5.4.[ADDRESS_36580] 1 SCr m easurement of no m ore than 1.5mg/dL, has been 
used for decades to determine treatment response in published HRS clinical studies and is 
thestandard endpoint uti lized in the literature and in HRS treatment guidelines ( Arro yoet al,
1996; Salerno et al, 2007; Angeli et al, 2015). The reversal of HRS Type 1 represents 
adramatic clinical response to treatment: for the endpo int to be achieved, the rapid 
progression of renal failure must be arrested and normal renal funct ion restored. The purpose 
of the primary  end point of “verified” HRS reversal is to verify that the first SCr value of no 
more than 1.5 m g/dL is not a spurious laboratory value
.An addit ional element of the primary 
endpo int requi rement ,ie,alive wit hout RRT,has been added to demonstrate the short term 
durabilit y ofthe primary end poin t on clinical outcomes. RRT is defined as any procedure to 
replace non -endocrine ki dney funct ion and includes intermittent hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, 
continuous hemo filtrat ion and hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and other dialysis and 
filtrat ion tech niques.

Administration
The dosing regimen for the current study  (see Secti on10.3) will be the same as that used in 
OT-0401 and REVERSE. In OT -0401 and REVERSE, over 70% of subjects had no dose 
increase from the starting dose of 1 mg q6h and the majorit y of subjects who achieved HRS 
reversal responded at the 1 mg dose of terlipressin. Similarly , in the T AHRS study , 
themajorit y of subjects who achieved HRS reversa lresponded at the 1 mg every  4 hours 
(q4h) dose of terlipressin and all subjects who received a starting dose of 0.5 mg (q4h)
(3mg/day) had a dose increase to at least 1 mg q4h (6 mg/day). No clear dose response 
wasevident from an examinat ion of the lit erature, wi th doses of terlipressin in 44 published 
studi es in HRS Type 1 ranging from 1 to 12 mg/day . Most studi es all owed f or dose increases 
after several days if no significant SCr decrease from baseline was observed. 
As per standard medical pract ice, concomitant use of albumin in both treatment arms 
isstrongly  recommended, if clinically appropriate 
(Arroy oet al, 1996; Salerno et al, 2007;
Angeli et al,
2015).

The thresho ld for upper cut -off of SCr in entry  criteria is derived fro m the resul ts of previ ous 
NDA  studi es. In OT -0401, none of the subject swith a baseline SCr l evel greater than
7.0mg/dL achieved HRS reversal. Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_36674] ( less than
3.4mg/dL  or at least3.4mg/dL).
Qualifying SCr is a prognostic factor for survival and HRS reversal. Excluding subjects with 
abaseline SCr of greater than 7mg/dL  and L VP at least 4 L within 2 days pri or to 
rando mizat ion (both areexclusion criteria for this study), 3.4 mg/dL  (N= 253) was the 
median baseline SCr of subjects enro lled in the OT -0401 and REVERSE studies co mbined.
Subjects will also be stratified by [CONTACT_094]-enrollment LVP (at least one singl e event of at least4 L 
orless than 4 Lwithin 3 to 14days prior to randomizat ion).Note, subjects with a L VP o f at 
least 4L areexcluded if it occurs within 2 days prior to randomization ( refer to Secti on8.4).
As per the literature, a paracentesis was considered a L VP if at least4L of fluid was 
withdrawn in a given procedure (Choi et al, 2005; Kao et al, 1985; Ginès et al, 1987 ;Pi[INVESTIGATOR_36641], 1988; Titoetal,1990) . In REVERSE, there were significant ly more placebo subjects who 
had at least 1 L VP (at least4 L in a single pr ocedure) within 14 days prior to enrollment 
(54[54.5%] placebo subjects vs 36 [37.1%] terlipressin subjects, p =0.0143) (prior LVP data 
were not collected in OT -0401). Subjects with a history  of pri
or LVP exhibited an almost 
3-fold greater verified HRS reversal rate wi th placebo com pared to pl acebo -treated subjects 
without a history  of pri
or LVP (18.5% vs 6.7%). The baseline imbalance increased the overall 
placebo response rate, contribut ing to the lower observed treatment effect.
The invest igator must review any paracentesis perform ed in the pre -enrollment period 
andvolume status after paracentesis must be considered carefully ; as per standard of care, 
adequate replacement of fluid remo ved wi th albumin is required.

Judicious, short term use of tem porary  diureti c therapy  as per standard of care may  be 
undertaken at the discret ion of the investigator in some subjects in whom a response to 
diuretic therapy  is expected. If fluid overload requiring intervent ion persists after these init ial

13.3 Detail of Baseline Assessments and Procedures
13.3.1 Physical Exam ination
A complete physical exam ination,including weight and height, will be conducted at baseline
and at the 30- day follow-up. This will  include a general  physical assessment of the major 
body  systems evaluat ing any new clinically significant abnormalit ies wi thin the foll owing: 
general appeara nce, skin, head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, neck, heart, lungs, abdo men, extremit ies, 
neuro logical, back/spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] , and lymph nodes. This includes worsening o f baseline condit ions.
In addit ion, abbreviated physical examinat ions will be conducted every  day during t he [ADDRESS_36631] by  
[CONTACT_36707] (generally within 15 to 30 minutes). 
Forsuspected cardiac ischemia, ex aminat ion should include assessment of vital signs, cardiac 
and pulmo nary auscul tation, and evaluat ion of jugul ar venous pressure by [CONTACT_36708]'s clinical judgment. For 
suspected cardiac ischemi a, site must perform  an ECG and cardiac enzymes (high sensit ivity 
troponin) at the time of assessment and 3hours l ater.Subjects with suspected intestinal 
ischemia should undergo careful examinat ion of the abdo men to evaluate for the presence of 
diffuse o r focal tenderness, rebound, or acute abdomen with diffuse rigidit y. For suspected 
intestinal ischemia, venous (blood) lactate levels must be drawn and co mpared to baseline 
levels. Further invest igations should be carried out based on clinical pract ice. All subjects 
shoul d have evaluat ion of the skin o f the trunk and extremit ies for m ottling, cyanosis, 
blanching or pallor .
Clinically relevant abnormalit ies found upon physical examinat ion will be reported 
andanalyzed as AEs.

13.3.5 Assessment of Multi -Organ Dysfunction
With the advancement in intensive care medicine, mult iorgan dysf unction syndrome (MODS) 
has repl aced the term  multio rgan failure since the complet ion of the REVERSE study . 
According to Al-Khafaji et al, 2015, MODS describes a continuum wit h incremental degrees 
of physio logic d erangements in individual organs; a process rather than a single event. 
Alteration in organ funct ion can vary widely fro m a mild degree of organ dysfunct ion 
tocompletely irreversible organ failure.
Multi-organ failure or dysfunction ,a hallmark of acute o n chronic liver failure (ACLF), 
commo n in the study  patient popul ation, is defined and quant ified by [CONTACT_36709] -SOFA 
score or its simplified versio n Chronic Liver Failure Consortium ( CLIF -
C)Organ Fa ilure 
score ( Arroyo et al, 2015). The scoring system has been developed and validated 
forpredi cting mortalit y in pat ients with 
ACLF (Jalan et al, 2014 ).

During baseline information co llection and adverse event reporting, the invest igators 
arerequi red to record the actual  organs invo lved in MODS ( ie, other organs invo lved 
inMODS in addit ion to the baseline hepatic and renal dysfunct ion, and the severit y 
ofdysfunct ion in each organ involved),as well as MODS ,itself, as a disease state. The use of

Study  drug causalit y will be assessed as fo llows:
Unrelated: An AE that is clearly  and incontrovertibly  due to extraneous causes 
(disease, environment, etc) and does not meet the criteria for ‘possible’  or ‘probable.’
Possible: The connect ion between the AE and study  treatm ent appears unlikely , but cannot 
beruled out wi th certa inty. An AE may be considered ‘possibly related’  if it has at l east 
2ofthe following:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study  drug.
It may readily have been produced by  [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or by  [CONTACT_36711] .
It follows a known response pattern to study  drug.
Probable: An AE that is considered to be related to study drug treatm ent with a high degree 
of certaint y. An AE may be considered probably related if:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study  drug.
It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_36712]'s 
clinical state.
It follows a known pattern of response to study  drug treatm ent.
It reappears upon rechallenge .

Criterion for SC RDoubling Over a 2-WeekPeriod
The no mogram  is intended for use in situations when the SCr value has increased rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36670] a shorter period of time but has not y et doubled wi thin 2 weeks.
To fulfill inclusio n criterion 
#4, subjects m ust ha ve a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36671] a SCr at least2.25 mg/dL  (meeting a trajectory for SCr to double over 2weeks).
Thequalifying serum creat inine for subjects on 
prior vasopressors will be taken after 
completion of vasopressor washout.
For ease of calculat ion, these trajectories are est imated by  [CONTACT_36730] a certain required “fo ld 
increase in SCr” to the elapsed time in days between 2measured values (see Figure 3
andTable21–1); greater proportional increases in SCr are required for observat ions of shorter 
durati on. As noted in the no mogram , a 1.[ADDRESS_36696] be

progressively rises fro m 4 days of observat ion up to a 2 fold increase by  14 days observati on.

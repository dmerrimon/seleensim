SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy  and Safety of Bemnifosbuvir  in High -Risk Outpatients with COVID -19 
Protocol Number:  AT-03A-017 
Clinical Phase:  3 
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of bemnifosbuvir  (BEM ) compared with placebo  in 
reducing all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419766] -cause death  in COVID -19 outpatients 
receiving only supportive care . 
Secondary  
Objectives:  To evaluate the efficacy of BEM compared with placebo  on: 
• COVID -19 related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419766] -cause death through Day 29  
• All-cause death through Day 29 and Day 60  
• COVID -19-related complications ( eg, death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
radiologically confirmed pneumonia, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], sepsis, 
coagulopathy, pericarditis/myocarditis, cardiac failure)  through 
Day 29 
• COVID -19-related medically attended visit s (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
emergency room  (ER)  visit, urgent care visit, physician’s office visit, 
or telemedicine visit) or all -cause death through D ay 29  and Day 60  
• COVID -19 symptom relapse  
To evaluate the antiviral activity of BEM compared with placebo on  viral load 
rebound  
To evaluate the safety of BEM  compared with placebo  
Exploratory 
Objectives:  To evaluate the efficacy of BEM  compared with placebo  on: 
• Alleviation or improvement of individual COVID -19 symptoms  
• Return to usual (pre -COVID -19) health  
• Requirement for post -randomization rescue therapy  
• The antiviral activity of BEM  compared with placebo  
To assess plasma concentrations of AT -511 (free base form of AT -527 [BEM]) 
and its metabolites   
Study Design:  • Randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  
• BEM  or matching placebo will be administered twice daily (BID) for 5  days 
(10 doses)  
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 7 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
• Locally available standard of care ( SOC ) treatment  should be initiated in 
parallel in addition to study drug (add -on). SOC treatment s with direct 
antiviral activity against SARS -CoV -2 are allowed but should be in itiated 
during screening and/or within 24 ho urs prior to or after randomization .  
• Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (active:placebo) to one of the following 
arms:  
− 550 mg BEM (2 x 275 -mg tablets) BID  for 5 days  
− Placebo (2 tablets) BID  for 5 days  
Note: Each dose consists of 2 tablets.  On each dosing day , 2 tabl ets will be 
taken for the morning dose and 2 tablets will be taken for the evening  dose. 
The total treatment course consists  of 10 doses over 5 days  (20 tablets 
total) .  
• Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (North America, 
Europe, Asia, and rest of world [ROW]) , age ( < 65 years old v s ≥ 65 years  
old) and by [CONTACT_878200]. The type of SOC received will be 
used to classify subjects into two categories:  
a. Com bination  antiviral stratum (subsequently referred to as the 
combination antiviral population) : In addition to study drug, the 
subject will be initiated on a local SOC regimen which includes  a 
treatment with direct SARS -CoV -2 antiviral activ ity. Examples 
include  nirmatrelvir/ritonavir , molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], mon oclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) . 
b. Supportive -care-only stratum (subsequently referred to as the 
supportive -care-only population) : the SOC regimen the subject will 
receive does not include any treatment with direct SARS -CoV -2 
antiviral activity.  
 
Note: Although randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_878201] -[ADDRESS_1226896] antiviral effects ( ie, corticosteroids).  
Note: Patients who require SOC treatment with a non-compatible antiviral 
treatment, defined as those with a potential drug -drug  interaction (DDI)  
with BEM  (eg, remdesivir) , are excluded.  
Note:  As ritonavir is a major P -gp inhibitor, s ubjects enrolled in the 
combination antiviral group who are taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should 
not take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir until at least 2 hours after taking study 
drug

The primary efficacy  endpoint will also be assessed in the combination antiviral 
population  as a secondary endpoint. All secondary  endpoints 
will be assessed in both the supportive -care-only population, and the 
combination antiviral population  
Statistical Methods:  The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted using the modified intent -to-treat-
S (mITT -S) population, which is defined as all randomized subjects who received 
≥ [ADDRESS_1226904] ≥ 1 positive SARS -CoV -2 result through Day 5 
(from nasopharyngeal [NP] swab samples ), and who are stratified into the  
supportive -care-only population .  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BEM  
based on the proportion of patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878137] 29 in the supportive -care-only population . This 
proportion of patients will be compared between the BEM  and placebo arms using 
a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for the  stratification factors  of 
age and region . The CMH p -value and estimated common risk difference, odds 
ratio and relative risk, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for these estimates,  will be presented.  
The primary estimand will be the difference in the proportion of all -cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138628] -cause mortality  between BEM -treated and placebo -treated 
subjects, regardless of adherence to study drug and subsequent interventions, in 
non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -[ADDRESS_1226905] its 
interpretation. For the intercu rrent events of rescue  (eg intervention with 
remdesivir) and concomitant COVID -19 medications, a treatment policy approach 
will be taken, whereby [CONTACT_878203], 
and observations collected after they are administe red to the patient will be used. 
In addition, patients will be followed, assessed, and analyzed irrespective of their

completion of the course of the study treatment. The analysis will be performed 
based on observed data, and the following measures will be  used to reduce 
missing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death data : electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ) 
capturing clinical information that may be indicative of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878138], and study staff may 
use a public information source to obtain information about survival status if a 
patient withdraws from the study.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will also be assessed in the combination antiviral

analyzed using methods similar to those specified for the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  Data handling, analysis populations, and specification of statistical 
testing for secondary efficacy endpoints, with methods used to control overall type  
I error, will be detailed in the SAP. Statistical analyses of exploratory efficacy 
endpoints, and any exploratory subgroup analyses will be detailed in the SAP  
An interim futility analysis and an interim efficacy/futility  analysis  are planned  
after 30% an d 65% of subjects in the supportive -care-only population  respectively  
are enrolled and have completed the  follow -up period (Day 29) . Testing will 
employ alpha spending and non -binding beta spending, both according to Lan -
Demets approximation of O’Brien Fleming method.  
The study is powered to detect a true 60% reduction in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138628] -
cause mortality rate with BEM as compared to placebo.  With 2100 evaluable 
supportive -care-only subjects  and interim analys es at 30% and 65%, there is 90% 
power if the true rate in the placebo arm is 4% (corresponding to an absolute 
difference of 2.4% in rate) and at least 80% power if the true rate in the placebo 
arm is 3% (corresponding to an absolute differen ce of 1.8%).  Sample size was 
calculated using SAS (version 9.4) for a [ADDRESS_1226906]. 
Considering a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses  and O’Brien -
Fleming spending for bot h alpha (0.025) and beta  (0.1) , the total sample size was 
inflated by a multiplier of 1.055 to arrive at a target sample size of 2100 subjec ts 
in the supportive -care-only population.   Assuming ~95% of randomized subjects  
in the supportive -care-only population  will meet the  criteria for inclusion in the  
mITT -S population , the study targets total enrollment o f 2210  subjects in the 
supportive -care-only population . Planned enrollment in the combination antiviral 
arm will be  up to 300 subjects . Therefore, the total planned sample size will b e 
2510 subjects.  
Treatment comparisons and summaries for frequency/proportion secondary 
endpoints will be similar to those specified for the primary endpoint. Specification 
of statistical testing for secondary endpoints, with methods used to control overal l 
type I error, will be specified in the SAP. 
Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods for 
estimation and log -rank test for treatment comparison.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background on COVID -19 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive -sense, single -stranded RNA viruses, named for the crown -like 
appearance of their spi[INVESTIGATOR_249103]. They are a family of viruses that 
cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe disea ses such as Middle East 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (MERS) and Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (SARS). An epi[INVESTIGATOR_878145], the 
largest metropolitan area in China’s Hubei province,  and was reported to the World Health 
Organization ( WHO ) Country Office in China on 31 -Dec-2019. This coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) is caused by a novel coronavirus strain called SARS coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV -2). 
The WHO subsequently declared a pandem ic on 11 -Mar-2020. As of May 20, 2022, over 
526 million cases of COVID -19 were reported worldwide, with over 6 million deaths ; as of 07 
June 2023 , over 76 7 million cases were reported worldwide with over 6.9 million deaths  
(WHO  Dashboard ).   
Infection with  SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226910] infection to severe life -threatening sepsis and 
multiorgan failure ( Wiersinga et al. 2020 ). Commonly reported symptoms include fever, cough, 
shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, and 
gastrointestinal disturbance. Symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_878146] [ADDRESS_1226911] -acute COVID -19 syndrome, also called Long COVID ( NIHR 2020 ). 
COVID -19 affects people of all age; however, people who are elderly or have certain underlying 
medical conditions ( eg obesity, diabetes, ch ronic heart, lung and kidney disease, and cancer; and 
the immunocompromised ) are at increased risk of mortality and poor outcomes  
(Carfi et al. 2020 ; CDC 202 2; ) and therefore have the greatest unmet need.  
Prevention and control of the disease have focused on public health measures to slow 
transmission, such as social distancing, the use of face masks, national or regional lockdowns, 
and vaccination. The first of several effective COVID -19 vaccines was autho rized in December 
2020. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_878147] -national vaccination campaigns, as of July 2022, 63% of the 
global population  have been fully vaccinated with rates < 40% in many  low-income countries ; as 
of March  2023, 67% of the global population  have been fully vaccinated  with vaccination rates 
in low -income countries still <40%  ([LOCATION_001] Times Vaccination Tracker ). Furthermore, the 
durability of response after vaccination is not well understood, and there are  known   
breakthrough infections, including among fully vaccinated individuals, partly driven by [CONTACT_878204] -CoV -2 variants ( Hacisuleyman et al. 2021 ). COVID -[ADDRESS_1226912] a contraindication to vaccinati on, or 
refuse to be vaccinated.  
Although access  and approvals  vary by [CONTACT_11338], there are a number of therapeutic treatment 
options for non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -19 patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high 
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 22 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
risk of disease progression. Depen ding on  the country , Emergency Use Authorization  (EUA ) or 
approvals may be  available  for some of these options, including nirmatrelvir /ritonavir , 
remdesivir , and molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]. However, there are limitations with all of these compounds, 
highlighting the need for t he continued development of additional novel therapeutics to add to 
the COVID -19 therapeutic arsenal.  
While the efficacy rates for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  are high in high-risk unvaccinated patients 
(86% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death [ Paxlovid . Prescr ibing Information  2023]), the 
nirmatrelvir component of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  requires boosting with ritonavir, resulting in 
significant drug-drug interactions ( DDIs ). As high-risk patients are likely to be on multiple 
concomitant medications, this DDI liability has the potential to significantly limit or at least 
complicate nirmatrelvir/ritonavir ’s use in the very population for which it is indicated. Before 
prescribing ritonav ir-boosted nirmatrelvir, concomitant medications need to be closely reviewed 
and potentially managed to prevent serious or life -threatening drug toxicities. Prescribers need to 
also consider expert consultation, especially for patients receiving highly spe cialized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878148] -dependent toxicities, such as certain anticonvulsant, anticoagulant, 
antiarrhythmic, chemotherapeutic, neuropsychiatric, and immunosuppressant drugs. Cases of 
relapse of symptomatic SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226913] also been  reported ( Charness et al case report 2022 ). As more data are gathered in 
larger populations of patients, it will be important to understand the true incidence and etiology 
of these relapses  in the real -world setting.   In addition, the efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  is 
decreased in high-risk vaccinated patients  (57% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death ) as well as 
standa rd risk patients ( 51% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death ) [[COMPANY_007] press  release 2022 ]). 
Similar high efficacy rates were observed with remdesivir (87% reduction in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death in high -risk unvaccinated patients). However, remdesivir must be 
administered intravenously (IV), making it logistically complicated to treat  large populations of 
outpatients who may not have immediate access to dedicated specialized health care facilities 
with trained health care providers prepared to administer parenteral medications.  
Molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_878149] b ut has lower efficacy than the 
preferred treatment options (30% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death in high-risk unvaccinated 
patients). As a mutagenic ribonucleoside agent, there is a theoretical risk that molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_878150], leading to mutations. 
Molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_878151]. Also, effective contraception must be used during and following 
treatme nt with molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]. In addition, there have been concerns about the potential effects of 
molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_878152] -CoV -2 mutation rates. As a result of the above, its use is restricted to 
only when alternative treatment options are not accessible  or clinicall y appropriate  
(Lagevrio EUA 2022) .    
As the effectiveness of the anti -SARS -CoV -2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878153], the role of each anti -SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226914] immediate

access to dedicated specialized health care facilities with trained health care providers prepared 
to administer parenteral medications and monitor for infusion reactions.   
Additional  well-tolerated, highly efficacious, more convenient oral, non -mutagenic direct -acting 
antivirals  with a low DDI potential are urgently needed in high -risk patients . 
1.2. Background on Bemnifosbuvir  
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527; BEM)  is a unique, [ADDRESS_1226915] a marketing authorization.  In laboratory studies, 
BEM  potently inhibits the RNA -polymerase of several single -stranded RNA viruses. BEM  is 
converte d to its active intracellular triphosphate form (AT -9010) through a series of intermediate 
metabolites . AT-9010 binds to the active sites of both RNA -dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
and nidovirus RdRp -associated nucleotidyl  transferase (NiRAN) domains of non-structural 
protein  12 (nsp12 ), blocking their respective activities and potently inhibiting SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226916] a range of coronaviruses, including SARS -CoV -2 (mean  90% effective concentration  
[EC 90] = 0.5 µM). BEM  maintains potency in vitro  against all tested SARS -CoV -2 variants of 
concern, including Omicron (BA.1 , BA.2 , BA .4, BA.5 and XBB ). 
Prior to COVID -19, clinical development for BEM  was first initiated for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection. Safety and pharmacokinetic ( PK) data (at doses up to 550 mg 
once daily for up to 12 weeks) from two completed studies within the HCV program (AT -01B-
001 and AT -01B-002) su pported the clinical evaluation of BEM  for COVID -19 at the outset of 
the pandemic.  
As part of  an accelerated global clinical development plan in COVID -19, the Phase 2 virology 
study (WV43042 [MOONSONG]) and the Phase 3 study (CV43043 [MORNIN[COMPANY_004]Y]) were 
started in parallel at the end of 2020/beginning of 2021. The CV43043 study was initiated with a 
550 mg twice daily  (BID) dose of BEM , which was predicted to be the effective dose based on 
available in vitro  antiviral activity data, tissue distribution data i n animals, and human PK data 
from healthy subjects and the HCV clinical program. The Phase 2 virology study WV43042 
being conducted in parallel was intended to be supportive of the selected dose in CV43043. The 
initial Phase 3 program objective was to demo nstrate alleviation/improvement of COVID -[ADDRESS_1226917] -risk 
patients (without risk factors). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878154]43043. 
Of note, the CV4304 3 study was terminated due to program and operational decisions but there 
were  no safety concerns at the time of discontinuation.   
Data from the CV43043  study are available . The encouraging  results (described below)  support  
the current Phase 3 study  (AT-03A-017). 
1.2.1.  Summary of Results from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 COVID -19 Studies  
The Phase 3 study (CV43043, MORNIN[COMPANY_004]Y) was a randomized, placebo -controlled study in 
non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878155] -[ADDRESS_1226918] risk for disease progression. The study also allowed vacci nated patients to 
be enrolled. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive 550 mg BEM  or placebo BID for 5  days. 
The primary endpoint was time to alleviation/improvement of COVID -19 symptoms. Secondary

Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
endpoints included hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], all -cause mortality and change in viral load. At the time of 
discontinuation, 216 patients had been randomized (2:1; active:placebo), with [ADDRESS_1226919] outpatient population, 
with 47% who were high risk , 28% who were vaccinated , and 56% who were seropositive at 
baseline. Because the study was prematurely discontinued, no formal statistical comparisons 
were  made and results are presented descriptively. Although the primary endpoint of symptoms 
alleviation  or improvement was not met, a lower proportion of patients required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198627] -19 (secondary endpoint) in the BEM  arm (2.9%; 4/137 patients) compared to the 
placebo arm (10%; 7/70 patients). This represents a 71% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n in patients 
who received BEM . This clinical observation favoring the BEM  arm was consistent for the 
clinical outcome secondary efficacy endpoints, including COVID -19 related medically attended 
visits (10.2% vs 14.3% ; BEM vs placebo ), COVID -19 related com plications (4.4% vs 10.0%) 
and post -treatment infections (9.5% vs 14.3%). There were no deaths in the study. There was no 
meaningful difference in the change from baseline in viral load between the BEM  arm and the 
placebo arm. In addition, the safety and t olerability of the 550 mg BID dose was generally 
comparable to placebo. There were no drug -related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported, and 
proportions of patients with adverse events (AEs) leading to study drug discontinuation were low 
(2.8% in the BEM  arm vs 7.0% in the placebo arm). Overall, gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were 
11.3% in the BEM  arm vs. 9.9% in the placebo arm. There were more drug -related GI AEs 
(nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/pain) in the BEM  arm (9.2%) compared to placebo 
(1.4%), but all were low grade (mild/moderate) and none resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
There was no reported vomiting in the BEM  arm.   
Although CV43043 was prematurely discontinued and did not meet the primary endpoint of 
symptom alleviation, the positive  signal observed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/deaths is the most clinically 
important and relevant finding to support the Phase 3 AT-03A-017 study. Considering the 71% 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878156] a broad patient population that included 
vaccinated and standard risk patients, this outcome compares favorably to the rates reported in 
Phase [ADDRESS_1226920] acting antivirals. These other studies enrolled mainly high 
risk, unvaccinated patients (molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_878157] a 30% risk reduct ion; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  with a 
86% risk reduction  [Paxlovid . Prescribing Information  2023, Lagevrio EUA 2022 ]). Efficacy 
with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  was lower in high-risk vaccinated patients (57% risk reduction ) and 
standard risk patients (51% risk reduction) [ [COMPANY_007] press release  2022 ].  Although selected as the 
primary endpoint for the CV43043 study, symptom -based endpoints for COVID -[ADDRESS_1226921] 
been well documented in studies with re mdesivir, a  [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration 
(US FDA )-approved intravenously administered nucleoside analogue. In the Phase 2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_878158], an 87% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death was observed in high -risk outpatients receiving 
remdesivir wit h no impact on viral load ( Gottlieb et al 2022 )

In addition to CV43043, two Phase [ADDRESS_1226922] been conducted, one in an outpatient 
population (WV43042, MOONSONG) and one in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878159] -19 (AT -03A-001).   
WV43042 was a Phase [ADDRESS_1226923] risk. The doses evaluated were 550 mg BID and 
1100 mg BID for 5 days. The study did not meet its primary virology endpoint of reduction i n 
the amount of SARS -CoV -2 virus RNA by [CONTACT_424251] (RT-
PCR ) in the full study population which included a heterogeneous group of low -risk patients who 
were vaccinated or seropositive at baseline, similar to the CV43043 study population. 
Nevertheless, there were positive virology trends observed in exploratory subgroups of patients 
at high risk (SARS -CoV -2 virus RNA reductions by [CONTACT_937] -PCR of ~0.5 log 10 at Day 7 with BEM  
[550 mg BID and 1100 mg BID] compared to placebo). The  differences in viral load decline in 
the high -risk cohort were also observed in the infectious virus titer assay. The safety and 
tolerability of the 550 mg BID dose of BEM  was generally comparable to placebo. However, 
mild to moderate nausea or vomiting l ed to study drug discontinuation in 16.7% of patients (5 of 
30 patients) in the 1100 mg BID arm compared to 0% in the 550 mg BID arm and 2.5% of 
patients (1 of 40 patients) in the placebo arm.  
AT-03A-[ADDRESS_1226924] of care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -19 patients had adapted making continued enrollment 
in a placebo -controlled trial no longer f easible  in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203725] . Only 2 subjects had 
been enrolled in Part B and both received placebo. Although low background disease -
progression rates precluded achievement of the primary clinical endpoint (protocol -defined 
progressive respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448]), there were numerical trends which directionally favored 
the BEM  550 mg BID arm. In Part A, the rates of progressive respi[INVESTIGATOR_878160] 
7.3% with BEM  550 mg BID (3 of 41 subjects) compared to 10% on placebo (4 of 40 subjects). 
In addition, the rates of all -cause mortality were 0% with BEM  550 mg BID (0 of 41 subjects) 
compared to 5% on placebo (2 of 40 subjects). In Part B, a third death occurred in a subject 
receiving placebo. For the virology endpoints, there were encouraging an d consistent trends, 
similar to those observed in the high -risk subset in the Phase 2 outpatient study. At Day 2, 
patients receiving BEM  550 mg BID experienced a 0.6 log 10 greater mean reduction from 
baseline viral load as compared to placebo, and a sustai ned difference in viral load reduction was 
maintained through Day 8. The safety and tolerability of the 550 mg BID dose of BEM  was 
generally comparable to placebo.

1.2.2.  Supportive Results from Clinical Pharmacology and Non -Clinical Studies  
Supporting data from a bronchoalveolar lavage  (BAL)  study in healthy subjects (AT -03A-007) 
provided confidence that BEM  is being efficiently delivered to the lungs (epi[INVESTIGATOR_71444]), 
the primary site of SARS -CoV -2 infection. In this study, it was confirmed that me an levels of 
BEM  above the EC 90 are achieved in the lungs at 4 hours after dosing with BEM  550 mg BID, 
with levels of AT -273 that approximate the EC 90 at 12 hours.  
Additionally, the clinical pharmacology of BEM  has been investigated in multiple dedicated 
Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies. The DDI studies conducted confirm BEM ’s minimal 
potential for drug interactions. At doses higher than 550 mg BID, including 825 mg BID and 
1100 mg BID, mild to moderate GI -related AEs, specifically nausea and vomiting, and 
abdominal pain were  more frequently reported in healthy subjects (consistent with data from the 
1100 mg BID arm of the Phase 2 WV43042 study).   
In support of the clinical program, the nonclinical safety profile of BEM was assessed in a 
comprehensive non -clinical safety program consistent with the requirements set out in the 
International Conference on Harmonisation  (ICH) M3 (R2) guideline and the ICHM3(R2) Q&A 
(R2) document (ICH 2009 ; ICH 2012 ). The intended clinical  route of administration ( ie oral 
administration) was used. Rats and monkeys were the selected species for the toxicology and 
safety pharmacology studies. Both species, as well as the rabbit used in reproductive toxicity 
studies, convert the prodrug to the  active metabolite similarly to humans. Additionally, all 
metabolites observed in humans were also observed in the preclinical species. BEM  is non -
mutagenic, has no effect on reproductive performance and is non -teratogenic.  
Additional d etails can be found in the BEM  Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3. Rationale for the Dose Selection  
The dose regimen selected for the  current  Phase 3 study is 550 mg  (2 x275 mg  tablets ) BID for 5 
days, as this dose has shown clinical benefit in CV43043 . This dose and duration were well  
tolerated and resulted in a 71% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878161] [ADDRESS_1226925] risk and vaccinated 
patients. Available PK data from this study showed a mean trough of  149.8 ng/mL, right at the 
targeted 150 ng/mL (based on in vitro  EC 90).   
Conceptually, higher doses are expected to achieve higher drug exposure and therefore better 
clinical outcomes. For BEM , doses beyond 550 mg BID were evaluated in healthy subjects an d 
patients with COVID -19. While, as expected, these studies demonstrated higher AT -273 trough 
levels of approximately 200 ng/mL with 825 mg BID and 1100 mg BID, these doses were also 
associated with increased incidences of GI related AEs including vomiting that were not 
observed in patients with the 550 mg BID regimen. A large phase 1 study (AT -03A-015) was 
conducted to further investigate the GI AEs for the 825 mg BID regimen. GI AEs including 
vomiting, while occurring at a lower rate co mpared with the 1100 mg BID dose (AT -03A-002 
cohorts 4 and 5, WV43042 Part B), were still present  relative to 
placebo regardless of meal status.  
The 550 mg BID dose was also the initial dose regimen selected for the COVID -19 program 
based on in vitro  data, tissue distribution data in non -human primates, and modeling data from

the completed studies in the HCV program. The 550 mg BID regimen was predicted, using 
plasma AT -273 as a surrogate, to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_878162] a mean  intracellular level of the 
active triphosphate metabolite AT -9010 above the in vitro  EC 90 (0.5 uM or 150  ng/mL of AT -
273 eq.) of the drug in inhibiting SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226926] epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HAE) 
cells.  
Preliminary PK results from the BAL  study (AT -03A-007) in healthy subjects demonstrated that 
antiviral concentrations of AT -273 with the 550 mg BID regimen of BEM  were achieved in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_878163], the primary target of the SARS -CoV -2 virus.  
Cumulative PK results fr om studies in healthy subjects (AT -03A-002) and patients with 
COVID -19 (AT -03A-001 and WV43042 Part A) have subsequently confirmed that mean plasma 
concentrations of AT -273 exceeded shortly after dose initiation and maintained mostly above the 
target of 15 0 ng/mL during the dosing period of [ADDRESS_1226927] risk factor for severe COVID -19 outcomes. As of May 2023 , 
75% of deaths in the  US ( >970,000 deaths) occurred in patients  ≥65 years of age  
(CDC Demographic Trends 202 3). A consistent trend was observed with BEM  in the CV43043  
study , in that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878164] .  In the control arm, the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878165]  > 40 years old was 15.4% , compared to 3.2% for those 
≤ 40 years. Further , there was an 82% reduction in risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878166] ≥[ADDRESS_1226928] 
concurrent comorbid conditions. The Phase 3 populati on for this study will include older patients 
(≥ 70 years  or ≥ 55 years with one risk factor  or 50  to 54  years with two risk factors ) or those 
≥ 18 years with other comorbidities (immunocompromised, Down syndrome, sickle cell disease, 
dementia, Parkinson’s disease, or care home residents), regardless of vaccination status. This 
represents a population of high -risk patients who are in most need of effective COVID -19 
treatment options and also are at increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death. Eligibi lity criteria are 
generally consistent with the priority list of patients who are at the highest risk of clinical 
progression according to the NIH COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines as well as those listed by [CONTACT_30222] ( NIH 202 3, CDC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878167] 2023 ).  Studying this enriched high -

risk population is necessary given the relatively low hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death rate with the  current  
circulating variants.  
Enrollment of 24 high -risk adolescents (≥ 12 years to 17 years) will be allowed after the planne d 
interim analysis for which 65% of the supportive -care-only stratum completed the follow -up 
period (Day 29). A DSMB recommendation that the study continue at this interim analysis point 
will trigger enrollment of adolescents.  Similar safety and PK charac teristics are expected for 
adolescents compared with adults.  
 
1.5. Rationale for Study Design and Allowance of Standard of Care  
With the rising COVID -19 cases due to the Omicron  variant , more COVID -19 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878168], either as monotherapy or potentially as combination therapy , if resistance and relapse 
become an issue with current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In the targeted Phase 3 patient population of high -risk 
patients, SOC for COVID -19 gr eatly varies globally. While access to antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878169], their use or access may be limited in other countries. Patients 
enrolled in the trial will be stratified by [CONTACT_878205]: those receiving antivirals  in addition to study drug  (referred to as the 
“combination  antiviral stratum ”) and those receiving supportive -care-only (no treatments  with 
activity against SARS -CoV -2 except study drug, referred to as the “ supportive -care-only 
stratum ”). Functionally, this will result in two distinct populations, one which will allow 
assessment of BEM  as a monotherapy and another that will allow assessment of BEM  in 
combination with other compatible antivirals. It is estimat ed that the supportive -care-only 
population will comprise > 8 8% of the patients enrolled in this global trial. Thus, the primary 
endpoint, proportion of subjects in the supportive -care-only population who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878170] a ny cause through Day 29, would support a BEM monotherapy 
indication in this population.  
While the primary objective of the study is to demonstrate efficacy in the supportive -care-only 
stratum  (BEM  monotherapy), the “ combination  antiviral stratum ” could result in valuable 
supporting data on the efficacy, antiviral activity, and safety of BEM  used in combination with 
other antiviral drugs. With an expected ~1 2% of the patients expected to enroll in this strat um, 
these data collected in parallel cou ld provide the necessary proof -of-concept, hypothesis -
generating data to support further evaluations of direct -acting antiviral  combination therapy in 
the targeted population. Considering the speed with which novel SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226929] whether currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878171], the study design proactively 
allows the evaluation of combination therapy  
 
 
  
This study was designed based on the clinical landscape of COVID -19; no patient groups were 
consulted in the design of this study.

1.6. Rationale for Primary Endpoint  
Rates of h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death remain the most clinically important a nd objective endpoints for 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1226930] -acting antiviral is to reduce the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878172] i nhibition of SARS -CoV -2 viral replication at the 
primary site of infection, presumably, the lung. Viral load reduction in nasopharyngeal  (NP)  
swab by [CONTACT_878206] ( RT-qPCR ) is commonly 
regarded as a measure o f clinical antiviral activity, which is thought to translate into the 
aforementioned clinical benefits. While this concept has been successful in some cases including 
the protease inhibitors nirmatrelvir /ritonavir  and ensitrelvir , it has not been the case for the 
nucleotide drug remdesivir. In non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19, remdesivir was able to 
reduce the risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377304] 87% while showing no difference in viral load 
reduction compared with placebo ( Gottlieb et al., 2022 ). Wh ile the reason for the discordance 
between clinical antiviral activity measured in NP  swab  and clinical efficacy/benefits remains to 
be elucidated, it raises the question on the reliability of using changes in NP  swab  viral load as a 
measure of clinical antiviral activity during clinical development of a nucleotide antiviral for 
SARS -CoV -2. Furthermore, the US FDA  Guidance for Industry COVID -19: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_878173] (February 2021 ) acknowledges the lack of 
established predictive relationship between the magnitude and timing of viral load reductions and 
the extent of clinical benefit.  
The clinical development of BEM  for COVID -19, a nucleotide analog belonging to the same 
class as remdesivir, has largely been focused on demonstrating NP  swab  viral load reduction. 
However, virology results have been variable. In the AT -03A-001 phase 2 study in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878174] -19 and risk factors for poor outcomes, BEM 550 mg BID x 
5 days rapi[INVESTIGATOR_878175] -CoV -2 viral load with a 0.6 log 10 greater mean reduction from 
baseline as compared to placebo on day 2. A difference in viral load reduction was maintained 
through Day 8. In the WV43042 phase 2 study in non -hospit alized patients with mild or 
moderate COVID -19, in the general population overall, BEM  550 mg BID and 1100 mg BID x 
5 days did not achieve a statistically significant difference in NP  swab  viral load reduction from 
baseline as compared with placebo, althou gh subgroup analyses showed a numerically larger 
viral load reduction in BEM  treated patients with risk factors compared with placebo. Recent 
data from the prematurely discontinued CV43043 study in patients with mild or moderate 
COVID -19 seemed partially i n agreement with WV43042 in that, in the overall population, BEM  
550 BID did not show any difference in NP  swab  viral load reduction from baseline as compared 
with placebo. Unlike WV43042, CV43043 did not achieve numerically better viral response in 
patien ts with risk factors either. Importantly, BEM  550 mg BID x 5 days substantially reduced 
the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88078] 71% as compared with placebo, in patients without or with risk 
factors. These analyses support further clinical evaluation of the efficac y of BEM  in reducing the 
rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878176] -19 with virologic responses as 
secondary/supportive endpoints.  
The primary endpoint will be assessed in the supportive -care-only population as the clinical 
efficacy of BEM  can only be evaluated in this population without the interference of the 
potential clinical benefit provided by [CONTACT_878207]. The 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death endpoint is proposed based on US FDA and other international health 
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 30 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
authorities ’ recommendations and it is most appropriate for a high -risk population such as the 
one included in this study. It has been the basis for evidence for other authorized and approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878177]. As cases continue to rise very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_4782] a  result of the current 
Omicron surge, it remains the most clinically important endpoint for patients, overburdened 
health care infrastructure, and public health.   
1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Overall, BEM  was well tolerated across the entire development program. At [ADDRESS_1226931] a low DDI potential. At dose levels ≥825 mg BID, an increase in 
GI-related AEs (mostly nausea and vomiting) was observed, which were mild to moderate in 
severity. GI AEs were more frequent at the 1100 mg BID dose an d resulted in early treatment 
discontinuation. SAEs  were only reported in the COVID -19 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies  (none in 
Phase 1 hea lthy volunteer studies) , assessed as not related to study treatment, and tended to 
describe progression or complications of COVID -19; SAEs resulting in death have only been 
reported in subjects receiving  placebo. The clinical efficacy data at 550 mg BID from the 
truncated study CV43043 indicate a benefit in reduction of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  (71%) , COVID -[ADDRESS_1226932] on reproductive performance and 
is non -teratogenic.  
Based o n the totality of the data, BEM  at 550 mg BID has demonstrated a favorable benefit -risk 
profile for evaluation in patients with  COVID -19.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. General Study Design  
This Phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  will be conducted in 
non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878178] (≥18 years of age) with mild or moderate COVID -19 (as defined 
in inclu sion criterion 3 , Section  4.2) and risk factors for severe COVID -19 (as defined in 
inclusion criterion 8,  Section  4.2).  
Age and comorbidities  will determine a patient’s risk and eligibility (see  inclusion criterion 8,  
Section  4.2). Onset of COVID -[ADDRESS_1226934] occurred ≤5 days before randomi zation.  
BEM  550 mg or matching placebo will be administered BID for 5 days (10 doses, with each dose 
including 2 tablets).  
Locally available SOC treatment should be initiated in parallel in addition to study drug (add-
on). SOC treatment s with direct antiviral activity against SARS -CoV -2 are allowed, but should 
be initiated during screening and/or within 24 hour s prior to or after randomization.  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (active:placebo) to one of the followi ng arms:  
• 550 mg BEM (2 x 275 -mg tablets) BID  for 5 days  
• Placebo (2 tablets) BID for 5 days  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (North America, Europe, Asia, and rest of 
world [ROW]), age (< 65 years old vs ≥ 65 years old) and by [CONTACT_878208]. The type of SOC 
received will be used to classify subjects into two categories:  
a. Combination  antiviral stratum (subsequently referred to as the combination antiv iral 
population) : In addition to study drug, the subject will be initiated on a local SOC regimen 
which includes a treatment with direct SARS -CoV -2 antiviral activity. Examples include 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir , molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], mAbs,  
b. Supportive -care-only stratum  (subsequently referred to as the supportive -care-only 
population) : the SOC regimen the subject will receive does not include any treatment with 
direct SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226935] antiviral effects ( ie 
corticosteroids).  
Patients who require SOC treatment with a non -compatible a ntiviral treatment, defined as those 
with a potential DDI with BEM  (eg, remdesivir) , are excluded.  
For subjects who deteriorate on -study, any rescue therapy which is SOC for progression to 
severe COVID -19 is permitted.  As noted in Section  5.7.5 , if rescue therapy will be  remdesivir , 
study drug should be discontinued before initiation of remdesivir . 
Approximately 2510  eligible subjects with COVID -19 will be enrolled, with a target  of 
2210  subjects in the supportive -care-only population  and up to 300 subjects in the combination 
antiviral population . The primary study endpoint (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death) will be evaluated in the 
supportive -care-only population.

5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1. Description and Handling of Study Treatments  
5.1.1.  Test Product  
BEM  will be provided by [CONTACT_14547] 275 mg tablets  (designated as formulation A2 -275 mg) . 
5.1.2.  Control Product  
Matching placebo tablets for BEM  will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
5.1.3.  Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will be responsible for ensuring that study drugs (active and placebo) are 
manufactured in accordan ce with applicable Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and 
requirements. The labels for the study drug(s) will meet applicable local regulatory requirements.  
5.1.4.  Storage and Handling  
Study drugs should be stored under the conditions described on the label.  
5.1.5.  Background Standard of Care  
Study drug (BEM  or placebo ) should  be administered as an “add -on” therapy to locally available 
SOC.  Depending on the region, SOC may either include compatible antiviral treatments (such as 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir , molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], mAbs or other COVID -19 drugs with antiviral 
effects) or alternatively be deemed  ‘supportive care only’ (and not include treatment with 
COVID -19 drugs with antiviral effects). Standard of care  is administered at the discretion o f the 
investigator , based on local practice , and includes therap ies or treatments that are locally 
available to the investigator/site . SOC  is not  a study drug and  is therefore not provide d by [CONTACT_429] . However, the type of background SOC that is administered must be documented and 
captured in the electronic case report form (e CRF ).  
Patients who require SOC treatment with a non -compatible antiviral treatment, defined as those 
with a potential DDI with BEM ( eg, remdesivir), are excluded.  
Auxilia ry Medicinal Products  (for EU sites)  
Compatible antiviral treatments  as SOC , such as direct  acting antivirals  and mAbs , are 
considered auxiliary medicinal products  in this study as per EU regulation No 536/2014 Article 2 
(8) and should be used in accordance with the terms of their marketing authorization. 
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  is an example of  an authorized auxiliary medicinal product . Some 
compatible antiviral treatments utilized as SOC in the combination antiviral arm of this trial 
outside of the EU may not be available in the EU ; all antivirals will be administered in 
accordance with their approv ed local usage .

5.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
A unique subject number will be assigned to each subject at screening. Once assigned, it will not 
be reassigned to another subject. Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will then be randomly 
assigned to a treatment group (active vs. placebo) according to a randomization list, generated by 
[CONTACT_878210]. This will be through a centralized randomization 
process and eligible subjects may also receive a unique randomization number linked to a 
treatment assignment.  Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (North America, 
Europ e, Asia, and ROW) , age (< 65 years old vs ≥ 65 years old) and by [CONTACT_878211]  (combination  
antiviral  vs supportive -care-only). The primary stratification factor is t he type of background 
SOC that the investigator plans to administer as this determines whether the subject is in the 
supportive -care only group ( ie may be included in the primary analysis population) or the 
combination antiviral group. Within each of the p rimary strat a, randomization is  further  stratified 
by [CONTACT_1617] (North America, Europe, Asia, and ROW) and age (<65 and ≥65). 
5.3. Blinding  
Study site personnel and subjects will be blinded to treatment assignment during the study. The 
Sponsor and its agents will also be blinded to treatment assignment, with the exception of 
individuals who require access to treatment assignments to fulfill th eir job roles during a clinical 
trial. These roles include clinical supply chain managers, any laboratory responsible for 
performing study drug PK, IxRS service provider, and Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) 
members . 
Unless efficacy is demonstrated at a n interim analysis, t he study blind will not be broken until 
after all subjects complete the primary study period (through  Day 29 ). 
During the study, the blind may be broken for an individual subject by [CONTACT_878212] e of a subject’s treatment group is necessary for further subject 
management. Although not necessary in the case of an emergency, the investigator should 
discuss the specific case with the Sponsor prior to unblinding. The date and reason for breaking 
the b lind must be recorded.  
5.4. Dosing and Administration  
5.4.1.  Dispensing  
Designated site staff will dispense the blinded study drugs (active or placebo) to each subject at 
the Day 1 visit.  
5.4.2.  Administration Instructions  
Study drug dosing should occur on the same day as randomization.  Subjects will self -administer 
BEM  550 mg (2 x 275 mg tablets)  or matching placebo (2 tablets ) orally BID on Days 1 -5. Each 
dose consists of 2 tablets. On each dosing day, 2 tablets will be taken for the morning dose and 2 
tablets will be taken for the evening dose. The total treatment course consists for a total of 
10 doses over 5 days (20 tablets total).  
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 40 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
 
BEM  (or matching placebo) should be taken orally approximately [ADDRESS_1226942] study dose is taken prior to 16:00 on Day 1, the next dose 
should be taken in the evening of the same day ( ie prior to midnight on the same calendar day 
with a minimum of 6 hours between doses). For these subjects, t he final (tenth) dose will be 
taken in the evening of Day 5. However, if the first study dose is taken after 16:00 on Day 1, the 
next dose should be taken in the morning of Day 2. For these subjects, the final (tenth) dose will 
be taken on the morning of D ay 6.  
BEM  (or placebo) tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and should not be 
chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved.  
If a dose of BEM  (or placebo) is missed ( ie, not taken within 6 hours after the scheduled dosing 
time), the subject should resume dosing with the next scheduled dose. Subjects should never 
double the next dose after a missed dose. In this scenario where a dose is missed, the subject 
should still complete the full course of 10 doses , making up for the missed dose  at the end of  the 
dosing  period (as opposed to only taking 9 doses). If a subject vomits after taking a dose, a 
replacement tablet should not be taken, and dosing should resume with the next scheduled dose. 
Subjects will be instructed to bring their bottles of study dru g to each study visit . 
BEM can be taken with or without food.  
5.4.3.  Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will be provided with a dosing diary, to record the times at which they self -administer 
study drug. The dosing diary will be used to assess treatment compliance.   Subjects who have 
difficulty in using the diary (eg, blind, illiterate, physical limitations, unfamiliar with technology) 
can obtain assistance from close contacts ( eg family members or friends)  in recording responses 
but should not obtain advice or help f rom others with constructing responses.  
5.5. Study Drug Accountability  
Complete and accurate records of all study drugs must be kept. These include acknowledgment 
of receipt of each shipment of study product, subject dispensing records , and records of returned 
or destroyed study product.  
At the end of the study, all unused study drugs and containers will be returned to the Sponsor (or 
designee) or destroyed, per the instruction of the Sponsor. Documentation confirming drug 
accountability will be reviewed over th e course of the trial.  
5.6. Premature Treatment or Study Discontinuation  
Subjects may voluntarily discontinue treatment or withdraw from the study at any time. They 
may also be removed from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor at any time.  
The investigator may withdraw a subject at any time if it is determined that continuing the study 
would result in a significant safety risk to the subject.  
Premature treatment or study discontinuation may occur for any of the following reasons:  
• Persistent  noncompliance with the protocol requirements

Subjects who prematurely discontinue study  drug treatment should be encouraged to remain in 
the study and maintain the same protocol schedule and assessments as described in Table  1. This 
will allow for contin ued subject follow -up for key outcome data. Subjects who prematurely

same protocol schedule should complete early termination (ET) assessments at the time of stud y 
discontinuation , as described in  Table  1. Nevertheless, all attempts should be made to contact [CONTACT_878213] 29 (telephone contact [CONTACT_4631])  to confirm key  study endpoints , including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_679513].  
The prima ry study period is through Day [ADDRESS_1226946] . 
5.7. Prior Therapy, Concomitant Therapy, Permitted Therapy, 
Cautionary Therapy, and Prohibited Therapy  
5.7.1.  Prior Therapy  
Restrictions  on prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878185] (Section  4.3). Subjects who  
have used other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to planned  dosing  (except for 
exclusions referenced in exclusion criteri on #5) or initiated any COVID -19 drug with an tiviral 
effects  intended to treat symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection ≥ [ADDRESS_1226947] receive d mAb (s) taken as pre - or post -exposure 
prophylaxis  (including if received ≥ 24 hours prior to randomization ) will be allowed into the 
study b ut they will be considered  as part of the combination  antiviral cohort . 
In addition, hydroxychloroquine or amiodarone within [ADDRESS_1226948] s may be included regardless of  COVID -19 vaccination status . However, information will 
be collected on timing and type of prior COVID -19 vaccination as well as timing of any  prior 
SAR S-CoV-2 infection . 
5.7.2.  Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication ( eg prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a  subject in addition 
to study drug treatment. All such medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded 
on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
5.7.3.  Permitted Therapy  
Locally available SOC treatment should be initiated in parallel in addition to stu dy drug (add -
on). If SOC includes treatment that has direct  antiviral  activity  against SARS -CoV -2 
(combination  antiviral cohort), such drug should be initiated during screening or within 24 hours 
prior to or after randomization . Allowed SARS -CoV -2 antivira l treatment s could includ e, but are 
not limited to  nirmatrelvir/ritonavir , molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], and mAbs . SARS -CoV-2 
treatments with  concerns for DDIs  (remdesivir)  with BEM  are not permitted . 
Subjects are also permitted to use the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352015]:  
• Acetaminophen (paracetamol)  
• Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 43 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
• Anti-emetics to manage any nausea or vomiting observed on the study (such as 
dopamine antagonists, serotonin 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists, and antihistamines)  
• Prophylactic anticoagulation with low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], direct factor Xa inhibitors, or 
direct thrombin inhibitors  
• Prescribed medications for concomitant conditions as per medical history, such as 
chronic supplementary oxygen, antihypertensives, antidiabetic m edications, 
rheumatologic medications, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_107110] ( eg, chronic 
inhaled/intranasal/oral steroids)  
• Hormonal contraceptives (see Section  5.8) 
• Hormone replacement therapy  
• Corticosteroids  
• Convalescent plasma  (For purposes of stratification, those receiving convalescent 
plasma would be included in the supportive -care-only cohort).  
• For subjects who deteriorate on -study, any  rescue therapy which is SOC for severe 
COVID -19 is permitted  (see Section  5.7.5  for details about remdesivir) . 
5.7.4.  Cautionary Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Herbal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169800], safety profiles, and 
potential DDI are generally unknown.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Mitigation of Other Potentia l DDI 
For more details regarding potential DDI , refer to  the BEM Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  P-glycoprotein (P -gp)-Based  Inhibit ion 
Concomitant use of P -gp inhibitors is permitted but must be taken at least [ADDRESS_1226949] of P -gp inhibitors, refer to:  https://go.drugbank.com/categories/DBCAT002667 . 
Note:  As ritonavir is a major P -gp inhibitor, subjects enrolled in the combination  antiviral 
group  who are taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  should not take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  until at least 
[ADDRESS_1226950]  2 hours after study 
drug (BEM/placebo ). 
Subjects taking  digoxin  must do so at least 2 hours after taking study drug . 
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 44 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Gastro intestinal Acid Reduction Based Interaction  
Gastrointestinal acid reducing agents such as proton -pump inhibitor s, H2 blockers  and antacids 
may reduce the solubility of BEM. Subjects taking  these agents  will do so at least 2 hours after 
taking study drug . 
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Tenofovir  Alafenamide  
Tenofovir alafenamide  and BEM may compete for activation enzymes .  Subjects with HIV 
and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV), who are taking tenofovir  alafenamide should do so at least 
2 hours after administration of study drug.    
5.7.5.  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_878186] 1 until Day 29 (the primary 
study period) or early termination, except as otherwise indicated, as described below:  
• Investigational therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) , except for 
unblinded protocols that don’t include direct acting antivirals for COVID -19  
(eg, open -label oncological regimen variations or biologic studies)  
Note:  Prior to enrolling subjects that are on other open -label studies, it is the site’s 
responsibility to ensure that the study criteria for that study allow for enrollment into 
this study.  
• SARS -CoV-2 treatments with concerns for DDIs :  remdesivir  
Note:  As BEM  and remdesivir sha re a common target and metabolic activation 
pathway, there is a potential for PK or pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interactions 
between the two, during concomitant administration of both drugs. Study drug should 
be discontinued before initiation of remdesivir . 
• Sofosbuvir -containing regimens  for subjects with active HCV , as BEM has potent 
inhibitory activity against HCV, which will cause pharmacodynamic interactions  
• Abacavir for subjects with HIV , as aba cavir and BEM share a common activation 
pathway  
• Hydroxychloroquine or amiodarone  
Note:  There is a known DDI between amiodarone and sofosbuvir (bradycardia). The 
phosphoramidate moiety of the BEM  structure is identical to that of sofosbuvir 
(SOF). As it is unclear if the phosphoramidate moiety of sofosb uvir is contributory to 
the DDI, amiodarone use is prohibited to ensure subject safety . 
Coadministration of hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir can result in reduced 
remdesivir antiviral activity. While remdesivir is not a study drug in this study , it 
remain s a viable rescue therapy that subjects may be given if clinically warranted. 
Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is prohibited  during the study.  
5.8. Contraception Requirements  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not re ached a 
postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than 
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 45 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL 2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery ( ie, removal of ovaries, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_137845], and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator ( eg, Müllerian agenesis). 
The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or 
regulations. Women of childbearing potential must be established on their chosen method of 
contraception at screening.  
The following are examples of adequate contraceptive methods:   
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine h ormone -releasing system  
• Hormonal contraceptives  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
• Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.  
• Vasectomized  partner  
• Sexual abstinence  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical 
trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, 
ovulation , symptothermal, or post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods 
of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in 
the local Informed Consent Form (ICF).  
Should acceptable methods of contraception  be more restrictive than the methods listed above 
per local regulations, guidance, investigator practice , or based on SOC  administered ( eg, 
molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]) , a more restrictive list may be included within the site/country -specific 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved ICF.

6.2. Medical History  
Complete medical  history will be obtained at screening. Information about COVID -19 disease 
history  and prior infections , including the onset date of symptoms, and risk factors will be 
collected. Subjects may be questioned about alcohol and drug use, and information about prior or 
concomitant medications will also be collected.  Information will also be collected on prior 
COVID -19 vaccine history . 
6.3. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed by a medically qualified individual as 
scheduled in Table  1. The complete physical examination will include a review of the following: 
head and neck, ears/nose/throat, lymph nodes, heart, lungs, abdomen,  musculoskeletal, 
neurological, skin, and general appearance.   
Demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity/race, body weight, height, BMI) will be recorded.   
After screening, a symptom -targeted physical exam should be done as clinically  indicated.  
6.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (body temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure) and 
SpO [ADDRESS_1226957] is in a seated position.  
6.5. Safety Laboratory Evaluations  
Safety laboratory evaluations will be performed as scheduled in Table  1. The investigator or 
designee will assess each abnormal value to determine if it is clinically significant.  
• Chemistry: Sodium, calcium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate or total carbon dioxi de 
(either is acceptable), glucose, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) or urea, creatinine, eGFR 
(CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420] ), total protein, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, AST, ALT, albumin, creatin e kinase ( CK), triglycerides, cholesterol, 
amylase , and lipase  
• Hematology: White blood cell ( WBC ) count with differential, red blood cell count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit , and platelet count  
• Coagulation: Prothrombin time (PT)  and International Normalized Ratio (INR)  
Note: Depending on logistics, the laborator y may use the PT to calculate INR and 
only report the INR to the clinical sites.  
• Pregnancy tests (serum or urine) will be performed on female subjects of childbearing 
potential  at screening , as specified in Table  [ADDRESS_1226958] can be done at Day 1 , as long as results are confirmed prior 
to dosing with study drug . 
The total volume of blood withdrawn during the study should not exceed 500 mL. However, it is 
possible that the total blood donation may be higher if repeat blood samples are required for 
safety assessments.

6.6. Other Laboratory Evaluations  
At screening, a RT -PCR or validated rapid antigen SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1226959] will be 
performed loc ally to confirm eligibility ( Table  1). A documented historical positive result from a 
test conducted ≤ 5 days prior to randomization is acceptable for c onfirming eligibility.  
Samples for the following will be sent to designated central laboratories  or Sponsor designee for 
analysis, on the schedule outlined in Table  1: 
• Nasopharyngeal ( NP) swab  samples for SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR ; an aliquot  will be 
dedicated for resistance analys es which will be described  in a separate resistance 
monitoring plan. Aliquot s may also be analyzed for viral titer and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_878188] a and RSV to rule out co-infection  
• Blood  samples will be collected for potential future biomarker  analys es
 
 others will be kept for future use to potentially 
analyze disease -related biomarkers  or other immune markers to inform the course of 
the disease.  
• Plasma samples for sparse PK analysis

Plasma concentrations of BEM  and metabolites (as appropriate) will be measured according to 
validated bioanalytical methods.  
Samples from all subjects who received at least one dose of BEM  will be analyzed. Samples 
from subjects who received placebo will not be analyzed.  
Bioanalytical laboratory personnel will have access to the randomization assignment.  
6.7. COVID -19 Symptom Assessment   
A COVID -19 symptom diary will be completed daily until Day 2 9 (Table  1). The symptom diary 
is provided in  Appendix 1  (Section  13.1). This diary  will be used to characterize key symptoms 
recognized as part of COVID -19 illness based on FDA guidance ( FDA 2020 ). The COVID -19

Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
Symptom Diary is composed of individual symptom it em questions, each with a 2- or 4- point 
Likert response option. In addition to symptoms, subjects will be asked for a self-assessment as 
to whether they have returned to their usual (pre -COVID -19) health status , as well as their 
assessment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1226961] once daily at the same time each evenin g through Day 2 9. 
6.7.1.  Data Collection Methods for the PRO  
The COVID -19 Symptom Diary is a patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure that will be self -
administered at the clinic  (Day 1)  and/or at home (see schedule in Table  1). At the clinic  on Day 
1, instruments will be administered before the subject receives any information on disease status, 
prior to the performance of non -PRO assessments, and prior to the a dministration of study 
treatment.  
The PRO instrument, translated into the local language as appropriate, will be completed either 
through use of an electronic application on the subject’s own electronic device, through use of a 
device provided by [CONTACT_37922], or as paper dairy. Subjects should be given the following 
instructions for completing the PRO at home:   
• The assessment should  be completed  at the same time each day  (before bed each 
evening ), and the  recall period (in  the last 24 hours) should be speci fied clearly . 
• Subjects should complete the instruments in a quiet area with minimal distractions 
and disruptions.  
• Subjects should answer questions to the best of their ability; there are no right or 
wrong answers.  
• Subjects who have difficulty in using the diary (eg, blind, illiterate, physical 
limitations, unfamiliar with technology) can obtain assistance from close contacts  (eg 
family members or friends)  in recording responses , but should not obtain advice or 
help from others with constructing responses.  
During the study visit  on Day 1 , the PRO instruments should be administered as outlined below:  
• Subjects ’ health status should not be discussed prior to administration of the 
instruments  
• Sites must administer the official version of each instrument, as provided by [CONTACT_429]. Instruments must not be copi[INVESTIGATOR_169804] . 
• Sites should allow sufficient time for subjects to complete the instruments  
• Sites should administer the instruments in a quiet area with minimal distractions and 
disruptions . 
• Subjec ts should be instructed to answer questions to the best of their ability; there are 
no right or wrong answers .

A COVID -19-related medically -attended visit will be defined as follows: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
(Section  6.8) ER visit, urgent care visit, physician’s office visit, or telemedicine visit, with the 
primary reason for the visit being COVID -19.  
Only medically -attended visits related to COVID -19, as de termined by [CONTACT_093], will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Details will include at minimum:  
• Type of visit (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER, urgent care, physician’s office visit, telemedicine)  
• Date of visit  
• Primary reason for COVID -19 related medically -attended visit   
• Treatments given for COVID -19 (including, but not limited to, concomitant 
medications and supplemental oxygen)  
• If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124889] , site personnel will record  length of visit, whether 
intensive care unit ( ICU) care was given, or whether mech anical ventilation was 
required . If additional infectious work -up was performed, the results should be

7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1. Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a medicinal 
product(s) and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the use of a medicinal 
product(s), whether or not considered related to this medicinal product(s).  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug(s) caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug(s) and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a 
drug(s).  
An AE may be:  
• A new  illness  
• Worsening of a previous chronic illness or a concomitant illness  
• An apparent adverse effect of the study medication(s) on safety -related laboratory 
tests. This observation could include a clinically -significant abnormal laboratory 
value or a signi ficant shift from baseline (though still within normal range) which the 
clinical investigator or qualified designate considers to be clinically significant  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
requir ed surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned (elective) surgical measures and the conditions(s) 
leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) know n before the start of 
study treatment. In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history.  
An SAE or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important m edical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above (according to medical 
judgment of the qualified investigator)  
Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded  as AEs or SAEs. 
However, laboratory abnormalities that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study 
drug interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an 
Bemnifosbuvir (AT -527) Confidential  Page 55 
Protocol AT -03A-017 (FINAL  2.0) 
 
Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
SAE, if they meet the definition above. In additi on, laboratory or other abnormal assessments 
(eg, electrocardiogram [ECG ], x-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as  an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described 
above. If the laborator y abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis ( eg, 
anemia), not the laboratory result ( ie, decreased hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities that do 
not require medical intervention or action are generally not considered AEs.  
Severity  should be recorded and graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.1 dated July 2017, as 
described below. If a value falls within the local laboratory normal range, then it will not be 
graded. For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the 
basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be 
in agreement with the grading of the laboratory ab normality.  
7.1.1.  Intensity Assessment  
The investigator or the designated person will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE 
by [CONTACT_44745] a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s eCRF. In 
classification of AEs, the term “s evere” is not the same as “serious”. Severity is a description of 
the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe chest pain). The term “serious” 
relates to a participant/event outcome or action criteria, usually associated with events t hat pose 
an immediate threat to a participant’s life or functioning, and meet one or more of the SAE 
criteria described above.  
The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.1 
will be used for assessing AEs ( DAIDS  Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events, Version 2.1. [July 2017] ). All AEs will be graded as grade 1 (mild), grade 2 
(moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (potentially life -threatening) , or grade 5 (death) according 
to the de finitions described in the DAIDS Table. Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate 
evaluation of the severity.  
7.1.2.  Causality Assessment  
The qualified investigator or a medically qualified designate will determine the relationship of 
any AE to study drugs using the following guidelines in Table  2. 
Table  2: Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship to Drug  Comment  
Reasonable Possibility  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship  between the drug(s) 
and the AE ( eg, AE is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure or is uncommon in the study population, but not 
commonly associated with drug exposure).  
No Reasonable Possibility  There is no evidence to suggest a  causal relationship between the 
drug(s) and the AE.

Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
7.2. Routine Reporting  
For the purposes of this study, non -serious AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF from the 
time of informed consent through Day 29 (the primary study period).  SAEs will be recorded  
through Day 60.  
During these periods, all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423], observed by [CONTACT_506662], or elicited by [CONTACT_701984].  
Any AE which remains unresolved as of the last visit will require follow -up until the AE has 
been resolved, a reasonable explanation for its persistence found, or is deemed chronic or stable 
by [CONTACT_093]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure subjects experiencing AEs 
receive appropriate follow -up, treatment where required, and that every action is well 
documented.  
Classification will be performed by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and preferred term using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to  other events ( eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as an SAE or AE in the eCRF. However, 
medi cally significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time 
should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  
7.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Clinical sites must notify  of any SAE, without regard to causa lity, within 
[ADDRESS_1226962] be completed by a member of the 
investigational site staff within 24 hours. This form should include a clearly written narrative 
describing diagnostic terms, signs, symptoms , and tre atment of the event ; diagnostic procedures ; 
as well as any relevant laboratory data and an assessment of the potential causal relationship 
between the event and the investigational product(s). Information not available at the time of the 
initial report ( eg an end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371]) must be documented. All follow -up information must be reported as soon as 
the relevant information is available.  
If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool 
and transmit to  within 24 hours by [CONTACT_7053]:  
 Email:  
 Fax:  
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.

An unlisted (unexpecte d) SAE is one in which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information (RSI). For investigational product(s), the 
expectedness of an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_878216]’s Brochure(s). Investigators will be notified, and the  Investigator’s Brochure will be 
updated, if any new pattern of AEs or laboratory abnormalities is found to be related to BEM  
dosing.  
The start date of an SAE reported on the Serious Adv erse Event form must be the same as the 
start date of the corresponding AE documented on the eCRF. If a change in severity is noted for 
the existing AE, it must be recorded. If a worsened AE meets the criteria for an SAE, the start 
date of the SAE must be the same as the start date of the worsened AE.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study, must be followed until any of the 
following occurs:  
• The even t resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value is available  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drugs or to factors unrelated 
to study conduct  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information ca n be obtained (subject or health 
care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after 
demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts)  
Any SAE reports will be reported by [CONTACT_473] (or designee) to their local IRB/IEC in 
accordance with local reporting requirements and reporting timelines.  
Similarly, the Sponsor (or designee) will determine whether an SAE must be reported in an 
expedited manner to regulatory authorities, in accordance with regulatory requirement s, 
including auxiliary medicinal products to Eudravigilance per Directive 2001/83/EC  where 
appropriate . If so, the Sponsor (or designee) will report the event to the regulatory authorities in 
accord with applicable reporting timelines.  
7.4. Pregnancy Reporting  
All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects  during the study (until [ADDRESS_1226963] 
dose of study drug)  or female partners of male subjects , where locally required, must be reported 
to  (see Section  7.[ADDRESS_1226964] information) by [CONTACT_144300]

The secondary endpoints are:  
Efficacy:  
• Proportion of subjects with COVID -19-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n or who died due to any 
cause through Day 29  
• Proportion of subjects who died due to any cause through Day 29 and Day 60  
• Proportion of subjects with COVID -19-related complications (e g., death,

The primary efficacy endpoint will also be assessed in the combination antiviral population as a 
secondary endpoint.  All secondary  endpoints will be assessed in both the 
supportive -care-only population, and the combination antiviral popula tion. 
8.3. Statistical Methods  
The primary  and secondary  efficacy analys es will be conducted using the mITT -S population. 
Efficacy analyses will be repeated using the mITT -C population.  
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population, which consists  of all subjects who 
receive d at least one dose  of study drug. In all safety analyses, subjects will be grouped 
according to the treatment that the subjects actually received rather than the treatment assigned at 
randomization. Here, treatment will be cons idered as BEM monotherapy and placebo for 
subjects in the supportive -care-only population and as BEM combination and compatible 
antiviral in the combination antiviral population.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_878217]. Disposition, with respect to both treatment and study completion, 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_878218].  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following information: the 
number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, standard deviation, Q1, median, Q3, 
minimum, and maximum. For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be 
displayed for each categor y. 
Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods for estimation and log -
rank test for treatment comparison.  
Data handling for quantitative data that are reported as less than the lower limit of quantification, 
as well as values report ed greater than the upper limit of quantification, will be described in the 
SAP.  
In general, data will be considered as observed, ie, values for missing data will not be imputed.  
The primary analysis will occur when all randomized subjects have had suffi cient follow -up time 
to complete the Day 2 9 visit. Data collected during the extended FU period will be summarized 
separately, after the primary study analysis.

8.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the effi cacy of BEM  based on the 
proportion of patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878195] [ADDRESS_1226970] comparison will 
be between the BEM  arm and the placebo arm. This proportion will be compared between the 
BEM  and placebo arms using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for the  
stratification factors  of age and region . The  CMH p -value and estimated common risk difference,  
odds ratio and relative risk, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) for 
these estimates,  will be presented.    
Intercurrent events are those that occur after treatment initiation and either preclude observation 
of the variable or affect its interpretation. For the intercurrent events of rescue  (eg intervention 
with r emdesivir)  and concomitant COVID -19 medications, a treatment policy approach will be 
taken, whereby [CONTACT_878219]. In addition, p atients will be 
followed, assessed, and analyzed irrespective of their completion of the course of the study 
treatment. The analysis will be performed based on observed data, and the following measures 
will be used to reduce missing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death d ata: eCRFs capturing clinical information 
that may be indicative of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878196], and study staff may use a public information source to obtain information about 
survival status if a p atient withdraws from the study.  
8.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted for the combination antiviral 
population as a secondary endpoint. Presentation and analysis of  other  secondary  efficacy  
endpoints will be carried out  using methods similar to those specified for the primary  efficacy  
endpoint.  Data handling , analysis populations,  and s pecification of statistical testing for 
secondary efficacy endpoints, with methods used to control overall  type I error, will be detail ed 
in the SAP. 
8.3.3.  Exploratory Analyses  
Additional  efficacy and antiviral  endpoints will be summarized descriptively. Any exploratory 
statistical analysis to be conducted on these endpoints will be documented in the SAP.    
Resistan ce analys es, including assessment of treatment -emergent mutations in SARS -CoV -2 
viral genes , will be documented in a separate resistance monitoring  plan.  
 
   
Exploratory sub -group analyses may also be conducted ; these will be detailed in the SAP.

8.5. Sample Size  
The study is powered to detect a tru e 60% reduction in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138628] -cause mortality 
rate with BEM as compared to placebo. With total N=2100 and the interim analysis plan as 
defined in Section  8.4, there is 90% power if the true rate in the placebo arm is 4% 
(corresponding to an absolute difference of 2.4% in rate) and at least 80% p ower if the true rate 
in the placebo arm is 3% (corresponding to an absolute difference of 1.8%). Sample size was

Lan-Demet s approximation of O’Brien Fleming m ethod (see Section  8.4), the total sample size 
was inflated by a multiplier of 1.055 to arrive at a target sample size of 2100 participants  in the 
supportive -care-only population.  
Assuming ~95% of randomized subjects who receive only supportive care as SOC will meet the 
mITT -S population criteria, the study targets total enrollment of 2210 subjects in the supportive -
care-only population.  Planned enrol lment in the antiviral combination arm is up to 300 subjects.

withdraw from the study at any time without je opardizing their medical care. They will be given 
a copy of their ICF.  
If an amended or revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must 
be obtained.  
9.4. Subject Confidentiality and Personal Data Protection  
The investigators and the Sponsor (and organization s processing data on its behalf  [Processers ]) 
will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in the study, in accordance with GCP 
and local regulations. Subjects should be identified by a unique subject identifier on all study 
documents provided to the Sponsor (and Processors ). In co mpliance with local regulations/ICH 
GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and institution permit authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor, of the regulatory agency(s), and IRB/IEC access to review the 
subject’s original medical records for verification of study -related procedures and data.  
Supplemental Information for Participating Sites Located in the European Union (EU), as 
applicable  
The collection of data from European patients in the study constitutes a processing of personal 
data within the meaning of Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (GDP R).  
At an organizational level, to meet European requirements the Sponsor has appointed a certified 
Data Protection Officer (DPO) in charge of ensuring compliance with data protection 
regulations. The DPO oversees the conduct of the required Data Protecti on Impact Assessment 
(DPIA) to assess and protect rights and freedoms of data subjects regarding processing 
operations. All Processors are bound by a data protection agreement (DPA). If personal data are 
transferred to a third country within the meaning of  the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), the DPA contains the Standard Contractual Clauses established by [CONTACT_878220] (AT -527) Confidential  Page 66

Version 2.0, FINAL , 15Jun2023  
Commission. The DPO is also in charge of any data subject request and can be contact[CONTACT_878221].  
The subjects and healthcare professionals involved in this study will be informed on the type of 
data collected and processed about them, for which objective and on which legal basis; they will 
also be informe d about their rights on their personal data, and how to exercise their rights.  
At a technical level, the Sponsor has implemented and maintains, and requires that Processors 
have implemented and maintain, measures such that personal data are stored in a sec ured 
environment, encrypted, and partitioned from other data. Access to personal data is limited to 
relevant staff through access policies. All persons accessing data are bound by a confidential 
clause or professional secrecy.  
Subjects will be assigned a u nique identifier (data pseudonymization) and will not be identified 
by [CONTACT_42503], study databases, study -related forms, study reports, or any related 
publications. The key to identify subjects is stored in a secure manner by [CONTACT_129583].  
The Spons or will regularly review its technical and organizational security measures and update 
them to take into account any evolution on technological developments. The Sponsor  may apply 
additional specific statutory requirements, where applicable in the national  laws.  
Besides technical and organizational measures,  the Sponsor, by [CONTACT_878222] , further maintains  the confidentiality of records and 
personal data of subjects.  
The Sponsor  has put in place a f unctional process of reporting of any data breach occurring at  the 
Sponsor’s or Processor’s facilities and premises which involve personal data of subjects in the 
clinical study.   In case of the occurrence of any data breach,  the Sponsor, in consultation w ith its 
DPO, will immediately apply relevant measures to mitigate the risks to data subjects as 
appropriate in relation to the specific context of the data breach, taking into account its source, 
underlying intentions, possibilities of recovery, etc. Any d ata breach presenting risks to the rights 
and freedoms of data subjects will be reported to the relevant supervisory data protection 
authority within 72 hours of  the Sponsor becoming aware of the data breach. In addition, in case 
of occurrence of a high -risk breach, subjects will be informed by  [CONTACT_1034]  (via clinical study 
site).

10. DATA COLLECTION, RETENT ION, AND MONITORING  
10.1. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent  DSMB will evaluate safety periodically  and review unblinded data from  interim 
analyses  (Section  8.4), providing any recommendations for early termination or study design 
adaptations .  Timing of additional reviews will be  detailed in th e DSMB charter.   
10.2. Case Report Forms  
Designated site staff will use source document entries to enter the data required by [CONTACT_878223]. Representatives of the Sponsor, the CRO or their designee(s) will train 
designated site staff on accessing and using a web -based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. 
Investigational site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until the required training is 
completed and documented. One eCRF will be completed for each subject enrolled in the study.  
All eCRFs will be reviewed, evaluated, and approved/signed by [CONTACT_093] (or designee), as 
required.  
The original source documents and a copy of the corresponding eCRFs will be retained by [CONTACT_1275]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_878197] S ponsor (or designee).  
10.3. Data Management and Processing  
Data from eCRFs and other external data ( eg, laboratory data) will be entered into the eCRF or 
merged with a clinical database as specified in the data management plan. Quality control and 
data validatio n procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical 
database.  
In accordance with the vendor’s applicable data management procedures, the clinical database 
will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual checks and listings. Data queries requiring 
clarification will be issued in the eCRF and sent to the study site for resolution. Only authorized 
personnel will make corrections to the clinical da ta in the eCRF, and all corrections will be 
documented in an audit trail.  
10.4. Quality Assurance  
This study will be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the 
CRO(s) that will conduct the study. These SOPs are designed to ensure ad herence to ICH 
Guideline E6 for GCP.   
All vendors and clinical sites will be subject to inspection by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee) to ensure 
that the data are generated, documented , and reported in compliance with the study plan and 
applicable local regulatory requirements.

whichever is l onger. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required 
by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed by [CONTACT_1034].  
10.6. Monitoring of the Study  
Due to the COVID -19 situation, any training or monitoring described in this section may be 
conducted remotely or via telephone or video. Depending on the situation over time at each site, 
it is possible that trainers or monitors  may be on -site. 
Before study initiation, representatives of the Sponsor or its designee(s) will review the protocol 
and eCRF with the investigators and their staff and perform study -specific training.  
During the study, the study monitor and CRO will check documentation, either remotely or on -
site, to ensure completeness of records, accuracy of entries on t he eCRFs, adherence to the 
protocol and to GCP, progress of enrollment, and confirmation study drug supply/logistics. Key 
study personnel must be available to assist the study monitor during remote or on -site visits.  
The investigator must maintain source d ocuments for each subject in the study, which may 
consist of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]). All information on eCRFs 
must be traceable to these source documents in the subject's file. For any on -site visits, the 
investigator mus t give the study monitor access to any relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the eCRF entries. The investigator must also keep records documenting 
the informed consent process. Information in source documents that could identify the s ubjects 
(such as the subjects’ names) will not be forwarded to the Sponsor (or its designee(s)).  
Depending on COVID -19 restrictions, the Sponsor or its representative(s) may visit the study 
facilities in order to maintain current knowledge of the study thr ough review of the records, 
comparison with source documents, observation and discussion of the conduct and progress of 
the study. The clinical site will then permit any trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, 
and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_670623]/documents.

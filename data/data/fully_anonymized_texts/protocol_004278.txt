Official Title: The Effect of Animal-Assisted Therapy on Prosocial Behavior in Children with Developmental Delay or Autism 
Spectrum Disorder
NCT #: N/A
Date: November 11, [ADDRESS_376173] of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on prosocial behavior and emotional regulation, 
both during and after AAT sessions, in children referred for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluation or documented 
developmental delay (DD) or behavioral concerns. We seek to address identified gaps in knowledge of the use of canines in therapy 
sessions by [CONTACT_307386]- and long-term effects of AAT and human-animal interaction occurring in AAT sessions. Caregivers were 
given the option to enroll the child in the AAT study at the follow-up appointment after the diagnostic assessment was completed, or 
upon enrollment in the ASD program if the child had an ASD diagnosis. Each AAT study lasted between eight to 12 weeks, and 
caregivers had the option to re-enroll the child for the next study to continue addressing behavioral concerns. Animal-assisted therapy 
sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the age and ability of the participant. Sessions started with five to 10 minutes of free 
play with the canine, followed by [CONTACT_307387]’s identified sensory profile. Participants then entered 
the clinic room for [ADDRESS_376174], a certified pediatric nurse practitioner (CPNP), taught 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_307380]. Sessions concluded with five minutes of play with the canine. Play 
activities include fetch, soccer, hide and seek, and puzzles. The canine was trained to lay under the table in the clinic room while the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307381]. He would provide grounding, light pressure, and deep pressure therapy if the participant 
became anxious during the sessions. The seated work was recorded using two cameras to ensure visibility of the interactions between 
the participant and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], canine, and caregiver; participant vocalizations and verbalizations; and participant facial expressions. We 
used two human-animal ethograms to code behavior during sessions and two behavioral assessments to note behavior occurring after 
sessions. All sessions occurred in the clinic located on the university's campus. Demographic data including participant age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, referral source, prior medical diagnoses, age of ASD or DD diagnosis, medications, and prior allied health, school, or 
psychological evaluations. The canine was trained as a therapy dog and was being trained as a service dog at the time of the study. The 
canine was present during sessions to interact with children and assist them to practice and develop skills to address identified deficits 
in social-emotional and adaptive functioning, prosocial behavior, and emotional regulation. AAT sessions were recorded to code 
interactions at a later time.
Objectives
1.Do interactions between a trained therapy canine and autistic children differ depending on the child's verbal abilities?
2.Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation in AAT sessions among children with varying verbal 
abilities?
3.Is there a difference in prosocial behavior and emotional regulation apart from animal-assisted therapy sessions among children 
with varying verbal abilities?
Design
We used standardized instruments to investigate human-animal intervention (HAI) occurring during AAT sessions and prosocial 
behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated by [CONTACT_307388]. SPSS and Microsoft Excel were used to run 
the analysis. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare prosocial behavior and emotional regulation occurring apart from AAT 
sessions between the two groups based on the self-report questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_50633]. Independent t-tests were used to 
analyze the differences in human-animal interaction among children with ASD with varying verbal abilities from the recorded sessions. 
The homogeneity of the variance (HOV) assumption between two groups was checked using Levene’s test for equality of variances in 
SPSS program before conducting the t-tests analysis. Results of t-tests with adjusted degrees of freedom value were reported if the 
HOV was violated. The null hypothesis was set to reflect no significant difference in HAI between verbal and nonverbal groups for the 
independent t-tests; therefore, a significant difference in the human-animal interaction behaviors regarding the children’s verbal 
abilities could be confirmed if the t-test results reject the null hypothesis. Cohen’s d was used to report the effect sizes of the 
independent t-tests; values up to 0.[ADDRESS_376175] sizes.  
Methods
Demographic data; past, family, and social histories; and prior therapy evaluations were collected during the initial consultation for 
enrollment into the ASD program. 
The Observation for Human Canine Interaction for Research (OHAIRE) Coding System from University of Arizona was used to 
note human bonding and prosocial behavior occurring during AAT sessions. The OHAIRE Coding System was specifically created 
for use in research with participants aged [ADDRESS_376176] one other person during sessions to allow for the 
coding of social behaviors. The participant being observed is known as the primary participant. The coding system allows for the 
primary participant to engage in social behaviors with various targets, including caregivers, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], objects, and canines. While 
the OHAIRE was designed to code behavior in the presence of common domesticated canine species, it has been tested with a 
restricted range of canine species to date. The tool has previously been used to code interactions with dogs and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], as well as 
social behaviors before and after interactions with horses (not direct interactions with horses). The coded behaviors are general 
enough to be assumed to apply to other domesticated canine species. Participants were video recorded continuously during 
unstructured interaction opportunities. Available activities provided opportunities to engage in both social and isolated behaviors. 
The video sample included a wide enough angle to observe the environment and all potential social interaction partners. The 
OHAIRE-V3 calculates a human-canine bond score in order to quantify the interactions taking place between the primary 
participant and the canine. The human-canine bond score was calculated for each 10-second interval based on the presence of an 
interaction between the primary participant and the canine, and the type of behaviors shown during that interaction. Participants 
received one point for each of the six behaviors from the ‘social communication & interaction’ category in the OHAIRE tool. No 
points were given if the primary participant does not interact with the canine. The behaviors included in the definition of the human 
canine bond score are talk, gesture, look, touch, affection, and prosocial behavior directed toward the canine. There are a total of six 
10-second intervals within each 1-minute video segment, and each of those 10-second intervals has six possible points: one point for 
each type of interaction. The total score from each 10-second interval is summed for a total overall human-canine bond score across 
the entire 1-minute video segment. Each 10-second interval will have a score between [ADDRESS_376177] a score between 0 and 36 points.
The 3-AAT Observation ethogram, adapted with permission from Johns Hopkins University,  was used to code both canine and 
human interaction during AAT sessions. The revised ethogram appraises the frequency of six domains of human interaction 
(affection, play, care, communication, comfort, withdrawal) and [ADDRESS_376178] 30 second mark. 
Each interaction has a code for intensity from 0 (not intense) to 3 (the most intense), and the mode of the interaction was entered to 
run the analysis.
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item tool developed to assess five domains: Emotional Problems, 
Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems, and Prosocial. The SDQ is the most used instrument in measuring therapeutic 
effect of interventions within the emotional state in children and adolescents ages [ADDRESS_376179] of the therapeutic intervention. Scores from four behavioral domains 
range from zero (“normal”) to 10 (“very high concerns”), while Prosocial domain scores are reversed so that 10 indicates “normal” 
behavior and zero signifies “very high concerns”. The SDQ also assesses the total, impact, internalizing, and externalizing scores to 
provide a complete overview of the child’s behavior during the past four weeks. Total scores are the sum of the behavior domains 
except the Prosocial domains and range from zero (normal) to 40 (very high). Impact scores range from zero (normal) to 10 (very 
high) and reflect overall distress and impairment interfering with daily social interactions. Internalizing scores reflect the Emotional 
Problems and Peer Problems domains, while Externalizing scores are the sum of the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity domains. 
Both the Internalizing and Externalizing domain scores range from zero (normal) to 20 (very high). The initial SDQ was 
administered at the beginning of the study and the follow-up assessment was used subsequently every four weeks until the study 
concluded. 
Lastly, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was administered weekly to measure therapeutic effects occurring in 
everyday life outside of the AAT session. The PANAS is a 20-item questionnaire utilizing a 5-point Likert scale to assess positive and 
negative affect occurring the week prior to administration. Each domain has [ADDRESS_376180].
Statistical Analysis Plan
This present study used standardized instruments to investigate human-animal intervention (HAI) occurring during AAT sessions 
and prosocial behavior and emotional regulation demonstrated by [CONTACT_307388]. SPSS and Microsoft Excel 
were used to run the analysis. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare prosocial behavior and emotional regulation occurring 
apart from AAT sessions between the two groups based on the self-report questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_50633]. A total of 144 
sessions were conducted, 84 of which were recorded and coded to analyze HAI during sessions. Independent t-tests were used to 
analyze the differences in human-animal interaction among children with ASD with varying verbal abilities from the recorded 
sessions. The homogeneity of the variance (HOV) assumption between two groups was checked using Levene’s test for equality of 
variances in SPSS program before conducting the t-tests analysis. Results of t-tests with adjusted degrees of freedom value were 
reported if the HOV was violated. The null hypothesis was set to reflect no significant difference in HAI between verbal and 
nonverbal groups for the independent t-tests; therefore, a significant difference in the human-animal interaction behaviors regarding 
the children’s verbal abilities could be confirmed if the t-test results reject the null hypothesis. Cohen’s d was used to report the 
effect sizes of the independent t-tests; values up to 0.[ADDRESS_376181].

PURPOSE OF STUDY   
This purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of services for children with developmental 
delay or autism spectrum disorder while using a dog trained in therapeutic techniques. This 
study’s aim is to see if therapy sessions with the dog result in an improvement in your child’s 
social and emotional abilities. Before you decide to allow your child to participate in this study, 
it is important that you understand why the study is being done and what will be involved. Please 
read the following information carefully. Please ask the co-investigator if there is anything that 
is not clear or if you need more information.  
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
Activities involved in this study include weekly therapy sessions lasting [ADDRESS_376182] your child with their identified social and emotional concerns. Your child will receive 24 
weeks of therapy, where 12 weeks will be with the dog and 12 weeks will be without the dog. 
You will be asked to complete a set of assessments on your child’s development, social -
emotional skills, functioning, parent-child interactions, and intelligence quotient throughout the 
study. If able, your child will indicate their level of anxiety before and after each therapy session 
using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a thermometer with varying levels of anxiety. Adolescents may be asked to 
self-report how they feel their socialization and emotional behaviors were during the previous 
week.  
Animal-assisted therapy sessions include techniques aimed to help your child with identified 
concerns in social and emotional behavior. The dog is trained to assist your child to engage in 
social interaction, like playing gently and taking turns during a game. Animal-assisted activities 
include playing fetch and other turn-taking games, assisting the dog to complete puzzles, 
coloring pi[INVESTIGATOR_307382], petting the dog, and grooming the dog. The dog can also give 
“hugs” if your child is anxious by [CONTACT_307389]’s legs. Free play 
with the dog will be allowed once your child and dog have built a relationship. The sessions with 
the dog will last between [ADDRESS_376183]. Kilmer, the dog’s 
owner and handler, will be present while the dog is in the therapy session with your child. 
Traditional therapy sessions without the dog will last for [ADDRESS_376184] been involved in the dog’s training and will be 
constantly assessing his behavior and can remove him as needed. There is a very small ris k of 
injury from the dog (e.g., scratching, teething/nippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]); however, given the extensive training of 
the dog and continuous monitoring of the dog at all times, this risk is considered minimal and 
unlikely.  
  
BENEFITS   
There are no direct benefits to yo u for allowing your child's assessments to be used in this 
research; however, results from this research could improve therapeutic care of children with 
developmental delay or autism spectrum disorder. Your child will also receive a plush toy that 
looks li ke the dog for participating in the study.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY   
Participant data will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_307390].  Your responses to the  questionnaires and evaluations  will have all identifying 
information removed. The co -investigators will keep data in their computers that are password 
protected. Notes, interview transcriptions, and any other hard -copi[INVESTIGATOR_307383] a locked file cabinet in the personal possession of the  co-
investigators. Videos of therapeutic sessions will be downloaded to co -investigators’ password -
protected university -issued computers within [ADDRESS_376185] access to the se files, unless otherwise 
required by [CONTACT_2371]. Co -investigators are legally obligated to report specific incidents which include, 
but may not be limited to, incidents of abuse and suicide risk.   
 
Your child has been identified at -risk for developmental delay or autism spectrum disorder by 
[CONTACT_5657]/her primary care provider (PCP), who then referred your child to the EMSON Pediatric 
Health Lab for further developmental assessment. As such, the referring PCP will receive the 
results of the assessments as well as recom mendations for identified concerns. Also, the 
investigators may request your consent to obtain medical records from the referring provider, 
allied health, and specialty clinics who take care of your child. Your child’s school teacher and 
staff may be conta cted to provide records or complete forms necessary for the evaluations if 
indicated. Aside from this, the co -investigators request permission to use assessment results in 
research on pediatric autism and developmental delay.

Title: The Effect of Animal-Assisted Therapy on Prosocial Behavior in Children with
Developmental Delay or Autism Spectrum Disorder
•What is the purpose of this research? Please explain both why you are doing the research (class assignment,
thesis, etc.) AND/OR state your hypothesis. See attachment is not a sufficient response.
The proposed project will investigate the effects of utilizing animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in the therapy plan for
youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). The purpose of this study is to explore
identified gaps in knowledge pertaining to AAT in pediatric ASD and DD care management. Specifically, we seek
to document canine care and behavior during training and AAT sessions, assess human and canine interaction
during AAT sessions, and analyze long-term effects of AAT on social-emotional and adaptive functioning in the
pediatric participants once the sessions have ended. This study will address the following research questions: 1.
What measures should be taken to ensure protection of the canine before, during, and after AAT sessions as well
as during training? 2. What human-animal interaction behaviors are present during AAT sessions with pediatric
participants ages 12 months to 18 years? 3. What effect does AAT have on pediatric development and social-
emotional and adaptive functioning? 4. Are effects in development and social-emotional and adaptive functioning
produced by [CONTACT_307394] 12-week AAT program?
•Are you collecting data about living individuals?
Yes
•Are you collecting data through intervention or interaction with these individuals?
Yes
•Beyond the basic Participant Types (children, UofA Students, adults, etc.) named elsewhere in this
application, do you have a target population (particular group of people) you want to recruit? Some
examples might be students in a particular class, members of a particular group or network, people
in a specific age range (whether adult or minor), children in a particular school or class, etc.
Yes
•Describe your target population.
[CONTACT_307413] collaborates with the Community Clinic of NWA who refer children, ages 18 months
to 18 years, at risk for developmental delay or autism spectrum disorders to her clinic, Access for
Autism (A4A), for further developmental evaluation and care management. Children receiving care
management by [CONTACT_941] A4A program who have developmental or behavioral concerns can volunteer to
enter this study.
•How are you recruiting participants? Are you standing in a public place asking people to take
a survey, sending out introductory emails, posting an ad or blurb on a website or social media,
posting a flyer in a public location, etc.? **Please note that all recruitment materials will need to be
uploaded in the Notes and Attachments section.
[CONTACT_307413] will discuss the study with parents/guardians whose children have been referred to the A4A
clinic for further developmental evaluation. Participation in the study is voluntary and does not affect other
services provided by [CONTACT_941] A4A clinic.
•Provide a brief description of the procedures involving the participants.
All interactions between the canine and participants will occur either at the A4A clinic, in the EPLEY
Center for Healthcare Professionals, or at the Psychology lab on campus. The first interaction between
the canine and the participant will focus on introducing the two and facilitating a bond through play,
such as petting or brushing the canine, or throwing a ball. The Purdue University Veterinary College of
Medicine O'HAIRE Coding System will be used to observe and code human behavior during this session.
Drs. Kilmer and Quetsch use a variety of behavioral and developmental evaluations to identify concerns
and provide strategies for home therapy to improve delays: 1. Participants ages 8 years and older who are
cognitively capable will be asked to self-report their emotional state before and after each AAT session
using an 11-point Likert scale chart in the shape of a thermometer, with ranges from "no distress/totally
relaxed" to "highest anxiety/stress that you've ever felt." 2. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
3. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 4. Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3rd edition 5. Ages and
Stages Questionnaire: Social and Emotional - 2nd edition 6. Social-Emotional Assessment Measure 7.
Vineland- 3rd edition 8. Social Responsiveness Scale- 2nd edition 9. PEDS: DM-AL 10. Standford-Binet
Intelligence Quota Test Caregiver satisfaction and perspectives of AAT integration in therapy sessions
will be assessed via surveys. Demographic data including participant age, gender, race/ethnicity, referral
source, prior medical diagnoses, age of ASD or DD diagnosis, medications, and prior allied health or
psychological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307385]. [CONTACT_307413] will incorporate AAT into the
therapy sessions at the A4A clinic that are guided by [CONTACT_307395]/
emotional assessments to target gross and fine motor skill, language, social, and emotional development.
Parents will be given handouts that are designed to address deficits identified by [CONTACT_307396]-3, ASQ:SE-2,
and SEAM assessments. The canine will be present to interact with children as they are learning their skill
for that week. For example, the canine will interact with the participant while the participant is learning a
new skill, such as improvement in handwriting, and the participant will be able to interact and play with
the canine if the participant focuses on completing the therapy assignment. Likewise, participants will
earn points if they perform their therapy strategies at home and can use those points to interact and play
with the canine at their next therapy session. Plush dog toys who look like the canine will be given to
pediatric participants as incentive to perform their home therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The following data will be collected
on the canine: 1. The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), a validated
measure to quantify animal behavior during training developed by [CONTACT_307397]
2003. The C-BARQ database will be used to compare the canine's training progress with other Black
Labrador Retriever dogs and can also alert to the onset of behavioral problems so [CONTACT_307413] can target
these concerns early in the training process. 2. The canine behavior ethogram which assesses 26 canine
behaviors during human-animal interactions. The ethogram is divided into three categories: affiliative
indicators, moderate stress indicators, and high-stress indicators. The research team will track the number
of AAT sessions in which the canine participates each day to assess for variations in temperament and
performance. 3. The exact minutes in which canine behaviors are present will be recorded in each AAT
session, noting patterns that indicate fatigue or distress. Human-animal interaction will be assessed by: 1.
The Purdue University Veterinary College of Medicine O'HAIRE Coding System will be used to observe
and code human behavior during AAT sessions. Observable behaviors categories captured by [CONTACT_307398] (Social Communication & Environmental Interaction),
Emotional Display (Facial, Verbal), and Interfering Behaviors (Aggression, Overactivity, Isolation). The
OHAIRE-V3 assessment will be used to calculate a human-animal bond score to quantify the interactions
taking place between the pediatric participants and the animal. The ELAN Coding software will be used
to achieve high inter-rater reliability through precise timing of observed interactions. All AAT sessions
will be recorded after receiving consent from families to retroactively code participant behavior during
sessions.
•How long are the procedures likely to take? Include duration and frequency.
The A4A weekly therapy sessions will last about 30 minutes; however only it is expected that the total
HAI time will be approximately 10-[ADDRESS_376189]. Kilmer's office once
the HAI part of the appointment has ended.
•How will information be given to people to get their informed consent to participate in this research?
Answers should include specific methods (e.g., verbal consent, information handout, online consent
form, full consent form requiring signature [CONTACT_307410].) **Please note that consent materials --
from a script for verbal consent to full consent forms that require participant signature -- must be
uploaded in the Notes and Attachments section.
[CONTACT_307413] will contact [CONTACT_3654]/guardians of potential participants to explain the AAT program and gage
their interest. If interested, parents will come to the A4A clinic on the first floor of ECHP to meet the
canine and sign the informed consent form. Verbal assent will be obtained from pediatric patients who are
cognitively able to give it.
•Does data collection rely on a scheduled event, such as a convention or specific date?
No
•How will your data be collected? Include all that apply: online, on paper/in person, audio and/
or video recordings. **Please note that all data collection materials will need to be uploaded in
the Notes and Attachments section. This includes: surveys, questionnaires, interview questions or
anything that is given to or asked of a participant.
Data will be collected in the initial consultation form for the A4A clinic, through performing
developmental assessments, and with surveys. All AAT sessions will be recorded after receiving consent
from families to retroactively code participant behavior during sessions. The following will be used to
collect data: 1. A4A Intake form: all participants 2. Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3rd edition: 1 month
to 5.5 years 3. Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social/Emotional- 2nd edition: birth to age 6 years 4. Social
and Emotional Assessment/ Measure: 2 to 66 months 5. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: [ADDRESS_376190] Schedule: [ADDRESS_376191] edition: 3 to 21 years 8.
Social Responsiveness Scale- 2nd edition: 2.5 to 18 years 9. PEDS: DM-AL: [ADDRESS_376192]: 2 to 18 years
•How will your data be stored? Include all that apply: electronically, on paper, audio and/or video
recordings.
Survey data will be stored in REDCap, a HIPAA-secured software which caregivers of youth with
complete on a personal device (iPad, laptop, cellphone). Data will only be accessible by [CONTACT_307399]. Data obtained in the ASQ- 3, ASQ: SE-2, SEAM, Vineland- 3, Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores will be stored in [CONTACT_307413]'s
password protected laptop. Any hard-copy measures of documents will be stored in Drs. Kilmer or
Quetsch's locked lab space in a locked filing cabinet. Video files will be downloaded from camcorders
directly to [CONTACT_307414]'s locked lab space located in Memorial Hall on the password-protected computers
and then additionally secured as a password protected file. Only authorized research personnel will have
access to these files.
•How will that data be kept secure?
Data will be stored on Drs. Kilmer and Quetsch's password-protected computers. Any hard-copy measures
of documents will be stored in [CONTACT_307414]'s locked lab space in a locked filing cabinet. Only participant
numbered IDs will be included on assessment documents. Participant identifying information and
associated ID numbers will be stored in the Quetsch lab in a password protected computer on a password
protected document. Only Drs. Quetsch and Kilmer will have access to participant ID information while
the remaining research staff will utilize participant ID numbers. All video files will be downloaded to [CONTACT_307415]'s lab computers within [ADDRESS_376193]-protected documents.
•Minimal Risk is defined as risks of harm not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily
life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. Will
participants be exposed to more than minimal risk? Include in your consideration the potential
of mental risks if asking sensitive questions, or legal or reputational risks in case of breach of
confidentiality.
Yes
•Describe the risks in question and any precautions that will be taken to minimize those risks.
Participants will not be exposed to more than minimal risks while receiving developmental or
behavioral evaluations. Participants will be exposed to the canine during therapy sessions for
approximately [ADDRESS_376194] the canine's leash during the AAT session and will hold him by
[CONTACT_307400]. Also, [CONTACT_307413] will assess the disposition of the pediatric participants before
allowing the canine to come to the room and will not allow the canine to participant if the pediatric
participant's behavior is disruptive or potentially dangerous for the canine.
•Are there any direct benefits to the participants for participating in this study?
Yes
•Describe the benefits participants will or may receive.
Pediatric participants will receive one plush toy that looks like the canine they are working with.
•Will the proposed research involve deception or the withholding of information from participants?
No

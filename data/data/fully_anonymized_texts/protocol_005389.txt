  Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria: • Serious: Serious unanticipated problems or events that result in significant harm, (which may be physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) hemorrhage or life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND • Unanticipated: (i.e., unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND • Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  12.1.[ADDRESS_535649] (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.

  12.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. Serious problems/events can be well defined and include: • death • hemorrhage • life threatening adverse experience • hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity • persistent or significant disability or incapacity • birth defect/anomaly All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  12.1.[ADDRESS_535650] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section of the electronic case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results will be recorded in the source document.   All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting Period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to the study device.  
Single Pass, Inc Kronos Study SP-01, Version 2.0    
Page 18 of 21 CONFIDENTIAL   
 2.  Unlikely: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  3.  Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to use of study device but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_194486]/devices or chemicals.  4.  Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to use of the device, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other devices or chemicals.  5.  Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from use of the device.             ** Severity Scale  The maximum intensity of an AE should be graded according to the definitions below and recorded in detail as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a number of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  1.  Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere      with patient’s daily activities.  2.  Moderate: AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with daily activities but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  3.  Severe: AEs interrupt a patient's usual daily activity and traditionally require systemic                 drug therapy or other treatment.   12.4 Medical Monitoring  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan, medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.

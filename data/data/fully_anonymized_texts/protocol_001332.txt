2.0 Objectives  
The purpose of this study is  to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness, safety, 
function,  comfort , and patient satisfaction  with a novel vaginal pessary design for the use 
in women who suffer from symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and have already 
opted for non -surgical management. Recruited subjects  will have Stage II POP or greater 
and will be current users of a Gellhorn or ring style  pessary. Following enrollment, each 
subject will enter a 1 -month wash out period in which they will continue using their 
current pessary so that baseline subjective and objective data can be collected. They will 
then be fit with a study pessary and enter a 3 -month treatment phase. Comparative , 
subjective  and objective data will be collected at the conclusion of the study.  
 
3.0 Background  
POP is a prevalent condition that can be observed in over 50% of women over the age of 
50.[ADDRESS_841558] 
surgery for pelvic organ prolapse is 12.6%, or 1:8.3 As the specialty of Female Pelvic 
Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) matures and surgical outcomes are being 
followed with  more scrutiny, it is becoming increasingly clear that surgical treatment 
options are less effective than once believed. The [ADDRESS_841559] estimated composite recurrence rates by 6 
years of 43%,  49%, and 57%.4  
 
The vaginal pessary is an effective treatment option for POP. A pessary is inserted in the 
vagina and acts as a shelf resting upon the pelvic floor muscles to support the descending 
organs.  A pessary is not surgically implanted and can b e removed and reinserted but is 
only effective while in situ. Often, pessaries are as effective as reconstructive surgery in 
improving the symptoms of prolapse. 77% of practicing urogynecologists recommend a 
vaginal pessary as the first line treatment opti on for their patients with POP.5 It is 
estimated that there are ~2.[ADDRESS_841560] been 
reported as high as 56%7 and include vaginal erosion, bl eeding, increased discharge, as 
well as discomfort and dysfunction in voiding and defecation.8 Furthermore, women who 
experience less severe forms of prolapse and who do not need the support of their pessary 
outside of strenuous physical activity often mus t wear their pessary when not necessary, 
which induces additional lifestyle impacts such as impairing a woman’s ability to engage 
in sexual intercourse.  
 
The two most commonly used pessaries on the market are the “ring with support ” and the 
“Gellhorn ” pessary. The Gellhorn pessary is clinically more effective to reduce the life 
impact of prolapse symptoms,9 and once fit has longer continuation rates than the ring 
with support (10.5 years vs. 1.8 years).10 Additionally, the Gellhorn successfully treated 
71% of women at [ADDRESS_841561] 
practitioners, particularly Ob/Gyn physicians who are not additionally specialized in 
FPMRS, preferentially prescribe the ring style pessaries  because they are easier and more  
intuitive to use. The Reia Vaginal  Pessary  (study pessary)  has been engineered to 
improve the comfort and ability of pessary removal and reinsertion by  [CONTACT_630738]. The Reia Vaginal  Pessary has a structural form similar to  the Gellhorn , but is 
collapsible,  and is hypothesized to be simpler and more comfortable  to use than ring style 
pessaries.   This hypothesis is  preliminarily  supported by [CONTACT_630739] , in-office trial with 15 subjects  (NCT 04275089) .    
 
4.0 Study Endpoints  
The primary and secondary endpoints of the study are described in the following table:  
Type  Name  [CONTACT_630752] -20 (PFDI -
20)  Between enrollment and 
the end of washout 
period (before treatment ) 
[Week 0 -4] and post 
treatment [Week 16]   The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - 
20 (PFDI -20) is a validated 
instrument to assess the presence and 
bother of symptoms that pelvic floor 
disorders have on health -related 
quality of life  in women. It is a 20 -
item questionnaire and the short 
form of the 46 question PFDI. There 
are three subscales: Urinary Distress 
Inventory 6 (UDI -6), Colorectal -
Anal Distress Inventory 8 (CRADI -
8), and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse 
Distress Inventory 6 (POPDI -6). The 
overall score range is [ADDRESS_841562] that pelvic floor 
dysfunction has on a patient's life. 
The minimal important change in the 
  
 DOCUMENT 
NUMBER  CP-002-[ADDRESS_841563] in women choosing 
conservative management of their 
prolapse  (i.e. a pessary)  is between 
13.5 and 18.3 points.  
Primary  Prevalence and 
severity of adverse 
events that subjects  
experience using the 
study pessary 
compared to those 
experienced with their 
current pessary  Throughout study [Week 
0-16] Adverse events 
can occur with use of the 
current pessary or during 
the treatment phase with 
the study pessary. They 
can be experience d with 
insertion or removal of 
either the current or 
study pessary, noted on 
physical exam, or 
reported at any time.  Adverse events experienced with 
insertion or removal of the current or 
study pessary include : pelvic 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_615896], perineal 
tear, failure of the study pessary to 
deploy or collapse, or pessary 
expulsion. Adverse events noted on 
physical exam include: vaginal 
irritation, vaginal ecchymosis, 
vaginal abrasions/superficial cuts, 
vaginal erosion, vaginal bleeding, 
vaginal discharge, or urinary 
retention. Adverse events which 
could occur at any time include: 
pelvic crampi[INVESTIGATOR_630729], 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_630730], urinary 
tract infection, substantial 
discomfort, pessary expulsion 
(collapsed or deployed), or adverse 
events unrelated to the pessary or 
study visit. Each event will be 
classified as mild (transient and 
easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] ), 
moderate (causing discomfort or 
interrupting usual activities), or 
severe (causing considerable 
interference with usual activities, 
may be incapacitating, or may 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).

NUMBER  CP-002-[ADDRESS_841569] and the investigator.  Subjects  will serve as their own controls and enter the 
treatment phase of the study after a 1 -month washout period of using their current 
pessary.   Subjects will be recruited for this study from panel s of patients in clinical 
practice s specializing in Female Pelvic Med icine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) . 
Inclusion will be based on pre -defined criteria outlined in “10.0 Inclusion and Exclusion 
Criteria .”  
 
The primary outcome measure will be the change in the scores of the Pelvic Floor 
Distress Inventory -20 (PFDI -20), administered first during the washout period while still 
using their current pessary and then at the conclusion of the treatment phase with th e 
study pessary. The PFDI -20 is a validated health -related quality of life instrument to 
assess the presence and bother of symptoms  in women with pelvic floor dysfunction. For 
women with relatively mild pelvic floor symptoms, a minimal important change (MI C) of 
between 13.[ADDRESS_841570] over 4 visits (Visit 0, Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3).  
 
Visit 0 [research purposes ] will involve screening, enrollment, consent , subject 
questionnaires, and chart abstraction for historical data  and will take place during a 
regularly scheduled pessary maintenance visit.  The current pessary size and type will be 
recorded, and it will be observed in situ for the presence of rotation and its ability to 
support prolapse by [CONTACT_630741] d ependent compartment of the 
subject ’s prolapse to the hymen  (POP-Q points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from 
the leading edge of the current pessary , if a Gellhorn,  to the hymen . After removal of the 
current pessary, a b aseline physical exam will be conducted to assess for pre -existing 
vaginal pathology (ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, erosions , granulation tissue , 
bleeding ) or urinary retention  associated with current pessary use . Other exam elements 
will include assessment of vulvovaginal  atrophy, pelvic muscle strength,  perineal 
descent , and POP -Q points GH (with strain) and TVL . After cleaning, t he current pessary 
will be replaced,  and each subject will begin the  washout period where they continue use 
of their current pessary. Either at th is first visit or during the washout period, each subject  
will complete the PFDI -20, PFIQ -7, and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -R to establish baseline scores.  Self-

Visit 1  [research purposes ] will aim to be scheduled between 3 and 5 weeks  from Visit 0 
(the conclusion of the washout period). Demographic and historical data will be extracted 
from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) if not completed at Visit [ADDRESS_841572]  satisfaction of the current pessary wil l be 
assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with a [ADDRESS_841573]’s prolapse to the hymen  (points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from the 
leading edge of the current pessary to the hymen. The current pessary will be removed , 
washed, placed in a sealed bag, labeled and either stored or given to the subject  for them  
to return with at their final visit . The physical exam will be repeated as in Visit 0, and the 
presence  of perineal disruption associated current pessary  removal will be noted. The 
appropriate study pessary  size for the subject based on the provided mappi[INVESTIGATOR_630731]’s current pessary  and practitioner’s expertise  will be selected at random from the 
inventory of study pessaries , removed from its seal ed bag , and the study pessary’s serial 
number (labeled on the bag) will be recorded. The subject  will be fit with the study 
pessary. If a study pessar y cannot be fit, and the patient is willing, they can be fit with a 
different sized pessary  at Visit 1 or  can remain in the study and return for a second 
attempt  to be fit with a study pessary  at Visit 2. A VAS will be used to assess the 
perceived discomfort with removal of the current pessary and , separ ately,  with insertion 
of the study pessary. For self -managers, ease of current pessary removal and reinsertion 
will be noted using a VAS and teaching will be provided on the proper technique to insert 
and remove the study pessary.  
Visit 2 [research purpos es] has the option to be omitted , at the discretion of the  
practitioner  and the subject , and will be aimed to be scheduled within 1-[ADDRESS_841574] can decide if this visit can be om itted. The 
purpose of this visit is to minimize unforeseeable risks  associated with use of the study 
pessary and/or to refit a subject with a study pessary if the original one was expelled  or 
could not be inserted during Visit 1 . If conducted in person, p hysical exam will be 
performed to assess for vaginal pathology (ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, 
erosions, granulation tissue or bleeding) or urinary retention related to the study pessary , 
and all adverse events will be recorded . The study  pessary will be observed in situ for the 
presence of rotation and its ability to support prolapse by [CONTACT_630742]’s prolapse to the hymen, as well as the 
distance from the leading edge of the  study  pessary to the hymen.  Those subjects  who

NUMBER  CP-002-[ADDRESS_841575] visit  would be fit with a new 
study pessary . 
 
Visit 3 [research purposes ] will occur at the conclusion of the 3 -month (from Visit 1) 
treatment phase - a typi[INVESTIGATOR_630732]. It can be scheduled in a window 
between [ADDRESS_841576]’s p rolapse to 
the hymen  (Points Ba and Bp) , as well as the distance from the leading edge of the study 
pessary to the hymen. A VAS will be used to assess discomfort with removal of the study 
pessary, discomfort with reinsertion of their current pessary, and t heir global satisfaction 
of the study pessary. The subject will have been instructed to return with their current 
pessary which was removed in Visit 1.  If the su bject’s current pessary is not brought to 
the visit , they will be given a new  pessary of the size and style of their current pessary. 
Each subjec t will complete the PFDI -20, PFIQ -7, and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -R for a post treatment 
comparison. For self -managers, other data collected will include frequency of removal 
and a VAS for  ease of study pessary insertion and removal.  
 
Additional Visits: Subjects will be seen as necessary and adverse events will be managed 
according  to standard of care.  If the study pessary falls out after Visit 1, the subject may 
be seen at their convenience for reinsertion or res izing.  If a study pessary cannot be fit 
and retained, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and their current pessary will 
be placed.  If the subject’s current pessary is not brought to the visit, they will be given a 
new pessary of the size and style of their current pessary.  
 
Special Circumstances: If a subject dies between Visit [ADDRESS_841577] the coroner to retrieve the study pessary.  If the study pessary cannot be 
retrieved, a copy of the death certificate will be obtained.  
 
The study pessary is the only device that will be used in this trial . There will be no 
placebo devices placed. The study pe ssary is not cleared by [CONTACT_1622], and a rationale is 
provided for a non -significant risk device claim in the attached documents.  
 
Data Collected  
See attached data collection forms. The data collected will be obtained through chart

be shredded after all potential subjects are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If they de monstrate a 
preliminary interest, they will be scheduled for the appropriate amount of time to 
complete consent in -person and enter the study as they present for their pessary 
care visit.  Additionally, the recruiter will offer to send electronically or mail 
prospective subjects a copy of the consent form to review ahead of their 
appointment. If the latter, p referred mailing addresses will be collected over the 
telephone and handwritten directly on the mailing envelope and not copi[INVESTIGATOR_630733].

visit if there is latitude in the schedule to extend the visit and complete the 
consent process and other aspects of Visit 0 . 
4. Advertisements (pending IRB approval) will be posted on so cial media , online, 
and/or in print . 
 
Payment for Participation  
Subjects  will be offered three separate  $[ADDRESS_841583] s in compensation for the ir time due 
to participation that is in excess of routine pessary care.   Visits 0  and 3 would occur as 
part of routine care.  A $[ADDRESS_841584] will be provided  after completing Visits 1 and 2 
(even if conducted as a phone call ) for extra time and travel, as well as at Visit [ADDRESS_841585] received  $[ADDRESS_841586] to be withdrawn from  the research study include:  
• The subject is found to have a condition that does not allow participation in the 
research, such as a finding upon physical examination that excludes them from the 
study . 
• The subject no longer tolerates their current pessary du ring the washout period or 
needs a different size or type of pessary during the washout period.  
• The subject is not able to be fit with a study pessary at the conclusion of Visit 2, or 
the study pessary is repeatedly expelled . 
• The study pessary causes discomfort o r adverse reaction  for which continued use is 
contraindicated.  
• The subject has a reaction that requires immediate removal of the study  pessary . 
• The subject may withdraw themselves  at any point for unforeseen circumstances.

NUMBER  CP-002-[ADDRESS_841587] could experience:  
 
• Discomfort during insertion, use, or removal of the study pessary.  
• Minor abrasion of the vagina or perineum with insertion or remova l of the study 
pessary.  
• Vaginal bleeding caused by [CONTACT_630745].  
• Increased vaginal discharge caused by [CONTACT_630745].  
• Vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_206572] (superficial or deep) from using the study pessary.  
• Difficulty urinating or leakage of urine caused by  [CONTACT_630745].  
• Difficulty with defecation caused by [CONTACT_630745].  
• Embarrassment if the study pessary falls out.  
• Minor discomfort if the study pessary rotates out of position or if it falls out.  
• Inconvenience caused by [CONTACT_630746] p essary to support the subject’s 
prolapse.  
 
Each of the risks cited above exist for any patient who chooses a pessary for management 
of their prolapse and are not unique to the study pessary.  Though inconvenient, these are 
not life threatening.   
 
The novelty of our pessary lies in its ability to f lex, which we hypothesize will make 
insertion and removal more comfortable for the subject.  Because it does not contain 
buttons, mechanism, or moving parts, it does not have mechanical features subject to 
failure.  The soft and pliable nature of the molde d silicon e should not be capable of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_630734], but this 
metric will be followed.  
 
In common clinical practice, patients often use their pessaries continuously for [ADDRESS_841588] who has signed a consent form and entered the study will be assigned a 
random study 3 -digit number ( 001-999).  Data related to the study will either be recorded  
on data collection  forms  (see attached document)  or collected in R EDCap .  The case 
report forms will not contain unique identifiers  and will  be referenced back to subjects 
only using the assigned study numbers.  A separate key will be created linking the 
subjects with their random numbers. Once the key is created it will be kept secure with 
other study related documents (including, but not limited  to, the protocol, instructions for 
use, all versions of the consent form, etc.). These documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_450928] [ADDRESS_841589] access to subjects' medical records to conduct and oversee the research. 
Excluding this circumstance, Reia, LLC will not intentionally release  patient  information 
to any individual, agency, or entity.

don’t believe a formal data safety  monitoring committee  is required. However, a data and 
safety monitoring plan will be in place. The data safety monitoring plan will focus on low 
intensity monitoring by [CONTACT_450930], comprised of the one clinician 
from each participating  site and a bio statistician . The Data Safety Monitoring Team will 
meet monthly , or sooner if necessary .  Their charge will be to review subject accrual,

adherence to study protocol, and monitor adverse events. Additionally, they will ensure 
prompt reporting of serious adverse events to WCG  IRB and the study sponsor (Reia, 
LLC).  
 
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the clinical investigator will seek information on 
adverse events by [CONTACT_450929]. Information on all adverse 
events will be recorded for review by [CONTACT_450930] . Moderate 
adverse events which represent a change in baseline from those experienced in the 
washout period will be reviewed by [CONTACT_630747]. 
Serious adverse events, as defined by [CONTACT_450932], will be reviewed by [CONTACT_450933] 24 hours and reported to WCG  IRB and the study sponsor 
(Reia, LLC). Careful monitoring of the recruitment, enrollment, study procedures, and 
adverse events will help protect the safety of the subjects and quality of the data.  
 
Any unanticipated adverse device effects that are p ossibly, probably, or definitely related 
to the study intervention will be immediately evaluated by [CONTACT_456], Reia, LLC.  If it 
is determined that the adverse device effect presents an unreasonable risk to the subjects, 
the investigation will be termina ted within [ADDRESS_841591] receiving notice.  
 
In compliance with 21 CFR §812.46, if the sponsor, Reia, LLC, discovers that the study 
team is not complying with the signed agreement, the study protocol, applicable FDA 
regulations, or any conditions for approval of this IRB application, then Reia, LLC w ill 
either secure compliance or stop delivery of the device and terminate the investigator’s 
participation.  Additionally, Reia, LLC will require the remaining investigational devices 
be returned.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
The primary somatic risks for pa rticipating in this study are associated with either 
discomfort or with pathologic changes to the vagina.  Discomfort can occur with 
insertion, removal, unintentional expulsion  or with daily use. Per convention , each 
subject will be awake and unsedated while the study pessary is being fit and  will be able 
to communicate any discomfort experienced . A physical exam will be performed at each 
study visit . Pathologic changes to the vagina , which can be noted during these times , 
include vaginal ecchymoses, abrasions, superficial cuts, erosions, granulation tissue, or 
bleeding. Subject  reported adverse events include pelvic crampi[INVESTIGATOR_630729], 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_630730], urinary tract infection, urinary retention, substant ial 
discomfort, pessary expulsion (deployed or collapsed), pessary failure to deploy or 
collapse, or adverse events unrelated to the pessary or study visit.  
 
Each a dverse event will be classified as Grade 1 or mild (easily tolerated by [CONTACT_630748]), Grade 2 or moderate (causing discomfort or interrupting usual

activities), or Grade 3 or severe (causing considerable interference with usual activities, 
may be incapacitating, or may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Treatment of any adverse event, if 
indicated, will be coordinated by [CONTACT_630749][INVESTIGATOR_450912]. Specific adverse events will be monitored as 
outlined in the  data and safety monitoring plan described in the above section . 
Additionally, the clinical research team will report any  Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3  
adverse events that are unexpected and possibly, probably , or definitely  related to the  
research procedures within 5 working days to the study sponsor (Reia, LLC ) and WCG  
IRB. Grade 4 (life threating consequences requiring immediate intervention) and Grade 5 
(death related to adverse event) that are unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related 
to the intervention will terminate the study. These adverse even ts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_630750] 24 hours and repor ted to WCG IRB and the study 
sponsor (Reia, LLC).  
 
It is unlikely that an incidental finding will be discovered since the study population 
presents for similar care every [ADDRESS_841592]'s identity. Once data collected for this research study is no longer identifiable, the 
data may be used for other purposes. Protected health i nformation will be handled as 
described in “13.0 Recruitment Methods” and “17.0 Data Management and 
Confidentiality.”

team who will guide them through the study visit . Given the sensitive nature of  
conditions treated in the O b/Gyn department, all care is delivered in are as not accessible 
to the public. The bathrooms and exam rooms are private.  The study team is comprised 
of clinicians who are sub-specialty trained in FPMRS and facile at asking the questions 
and performing the procedures outlined in the study protocol .

that section to ensure comprehension before moving on to the next section.  
 
The consent document will then be signed and dated by [CONTACT_450937] .  A copy of the consent document will be scanned into the 
subject’s medical record and a copy will be given to the subject.  The original will be 
kept in the locked cabinet with other research documents.  
 
As part of the process, subjects will be given as  much time as they need to decide on 
participation.  If they appear to be feeling pressure or need more time , they will not be 
enrolled in the study.  If at any point the subject indicates they do not want to take part in 
the research, the informed consent  process will be stopped.

The investigator teams across all sites and sponsor will meet as a group to review the 
consent form, protocol, instructions for use, data collection form, and phone script prior 
to commencing the study. The sponsor will additi onally visit each site to train the 
practitioners and set up the study materials in the designated locations.  Each member of 
the team will have adequate time to review the documentation and the opportunity to ask 
questions to the sponsor and principal inv estigator, and then sign a training log to

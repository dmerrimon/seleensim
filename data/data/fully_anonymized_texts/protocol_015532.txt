 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA 
This trial  will investigate the feasibility of implanted anchored Beacon® electromagnetic  lung 
transponders  (Calypso®) to  guide and monitor deep- inspi[INVESTIGATOR_808206] (0IBH)  treatments 
in patients with inoperable thoracic malignancies. Currently, many patients with thoracic 
tumors cannot be  treated to the  optimal intended radiation dose due to strict dosimetric 
limitations for normal tissues nearby. Furthermore, all  lung tumors  that are  treated to the full 
radiation dose exhibit tumor motion with respi[INVESTIGATOR_808207] (ITV)  that encompasses all  possible tumor positions 
during the treatment in order to avoid missing the target. This results in  the unnecessary 
treatment of larger amounts of normal lungs, esophagus and other nearby [CONTACT_808254].  
 
Several  techniques  to reduce respi[INVESTIGATOR_808208].  One of the most  promising approaches is  to immobilize  the tumor 
by [CONTACT_808255]. This has been found to result in  effective reduction of 
tumor motion as well  as an expansion of the lungs and other normal  tissues to be  moved 
away from the  radiation target. However,  0IBH is currently performed based on external 
markers and radiographic surrogates such as  the diaphragm to monitor the patient's 
breathhold. It  is known that external  markers and the diaphragm frequently do not  correlate 
well with internal  motion  and tumor  position.  Using  implanted Calypso beacons would for the 
first time allow  real-time monitoring of  tumor  position and breathhold in patients with  thoracic 
malignancies . This technology was  initially developed for prostate cancer patients with  great 
success. A new anchored  lung transponder  has been developed  for its application in thoracic 
malignancies in which there is significantly more tumor motion.  Based on our experience in 
prostate cancer patients, it is  our expectation that this transponder would improve the 
reproducibility  of localizing and monitoring tumor position during breathhold in real  time, 
decrease radiation dose to organs at risk in close  proximity to the radiation target and allow 
dose escalation to desired radiation doses. In addition, limiting tumor motion  to a minimum 
and thus increasing  our confidence in intrafraction  tumor  position would  allow  decreasing  the 
ITV margins that are currently added to the tumor to account for tumor motion. This would 
ultimately lead to improved local  control  rates and decreased adverse events attributable to 
the radiation treatments . 
Patients  who are able to hold their breath at least  for [ADDRESS_1117009] scan  in 0IBH will be obtained using the Varian® 
Real -time Position Management ™ (RPM) system. Two radiation therapy  plans will be 
developed, one based on the free-breathing [ADDRESS_1117010] setup

modified slow vital  capacity  maneuver and  DIBH  maneuver [1]  and hold their breath.  Patients 
will have  the ability  to perform this  maneuver  with or without biofeedback  from digital  goggles 
that are placed over the  patient's eyes and display the breathing trace of the Calypso 
transponders . The use of the digital  goggles will  be determined by  [CONTACT_808256].  This will allow  us to investigate  whether  real-time biofeedback 
adds to the reproducibility  of patients holding their breath. A DIBH cone- beam CT will be 
acquired in approximately  three breath- holds, once a week for standard fractionated RT 
patients  or with each  fraction  for SBRT patients. After review and approval of the  images,  the 
patient will be treated while holding their breath using the DIBH maneuver . In standard 
fractionated  RT patients the radiation treatment  will be guided by [CONTACT_808257] 2D kV imaging. The Calypso transponder  signal will be used to monitor the  level of the 
breath- hold during  treatment.  The breath- hold level  based on the Calypso transponder signal 
will be verified daily by [CONTACT_941] 2D imaging  and once a week  in 3D by [CONTACT_808258]- beam CT. 
In SBRT patients, the radiation treatment will be guided by [CONTACT_808259]- beam CT.  The Calypso transponder  signal  will be used to monitor the level of  the 
breath- hold during treatment. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808209]/her breath within the tolerance level the patient has  been 
assigned to. This will be continued up until the initially planned 30 patients are accrued..  Should 
the transponder signal  indicate that the target  has moved outside of  the preset tolerance,  the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808210]'s breathhold has 
returned to the desired target range or until  the patient's setup has been corrected. In  the 
additional  25 patients  planned, the margins will  be reduced  in a step-wise fashion.  The gate will be 
decreased 1mm  per each set of 5 patients  until the duty cycle  (beam -on time)  and number  of DIBH 
attempts  are doubled.  The gate at which  this occurs will be considered the minimum clinically 
feasible gate  
The study will determine for  the first time based on real -time tumor positioning information 
whether  patients  are able to reproducibly  hold their breath in DIBH within  excursions of  5.+/- 
0.5cm or less . Furthermore, it will determine whether visual biofeedback improves the 
reproducibility  of the breathhold.  It will provide a unique dataset that will  allow us to 
determine the concordance level  of real -time tumor position information from the  Calypso 
transponders, external  surface signal  and radiographic imaging. Ultimately, this  study will 
allow  us to quantify the decrease in radiation dose to organs at risk, decreased toxicity  and 
amount of dose escalation made possible by [CONTACT_808260] -time tumor 
position information . 
Patients will be considered evaluable for protocol when they have had successful calypso 
beacon implantation without  the beacons  migrating> 5cm,  and they have completed training 
in DIBH. In the extension of the protocol described below, 25 patients will be accrued; the 
expected time for completion of this study is 3 year from its approval.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
3.1 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_808212]- small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  remains  the malignancy  associated  with the highest 
number of cancer -related  deaths in the US.  
Patients with  inoperable early -stage NSCLC are  typi[INVESTIGATOR_808213]-dose stereotactic 
body  radiation therapy (SBRT) resulting in excellent local  control of >90%.[2- 5] SBRT is  now 
also being used for metastatic disease in  the lungs, with equally good  local control rates and 
low rates of toxicity as  observed in  early -stage NSCLC .[8-11] Currently, a  4D free breathing 
CT scan  is obtained at simulation. The 4D scan  is used to determine the entire volume swept 
out as  the tumor moves through the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]. This volume (the ITV) is further 
increased by [CONTACT_1121] 0.5 to 1 cm margins  of healthy tissue  to create the volume (the 
target) which  is treated to the prescription dose.  The margins of healthy lung are needed to 
account for positioning uncertainties during treatment. Significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_808214].  The volume of  healthy lung within  the target, and  the volumes of adjacent normal 
tissues such  as chest wall  increase  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_808215]. Since  these patients are 
usually medically inoperable due to severe emphysema or other medical comorbidities,  any 
reduction in radiation  dose  to organs  at risk is desirable.  The most common toxicities  observed 
with SBRT include respi[INVESTIGATOR_312530], esophagitis, chest wall pain, and  rib fractures. The rate 
of toxicities from SBRT appears to be directly related to the irradiated volume, the tumor

 location and the radiation  dose.[5 -7] 
 
Locally -advanced NSCLC patients  receive  fractionated RT, ideally  60 Gy in 30 fractions  when 
given with concurrent chemotherapy .[12-14] Frequently, the predicted toxicity from radiation 
dose  to the lungs and spi[INVESTIGATOR_808216] . [15, 16]  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_808217],  especially  in patients  with already  large tumors. 
The most common toxicities in this patient population are esophagitis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_808218].[14,  17] The same challenges exist for patients with limited-  
stage small  cell lung cancer treated  with chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy.[18 -20] 
Techniques  to address  intrafraction tumor  motion  include  abdominal  compression, respi[INVESTIGATOR_640003], and active breathing control (ABC) .[21] While these are all clinically approved 
techniques, they are not  currently widely used in practice. Abdominal compression  can be 
uncomfortable to the patients and does  not necessarily control  internal motion well.[22] In 
addition,  it compresses  the lungs  and does  not consistently  improve sparing of normal  tissues, 
but may actually worsen the dosimetry.[23]  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_808219].[24, 25]  ABC is  an involved process using a  spi[INVESTIGATOR_808220], and  there are problems with changes in tidal volume, volume 
expansion, patients' response and adaptation to  the system.[26, 27] These techniques all 
depend on unreliable surrogates of the target position, and frequently cannot be  tolerated by 
[CONTACT_808262], making 
them  far from ideal . 
In principle, DISH  is a promising approach to minimize respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947]. It  has been shown 
to reduce respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947], increase lung volume, and allow dose escalation. [1, 21, 28, 29] 
Currently, DISH  is feasible in about 25%  of patients who undergo lung  radiation therapy. This 
is because of the difficulty  many  patients  have in adequately  performing the modified  slow vital 
capacity maneuver currently used for DISH, which consists of a  deep inhalation, deep 
exhalation, second deep inhalation and  breath hold.  When performed well, the maneuver 
results in  a reproducible lung inflation and thereby [CONTACT_808263]. We currently use it in 
selected patients  who are able to perform this  maneuver well. Currently, DISH is  based on 
external markers e.g. RPM, or radiographic surrogates such as the diaphragm, since lung 
tumors are typi[INVESTIGATOR_808221] 2D radiographs. However, DISH  based on 
surrogates like external markers and radiographic surrogates such as the diaphragm  is 
fraught with the same problems as respi[INVESTIGATOR_808222]. There may  be a lack of correlation between external marker and internal target 
motion, e.g.  drifts or shifts of the internal target that may not be accurately detected by  [CONTACT_808264].[24, 25]  
We therefore propose using implanted Calypso lung transponders for guidance and 
monitoring of  DISH  in patients  with thoracic  malignancies who are treated with radiation 
therapy.  This would represent a significant improvement over  current DISH techniques

 by [CONTACT_808265],  real-time tumor position  information prior  to and throughout 
the radiation treatment delivery . With real-time tumor position feedback, it  will not be 
necessary to perform the difficult DIBH  maneuver; instead, a simple inhalation and 
breath hold will be sufficient to position the  tumor with high  reproducibility.  We expect 
this to  substantially improve the patient eligibility rate compared to other methods for 
DIBH  guidance, such  as spi[INVESTIGATOR_808223]. As  a result, we  expect to  more 
frequently  be able to treat patients with locally -advanced lung cancers to  the intended 
total dose  of [ADDRESS_1117013]  benefit to  patients  from using  this technique. If  successful 
this study will  lead to a new clinical technique that  will allow  us to decrease the volume 
of healthy  lung and adjacent  tissues exposed  to high doses,  thus further  decreasing the 
risk for toxicities. This makes possible a strategy for dose escalation and  thus the 
potential  for improved local  control in patients where current treatments are  limited by 
[CONTACT_808266].  
 
3.1.1 Rationale  for the use of Calypso  lung  transponders  
 
In prostate cancer RT, the use of electromagnetic  Calypso transponders has been found to 
allow  real-time tracking  of inter- and intrafraction motion,  as well as reduction in PTV margins 
and patient -reported acute morbidity.[31 -33] Submillimeter accuracy was established to a 
range of 27cm distance from the detection array  and at speeds  of up to 3cm/s,  thus making it 
the most  accurate real-time motion  monitoring device available.[34]  Electromagnetic  Calypso 
transponders revealed prostate motion of >5mm in 97% of patients, thus providing a 
significant benefit over  conventional  patient positioning. In addition, a cost -utility analysis 
demonstrated significant benefits in quality -adjusted life years (QALY)  compared to 
conventional localization.[35]  Outside of prostate cancer, these transponders have been 
shown  to also be feasible for inter-and intrafraction  motion detection in pancreatic  cancer.[36]  
The implantation of the transponders  as part of the staging  laparoscopy was  well-tolerated and 
minimal migration of the transponders was observed. It  was shown that breathholding 
significantly decreased tumor motion.  
Until recently, no such  transponder system was available for  lung tumors,  due to the difficulty 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a transponder that would stay fixed  after implantation. Varian Medical  has now 
developed a modified transponder for use in  lung cancer by  [CONTACT_808267]. The  anchors of the lung 
transponder stabilize the transponder in  small  airways of the lungs.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_808224], Tygerberg,  South  Africa,  and the University  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_808225],  Basel, 
Switzerland, has found the first use in humans to be safe and feasible.[22, 37] No patients 
developed pneumonia, pneumothorax or adverse pulmonary symptoms . Significant 
intrafraction variability of tumor motion was detected, even with the use  of external 
compression  devices.  Currently,  these anchored transponders  are being tested  for safety and 
feasibility in  the lungs in  an ongoing larger clinical study ("Evaluating an Anchored 
Transponder in  Lung Cancer Patients  Receiving Radiation Therapy" ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), 
www .clinicaltrials .gov). Preliminary findings of this study in the US showed that out of 48

 evaluable patients, two patients experienced a pneumothorax  (Grade 2), one patient had 
anesthesia- related  cardiac arrest (Grade 4), two patients experienced cough (Grade 2) and 
one patient had dyspnea (Grade 2) after the bronchoscopy,  one patient had  lung infection 
(Grade 3), and two patients had  migration of one fiducial  marker each that  did not impact the 
ability  to track the  tumor  during radiation treatments.[38,  51.] The use of Calypso  transponders 
holds the potential  for a great benefit of  real-time tumor position information without  the use of 
ionizing radiation from additional intrafraction imaging . Calypso transponders have been 
routinely used in our department as a motion monitoring system for prostate RT for about [ADDRESS_1117014] kV 
imaging.  
 
3.1.2 Rationale  for the use of SuperDimension®  system  and radial  probe 
Endobronchial Ultrasound  
The SuperDimension®  system is an electromagnetic  navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) system 
that allows minimally invasive procedures in  the periphery of the lungs with higher accuracy 
than conventional bronchoscopy alone[39]. It  allows bronchoscopic biopsies, fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_808226] a reduced risk of pneumothorax  as compared 
to transthoracic approaches . Given its extended range it has been shown  to reach peripheral 
lung tumors with  accuracy >80%. This system allows for virtual guidance based upon CT 
reconstructions  and electromagnetic  tracking.  Therefore, real -time confirmation can be 
provided by [CONTACT_808268] (rEBUS; Olympus Medical) which further 
improves the  accuracy.[40, 41]  In certain cases, rEBUS alone is sufficient to  localize 
peripheral pulmonary lesions.[42 -45] However, it  has been shown that the combination of 
these  technologies  provides  the highest  diagnostic  yield  for biopsies  of peripheral  lung lesions 
by [CONTACT_808269].  Both  of these localization technologies are  in 
routine use by [CONTACT_808270] . 
Prior studies have demonstrated safety in  placing other fiducial markers bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 
(ENB  +/- rEBUS) for lung tumors with low migration rates and low pneumothorax rates.[46 - 
48] Comparisons of  transcutaneous  versus ENS- guided fiducial marker placement shows a 
higher risk of pneumothorax in the transcutaneous  group.[48]  Furthermore, early studies in 
Switzerland  and South  Africa  have  shown  the feasibility, stability  and safety  of bronchoscopic 
Calypso transponder placement.[37]  We therefore propose to  use the SuperDimension  ENB 
system and rEBUS  for the placement of Calypso transponders whenever possible.  
Alternatively,  conventional  bronchoscopy  may be used for Calypso  transponder placement 
where  feasible.  Radial  probe  endobronchial  ultrasound (EBUS)  may be used when needed 
for more accurate placement of the Calypso transponders.

 3.2 Preliminary  Data 
 
DIBH  has been previously  explored  using coached breath- hold monitored by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038]  [28, 
49] and radiographic imaging and using spi[INVESTIGATOR_808227]  "ABC device" together 
with radiographic imaging[21  ][18, 27]. An initial  series of [ADDRESS_1117015] scans under 4 different respi[INVESTIGATOR_808228] 25 Gy by 30% compared to  free- 
breathing radiation plans. Patients were  able to comfortably hold their breath for 12 -16 
seconds and perform 10 -13 breath- holds in a single session.[28]  
We then showed  that coached DIBH  with spi[INVESTIGATOR_808229].[1] Patients were 
initially  maintained at quiet tidal  breathing,  followed by  a deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], a deep expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
a second deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and breath- hold in deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (DIBH). Simulation, 
verification and radiation treatments took place during this  last phase of DIBH. Seven 
patients received a total  of 164 treatment sessions with excellent tolerability. None of the 
seven patients  needed to discontinue  treatment  or resume the free-breathing backup method  
due to fatigue or inability  to perform  the DIBH  maneuver.  On average,  the radiation  dose could 
be increased from 69.4 Gy to 87.9 Gy without increasing the risk of toxicity by [CONTACT_808271].  
In a subsequent analysis of 7  patients  undergoing over 250 treatments, we found that 
reproducibility  was excellent as judged by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_808230] a surrogate. Presumed respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]- dependent  tumor motion was thus 
significantly reduced from 0.8 +/ - 0.5cm to 0.02 +/ - 0.14 cm  (mean and  standard deviation) 
compared to free breathing.[49]  The main  advantages  observed  with the use of DIBH  were  an 
increase in lung volume and motion of the PTV away  from critical  structures, e.g.  spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Thus, 
DIBH  is an excellent  tool to decrease target  motion,  decrease radiation  dose  to normal  organs 
at risk and thus  allow dose escalation to the tumor . DIBH treatments are currently clinically 
used  in our department in appropriate patients. However, all  DIBH  treatments to date have 
relied  on external  or indirect markers  as surrogates, sometimes  combined with fluoroscopy or 
radiographic imaging for position verification.  Given the potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_808231],  we propose to investigate and  improve DIBH treatment delivery using real -time 
tumor position information from implanted electromagnetic  Calypso anchored transponders.  
In addition,  the use of Calypso  anchored  transponders  would  simplify  the DIBH  maneuver  to 
a single, comfortable breathhold, thus  making it  an attractive treatment option  for a wider 
patient population.  
Early  studies  in Switzerland and South Africa  have shown  the feasibility, stability  and safety of 
bronchoscopic Calypso anchored transponder placement.[37]  They have also demonstrated 
successful  intrafraction motion detection.[22]  An ongoing prospective international trial 
explores the safety and  feasibility of endobronchial implantation of these electromagnetic 
fiducials.  Interim results reported at ASTRO 2012 showed that 149  transponders were 
successfully implanted in  48 patients.[38,  51.] Two patients developed cough (G2), 1 patient

 had dyspnea (G2)  after bronchoscopy, two patients had pneumothoraces  (G2), one patient 
had an anesthesia- related cardiac arrest (G4), and one patient had a  lung infection (G3) 
concurrent  with marker  migration.  One other  patient  experienced an asymptomatic  migration 
of one transponder in a  large  airway that did  not prevent localization and tracking by  [CONTACT_808272]. Positional stability of these transponders is  therefore 99% to date.  
4.0 OVERVIEW OF  STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
4.1 Design  
 
The primary  objective  of this study  is to evaluate  the feasibility  of Calypso transponders as 
an internal tumor surrogate to guide DIBH radiation treatments in real time.  
 
The use of Calypso transponders has  the potential to  result in improved reproducibility  of 
tumor positioning during DIBH treatments. We therefore plan to analyze the obtained 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_808232]  a set of  secondary objectives. These  include a comparison of  the 
reproducibility  of DIBH tumor position with visual versus without visual biofeedback  (for 
patients who agree to use the digital  goggles), measurement of any  residual intrafraction 
tumor  motion,  improvement in  normal  tissue  dosimetry  during DIBH based on the Calypso 
lung transponder signal  as a surrogate, and determination of any increase  in dose 
escalation and the potential for decreasing margins made possible by [CONTACT_808261]- guided 
DIBH. Given the successful radiation localization in the first 25  patients, we will  also aim 
to determine the  minimum clinically feasible gate  margin for  radiation. We will reduce the 
gate from +/ -5mm by 1mm for every 5  patients treated. Once the minimum gate is 
determined,  the remaining patients will be treated at  +1mm from this value. We will also

 4.2 Intervention 
 
The Calypso signal will  be used to verify and monitor the patient's DIBH maneuver at  each 
treatment session. In addition, physician evaluation of  patient setup  accuracy will  be 
performed using all available images  and adjustments will  be made as per standard practice. 
Should the transponder signal  indicate that the target has  moved outside of  the preset 
tolerance, the system will automatically hold  further radiation  treatment delivery until  the 
patient's breathhold has  returned to the desired target range or until  the patient's setup has 
been corrected.  
For imaging, we will use the  on-board kV imaging system.  Patients  undergoing SBRT will 
receive standard CBCTs for patient setup, but no more than [ADDRESS_1117017]  for protocol  purposes.  A maximum  of 8 CBCTs  over the entire 
treatment course will be permissible for protocol purposes in patients undergoing 
conventionally fractionated RT.  
Radiation therapy  dose guidelines, treatment  planning  process  and followup  will not be 
changed by [CONTACT_808274].  
 
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
The major components required for this study are the anchored Calypso beacon 
transponders, the SuperDimension electromagnetic  navigation bronchoscopy system, 
Olympus  radial  probe endobronchial  ultrasound and RPM system  on the simulator  and the 
Calypso tracking system at the treatment machine.  
The anchored Calypso beacon transponders and training and user documentation will be 
provided by [CONTACT_808275], Palo Alto, CA, as  part of a  research agreement. The 
Calypso Anchored beacon transponders received FDA 510(k) clearance. Previously, a 
physician- sponsored  investigational  device exemption {IDE) application had  been approved 
by [CONTACT_808276] (FDA) to permit the use of Anchored Beacon Transponders in  lung for this study. A cross- reference to the IDE for the ongoing Calypso 
feasibility trial  which is already  on file at the FDA has been kindly  provided by [CONTACT_808277].
 
The SuperDimension  ENB and Olympus rEBUS are both in routine use by  [CONTACT_808278]  (EWC), Locatable Guides  (LG),  and the planning and navigation  software.  
Prior  to undergoing  treatment,  the patient  will have a CT chest  for Navigation performed at 
MSKCC.  The images  obtained  from this specially formatted CT scan  will be uploaded into 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 13- 174 A(15)  
Approval  date:  26-Dec-[ADDRESS_1117018](s)  to the lesion will be selected  and confirmed.  This 
"patient plan" will be brought to  the operating room for use during  the placement of the 
Calypso fiducials, as part of the standard use of the SuperDimension  ENB system.  The 
following is an outline of the basic schema of how the procedure will  be performed:  
 
Bronchoscopic  Intervention  with Calypso  beacon  transponder  placement:  
 
1. Pre-operative "patient  plan"  created and confirmed to be appropriate for beacon 
transponder placement  
2. Anesthesia  induction  via laryngeal  mask  airway  or endotracheal  tube 
3. Standard  bronchoscopic  evaluation  of the airways  
4. The LG and EWC  are advanced through the working channel  of the 
bronchoscope  
5. Registration  of the SuperDimension ENB  system  3-D model  with the airways  in 
real time is performed  
6. Navigation of the LG and EWC to the lesion of interest  
7. Flouroscopy to confirm  location of EWC  and that it does  not move during the 
placement of the beacon transponders  
8. Removal  of the LG while  maintaining  the EWC  in place  
9. Confirmation  with rEBUS  that the EWC  is at the lesion of interest  
10. Placement  of [ADDRESS_1117019]-procedural  care,  including  a 
portable CXR  
During the procedure, all  care will be taken to reduce the risk of adverse events for the 
placement of the fiducials.  The use of Olympus rEBUS and  fluoroscopy, in addition to the 
SuperDimension ENB system, will further reduce the risk of adverse events, including 
pneumothorax . As previously noted, the risk of adverse events during the placement of 
fiducials  is very low, with the majority  of the risk associated with anesthesia.  [37, 46-48, 50]. 
There is an inherent increased risk for these patients since they  will have to undergo a 
bronchoscopy for the placement of  fiducials as part of the radiation therapy, unlike patients 
who are undergoing radiation  therapy  without  fiducial  placement.  Since the majority  of these 
patients  have many  medical  comorbidities and  have been deemed non-operable, a complete 
pre-operative assessment will  be performed by  [CONTACT_808279],  with standard anesthesia evaluation  done  during pre-surgical  testing,  to confirm  that 
the patient is an acceptable risk for anesthesia . This may include formal cardiac and 
pulmonary studies, as well as appropriate specialty consultations,  including internal

7.[ADDRESS_1117022] taken notice of NIH/ADAMHA policies concerning the  inclusion of women and 
minorities in clinical research populations.  We expect that the study population will be fully 
representative of the range of patients  seen at MSKCC without  exclusion to age (> 18 years), 
or ethnic  background.  Given  the limited  number of  subjects to  be entered onto the study,  no 
specific outreach efforts are planned.  
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified by a member  of the patient's  treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator, or  research team at Memorial Sloan- Kettering  Cancer Center 
(MSKCC) . If the  investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their 
patient's medical  records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and 
their potential for enrolling in  the research study.  Potential subjects contact[CONTACT_808281]/research staff of the study.

eligible to  enroll  in the study and  to record appropriate contact [CONTACT_808282].  
During the  initial  conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is  necessary to  the 
recruitment and enrollment process.  The investigator/research staff may also review 
portions of their medical records at  MSKCC in order to  further assess eligibility.  They will 
use the information provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or  medical  record  to confirm  that the patient

recruitment process  outlined presents  no more than minimal  risk to the privacy of  the patients 
who are screened and  minimal PHI  will be maintained as part of a  screening log. For these 
reason, we seek  a limited  waiver  of authorization for  the purposes  of (1) reviewing relevant to 
the enrollment process; (2) conversing with patients  regarding possible enrollment; (3)  handling 
of PHI contained  within  those records and  provided by  [CONTACT_28632]; and (4) 
maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached (if applicable).  
We expect  to accrue 1-2 patients  per month  for a total of 30 patients.  
8.0 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
• Pathology  review  to confirm  diagnosis  
• History  and physical  exam  
• The DIBH maneuver consists of a comfortably deep inhalation followed by a breath 
hold. Patients will  be clinically tested  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_808234]) to  hold their 
breath for a minimum of 20  seconds xS  times in a simulated treatment position with 
their arms raised  above their  heads.  The patient  will be asked to practice  at home,  and 
coaching will be repeated at the time of treatment.  
• CT scan  of the chest  for navigation  
• Pregnancy  test, if applicable  
• Consultation with thoracic  surgery  or interventional  pulmonology  for transponder 
implantation  
 
9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
Using ENB  and rEBUS,  three  Calypso  transponders will  be bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_808235] a 
small bronchial airway according to the Anchored Beacon Transponder Instructions for Use 
provided by [CONTACT_808283]  (see section 20.0 Appendices). Two Calypso transponders will  be 
permissible if  it is technically not possible to place  three  transponders, as  the tracking  system 
works  with a minimum  of two transponders.  Placement within  [ADDRESS_1117024]  protocol.  Immobilization  will be 
in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_808236]: 13- 174 A(15)  
Approval  date:  26-Dec-2023  
17  
 between the Calypso  beacons  and the Calypso  detector  plate.  The patient will  be coached 
through the DIBH maneuver and a breath- hold level  that the patient can comfortably and 
reproducibly  achieve  using the Calypso system will  be determined. A free-breathing (FB) 4D 
CT scan  of the thorax and a CT  scan  in DIBH mode will  be obtained using the RPM  system. 
The patient's position and setup will be documented by [CONTACT_808284].  
Target volumes and  normal  structures will  be delineated on the FB scan  and on the DIBH 
scan . Target delineations will be performed on  the registered 4DCT image set and on  the 
DIBH  scan  as per current  clinical practice.  The Calypso beacons  will also be delineated on 
each phase of the 4DCT study and on the DIBH scans.  
 
Analysis of  the 4DCT will provide an initial  evaluation of  the motion concordance between the 
Calypso beacon and the RPM external marker. Two radiation treatment plans will be 
developed,  one based on the free-breathing  scan and one based on the DIBH scan . These 
will be used for dosimetric comparison of  treatment plans between a free- breathing and DIBH 
treatment. Only the  DIBH treatment plan will  be used clinically, unless a patient is  unable to 
complete the DIBH  maneuvers at  the time of treatment.  In that case, the plan based on the FB 
scan will  serve as a backup plan.  The beacon coordinates for the DIBH scan will be input to 
the Calypso system.  
 
In the additional [ADDRESS_1117025] will  then estimate  the dosimetric effects per day in case  the patient  is 
still unable to achieve adequate breath  hold the next day. Depending on the estimated 
dosimetry and the patient's reasons  for not being able to achieve breath hold,  the patient 
may be taken off protocol if unable to perform the breath hold to within +/ - 5 mm for 3 
consecutive treatment days . Patients who are taken off protocol prior to treatment 
completion will be treated based on the free- breathing  treatment planning scan for the 
remainder of the radiation treatment course.  
 
9.1 For patients  undergoing SBRT  in 10 or less fractions, the following  procedures will be 
performed:  
1. Standard setup  procedures  based on external  tattoos will be performed.  
 
2. The Calypso  antenna will be deployed and positioned over the patient's  chest.  Tracking  of 
the Calypso transponder signal will commence.

Approval  date:  26-Dec-[ADDRESS_1117026] will  coach the  patient on 
how to hold their breath during the treatment. On treatment days with visual feedback, the 
patient will  be able to view and control  his/her breathing through biofeedback using goggles 
(Myvu  Personal  Media Viewer, Myvu Corporation)  or an iPhone that displays  the Calypso 
trace . The couch position will  be adjusted by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_808237].  The Calypso 
trace will be set to zero based on the DIBH level.  
4. The patient  will resume regular  breathing and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808238].  
 
5. The patient will be  remotely asked to  repeat the DIBH maneuver and a CBCT will be 
obtained over several  breathholds  (exact  number  depending  on the patient's  ability  to hold 
their breath)  using partial  arcs and the assigned  breath  hold tolerance  window.  
6. The CBCT images will  be evaluated and the patient will  be repositioned for a soft tissue 
match  as needed.  The soft tissue  match  will then be evaluated and approved by [CONTACT_808285]. The isocenter coordinates in  Calypso will be 
changed based on the patient's repositioning shift dictated by [CONTACT_808286]. 
No more than [ADDRESS_1117027] fractionated  RT the following  procedures will be 
performed:  
1. Standard setup  procedures  based on external  tattoos  will be performed.  
 
2. The Calypso  antenna will be deployed and positioned over the patient's  chest.  Tracking  of 
the Calypso transponder signal will commence.  
Optional:  In patients  where the Calypso  antenna external  markers  detected by [CONTACT_28920]-house 
infrared tracking system can be  arranged in such a way  that both signals  can be obtained

 simultaneously  (depending on  body habitus), a free- breathing  trace of the Calypso 
transponders  over 2 minutes  in combination with the external  marker  signal  will be obtained . 
These will be used for future analysis and building of an  external/internal  respi[INVESTIGATOR_808239].  
3. For patients who have been selected to use the digital  goggles, the DIBH  maneuver will be 
performed  with visual  biofeedback at  least once a week and at least one  fraction will  be done 
without visual  feedback .During  treatment  the radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808240]. On treatment days with visual  feedback, the patient 
will be able to view and control  his/her breathing through biofeedback using goggles (Myvu

couch position will  be adjusted by  [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_808241]. The Calypso trace will  be set 
to zero based on the DIBH level.  
 
4. The patient  will resume  regular  breathing and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808238].  
 
5. The patient  will be remotely  asked  to repeat  the DIBH  maneuver and a set of orthogonal  kV 
images  will be obtained. These will be used to verify that no beacon has migrated from its 
initial position.  
7. Once a  week, the patient will  be remotely asked to  repeat  the DIBH  maneuver and a CBCT 
will be obtained over several  breathholds  (exact  number  depending on the patient's  ability  to 
hold their breath) of [ADDRESS_1117028] images will  be evaluated and the patient will  be repositioned for a soft tissue 
match  as needed.  The soft tissue  match  will then be evaluated and approved by [CONTACT_30780]. The isocenter coordinates in Calypso will be changed based on the patient's 
repositioning shift dictated by [CONTACT_808286] . 
 
The patient will then be remotely asked to reproduce the DIBH maneuver with a tolerance 
window  to which  they have been assigned  and be treated in DIBH  Number of  beam holds, 
treatment interruptions  and total  treatment time from first beam -on time to the last beam- off 
time will be recorded by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Beacon position  during DIBH  will be monitored by [CONTACT_137335][INVESTIGATOR_808242]. If the Calypso beacon signal  indicates that the  tumor has  moved outside of  the 
tolerance window, the radiation beam will  be automatically held  by [CONTACT_808287]. For treatments between CBCT sessions, the patient will  be 
set up according to  steps 1 -4, kV images will be acquired (Step 5) to verify beacon stability 
and the day's treatment with breath- hold will proceed without further imaging.

3. Definition of an Unexpected Adverse  Event  
 
a. An Unexpected AE is an experience not previously reported (in nature, severity, 
or incidence)  in the current  Investigator's  Brochure or general  investigational  plan.  
Evaluation  of SAE:  
Review of the patient record including the treatment dosimetry will  be undertaken by [CONTACT_28824]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_808243],  discontinue the study  altogether,  or to modify  the protocol  prior to enrolling  more 
patients pending the results of the  review. However, if the SAE meets the criteria for the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], as defined in Section 14.0, the trial will be stopped.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
Primary  objectives:  
 
• To evaluate  the feasibility  of Calypso  transponders as  an internal  tumor  surrogate to guide 
DIBH radiation treatments in real time.  
 
•  Feasibility is defined as  completion of all  treatments using the DIBH treatment plan  and 
Calypso transponders. Patients who cannot have  their transponders placed accurately 
bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_808244]- guided DIBH will  not be possible will be considered 
a failure . Patients who  are removed from the protocol  as a result of  being unable to perform 
the breath hold  for 3 consecutive treatment days at any point in  the treatment course for 
reasons that  are not  related to the Calypso transponders, Calypso detection or 
complications  of using the Calypso  implantation or system  (e.g. disease progression,  severe 
side effects  from treatment, e.g. esophagitis, infections, failure to thrive, generalized 
weakness, low  blood counts etc.), will  be replaced by [CONTACT_808288]. Those 
patients will  be treated with the free- breathing  backup radiation treatment plan . The reason 
for the patient's inability to hold their breath will be recorded.  
Secondary objectives:  
 
• To compare the reproducibility  with visual  versus without  visual  biofeedback.  
• To assess differences in  the ability  of maintaining the DIBH maneuver within the fate with 
and without visual biofeedback  
• To measure the  residual  intrafraction tumor motion and associated improvement in 
normal  tissue  dosimetry  during DIBH  based on the Calypso  lung transponder signal  as a 
surrogate  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 13- 174 A(15)  
Approval  date:  26-Dec-2023  
24  
 • To measure the increase in dose escalation  and the potential  for decreasing  margins 
made possible by [CONTACT_808261]- guided DIBH  
• To determine the minimum clinically  feasible gate margin for radiation  
• To assess tumor  shrinkage, beacon position  and centroid changes in conventionally 
fractionated patients  
• To assess intra - and inter-fraction  variation in lung volume preservation of  multiple DIBH 
maneauvers  
Reproducibility  of using internal tumor surrogates (Calypso beacons) during repeated deep 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_808245].  The ability  to maintain the breathhold to within 
the tolerance level  to which they have been assigned will  be assessed. Number of  beam  holds 
and treatment interruptions will  be recorded as  an objective measure of the patient's ability to 
maintain their breathhold.  Whether or not visual biofeedback will aid in the ability to  hold their 
breath reliably and  within the  target region will  be assessed using the number of treatment 
interruptions.  We will also assess differences in  duty cycle and number of  DIBH attempts with 
and without visual biofeedback. Differences in  the ability of maintaining the DIBH maneuver 
within the gate with and without visual biofeedback  will be measured as  duty cycle, a 
quantifiable measure of how long it  takes to  deliver a radiation treatment. It is related to how 
well patients can hold their breath and the tumor in the target position. Each patient will have 
the goggles 50% of the treatments and without goggles the other 50% of the time. Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests will be done to compare the duty cycle.  
The residual  intrafraction motion and drift during DIBH will  be determined based on the 
Calpyso signal  traces which may  provide critical insight into  the ability  to immobilize the 
tumor by [CONTACT_808289]. Beacon position stability will  be determined on acquired cone- beam CTs by 
[CONTACT_808290] {GTV)  as well 
as the distance of the beacons  to each other.  Improvement of  normal  tissue  dosimetry based 
on Calypso -guided DIBH will  be determined  from the treatment plans developed on the free - 
breathing  and DIBH  simulation  CT scans . Specific dosimetric parameters  will include the chest 
wall V30, total  lung V20,  mean lung dose, lung toxicity model  metrics (Lyman model  NTCP 
and parallel  model  fraction damaged (fdam)), mean and maximum esophageal dose, and 
maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_522263].  
 
To determine the  minimum clinically feasible gate margins we will decrease the gate in  a 
step-wise progression as  far as a  minimum of 2 mm. The gate will be reduced from +/ - 
5mm  by 1mm  for every  5 patients treated. Halving of  the duty cycle will  be considered the 
minimum gate that is  clinically feasible . Once the minimum gate is determined, the 
remaining patients will be treated at +1mm from this value . 
 
In the additional 10 conventionally fractionated patients, tumor shrinkage will be 
summarized as  relative shrinkage in a percentage. Beacon position and  centroid are  3D 
coordinates that will  be determined as  a distance  from a landmark such  as a bone or the 
carina.

Lung volume preservation will  be assessed  on wide field of view cone- beam CTs  and 
compared intra - and interfraction within each patient to check for reproducibility or 
variability of lung volumes across multiple DIBH maneuvers . 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
1. Found to be ineligible for the protocol  as described in  the section  on Criteria  for 
Patient/Subject  Eligibility  
2. Patient  and/or  guardian requests  to withdraw from study  for any reason  
3. Referring  physician requests  to withdraw  from study  for any reason,  including  believing 
that it would be in the patient's best interest  
4. Refusal  of patient  to continue treatment  and/or  observations  
5. Loss  to follow -up 
6. Patient  death  
7. Calypso beacon migration  of >5cm  from original  implantation  position may be taken  off 
study if the Calypso signal can no longer be detected  
8. Patient  unable  to adequately  perform  the breath  hold for [ADDRESS_1117032] their transponders 
placed accurately  bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_808246]- guided DIBH will not be possible as a 
consequence of that will be considered a failure.  Patients who are removed from the protocol as a 
result of being unable to  perform the  breath hold  for 3 consecutive treatment days at any point in  the 
treatment course for reasons that  are not related to the Calypso transponders, Calypso detection or 
complications of using the Calypso implantation or system (e .g. disease progression, severe side 
effects from treatment, e.g. esophagitis , infections, failure to  thrive , generalized weakness, low blood 
counts etc.),  will be replaced by [CONTACT_808291].  The patients who are removed will  be treated 
with the free-breathing backup radiation treatment plan . The reason for the patient's inability to hold 
their breath will be recorded.  
 
For this objective the first and second set  of [ADDRESS_1117033] 25  evaluable (DIBH training can be 
done and Calypso beacons can be implanted without migrating > 5cm) patients can be used in

 assessing the feasibility rate.  To establish the decision rule we will  compute the sample feasibility 
rate (i.e., the number of  patients who could be successfully treated divided by [CONTACT_808292], which we expect to  range from 25 to 30) and form an 80% 2- sided Clopper - 
Pearson exact  confidence interval.  If the lower  bound of this exact confidence interval  is greater than 
66% then we  will declare this procedure feasible. Namely, we will  test the  hypotheses  Ho: 9<=0.66 
vs. H1: 9>0.66 at  alpha=0.05,  where [ADDRESS_1117034] statistic will  be the  lower 
bound of the 90% 2-sided  Clopper -Pearson exact  confidence interval  for binomial trials.  Equivalently, 
this test statistic can  be written as  Beta(0.05, X,  N+1-X), i.e.,  the 5th-percentile  of the beta distribution 
with two parameters X and N+1- X, where X and N denote the number of successes and the total 
sample size (expected to be from 25 to 30), respectively . When the sample size is as small as 25, 
the power of  rejecting the null hypothesis is  61%,  84% and 97% when  the true feasibility rate  is 0.80,  
0.85 and 0.90, respectively. When the sample size is as large  as 30, such power becomes 61%,  85% 
and 97%. Since we expect the feasibility rate to be  around 0.85, the sample size is  sufficiently large. 
We expect to finish the recruitment in 4 years.  
 
For protective purposes we will implement a  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_808247] (related to the proposed procedure). If 6  or more events (i .e., procedure- related 
pneumothorax  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) among the first 30 patients, or 11 or more events among the total 
55 patients we  plan to  enroll are observed, we will halt the trial to thoroughly investigate such events. 
This sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_808248]:  
 
True event  probability I0.[ADDRESS_1117035] secondary  objective, we will compare the visual  vs no visual  biofeedback  treatments (for 
patients who  agree to use the digital  goggles) by  [CONTACT_808293].  We expect 
that there will  be fewer treatment interruptions when using biofeedback. To this  end Wilcoxon 
signed- rank tests will  be conducted based on the  patients who can successfully be treated.  
 
For the 2nd secondary objective, we will assess differences in the ability of maintaining the DIBH 
maneuver within the fate with and without visual  biofeedback.  Such differences will  be measured 
as duty cycle, and  will be compared using Wilcoxon signed- rank tests based on the patients  who 
can successfully be treated.  
 
For the  3rd secondary objective, the  residual  intrafraction tumor  motion  (surrogated by  [CONTACT_808261]) will 
be measured in all 3 dimensions and the euclidean distance will  be calculated, which will  then be 
correlated with the normal tissue dosimetry (see end of Section 12 .0). Patients will  receive multiple 
fractions and  thus multiple measurements of  such  distance will  be obtained from  the same patients.

 These repeated measures will  be averaged for each patient and  the correlation will be examined by 
[CONTACT_712125]. If such continuous data are skewed, we may either use an appropriate 
monotone transformation, or examine the  nonparametric  correlation coefficient (such as Spearman 
rank correlation coefficient) between the tumor motion and the normal tissue dosimetry instead . 
 
For the  4th secondary objective, the  potential increase in dose  escalation and decrease in margins 
made  possible by [CONTACT_808261] - guided DIBH, as  contrasted to those  obtained from the 40 CT scan,  will 
be formulated as pair data from each patient and tested by [CONTACT_498766]- rank tests . 
Dosimetric parameters  listed  at the end of Section  12.0 will be used again for such  analysis . 
 
The 5th secondary  objective does  not require  statistical  analysis.  See Section  12.0 for details.  
 
For the 6th secondary objective, tumor shrinkage, beacon position and centroid changes in 
conventionally  fractionated patients (totally 10),  all measured as  continuous variables, will  be 
summarized descriptively.  
 
For the 7th secondary objective, intra-  and inter-fraction variation in  lung volume preservation of 
multiple DIBH maneauvers will be recorded within each patient and summarized descriptively.  
 
15.0 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION AND  RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Research Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Obtain 
informed consent, by [CONTACT_30608].  During the  registration process registering individuals will be required to 
complete a protocol specific  Eligibility Checklist. The  individual signing the Eligibility Checklist 
is confirming that the  participant is eligible to  enroll in the study.  Study staff are responsible 
for ensuring that all institutional requirements necessary to  enroll a participant to the study 
have been completed . See related Clinical Research Policy and Procedure #401 (Protocol 
Participant Registration).  
 
15.2 Randomization 
No randomization will occur  in this study.  
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) and/or Clinical  Research Associate (CRA) will be 
assigned to the study.  The responsibilities  of the CRC or  CRA include  project  compliance, 
data collection, abstraction and  entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem 
resolution and prioritization,  and coordination of the activities of the protocol study team .

Approval  date:  26-Dec-[ADDRESS_1117036].  
 
16.1 Quality  Assurance 
Regular  registration  reports  will be generated to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration data.  Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess  missing data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the  study period and potential problems  will be brought to 
the attention of the study team for discussion and action.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted by [CONTACT_123894], at a minimum of  two times per year, more frequently if indicated.  
 
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by  [CONTACT_28642] 2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies set forth by  [CONTACT_30590] "Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data  and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials" which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html.  The DSM Plans  at MSKCC  were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There are several  different mechanisms by [CONTACT_808294], safety 
and quality . There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education 
on clinical research QA) and  departmental procedures for  quality  control,  plus there are two 
institutional committees that are  responsible for monitoring the activities of our  
clinical  trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety Monitoring  Committee (DSMC)  for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and  the Data  and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase Ill 
clinical trials, report to  the Center's Research Council  and Institutional Review Board.  
During  the protocol  development and  review  process, each  protocol will  be assessed  for its 
level  of risk and degree  of monitoring required . Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial  sponsored, NCI  cooperative group,  etc.) will  be addressed 
and the monitoring procedures will  be established at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
 
17.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Risks:  There are small  risks  of side  effects related to the implantation of the Calypso 
transponders  into small  airways  near the tumor  or the tumor  itself. These  risks  include but 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 13- 174 A(15)  
Approval  date:  26-Dec-[ADDRESS_1117037]  obstruction, pneumothorax, device embolization, 
device migration and pneumonia.  Radiation exposure  due to additional  protocol  imaging is 
minimal. Doses required for kV conebeam imaging are on the order of 3- 4 cGy per scan; 
doses for standard radiographic imaging are less  than 0.1  cGy /image.  
 
Costs:  All of the treatments, studies, and procedures are considered standard of  care, 
including the placement of standard  fiducials for radiation therapy.  The patient and/or 
patient's insurance will  be responsible for all  charges, which are  part of the standard of care . 
No financial  reimbursement or  other  financial  incentive will  be provided  for patients  to enroll  in 
this study.  The Calypso beacons will  be provided by [CONTACT_808295] -billable.  
The implantation of the beacons will  be billable to  insurance. Any complications from the 
Calypso  beacon implantation will be managed as per responsible physician and any tests or 
interventions related to the management of potential complications will be billed to the 
patient's insurance.  Performing the  placement of the Calypso beacon transponders in the 
context  of a clinical trial will allow  for a more indepth and objective evaluation of  the system.  
 
Benefits: There  is a potential clinical benefit  from this  clinical trial in terms of decreased 
toxicity  from radiation  treatments  and/or  achieving a higher  total treatment  dose  due to DIBH. 
We hope that in the future, knowledge from this  trial will help patients that  are candidates for 
the implantation of Calypso transponders as well as patients who are not candidates by 
[CONTACT_808296] -time tumor position changes with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
Side  effects:  Side effects  of the study  specific to the implantation of the fiducial  markers  are 
anesthesia risk,  bleeding, infection, pulmonary toxicities, and migration of the fiducial 
markers.

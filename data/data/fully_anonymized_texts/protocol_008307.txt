Title: Tendinopathy Education on the Achilles (TEAch)  
NCT: 04059146  
Document Date : 4/12/22  
Document type : Study protocol  with Statistical Analysis Plan  
  
Description of the clinical study  
This is a randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled trial with individuals who have chronic Achilles 
tendinopathy (AT). This study investigates the effects of education on outcomes (specified in hypotheses 
below) related to participation in an exercise p rogram. Participants were  randomized to one of two educational 
programs. All participants receive d the same exercise intervention. This study enroll ed (consented and 
randomized)  66 participants  to complete 2 evaluation sessions (baseline, 8 -week follow -up), 6-[ADDRESS_752791] (between baseline and 8 -week follow -up), and 1 survey -based  evaluation 
sessions (12 -week follow -up).  
 
Specific Aims  
Specific Aim 1. Determine if an educational intervention focusing on a biopsychosocial approach to pain 
mechanisms (i.e. Explain Pain) compared to education based primarily on a biomedical model geared at 
peripheral pain mechanisms (i.e. standard of care) is more effective at reducing pain and disability in a 
feasibility RCT exercise program  for Achilles tendinopathy.  
We hypothesize  that a biopsychosocial approach to education will decrease pain and disability more 
than the standard of care for patients with AT after an 8 -week intervention and be maintained at 12 -
week follow -up. 
Specific Aim  2. Determine which central pain mechanisms (nociplastic pain, pain psychology, motor 
dysfunction) are improved by [CONTACT_573380], regardless of education group.  
We hypothesize  that exercise will improve all three central pain mechanisms.  
 
Study Design  
Interventional, 2 -arm randomized, controlled trial with parallel assignment.  
 
Study Methods  
Evaluation sessions involve d the following 4 types of testing  a 0-weeks and 8 -weeks .  
1) Clinical exam (including ultrasound imaging)  
2) Movement analysis and verbal pain rating  
3) Sensory testing (Pain pressure threshold at the hamstring and Achilles bilaterally; Conditioned pain 
modulation at the Achilles)  
4)  Questionnaires (demographics, symptom description, and psychological)  
 
In addition, participants completed  questionnaires again at 12 -weeks.  
 
Participants attend ed 7 treatment sessions over 8 weeks  that included:  
1) Questionnaires (exerci se adherence, educational quizze s, symptom description)  
2) Exercise participation  where p articipants were  given exercises to do at home in between treatment 
sessions. Participants receive d instruction from a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_573377].  
3) Education  where p articipants were  given homework and online quizzes to do at home in between 
treatment sessions. The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_573378]. 
 
Additional description of the p rimary outcome measures are provided  below.  
a) Self -reported pain : The numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)  was used to monitor pain with rest and activity 
throughout study participation , including single limb heel raises .[1] 
b) Self -reported disability: Disability was assessed with the PROMIS physical function  computer adaptive 
test, which has been used in orthopaedic and Achilles tendon populations. [2, 3]   
c) Performance -based function : Plantarflexor endurance was quantified with the maximum number of single 
limb heel raises the participant could perform with good technique .  
d) Psychosocial factors: The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK)  rates current level of fear about 
movement causing pain and injury. [4]  
e) Nociplastic pain: Conditioned pain modulation (CPM)  was assessed utilizing : 
• Test stimulus  
o Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) are collected at the Achilles (centered around most painful 
region) with a pressure algometer (Somedic Algometer Type II, Horby [CONTACT_103468], probe 1cm2) at 
a rate of 50 kPa/sec. PPTs will be collected at the Achilles (painful side) during the conditioning 
stimulus.  
o PPTs are the average of a series of [ADDRESS_752792] painful . 
o To minimize temporal summation the inter -stimulus interval will be >10 seconds  
o PPTs are collected with hand in room temperature water and during the conditioning stimulus 
starting at 20s. The order of collecting PPT during room temperature water vs during  the 
conditioning stimulus  was pseudo -randomized based on study id (even or odd) . 
o Participants were  instructed to press a trigger when the pressure first becomes painful (pain > 
0/10) 
• Conditioning stimulus  
o Participant’s right hand was immersed up to the wr ist in ice water (6 +0.5°C) for a total of 2 
minutes  
o The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was maintained by [CONTACT_573381].  
 
  
 
Sample  size justification  
 
Specific Aim 1 : This analysis will compare the between  group (biopsychosocial vs biomedical approach to 
education) changes in pain and disability scores from baseline to 8 -weeks and to 12 -weeks follow -up for 
participants with AT participating in an exercise program. Based on findings from Moseley et al. [5] for an RCT 
comparing a [ADDRESS_752793] of care in 49 
patients with chronic low back pain, we anticipate between group differences with Cohen’s d ≥0.36  for pain 
(between group difference across 2 t ime points=0.75, SD of 1.[ADDRESS_752794] size of f=0.36, 
correlation between repeated measures=0.5) and disability (between group difference across 2 time 
points=1.95, SD of 2.[ADDRESS_752795] size of f=0.42, correlation between repeated 
measures=0.5). [5] Under these assumptions, a sample size of 30 patients per group would be needed to reach 
80% power for the time averaged difference between two group means in a repeated measures design with 
=0.025 (Bonferroni correction  of 0.05/2 for 2 outcomes in Aim 1) to detect a between group effect size of 
0.36.  
Specific Aim 2 : This analysis will compare the within  group changes (baseline to 8 -weeks) in central pain 
mechanisms (nociplastic pain, psychosocial factors, motor dysfunct ion) with an exercise intervention  for 
participants with AT, regardless of educational group. The power analysis for this aim is based on data from [ADDRESS_752796] had a moderate to large (Cohen’s d ≥0.47) treatment effects on central pain mechanisms. A 
double -blinded, cross -over study led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sluka [6] found that Active -TENS improved CPM more than 
Placebo -TENS (Mean difference between treatments over time=18.8%, SD=33.4%, effect size= 0.56). A study 
by [CONTACT_573382] [7] reported a mean increase in PPT at the Achilles on the involved side during CPM testing in 
the AT population was 36.4 + 68.1 kPa (14.4% increase, before= 253 +80.5 kPa, during= 289.4 [PHONE_11883] kPa). An 
18.8% improvement with treatment over time would correspond to  an 84kPa (33.2%) increase in PPT during 
CPM in the AT population. Cai et al. [8] found that a 4 -week cognitive b ehavioral therapy program reduced fear 
of movement by 8.1 points with a SD of 5.44 (effect size= 1.5). Based on our preliminary data from the K99 
phase, there was a mean improvement of 3.4 repetitions (SD of change= 6.7) in heel rise performance after an 
anesthetic injection for the AT group (effect size=0.51). Type I error rate of =0.017 (Bonferroni correction of 
0.05/3 for 3 outcomes in Aim 2) will be used for this aim to adjust for the multiple comparisons. The sample 
size of [ADDRESS_752797] size of d ≥0.43 with 80% power under 
these assumptions.  
Allowing for a 40% ineligible rate after consent and 10% dropout rate after randomization, we will consent 110 
participants, enroll/randomize [ADDRESS_752798] sizes for 
the primary outcome 
measures based on 
previously published 
differences or clinically 
meaningful (MCD/MCID) 
and standard deviation 
(SD) for the Achilles 
tendinopathy (AT) 
population ( Table 1 ).  
For Aims [ADDRESS_752799] any cross -over between groups. This level of 
attrition is similar to that observed in prior studie s conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Sluka and Rakel at the University of Iowa 
in intervention trials including exercise. [12, 13]  
 
 Table 1.  Published differences or clinically meaningful (MCD/MCID) and 
standard deviation (SD) for the Achilles tendinopathy (AT) population were used 
to calculated estimated effect sizes of the primary outcomes for Aims 1 and 2.

be presented as mean ± SD for normally distributed data and median with interquartile ranges for non -normally 
distributed data. When the normality assumption is not met, transformation, such as log, will be used to 
complete planned parametric analyses.  Type I error rate  will be maintained  at 0.[ADDRESS_752802] of the interventions on the primary outcomes for pain (NPRS) and 
disability (PROMIS physical function)  from baseline to [ADDRESS_752803] of the interventions by [CONTACT_573384] n mechanisms 
(nociplastic pain: PPT, psychosocial factors: TSK, motor control: heel raises) from baseline to 8 -weeks. 
For Aims 1 and 2, the factors in the linear mixed model will include group and time effects. In addition, 
the significance of the group*ti me interaction term, where the group*time interaction tests if the change 
over time differs between groups, will also be tested.

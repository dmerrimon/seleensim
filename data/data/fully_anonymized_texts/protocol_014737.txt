         Trigger finger corticosteroid injection with and without lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427986]-rine; a randomized, double blind controlled trial CT Number: 1064521-12  Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_427987], MD Version Date: 8/27/2019     
[8/27/[ADDRESS_541073]  Objective: To determine if there is less pain from a corticosteroid injection with or without lido-caine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427988] (stenosis tenosynovitis). Research Plan: The treatment of trigger finger involves an injection of corticosteroid (e.g., 40 mg Kenalog). Kenalog treats the underlying inflammatory pathology.  Some surgeons add lido-caine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_100789] a local anesthetic with the injection. Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427989]-sociated with a burning sensation and may be the primary pain associated with the injection. We hypothesize that a corticosteroid injection without lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427990], and equally effective in treating trigger finger. This hypothesis is based on experience injecting without lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (i.e., Kenalog only) in clinic. Comparison of these two meth-ods has not been done previously. Patients presenting to our clinic with trigger finger will have the option to electively enroll in this study comparing the two methods. Methods: Patients will be randomized into two groups with randomizing software. The two groups will include (1) 1mL corticosteroid + 1mL Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_333663] (2) 1mL cortico-steroid + 1mL saline. The surgeon (injector) will also be blinded to the selected treatment to avoid bias. The pain levels will be assessed at 1 minute after the injection using the VAS pain scale.

[8/27/2019   Page 4 of 9  1. Introduction  Trigger finger is a pathology of the flexor tendons in the fingers. Under normal physio-logic conditions, the flexor tendon slides under a close-fitting tendon sheath when the finger ex-tends or flexes. However, in some patients, the flexor tendon can become irritated and subse-quently develop inflammatory nodules. When this happens, the nodules catch the tendon sheath during finger extension and flexion. This can causes pain and dysfunction.   The treatment for trigger finger involves the injection of a corticosteroid to shrink the in-flammatory nodule on the flexor tendon. Often, the injection involves a 50:[ADDRESS_541074] compared the pain outcomes and long-term efficacy of using corti-costeroids + lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427991].  Trigger finger is present in 3-5% of the general adult population, and up to 10% of dia-betic patients 8, [ADDRESS_541075] millions of patients.   2. Objective and hypothesis The purpose of this study is to see if removing lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427992]-jections decreases pain of the shot without decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment. We hypothesize that using an injection of corticosteroids (without lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) will re-duce the of treatment.  3. Study Procedures 3.1 Study Design This study will be a prospective randomized control trial. The study will also be double blind, as the patient and physician will not know which injection is being used. Both interventions (Kena-log + Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427993]) can be classified as standard of care, as they are already being used in our clinic and by [CONTACT_427996] a similar fashion. Syringes will be pre-filled by [CONTACT_427997]: 1.     1mL 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_427994] 1ml of Kenalog 40 (2 mL total) 
[8/27/2019   Page 5 of 9 2.     1mL of 0.9% saline and 1ml of Kenalog 40 (2 mL total) Patients will have an equal (50% chance) of receiving either injection that will be determined by [CONTACT_427998]. 3.2 Data points  We will keep track of the following:  - Patient identification (medical record number) - Age - Gender - Type of Injection - Date of injection - Digit/Hand - Reported Pain Score at 1 minute - Adverse effects of injection (infection, skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], atrophy) We will also be keepi[INVESTIGATOR_427995]:  - Diabetes (insulin dependent, non-insulin dependent) - Hypothyroidism - Chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] - Smoking history  - Carpal tunnel syndrome - Rheumatologic conditions   3.[ADDRESS_541076] of care, and are already used on the clinic population being stud-ied on a daily basis.  There is no new experimental intervention that would put patients at greater than minimal risk To minimize procedural risks, an experienced clinician will perform all injections. A standardized procedure will also be used for each injection. There will be a timeout before each procedure to 
[8/27/[ADDRESS_541077] successfully completed human subjects training.  3.5 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria: - >18 years Exclusion Criteria: - Unconsentable - Not a candidate for injections 3.6 Statistical Analysis We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from independent control and exper-imental subjects with 1.1538 control(s) per experimental subject.  In a previous study the re-sponse within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 0.3.  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 0.2, we will need to study [ADDRESS_541078] the null hypothesis that the popula-tion means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Demographic data and adverse events will be assessed with the chi-square analysis.  Pain scores will be assessed with the Manny-Whitney U test. 3.7   Withdrawal of Subjects There are no anticipated circumstances under which subjects would be withdrawn from re-search without their consent. If subjects withdraw, there will be no penalty or consequences.   4. Adverse Reporting 
[8/27/[ADDRESS_541079]-care along with any necessary physician staff. 5. Privacy and Confidentiality Private health information (PHI) will used in the study, but not disclosed. All PHI will be stored on a secure, password-locked server. All participants in the study have obtained Human Re-search certification to have the necessary authorization to PHI. When collecting patient data, only medical record numbers will be used to identify patients.   6. Communication Plan Reporting will occur through standard process for the IRB.  There is one clinic at a single site performing this study.  7. References 1. Rhoades CE, Gelberman RH, Manjarris JF. Stenosing tenosynovitis of the fingers and thumb.

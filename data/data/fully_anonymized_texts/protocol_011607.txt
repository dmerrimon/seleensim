Study Design and 
Methodology  This clinical study will be a multi -center, open label, 
prospective study of 8 weeks of treatment with 24 weeks of 
follow -up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj 
ophthalmic solution  administered as one drop in  the 
affected eye(s), 6 times per day at 2 -hour intervals, for eight 
weeks in patients with Stage 1 Neurotrophic Keratitis (NK).  
The study is divided into four phases as follows:  
1. Screening Visit (Day -14):  Procedures for inclusion 
will be performed at both Visit 1 (Screening) and 
Visit 2 (Baseline).  Commercially available artificial 
tears (AT) provided by [CONTACT_243900] a day . 
2. Washout period (from day minus 14 to day 0):    14 
days with no further treatment except commercially 
available preservative -free artificial tears provided by 
[CONTACT_456] (Note:  Xiidra™ and Restasis™ use is 
disallowed for 14 days prior to Visit 2.)  Artificial 
tears (AT) provided by [CONTACT_243901] a day and will be tracked via daily 
diary during washout period.  
3. Treatment:  
a. Treatment (weeks 1 -8): eligible patients 
will start OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 
mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic 
solution  administered as one drop in the 
affected eye(s), [ADDRESS_296282] will be 
permitted for topi[INVESTIGATOR_243848]. 
Commercially available preservative free 
artificial tears (AT) provided by [CONTACT_243902] .   
4. Follow up (weeks 9 -32):   For the [ADDRESS_296283] 
treatment:

lubrication . The use of artificial tears will be 
tracked via a daily dosing diary.  
b. For patients not completely healed and who 
don’t meet criteria for premature 
discontinuation, will also be followed up but 
any topi[INVESTIGATOR_243849]. All treatment s 
will be tracked as concomitant medications.  
No su rgical procedures are permitted during 
the follow -up (i.e. sutured Amniotic 
Membrane Transfer ( AMT ), suture d 
tarso rrhaphy). Permitted items include 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_243850] . 
 
The study will be a total of 34 weeks in duration: a screening 
period of 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of treatment and a 
24-week follow -up period. At the end of the screening period 
(at Visit 2), patients meeting the entry criteria for this study 
will be assigned to treatment with OXERVATE™ 0.002% 
(20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution  
which will be known as Study Product beginning the morning 
following Visit 2.  
Following the completion of the treatment period, patients 
will be followed up for an additional 24 weeks (for patients 
healed and non -healed  [and not meeting d iscontinuation  
criteria] at Week 8) and will be evaluated at the end of the 
follow -up period. At the investigator’s discretion, the subject 
may be seen for an Unscheduled Visit to evaluate for safety. 
Patients who prematurely discontinue  for whatever reason 
will not be followed post discontinuation and should have 
Visit 6 assessments completed.  
 
At Visit 1, eligible patients will be instructed to discontinue 
all topi[INVESTIGATOR_243851] a vailable preservative -free artificial tears 
provided by [CONTACT_243903]. At the conclusion of the Baseline 
Visit (Visit 2) eligible patients will be dispensed a [ADDRESS_296284] one drop six times a day starting on the day after  
Day 0/ Visit 2 through Week 8 of the controlled treatment 
period.

Page [ADDRESS_296285] will additionally be 
dispensed to the patients during the treatment period at Visits 
3, 4 and 5/Weeks 2, [ADDRESS_296286] treatment, and during the follow up period, 
AT should be used only if strictly needed . The use of AT will 
be tracked in the daily dosing diary.  
At Visit 6 (End of Treatment), patients will be assess ed for 
corneal healing.  
 
Rescue Therapy: Commercially available preservative free 
artificial tears (AT) provided by [CONTACT_243904].  Per the investigators discretion 
if the patient requires  rescue therapy during the 8-week  
treatment period then they can receive  artificial  tears 
provided by [CONTACT_243905]. The 
frequency of rescue therapy must be documented in the 
patient's diary.  
 
Completely healed patients at week 8 are defined by [CONTACT_243906] ≤1 in the central  qualifying  zone  via FCS (per NEI 
scale)  and no persistent staining in  the non-qualifying zones 
(excluding the superior zone)  defined as the absence of 
pathological staining via corneal photography .  Patients who 
are completely healed at Week 8 will be followed for an 
additional 24 weeks during the follow -up period.  During the 
24-week  follow -up period (Weeks 9 -32) the patients will be 
followed without any Study Product, however, preservative -
free AT  (provided by [CONTACT_4530]) may be used and 
documented on the daily diary.   If warranted for patient 
safety, the Investigator may elect to see the subject at an 
Unscheduled Visit(s) to evaluate the patient.  
 
Patients who are not completely healed at week 8 defined 
by [CONTACT_243907] 2 via FCS in the central qualifying zone 
AND who do not meet the criteria for premature 
discontinuation, will also be followed for an additional 24 
weeks during the follow -up period.  During the 24-week  
follow -up period (Weeks 9 -32) the patients will be followed 
and may be treated at the physician’s discretion (retreatment

with OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -
bkbj ophthalmic solution  is not permitted). Any 
concomitant  treatment  must be documented on concomitant  
medi cation log.   If warranted for patient safety, the 
Investigator may elect to see the subject at an Unscheduled 
Visit(s) to evaluate the patient.  
 
Patients who meet the definition of Deterioration or No 
Improvement in the study eye  at week 8 and during the 
follow up period , will be discontinued from the study and 
treated as appropriate at the discretion of the investigator.   
Deterioration or No Improvement is defined by [CONTACT_117162]:   
 In the Study Eye, the FCS  is unchanged 
(Grade=3) from baseline in the qualifying NEI 
zone.  
 At the PI s discretion in the study eye if any of the 
non-qualifying  zones progress from baseline.  
 decrease in BCDVA by >10 ETDRS letters  from 
baseline.  
 progression in staining to a lesion/PED or corneal 
melting or perforation . 
 onset of infection  (viral, fungal, bacterial)  
 Require an ocular surgical procedure, including 
the need for a corneal transplant.  
Note: If there is a deterioration in the non -study eye , the 
Investigator may dis continue treatment in that eye and 
initiate alternative treatment at their discretion in the non -
study eye but  continue following the study eye per protocol.  
 
All patients will attend the following clinic visits in the 
following sequence:   
 Screening (Visit 1/Day -14) 
 Baseline and First Study Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -Up (Visit 
2/Day 0)  
 Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -Up (Visit 3/Week 2)  
 Treatment Assessment and Study Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -Up 
(Visit 4/Week 4)  
 Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -Up (Visit 5/Week 6)  
 End of 8 -week Treatment (Visit 6/Week 8)  
 Follow -Up and Final Study Visit (Visit 7/Week 32)

2.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Neurotrophic keratitis (NK), also known as neurotrophic keratopathy, is a rare degenerative corneal 
disease caused by [CONTACT_243913] a decrease or absence in 
corneal sensation. The cornea is an avascular tissue that i s provided with the richest innervation of all 
body tissues via the trigeminal nerve. Corneal hypoesthesia or anesthesia and decreased reflex tearing

Page [ADDRESS_296296] (PED), ulceration, melting, perforation and infectious keratitis.  
Neurotrophic keratitis has been divided into three stages according to the Mackie classification scheme 
and treatmen t recommendations are based on the severity of the corneal involvement.[1]  
 
Based on the Mackie scale, Stage [ADDRESS_296297] (PED). The goal of treatment in Stage [ADDRESS_296298] lenses and the use of 
prophylactic antibiotics to prevent the risk of corneal infection. Based on the Mackie scale, Stage 3 NK 
is defined by [CONTACT_46917] a corneal ulcer, which may progress to corneal melting and perforation.  
When a corneal ulcer develops, therapy is aimed at promoting corneal healing and preventing corneal 
melting or perforation. Surgical procedures at this stage (tarsorrhaphy, flap procedures and amniotic 
membrane transplantation) can preserve or restore ocular integrity but at t he expense of cosmetic 
appearance and visual function.[2, 3] As of today, the only FDA approved pharmacologic therapy for the 
treatment of NK is OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution, a 
recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNG F).[4, 5]   
 
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic and 
sensory neurons, and for differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. It binds with at least 
two classes of receptors: high -affini ty tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a transmembrane tyrosine 
kinase, and low -affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR), also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR).[6, 
7]  
 
NGF and its receptors TrkA and p75 are expressed in the anterior segment of the eye ( iris, ciliary body, 
lens, cornea, and conjunctiva), and NGF is released in the aqueous humor. Several pi[INVESTIGATOR_243860], playing a 
crucial role in the physiopathology of sev eral anterior ocular segment diseases.[8, 9] 
 
OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution is a recombinant human 
nerve growth factor approved by [CONTACT_243914] 2018 and it is indicated for the treatment of 
neurotrophic keratitis.  R elevant pre -clinical, toxicological and clinical data are summarized below and 
can be found in the Package Insert (Appendix 3).[4] 
2.2. RELEVANT NON -CLINICA L PHARMACOLOGY  
Both in vitro and in vivo data illustrate the biological activity of NGF in terms of neuronal growth and 
differentiation, as well as in prevention of apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Cultured corneal/limbal

cells of rabbit respond well to the prolifera tion stimulus induced by [CONTACT_243915].[10-12] 
 
OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution, a recombinant human nerve 
growth factor, is the first FDA -approved pharmacologic treatment that targets the root p athogenesis of 
neurotrophic keratitis.[4] 
 
Cenegermin -bkbj, the active ingredient of OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj 
ophthalmic solution, is structurally identical to the human nerve growth factor (NGF) protein made in 
ocular tissues.  
 
NGF is an endogenous protein involved in the differentiation and maintenance of neurons, which acts 
through specific high -affinity (i.e., TrkA) and low -affinity (i.e., p75NTR) nerve growth factor receptors 
in the anterior segment of the eye to support corn eal innervation and integrity. Endogenous NGF is 
believed to support corneal integrity through 3 mechanisms; corneal innervation, cell proliferation and 
tear secretion (shown in preclinical models) .[1, 2, 8, 13] 
 
2.3. A SUMMARY  OF CLINICAL DATA  
The safety and efficacy of OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution, 
was studied in a total of [ADDRESS_296299] study conducted in Europe NGF0212 
(REPARO), patients were randomized into t hree different groups. One group received OXERVATE™ 
0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution, a second group received 10µg/mL 
cenegermin, and the third group received vehicle.[14] In the second study conducted in the US NGF0214, 
patients were  randomized into two groups. One group was treated with OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 
mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution the other group was treated with vehicle.[15] All eye 
drops in both studies were given six times daily at 2 -hour intervals in the affec ted eye(s) for eight 
weeks. In the first study, only patients with the disease in one eye were enrolled, while in the second 
study, patients with the disease in both eyes were treated in both eyes (bilaterally), the worse eye was 
considered the study eye f or efficacy evaluations. Complete corneal healing (defined as absence of 
staining of the corneal lesion and no persistent staining in the rest of the cornea at eight weeks) was 
demonstrated in 72 percent of patients treated with OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL ) cenegermin -
bkbj ophthalmic solution compared to 33.3 percent of patients (p<0.001) treated with vehicle in the 
REPARO trial. For the US trial NGF0214, 65.2 percent of patients treated with OXERVATE™ 0.002% 
(20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution compared to 16.7 percent of patients treated with 
vehicle had complete corneal healing at week 8.[14, 15] 
 
The data from the two studies were enclosed into the biologics license application (BLA) and the FDA 
granted the approval for OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mc g/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution for 
the treatment of all stages of NK.[4]

At Visit 6 (End of Treatment), patients will be assessed for corneal healing.  
  Completely healed patients  at week 8  are defined by [CONTACT_243907] ≤1 in the central qualifying 
zone via FCS (per NEI scale) and no persistent staining in the  non-qualifying zones  (excluding the 
superior zone)  defined as the absence of pathological staining via corneal photography .  Patients  who are 
completely healed at Week 8 will be foll owed for an additional 24 weeks during the follow -up period.  
During the 24-week  follow -up period (Weeks 9-32) the patients  will be followed without any Study 
Product , however, preservative -free AT (provided by [CONTACT_4530]) may be used documented on the 
daily diary . If warranted for patient safety, the  Investigator may elect to see the subject at an Unscheduled 
Visit(s) to evaluate the patient .  
Patients who are not completely healed at week 8  are defined by [CONTACT_243907] 2 via FCS in 
the central qualifying  zone AND who do not meet the criteria for premature discontinuation, will also 
be followed for an additional 24 weeks during the follow -up period. During the 24 week follow -up period 
(Weeks 9 -32) the patients will be followed may be treated at t he physician’s discretion  (retreatment with 
OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL)  cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution  is not permitted) . Any 
concomitant  treatment must be documented  on concomitant  medi cation log .  If warranted for patient 
safety, the Investigator may elect to see the subject at an Unscheduled Visit(s) to evaluate the patient.  
Patients who meet the definition of Deteri oration or No Improvement in the study eye  at 
week 8 and during the follow up period , will be discontinued from the study and treated  as appropriate 
at the discretion of the investigator.   
 Deterioration or No Improvement is defined by [CONTACT_39132] :   
 In the  Study Eye, the FCS is unchanged  (Grade=3)  from baseline in the qualifying NEI zone.  
 At the PIs discretion, in the study eye there is a progression from baseline in the non -qualifying 
zones  
 decrease in BCDVA by > 10 ETDRS letters  from baseline.  
 progression in staining to a PED or corneal melting or perforation  
 onset of infection  
 Require an ocular surgical procedure, including  the need for a corneal transplant.  
Note:  If there is a deteri oration  in the non -study eye , the Investigator may discontinue treatment in that 
eye and initiate alternative treatment at their discretion  in the non -study eye , but continue  following the 
study eye per protocol . 
All patients  will attend the following clinic visits  in the following sequence :   
 Screening (Visit 1/Day -14) 
 Baseline  and First Study Product  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-Up (Visit 2/Day 0) 
 Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-Up (Visi t 3/Week 2 ) 
 Treatment Assessment  and Study Product  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-Up (Visit 4/Week 4 ) 
 Product Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -Up (Visit 5/Week 6)  
 End of 8-week Treatment ( Visit 6/Week 8 ) 
 Follow -Up and Final Study Visit  (Visit 7/Week 32).

Page [ADDRESS_296308] who meets the definition of experiencing a deterioration  in the study eye , will be 
discontinued from the study,  and followed per the Investigator’s discretion.    
 
If there is a deterioration in the non-study eye , the Investigator may discontinue treatment in that eye 
and initiate alternative treatment at their discretion in the non -study eye, but continue following the 
study eye per protocol.  
3.3.1.  Rationale for Selection of dose, and treatment schedule in  the study  
The dose proposed in this study , OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic 
solution (one drop in each eye six times daily for 8 weeks), was tested in the previous  NK studies 
(NGF0212 and NGF0214 ).   
The 20 μg/ml concentration of OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic 
solution is well sustained by [CONTACT_243921] .  
The dose and route of administration of OXERVATE™ 0.002%  (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj 
ophthalmic solution selected in this study is based on the approved marketed concentration as an eye 
drop approved for the treatment of NK.

Page 30 of 75 
 
Given the nature of the disease, an eight week treatment period at 6 doses/day is con sidered sufficient 
time to produce a reversal of PED in a Stage 2 and Stage 3 (more severe) NK patient population and 
reach es the maximal response in terms of efficacy as seen in up to 72%  (REPARO)  of patients who had 
complete corneal healing defined as absence of staining of the corneal lesion and no persistent staining 
in the rest of the cornea after 8 weeks of treatment.   An established safety profile exists with cenegermin  
20 µg /mL  having been evaluated in six prior clinical trials .  Additionally, toxicology and data  showed 
cenegermin  to be well tolerated in animal models  with no systemic or ocular toxicity . 
Patients  with tolerability issues or worsening of symptoms may be discontinued at any time durin g the 
study .

4.3. SELECTION OF STUDY E YE 
The study eye is the eye at Visit 2 having Grade 3  FCS per the NEI scale in the central  zone  and a 
decreased corneal sensitivity (≤ 4 cm using the Cochet -Bonnet aesthesiometer) in the central zone  at 
both Visit [ADDRESS_296312] a qualifying central zone meeting FCS and corneal 
sensitivity requirements at both Visit 1 and Visit 2,  the right eye will be selected as study eye.    
Note:   If both eyes meet the FCS and corneal sensitivity requirements  in the  central zone , the subject 
will be treated bilaterally. If only one eye qualifies, but the contralateral eye has FCS in  the central zone  
≥2 on NEI scale and the Investigator feels that both eyes would benefit from treatment ( i.e. the 
qualifying eye is abnormal, but does not meet criteria for study)  both eyes may be treated  with study 
product .  Data will be collected and recorded in the  eCRF for both eyes throughout the study.  
If there is only one qualifying eye/one study eye, only one eye will be treated ; however, both eyes will 
be evaluated, and data will be collected for both eyes.

6.2. EARLY WITHDRAWAL FRO M STUDY  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases participation in the 
study, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study protocol procedures. Patients can 
be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons:  
 Progression from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or Stage 3 NK , or corneal melting/perforation  
 At the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] p atient  is considered to be a non -responder (no improvement from baseline) . 
 In the qualifying/Study Eye, the FCS is unchanged (Grade=3) from baseline after 8 weeks of 
treatment in the qualifying NEI zone or there is an increase in FCS ≥1 within a non -qualifying 
NEI zone  in the same eye . 
 Decrease in BCDVA by >10 ETDRS letters  
 Onset of infection  (bacterial or viral)  
 Protocol violation, including lack of compliance  defined as <80% of doses taken based on diary 
documentation between treatment clinic visits.  
 Withdrawal  of consent  
 Lost to follow -up during the treatment period (Every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; 
a registered letter must be sent)  
 Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034]  
 Other reasons, such as administrative reasons or pregnancy  
 Development of AE or unacceptable toxicity  per the investigator ’s discretion , precluding further 
therapy with the study drug.  
 
 Severe protocol violations, such as an incorrect treatment administration, or a concomitant use of 
not permitted medications. Before removal, these  cases should first be discussed with Dompé . 
The reasons for premature discontinuation from the study will be reflected on the Study Termination 
Record of the CRF. For patients who prematurely discontinue, Visit 6 procedures will be completed, and 
these pa tients will be considered off study and will no longer be followed.

8. EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS AND SAFETY INFORMATION  
8.1. DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and u nintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
pharmaceutical product, whether  or not considered related to the Study Product.  
This definition includes an exacerbation of preexisting medical conditions or events, historical conditions 
not present prior to study treatment, which reappear following study treatment, intercurrent illnesses, 
hypersensitivity reactions, drug -drug or drug -food interactions, medication errors, overdose (both 
intentional or unintentional), drug misuse/abuse, false positive laboratory test, or the significant 
worsening of the disease under investigation.   
 
Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  is defined as an adverse experience which is reasonably likely to 
have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].  An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterized by 
[CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a pharmaceutical  product and an occurren ce is suspected. 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including 
pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding factors such as 
concomitant medication, concom itant diseases,  and relevant history.  
Adverse drug reactions may arise from use of the Study Product  within or outside the terms of the 
marketing authorization or from occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing 
authorization include off -label use, overdose, misuse, abuse,  and medication errors, occupational 
exposure.  
The Investigator carefully assesses relationship between event and Study drug  using the information 
below.  
Arguments that may suggest a reasonable causal relationship could be:  
• The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug  
• The event is known to be caused by [CONTACT_243930]  
• A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure  
•  Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re -introduced  
• No medically sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -existing or 
concomitant diseases, or co -medications)  
• The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239] -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed to the 
drug 
• An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased,  smaller effect size 
if dose is diminished)  
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be:  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 50 of 75 
 
• No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident (e.g. pre -
treatment  cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days/weeks of drug administration; 
an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned)  
• Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], considering  the 
pharmacol ogical properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives) . Of note, this criterion may 
not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].  
• Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. situations 
where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the 
observed event than the drug concerned)  
• Disappearance of the event even though the study drug treatment continues or remains 
unchang ed. 
 
Adverse events are to be considered unrelated if the relationship to the study drug as described in the table 
in section [8.3.2]  is none or unlikely; whereas any AE reported in the study having a possible, probable 
or highly probable relationship to study drug will be considered as an ADR. [For the purposes of safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event .] 
Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particular 
concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment  within the study, e.g. the potential for 
AEs based on knowledge fr om other compounds in the same class.  
In the present study, the following sight -threatening  events will follow into the definition of AESI and 
will be considered equivalent to a SAE and will be reported following the procedures described below for 
the rep orting of a SAE : 
 
 Adverse Events that caused a decrease in visual acuity of >30 ETDRS letters or > +0.6 LogMAR 
(compared with the last assessment of visual acuity at the last visit) lasting >1 hour.  
 Adverse Events that caused a decrease in visual acuity to  the level of Light Perception or worse 
lasting >1 hour.  
 Adverse Events that required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or 
biopsy with intravitreal injection of anti -infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy with gas) to preven t 
permanent loss of sight.  
 Adverse Events associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber 
cell/flare or 4+ vitritis).  
 Adverse Events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], required medical intervention to prevent 
permanent los s of sight.

Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening (i.e. the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243883]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243884], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event 
should be considered serious.  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
NOTE: This definition is not i ntended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not co nstitute a 
substantial disruption.  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
 is medically significant or important medical condition, i.e. an important medical event that based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient,  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
An important medical condition is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6931] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58167], not associated with any deterioration in condition are not considered to be SAEs.   
These events must be recorded in the AE page of the CRF where a variable will be ticked to indicate that 
they are not SAEs.  
Death shall always be reported as SAE . Cause of death shall always be specified when known.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 52 of 75 
 
Any preplanned surgery or procedure should be clearly documented in the site source documents by [CONTACT_243931]’s entry into the study. If it has not been 
documented at the time of the patient’s entry into the study, then it should be documented as a serious 
adverse event and reported to Dompé . 
Dompé consid ers cancer and abortion (spontaneous or non -spontaneous) as serious adverse event s, as 
well as any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is considered a serious 
adverse reaction.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Events  
An AE or ADR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the package insert . An event is unexpected 
also when it is  not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed and listed in the package 
insert . 
The determination of expectedness sha ll be made based on  the package insert . It is the responsibility of 
the Sponsor to assess whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  
Suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction  
A suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R ) is defined as a n adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and meets the definition of a 
Serious Adverse Reaction.  
8.2. MONITORING FOR ADVER SE EVENTS  
At each visit following study informed consent form signature, after the subject has had the opportunity 
to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator or appropriate designee should inquire about 
AEs by [CONTACT_243932]:  
• “Have you  had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change in concomitant condition(s) that is the result of 
an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in a subject’s medical health. Anticipated day -to-day 
fluctuations of preexisting conditions that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or 
worsening need not be reported as AEs. Changes in any pr otocol -specific [ocular or] systemic parameter 
evaluated during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. In addition, the subject’s responses to 
any questionnaire utilized during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward 
(unfa vorable and unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response that is 
clinically relevant is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless 
of causality.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page [ADDRESS_296337] treatment period are to be considered AEs and/or SAEs, and consequently 
recorded and reported as such. Should a non -serious AE become serious, the Investigator will then follo w 
the same reporting procedures as for SAEs.  
Each AE will be described by:  
• Its duration (start and stop dates)  
• Severity  
• Its relationship to the study drug; (suspected/unsuspected)  
• Action(s) taken  
• Outcome  
Medical conditions/diseases, or cancer related signs/symptoms present before starting study treatment 
shall be documented in the medical history section of the CRF; these conditions are considered AEs only 
if they increase either in frequency or severity once informed consent has been signed.  
8.3.1.  Follow -Up of patients with Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of patients  during the trial and for 
ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are maintained after the trial. 
All A Es should be followed -up to determine outcome of the reaction. The Investigator should follow up 
the event until resolution or stabilization of the condition. It is the Investigator's responsibility to assure 
that the patients  experiencing AEs receive defi nite treatment for any AE, if required.  
If subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a SAE, a copy of the discharge summary is to be forwarded to the 
Sponsor as soon as it becomes available. In addition, a letter from the Investigator that summarizes the 
events rela ted to the case as well as results of any relevant laboratory tests also may be requested. Further, 
depending upon the nature of the SAE, Dompé may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_243885]’s 
medical records. In case of death, a copy of the auto psy report, if performed, should also be provided.  
The Investigator shall inform the Sponsor with an appropriate written communication, whenever he /she 
becomes aware of new available information regarding the SAE once  the condition is resolved or 
stabilized and when no more information about the event is expected. Additional information received 
after the initial SAE has been reported to the Sponsor should be reported as follow -up information 
following the same procedu re and timeline as the initial SAE.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 54 of 75 
 
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed -up to clarify as completely as possible 
their nature and/or causality and until all queries have been resolved. All SAEs will be followed up until 
the events r esolve or the events or sequelae stabilize, or it is unlikely that any additional information can 
be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts (i.e. subject or Investigator is 
unable to provide additional information, or the subj ect is lost to follow up), unless subject has withdrawn 
his/her consent.  
8.3.2.  Relationship of AEs to the Study Product  
The Investigator will assess the possible relationship between the AE and the investigational medication, 
according to the criteria in Table below:  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to the Study Product  
None (Intercurrent 
Event)  An event that is not and cannot be related to the Study Product , e.g. patient is 
a passenger in a road traffic accident.  
Unlikely (remote)  Relationship is not likely e.g. a clinical event including laboratory test 
abnormality with temporal relationship to drug administration which makes 
a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide more plausible explanations  
Possible  Relationship may exist, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
condition or treatment or other cause  
Probable  Relationship is likely, the AE abates upon discontinuation of Study Product 
and cannot be due to the patient’s condition  
Highly Probable  Strong relationship, the event abates upon discontinuation of l Study Product  
and, if applicable, re -appears upon repeat exposure  
 
8.3.3.  Severity of AEs  
The Investigator will grade the severity of any AE using the definitions in the Table below . For each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the highest severity grade attained should be reported.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 55 of 75 
 
Severity of the Adverse Event  
Mild  Grade 1 - Does not interfere with patient’s usual function (awareness of 
symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated [acceptable]).  
Moderate  Grade 2 - Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function (enough 
discomfort to interfere with usual activity [disturbing]).  
Severe  Grade 3 - Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function (incapacity to 
work or to do usual activities [unacceptable])  
8.4. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING  
8.4.1.  Reporting Procedure for Investigators to Lexitas Pharma Services, Inc.  And Dompé 
Drug Safety  
The Investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of presumed causal relationship, to Lexitas Pharma 
Services, Inc.  Pharmacovigilance  and to Dompé Drug Safety , by e -mail (preferred) or fax within 24 hours 
of learning of the event.  
SAE reporting should be sent to:  
SAE Email address: [EMAIL_4730]   
Dompé Drug Safety: [EMAIL_4731]  
Dompé Drug Safety: +1 (347) -294-3328  
In case of failure of/lack of access to email, or fax, the event should be reported using  the SAE hotline 
telephone number: [PHONE_5118] . 
If an SAE is reported via telephone, the telephone report should be followed by  a written report using a 
reporting method described above ( i.e., completion of paper form).  
The investigator should also report information on SAEs that continue after patient has completed his/her 
participation in the study (whether study completion or withdrawal ) unless  patient has withdrawn his/her 
consent.  
Information on SAEs will be recorded on the SAE form approved by [CONTACT_1034]. Additional follow -up 
information (e.g., test results, autopsy, and discharge summary) may be requested to supplement the  SAE 
report form and can be attached as de -identified records. Follow -up reports (as many as required) should 
be completed and e -mailed/faxed following the same  procedure and timeline above, marking the SAE 
form as “follow up Number XX”.   
Whenever more th an one SAE is observed, the Investigator should identify which is the primary serious 
adverse event, i.e. the most relevant one. In any case, the Investigator is requested to record his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_243886](s) with the in vestigational medication.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 56 of 75 
 
In line with CT3 Detailed Guidance and ICH E2A provisions, although the Investigator does not usually 
need to actively monitor patients for AEs once the trial has ended,  if the Investigator becomes aware of a 
SAE occurring to a pa tient after that patient has ended his/her participation in the study (whether study 
completion or withdrawal), the SAE should be reported by [CONTACT_243933] é/Lexitas  
Pharmacovigilance . Such “post -study cases” should be regarded for expedited reporting purposes as 
though they were study reports. Therefore, a causality assessment and determination of expectedness are 
needed for a decision on whether  expedited reporting is required.   
 
8.4.2.  Conditions that should not be reported as serious adverse events  
The conditions listed below, that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient, are not considered to be SAE,  
and shall not be reported as such, but only need to be recorded in the CRF:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243887].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58172], not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243888], which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition that 
is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58174].  
 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of 
SAEs given  above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
In addition, the following situat ion shall not be considered SAE:   
 Trial end points  
 Abnormal lab values or test results that do not induce clinical signs and/or symptoms and require 
intervention/therapy, i.e. are clinically significant.  
 
8.4.3.  Reporting Procedure to IRB/IEC and to Regulatory Au thorities  
S[LOCATION_003]R shall be reported to the Regulatory Authority (FDA and non -US concerned Authority as 
applicable) by [CONTACT_58231]é as soon as possible and in no event later than : 
 (a) seven  calendar days  after becoming aware of the information if the event is fatal or life threatening ; 
to be followed by [CONTACT_243934].  
 (b) fifteen  calendar days  after becoming aware of the information if the event is neither fatal nor life 
threatening.  

 
Domp é Protocol NGF0 120_Final_04May2021. Confidential. Do Not Distribute.  
Page 57 of 75 
 
Lexitas Pharma Services, Inc  shall follow up on safet y information and shall report any relevant updated 
findings as soon as available.  
If the results of an investigation show that an adverse drug reaction not initially determined to be 
reportable is reclassified as reportable, Domp é shall report such reacti on in a written safety report as soon 
as possible, but in no event later than 7/15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
In addition, each IRB/IEC/Regulatory Authority and Investigator will receive appropriate periodic safety 
updates as per applicable local requirements and regulations.   
In addition to reporting the SAE to Dompé and Lexitas , the Investigator must also comply with the 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the local IRB which approved the study. The 
requirements of IRBs vary from one IRB to another; however, as a minimum requirement, the 
Investigators must promptly report all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) to their 
IRB.  
In line with provisions set forth in 21CFR312, Dompé shall notify all participating Investigators in an 
IND safety report of any suspected adverse reaction that is both seriou s and unexpected and of potential 
serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than:  
 seven calendar days  after becoming aware of the information if the event is fatal or life threatening; 
to be followe d by [CONTACT_243934].  
 fifteen calendar days  after becoming aware of the information if the event is serious but neither fatal 
nor life threatening.  
The Investigators in turn shall notify their local IRB.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_243889]’s Files.  
Dompé shall also notify FDA in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or 
any other source, as soon as possible after Dompé determines that the information qualifies for 
reporting, shall  notify of:  
- any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. Dompé must report an adverse 
event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and the adverse event.  
- findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. Such a 
finding would result in a safety -related change in the overall conduct of the clinical investiga tion. 
- findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug  
- increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
8.4.4.  Periodical Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
Dompé shall be responsible  to prepare and submit annual safety reports (Development Safety Update 
Report – DSUR) to relevant Regulatory Authorities.

Page [ADDRESS_296338] DURING PREGN ANCY  
Women of childbearing potential are not excluded from the study if adequate birth control methods are 
being utilized. Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant. Adequate birth control methods are summarized in the protocol’s exclusion criteria. 
Prior to enrolment in the clinical trial,  female patients of childbearing potential and their partners must be 
advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during the entire course of the study treatment and for 
the [ADDRESS_296339] report every pregnancy on a Pregnancy Report Form as soon as possible (within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy ) to the same contacts specified  in Section 8.4.1., even if no AE has 
occurred, and follow it to term. If, however, the pregnancy is associated with an SAE ( e.g., if the mother 
is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16113]), in addition to the pregnancy report form, a separate SAE report form 
must be filed as described in Section 8.4.1. with the appropriate serious criterion ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
indicated on the SAE report form.  
Any pregnancy leads to the immediate exclusion from the trial. Miscarriage, stillbirth,  and any 
malformation/disease must  be reported as a SAE.  
The pregnant woman (patient or partner) should be followed for pregnancy outcome through delivery or 
termination of the pregnancy. In any pregnancy that progresses to term, the infant should be followed 
until 6 months after birth and  any congenital abnormalities/birth defects in the infant should be reported 
as an SAE.  
 
8.6. ADVERSE EVENTS CAUSI NG TREATMENT DISCONT INUATION  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study as a consequence of an AE, this must be recorded and reasoned 
in the CRF, an d the patient must be followed up until the resolution of the AE or as instructed by [CONTACT_35041].  
8.7. OVERDOSE  
Cases of overdose (accidental or intentional) should be reported in the eDC.  Any overdose which results 
in a serious adverse event is to be reported to Domp é and Lexitas Pharmacovigilance and Dompé Medical 
Expert, following the same procedure for SAE, within 24 hours from the Investigator’s knowledge of its 
occurrence. This includes reports related to drug intake through different routes (e.g.  ingestion) or with 
suicidal intentions and consequent drug overdose.  
An overdose of OXERVATE™ 0.002% (20 mcg/mL) cenegermin -bkbj ophthalmic solution  is defined as the 
administration of 50% or more additional drops on any given treatment day.

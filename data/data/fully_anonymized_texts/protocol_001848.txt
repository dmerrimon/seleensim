3. Abstract:  
 
We have a series of surgical cases in which we have been able to achieve excellent 
intraoperative biliary visualization with a greatly decreased (50 -200X fold lower) dose 
of ICG than the previously published  dose. Furthermor e, this decreased dose was 
visible in about [ADDRESS_759883] our hypothesis with the following specific aims:  
Aim:  To compare the efficacy and utility of a low dose ICG (0.05 mg) protocol with a 
previously published  dose (2.5 mg) in imag ing the extrahepatic biliary tract . 
 
 
4. Background:  
 
Near -infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging after an intravenous injection of indocyanine 
green (ICG) allows for the intraoperative identification of biliary anatomy. ICG binds to 
plasma proteins and emits light with a peak wavelength around 830nm when illum inated 
with near -infrared light. ICG is exclusively excreted by [CONTACT_4852], and biliary excretion 
lasts from several minutes to [ADDRESS_759884] -injection (1). NIRF imaging has been shown 
to be a safe, easy, fast, cost -effective strategy for delineating biliary anatomy because 
it decreases the risk of bile duct injury and does not require radiation (2)(3)(4). Research 
from our group, among others, has shown that visualization of the extrahepatic biliary 
tract is adequate  at a dose on the order of 2.[ADDRESS_759885] 15 minutes prior 
to visualization (5). 
Since the advent of NIRF, imaging technology has improved, with increasin g sensitivity 
and improved intraoperative displays. Whether these improvements have resulted in 
increased sensitivity and utility has not yet been demonstrated, nor has the possibility 
of whether improved technology has decreased either the dose required f or adequate 
visualization or the time interval prior to optimal visualization.  
5. Specific Aim:  
 
To compare the efficacy and utility of a low dose ICG (0.05 mg) protocol with a 
previously published dose (2.5 mg) in imag ing the extrahepatic biliary tract .  
6. Research Plan:  
 
Current standard of care for this service is to administer 2.[ADDRESS_759886] visualization. If there is any further need for 
anatomic information, then a combination of ultrasound and X -ray c holangiography is 
used. For this study, a dult patients scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic hepatic or 
biliary operation will be randomized to two groups 1) low dose (0.05 mg) or 2) standard 
dose (2.5 mg) of ICG preoperatively on the day of surgery. Patients  with a history of 
adverse reactions or known allergy to  ICG, iodine, or iodine dyes will be  excluded. 
Pregnant and/or lactating patients will also be excluded. Participants  will receive a 
baseline assessment. Demographic information,  including age , gender, ethnicity or 
race, body mass  index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, preoperative  
diagnosis, liver function, and complete medical  history, will be  collected.  Case difficulty 
will be graded by [CONTACT_578209] 
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29956029/ ). T he PI[INVESTIGATOR_578201] ( Stryker  Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan)  will be  
used. This device enables the  surgeon to simultaneously see real -time, high -definition  
visible -range and NIR fluorescence videos and to superimpose  them. It is currently 
approved by [CONTACT_578210] -infrared fluorescence imaging.  Essentially, 
it is a standard laparoscopic  device with an added excitation laser at [ADDRESS_759887] 
as guided by [CONTACT_578211]. The 
operating  
surgeon will be 
blinded to the 
dose given. At 
two points 
during the 
operation ([ADDRESS_759888] and 2 - upon completion of the dissection and establishment 
of the critical view of safety) , a qualitative assessment  will be mad e by [CONTACT_578212] (being able to identify and distinguish the common  bile duct, the common 
hepatic duct, and the cystic duct  from the surrounding structures an d from each other) 
on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = no improvement/identification not  confirmed; 2 = marginally 
improved; 3 = sufficiently  improved; 4 = well improved; 5 = greatly improved/ exceeds 
expectations). The recorded visualization will also be assessed by  a blinded 
independent surgeon who will use the same scale. A quantitative assessment will also 
be performed on the recorded visualization  using ImageJ (US National Institutes  of 
Health, Bethesda, MD; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) by  [CONTACT_578213].  These quantitative 
measurements will allow an  independent measure of duct visualization . Both 
quantitative and qualitative scores will be compared to determine whether there  are 
significant differences between the doses. A total of thirty patients (15 in each arm) will 
be required for more than a 90% power to detect a difference in the duct -to-liver ratio 
of 0.[ADDRESS_759889] de viation of 0.15.  
These estimates are based on our previously published results. (5) 
 
 
Patients who are not able to provide informed consent and have a history of sensitivity 
or allergy to shellfish, ICG, or iodine will be excluded from the study.  
 
Randomization: Identical envelopes wi ll be made with a card marked either standard or 
low dose to be chosen in blocks of four. At the time of enrollment, an envelope will be 
selected at random from a box and the subject will be assigned to the corresponding 
arm. This envelope will then be dis carded to allow for equal numbers in each group.

For the purposes of the study, the recorded videos will be stored on a secure local 
server with access limited only to the study team. This will allow them team to 
perform the image analysis and related calculations. At the end of the study, the 
videos will be deidentified  and maintained for possible future research.  
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
 
Using a lower dose of  ICG may lead to poorer visualization of the anatomy during 
surgery compared to the standard dose. The surgeons, however, routinely use other 
methods of visualization during surgery (such as ultrasound or x -rays) that would 
decrease the risks of poor visualization during the operation . The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions to ICG  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_578202], shortness 
of breath, and nausea. Less commonly reported events include bronchospasm (a 
condition wherein muscles lining the airways of the lungs constrict or tighten, reducing 
airflow), laryngospasm (a spasm of the vocal cords that temporarily makes it difficult 
to speak or breath), low blood pressure, and cardiac arrest. IVs are routinely used by 
[CONTACT_578214].  
8. Possible Benefits:  
Decreasing the dose of ICG may lead to better visualization of the anatomy during 
surgery and also it may decrease the risk of side -effects . 
9. Conflict of Interest:  
 
The investigators have no  real or potential conflict of interest with regard to this 
research project.

This protocol summary will include a minimum of the following:  
• The UF IRB assigned protocol number, protocol title, PI [CONTACT_2300], data coordinator 
name [CONTACT_578218], regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
• Date of initial UF IRB approval, date of most recent consent UF IRB

have met each objective.  
• Intraoperative measures  
• Summa ry of toxicities and protocol deviations.  
• Summary of any recent literature which may affect the safety or ethics of the trial.  
 
10.2 Site Monitoring  
 
10.3 Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_578203],  the Principal 
Investigator (PI) agrees to maintain and have available for monitoring adequate case 
records (accurate source documents and CRFs) for the subjects treated under this 
protocol.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_571961], protocol 
violations, and other immediate protocol issues. The study coordinator will collect 
information on subjects enrolled through the use of electronic or paper adverse event 
(AE) forms, CRFs, and Informed Consent forms.  
 
10.4 Interim Analyses & Sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_578204] a phase II feasibility study, our goal is to establish clinical and operative 
expectations around the use of low -dose IV ICG.  Given the standard use of standard 
dose IV ICG, we are not concerned about safety, so a phase I study or safety ru n-in of 
low dose ICG is not felt to be needed. However, we will monitor and record any AEs 
related to the IV ICG administration in both arms of the study.  
 
Given the published safety data on intraoperative use of ICG, we do not anticipate 
any safety issues  between the standard and low dose ICG, but will monitor AEs 
related to ICG administration in real time.  A pre -planned stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_578205].

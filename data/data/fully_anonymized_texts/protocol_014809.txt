sessions in the Pediatric ICU: A feasibility study (PCRG)

Study  Protocol  
Purpose  
 
The purpose  of this study  is to evaluate  the feasibility,  acceptability,  safety,  and preliminary  therapeutic 
treatment eﬀects of PAROTM, a therapeutic animal robot, during physical therapy and occupational 
therapy sessions with critically ill patients in the Pediatric ICU (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]).  
 
 
Background &  Rationale  
Symptom  Experience  in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]:  Admission  to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_726124]. In addition to physical symptoms such as pain, thirst and fatigue, patients in the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_726125] a multitude of psychological symptoms. Symptoms like anxiety, spells of terror, 
social isolation, disturbed sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_47677], restlessness, fear, confusion and loss of control are 
exacerbated in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_726126], decreased capacity to 
communicate, and rely on healthcare providers for survival.  
Symptom  Management  in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]:  Large  doses  of sedative  and analgesic  medications  are administered 
by [CONTACT_726132]ﬀ to help alleviate distressing symptoms. Overuse of sedative medications can cause a 
sequelae of adverse eﬀects and, therefore, recent recommendations call for reducing sedative use as 
much as possible. To minimize the overwhelming symptom burden of acute critical illness and promote 
lasting psychological well -being during recovery, it is imperative to identify eﬀective non - 
pharmacological interventions that decrease psychological distress, but do not alter level of alertness 
during acute critical illness. Established evidence supports the use of a variety of non -pharmacological 
approaches that can be easily applied as adjuncts to sedative and analgesic medications in order to 
reduce  dependence  on these  medications.  Animal  assisted  interactions  (AAI)  are a promising  integrative 
approach that can be used as an adjunct to sedative and analgesic medications in order to improve 
psychological symptoms and promote comfort, relaxation, and positive mood in critically ill patients.  
AAI to Alleviate Symptoms in the ICU: AAI are interventions that intentionally incorporate animals as 
part of a therapeutic process to promote human health, learning, and well -being. Domestic and farm 
animals such as dogs, cats, birds, equines, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, llamas, sheep, goats, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_726127].  Animals  can be simply  observed,  touched,  held,  and petted,  or 
more actively integrated into speciﬁc therapy activities such as brushing with diﬀerent tools to exercise 
range of motion and ﬁne motor coordination and tandem walking with the animal to encourage 
exercise. Recent literature indicates that AAI can improve reality orientation and attention span, 
eliminate the sense of isolation, reduce stress and anxiety, enhance communication, promote positive 
social interactions, and enhance overall quality of life. The use of AAI in the ICU has the potential to 
engage patients, family members, and healthcare staﬀ in an innovative, holistic approach to symptom 
management.  
Beneﬁts  of Robotic  Animals  for AAI in the ICU: While  additional  research  is warranted  to further  explore 
the potential impact of AAI on a variety of clinically meaningful patient outcomes, the highly technical, 
fast-paced ICU environment and the severely immunocompromised health statuses of ICU patients 
greatly limits the exploration of AAI in the ICU. A new frontier in animal robotics opens a vast array of 
opportunities to implement AAI in the critically ill population. Robot animals may be just as eﬀective as 
live animals and may provide even more ﬂexibility and tailoring in order to meet the needs of diverse  
situation  that arise  in the ICU. In addition,  the infection  control  risk that live animals  pose  to critically  ill 
patients  may  be signiﬁcantly  lessened.  
 
 
Methods  
At the patient’s  ﬁrst physical/occupational  (PT/OT)  appointment,  the PT/OT  provider  will assess  whether 
eligibility criteria are met. If so,  the study will be presented to the patient and their parent or guardian. 
If the patient is interested in participating, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s research assistant (RA) will obtain written 
informed consent. Pretest data collection is next, followed by [CONTACT_726133]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_726128]  ﬁeld notes. After completion of the therapy 
session, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_726129] -test data collection. The participant will remain in the study for up  
to 7 PT/OT sessions or until discharge from the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  
The Patient Demographic Form will be administered to all participants prior to the initial PT/OT session 
with PARO. Data speciﬁc to the PARO intervention (Psychological and Physiological Variables, Activity 
Performance), will be collected via a face -to-face interview within 30 minutes prior to and within 30 
minutes after each PT/OT session with PARO. ATP testing will occur prior to each new subject 
enrollment to ensure participant safety. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted with the 
participant  and an intervention  satisfaction  measure  will be administered  after  the protocol  is complete 
(either after 7 PT/OT sessions with PARO or at ICU discharge).  
 
Only  one participant  will be enrolled  at a time.  Participants  & therapi[INVESTIGATOR_726130].  During  the protocol,  PARO  will be kept  in a hard  plastic  pet carrier 
which is brought to the participant’s room for the PT/OT sessions. A sheet or towel will be placed under 
PARO anytime it is placed on a bed, table, chair, etc. to avoid direct contact [CONTACT_726134].  
Once the PT/OT session is done, the PARO is returned to the PI’s oﬃce in the carrier. The PARO is 
removed from the carrier,  which is cleaned with a PDI Super Sani -Cloth wipe. The PARO is then cleaned 
per the Daily  Cleaning  Protocol . This entails  moving  a Rapid  Razor -UV™ cordless  handheld  sanitizer  over 
the entire PARO surface, pausing over each area for 20 to 30 seconds. The PARO  is returned to the 
carrier after cleaning.  
Prior to a new enrollment or if the PARO is visibly soiled, it will be deep cleaned per the Deep Cleaning 
Protocol . This involves spraying the PARO’s fur with Dapple cleaner and wipi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] a towel, avoiding 
the area around eyes and nose. Next the fur is wiped  with a PDI Super Sani -Cloth and left to dry. Lastly, 
the fur is brushed with a brush sprayed with Clorox bleach and allowed to dry again. Cleanliness is 
tested by [CONTACT_433148] [ADDRESS_991249] deviation, range, median, and interquartile range. A content analysis on the 
results from the semi -structured interviews will be conducted.  
For Aim 2, exploring safety considerations related to infection control [participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired 
infection  (HAI)  rates,  screening  for the presence  of microbial  contamination  with  real-time  ATP testing], 
any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_726131]. The ATP scores after each 
deep cleaning session will be plotted for graphical trends.  
For Aim 3, examining the therapeutic eﬀect of PARO on patient psychological variables (pain, 
anxiety)  physiological  variables  (heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842],  oxygen  saturation),  and 
sedative  and analgesic  medication  requirements  will be recorded  pre- and post -test.  These  scores  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and the distributions of psychological and physical variables will 
be assessed for normality. Therapeutic eﬀects for normally distributed variables will be assessed with 
paired samples t -tests to assess changes as a result of  PARO. Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used for 
variables found to be non -normal.

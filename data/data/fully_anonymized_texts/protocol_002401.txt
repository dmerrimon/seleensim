Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 5  Methodology:  
Study AG348-C-003 is a Phase 2, open label, 2-arm, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging study in 
adult subjects with PK deficiency; the study will be divided in to a Core Period and an Extension 
Period. During the Core Period, subjects will receive multiple doses of AG-348 for up to 24 weeks; 
subjects who are eligible can enter the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up to 2 y ears following 
the end of the Core Period.  
Subjects with PK deficiency confirmed by [CONTACT_29617] (RBC) PK enzymatic assay performed at 
Screening will be eligible to participate in this study. At the Week 24 visit, subjects who safely 
tolerate AG -348 and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible to immediately roll over 
to the Extension Period for continued treatment. Subjects who complete treatment at the end of the Core Period (24 weeks) will undergo follow- up assessment [ADDRESS_772543] discontinues at any other time (including discontinuation during the Core or Extension 
Period), the follow -up assessments will be conducted 4  weeks after discontinuation. Subjects with 
toxicity suspected to be related to study drug will continue follow- up until the adverse event (AE) 
resolves, is declared chronic by [CONTACT_737], or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
For the Core Period, up to 25 subjects will be initially randomized on an open- label 1:1 basis to each 
of two twice -daily (BID) doses of AG -348 (up to 50 subjects total; refer to the Study Schema  
diagram below).  
Study Schema:  Core Period 
 
Abbreviations:  BID (q12h)  = twice daily (every 12 hours); DRT = Data Review Team; PKR  = pyruvate kinase red blood 
cell isoform; TBD =  to be determined; w  = week(s). 
The dose of Arm 1 is 300 mg of AG -348 administered orally (PO) every 12 hours (q12h), ie, BID.  
The dose of Arm [ADDRESS_772544] frequently enrolled. The PKR  

Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772545] of 4  levels (R510Q, R486W, R479H, and all other mutations 
as “other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_76478] 1 of the indicated muta tions; subjects 
with more than 1 stratified mutation will be assigned based on the Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been selected from t he AG348-C-001 single 
ascending dose (SAD) and AG348-C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult 
subjects to represent the range of doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG an d ATP.  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible subject population and because the underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected subjects is heterogeneous due to the 
wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is  deemed  important to focus closely on 
dose findings in this first -in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 
different doses of AG- 348 administered BID, a Data Review Team (DRT) will be established to 
review study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose, and schedule of AG -348  
as indicated .  
The D RT will monitor safety on an ongoing basis and meet at regular intervals of approximately 
every 6  weeks, or ad hoc , as necessary, for as long as any subjects are still in the Core Period to 
review AEs, vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms (ECGs). The DRT will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of  clinical activity (eg, changes from baseline in Hb).  
These DRT meetings will also include data review for all subjects that may be under treatment in the Extension Period. If there are no subjects still being treated in the Core Period, and the only subj ects 
on treatment are those in the Extension Period, then the frequency of the DRT meetings will reduce to approximately every [ADDRESS_772546] visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period.  
When all the subjects are in the Extension Period, PK/PD data will no longer be reviewed by [CONTACT_587335]. The DRT will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, 
Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsi ble Medical Officer.  
Beginning [ADDRESS_772547] is dosed in the Core Period or ad hoc  as necessary, and 
proceeding according to the schedule indicated above (approximately every [ADDRESS_772548] 
completed the Core Period), the DRT will review cumulative safety data, available PK/PD data, and clinical activity data.  
Based on the DRT’s recurring reviews, the DRT may exercise  1 or more of th e following options 
during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 subjects at a dose to be determined; the dose 
for Arm  3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360 mg 
BID; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than BID. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm 3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to allow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity.  
• Re-assign subjects’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the subjects in the terminated arm will remain in their original arm, ie, they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and 
schedule is being adopted.  
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 7  • Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in  [ADDRESS_772549] clinical relevance.  
 
The DRT may exercise 1 or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatment without change. 
• Re-assign subjects’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer, and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical activity. 
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinical data (eg, for unacceptable 
safety/tolerabil ity, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity).  
 
The data that the DRT will r eview to make these decisions are expected to include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Observations:  All AEs, VS, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs. 
• PK and PD Observations:  Includes changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP, except when all subjects 
are in the Extension Period  
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  Includes changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
LDH, EPO, hepcidin, total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. 
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772550] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy adult subjects.  
The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined at the Sponsor’s 
discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
The DRT will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to 
terminate enrollment in an arm based on evaluation of safety and efficacy.  
All subjects in the Extension Period will undergo a gradual dose -taper regimen  to identify  the optimal 
maintenance dose for each  (defined as the dose that results in ≤ 1.0 g/dL decrease in Hb compared to 
the pre taper Hb value on at least 2 measurements following each dose taper step) on a per -subject 
basis (see Section  9.7.3).  
Due to the pot
ential for AG-348- mediated aromatase inhibition, combined with the known risk of 
osteoporosis in subjects with congenital hemolytic anemias, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) 
scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening (if subject has not had prior DXA scan within  
3 months of Day 1) to obtain bone mineral density values and T and Z scores. These data are intended 
to ser
ve as 
a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling subjects, and are deemed of 
particular importance for those who enter the longer term Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatment (Core Period).  
All subjects will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks [ADDRESS_772551] additional DXA scans at Months 12, 18, 24,  
and 30. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accrui ng arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_772552] 
arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 subjects.  
An extension study (to be determined) may be offered to subjects who successfully complete the 
Extension Period.

Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772553] dose of study treatment. During the 
Core Perio d, subjects will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 
22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24).  
Subjects who safely tolerate AG -348 through Week 24 (Core Period) and for whom the Investigator 
agrees with continuation of AG- [ADDRESS_772554] dose of the Extension Period 
(except for those who may continue treatment in an extension study [ to be designed] after having 
completed the Extension Period).  
Dose Modifications for Safety and/or Increase in  Hb Level  
The Investigator will monitor all subjects for safety and tolerability. Modification of an individual 
subject’s dose of AG -348 will be based on AEs and/or observed changes in Hb level as described in 
Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2.  
Additional criteria for dose reduction will apply in the Extension Period, as detailed in Section 9.7.3. 
Number of subjects (planned):  Up to approximately 75 subjects.

safely tolerate AG -348 and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of AG-348 treatment 
may be eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment (up to 
2 years following c ompletion of the Core Period).  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety 
Monitoring of AEs in randomized subjects, including serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest 
(AESIs), and AEs leading to discontinuation (all AEs will be graded using CTCAE, Version 4.03) ; 
safety laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation); physical examination 
findings (including neurological examination); VS; 12- lead ECGs;  and DXA scans.  
Serum sex hormone levels (testosterone [total and free], estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (serum osteocalcin -N-mid and serum C- terminal telopeptide [CTX]), 25 -hydroxy vitamin D2 
and D3, total cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein -cholesterol (HDL -C), and triglycerides will be 
monitored for evidence of potential inhibition of aromatase by [CONTACT_147248]-348.  
Menstruating female subjects will also keep a paper -based menstrual cycle diary throughout the study.  
Indicators of Clinical Activity  
Monitoring of potential indicators of clinical activity will include evaluating changes in  Hb, HCT, 
reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, LDH, total and indirect bilirubin, EPO, hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_772569] dose and the morning 
Day 15 dose, and additional trough levels of AG-348 and AGI-8702 will be obtained.

Page 13  During the Extension Period, predose PK samples will be drawn for the measurement of trough levels 
of AG-348 and AGI-8702 at each study visit t (every 3 months;  Appendix 1.2).  AG-348 and  
AGI-8702 will be analyzed using qualified assays to determine concentrations in plasma.  
Pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacodynamic assessments during the Core Period will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary 
objectives),  
  
 
Approximately the first  [ADDRESS_772570] 
dose and the morning Day 15 dose, and additional trough levels of ATP and 2,3- DPG will be 
obtained.  
During the Extension Period, predose PD samples will be drawn for the measurement of trough levels 
of 2,3- DPG, ATP,  at each study visit (every 3  months;  Appendix 1.2) . Adenosine 
triphosphate and 2,3 DPG will be analy zed using qualified assays to determine concentrations in 
whole blood. Pharmacodynamic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 will be computed based on observed whole blood ATP and 2,3-DPG concentrations.  
Statistical methods:  
Sample Size  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size may be determined by [CONTACT_5870]. Depending 
on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_772571] dose arm, the 
study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 subjects.  
Analysis Periods  
Analyses of safety and of indicators of clinical activity will b e separated for the Core Period, and f or 
the Cumulative Period (Core Period and Extension Period), if applicable. Unless specified otherwise, safety analysis will be based on the treatment -emergent period defined as from the first dose to  
[ADDRESS_772572] dose of the corresponding period.  
Analysis Sets 
Populations for analysis (ie, analysis sets) will include a Safety Analysis Set and an Efficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment; 
this population will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data and the default analysis set for all data analyses unless otherwise stated. Subjects will be classified according to initial treatment group, 
defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or as the first treatment received if 
assigned treatment is never received.

clinical activity data. Subjects will be classified ac cording to assigned treatment, unless  
specified otherwise.  
Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety for  
this study.  
Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in  the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for 
the study, which will be finalized before the database lock after all subjects have completed the Core 
Period. The results of this analysis will be presented in a clinical study report (CSR).  
Additional data collec ted during the Extension Period after the Core Period database lock will be 
analyzed for inclusion in a subsequent CSR addendum. 
The primary objective during the Core Period of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of up to 24 weeks  of AG -348 in subjects with PK deficiency . Therefore, analyses will be 
primarily descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted.  
Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demographic data.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and 
continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum, and maximum).  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and the 
incidence of AEs  in the treatment- emergent period  (TEAEs) (new or worsening from baseline) will be

summarized. If necessary, additional analyses related to the dose-tapering regimen  in the Extension 
Period , focusing on the long -term treatment effect in the Cumulative Period, may be conducted . These 
analyses will be described in a separate anal ysis plan for the Extension Period following the Core 
Period database lock , but before the database lock for the Extension Period.  
PK-PD Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 and 
the metabol ite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire population.

Interim Revie w 
No formal statistical inte rim analysis will be conducted. 
Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627], who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity data at regular intervals (approximately every [ADDRESS_772576] completed the Core Period) throughout the duration of the study. When all the subjects are in the 
Extension Period, PK/PD data will no longer be revie wed by [CONTACT_550627]. The composition of the DRT, 
its meeting schedule, the data to be reviewed, and the decisions it is empowered to make have been described previously. 
Additional interim reviews of data may be conducted to support decision- making concerning the 
current clinical study, the S ponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety 
concerns.

5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK deficiency ) is a glycolytic  enzymopathy that results in  
nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from mild or 
fully compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and lifelong chronic hemolytic 
anemia associated with severe, debilitating  comorbidities. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is caused 
by [CONTACT_587353], which results in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR) in the red blood cell (RBC).  
As shown in Figure 1 below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible step in glycolysis, 
converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, and formation of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. PKR is thus a key enzyme for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed that ATP levels are critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity (van Wijk and van Solinge 2005).  
Figure  1: Red Cell Glycolysis  
 
Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycer ate;  
ADP = adenosine diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6- bisphosphate; PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate;  
PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase. 
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in P KR that have been described have a deleterious effect on PKR 
catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or protein expression. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is 
associated with reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell maturation. Mature erythrocytes l ack mitochondria relying predominantly on glycolysis to generate ATP. It is 
hypothesized that insufficient energy production promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired maintenance of cellular membrane homeostasis.  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and 
compound heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_772589] been identified in subjects with PK deficiency  to date, and the majority of these 
mutations are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005) . The prevalence of PK 
deficiency , based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is 
estimated at 51 cases per million in the Caucasian population ( Beutler and Gelbart 2000).  
Some subjects with PK deficienc y have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254]  (Christensen, et al. 2011 ; Ghidini, et al. 1991; Hennekam, et al. 1990). 
Infants with PK deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with hepatosplenomegaly, 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is associated with a high risk of kernicterus.

Page 27  Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires supportive treatment with 
intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia caused by [CONTACT_587354], as well as supportive transfusion to keep their hematocrit (HCT) levels  > 60%. 
Adults with PK deficiency  are reported to have life-long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associated co morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co morbidities 
include frequent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute or  
chronic hemolytic anemia (Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life-threatening iro n deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256]. 
The current therapeutic options for subjects with PK deficiency  are supportive. Most require life-
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long-term survei llance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion-independent subjects, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587355] ( Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and decrease bilirubin levels in some subjects. However , this intervention is associated with 
significant morbidity including infection risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis.

 Summary of Nonclinical Data 5.2.1.
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of 
AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mutants (mPKR) in vitro, ex vivo, and 
in vivo. Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG- 348 Investigator’s 
Brochure.

showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI-8702 is a weak activator of the PKR enzyme. In 
whole blood from mice treated with AG-348, 
13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating AG-348-mediated activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG-[ADDRESS_772594] ATP consistent with activation of PKR.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from subjects with PK deficiency . AG-348 activated PKR and induced met abolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK deficiency  subjects with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzyma tic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_772595]/inverse 
agonist and an aromatase inhibitor, no effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or t oxicology studies. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in toxicology studies ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that neither AG-348 nor AGI-8702 exhibited significant inhibition of the human ether-à- go-go related gene (hERG) current (concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inhibition [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular (CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose level. No effects were seen in AG -348 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)- compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587257] s in Sprague Dawley rats. AG -348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose -dependent emetic activity in the ferret at ≥ 30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies of AG-348 were performed in Sprague Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) was administered PO in the food-effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG-348 in animal 
species i s characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma clearance, 
and high volume of distribution at steady-state in rats, dogs, and monkeys.

Page 29  AG-348 has a medium to long apparent terminal half- life (t 1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability was observed for AG-348 in animals. A high- fat diet led to 
lower oral absorption of AG-348 in monkeys. 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1%) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24hr) following 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively. Metabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_772596] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248]-348. There was evidence of metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely irreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG-[ADDRESS_772597] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG-348 has the potential to cause an induction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 substrates. 
The routes of metabolism for AG-348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributing > 70% 
of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute < 4% each.  
AG-348 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P- gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P-gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but does not inhibit BCRP. AGI-8702 is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP under the concentrations tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of AG -348 was evaluated in bacterial reverse mutation assays, the in vitro 
human peripheral blood micronucleus assay, the in vivo micronucleus assay, and in vivo in 
Sprague Dawley rats, New Zealand White rabbits, Beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The toxicity of the major metabolite of AG -348, AGI-8702, was also evaluated through metabolic 
formation both in vitro in S9 fractions and in vivo. 
AG-348 was nonmutagenic and nonclastogenic in GLP- compliant assays including bacterial 
reverse mutation assays, an in vitro micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, 
and an in  vivo micronucleus assay in male and female Sprague Dawley rats.  
In dogs, following single oral dose administration, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, and the maximum tolerated dose was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associat ed with an AUC
0-12hr value of 8576 ng × h/mL. In monkeys, single oral doses of AG-348 
up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in adverse findings, and were associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 
of 105,000 ng × h/mL.  
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 30  In the GLP-compliant 28-day monkey study, the high dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose) 
was the no -observed- adverse- effect -level (NOAEL). Effects were limited to increased liver 
weights without serum chemistry or microscopic correlate.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose study in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified at doses up to 
200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose; Day 90 AUC 0-12hr values of 10,400 and 14,600 ng × h/mL in 
males and females, respectively), and no new effects were identified when compared to the 28-day repeat -dose study. In the 9-month repeat-dose monkey toxicology study, a previously 
unidentified adverse finding of minimal subcapsular inflammation/hepatocellular pressure necrosis resulting from nonadverse adaptive hepatocellular hypertrophy secondary to CYP 
enzyme induction was observed in the liver of males at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (50 and 100 mg/kg/dose) and in females at 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose). No other adverse findings were observed.  
In rats (Sprague Dawley), single oral doses of AG-348 up to 2000 mg/kg did not result in 
adverse findi ngs, and were associated with AUC
0-12hr values up to 789,327 ng × h/mL. In the 
GLP -compliant 28-day rat study, the NOAEL in males was the highest dose tested, 
600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose), and in females was the lowest dose tested, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg /dose). 
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermatid retention, and Leydig cell hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at dose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. In the [ADDRESS_772598] dose tested was 
300 mg/kg/day (150 mg/kg/dose) in males and 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) in females, which resulted in no test article -related deaths.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC 50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). The 
potential adverse effects observed in the male and female reproductive tracts of rats in the  
6-month toxicology study were consistent with aromatase inhibition and mirror findings in the previous 13-week toxicology study. AGI-8702 is not an aromatase inhibitor. In GLP- compliant 
embryo -fetal d evelopment studies in rats and rabbits, developmental toxicities were observed in 
rats but not rabbits. Fetal adverse effects in rats were considered likely due to aromatase 
inhibition.

 Summary of Clinical Data 5.2.2.
To date, [ADDRESS_772599] been exposed to AG-348 in 2 clinical studies, a single 
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these subjects exposed to a single AG -348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under fasted and fed conditions; and 36 exposed to repeated doses of AG-348 for up to 14 days.  
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772600] clinical trial in which subjects with PK deficiency will be treated with AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG-348 showed low to moderate variability between subjects. 
After single doses of AG -348 from 30 to 2500 mg, AG-348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587258] (t
max). There appeared to be some lengthening 
of the period of absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] t max and a less-than-
propor tional increase in maximum plasma concentration .  
Dose -normalized area under the curve (AUC) generally remained constant over the dose range 
studied, suggesting that AG-348 total exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean t
1/2 ranged from 1 7.8 to 20.4 hours when samples were collected through 72 hours and 
from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were collected through 120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contributed little to overall exposure of AG -348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587358]
0-12hr and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from  
0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞), suggesting a shorter effective half -life of approximately 3 to 6 hours.  
AG-348 was extensively distributed (mean apparent volume of distribution range of 271 to 
1148 L) and had a moderate rate of clearance (geometric mean clearance range of 10.3 to 
13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG-348 excreted in urine ranged from 0.0145 to 0.0209 across the 
dose levels , suggesting that renal excretion plays a minor role in the systemic elimination of 
AG-348. 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG-348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours (q12h), 
ie, twice daily (BID), to [ADDRESS_772601] dose. AG-348 exposure observed after repeated dosing for 14 days at doses of 120 mg every 24 hours, ie, once daily (QD) to [ADDRESS_772602] was greater at higher doses; lower doses of [ADDRESS_772603] on the PK  
of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,3- DPG was observed at 
3 hours postdose , decreased in a dose-dependent manner to a minimum at 24-hour postdose, and 
then returned to values similar to baseline by 72 to 120 hours postdose . The mean decrease at 
24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_772604] dose of multiple doses and prior to doses in the MAD 
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772605] dose; the concentration of 
ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_772606] dose on Day 14. The magnitude of the increase in ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg BID to 700 mg BID. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well- tolerated among healthy adult subjects at doses that produced 
strong pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP.  
Phase 1 Studies AG348-C-001 and AG348-C- 002 in Healthy Adult Subjects  
After a single AG -348 dose, adverse events occurring in the treatment- emergent period (TEAEs) 
reported by > [ADDRESS_772607] at any time on study (either under fasted or fed conditions) included 
headache (22%), nausea (14%), and contact [CONTACT_587359] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of AG-348 for 14 days,  TEAEs that occurred in > 5% of all AG -348- treated subjects 
across all cohorts included headache (13.9%), nausea (13.9%), vomiting (8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), feeling hot (8.3%), restlessness (8.3%), and dizziness, fatigue, vessel puncture site bruise, hyperhidrosis, dermatitis allergic, and drug eruption (5.6% each). 
A dose-relationship was apparent with regard to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primarily nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing dose. Nausea and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the  SAD study and only 
at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD study. Nausea and vomiting were not observed at any dose ≤ [ADDRESS_772608] been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The 
only Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]; aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with 700  mg AG -348 BID. 
The event was  considered to be possibly related to AG-348, was declared a dose- limiting toxicity 
(DLT ), and led to study drug discontinuation, after  which the elevated liver transaminases 
resolved. Altogether, 3 of 6 subjects treated with AG -348 at 700 mg BID discontinued study 
drug in the MAD study: the subject described above with Grade [ADDRESS_772609] discontinued in the SAD study due to an adverse event (AE). 
Furthermore, no DLTs were observed after a single administration of AG-348 at doses of 30 mg 
to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG-348 for 14 days at daily doses of 15 mg to 700 mg BID except for the event of Grade 3 elevated liver function tests described above.  
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) , the AG348-C-002 (MAD) study included assessment of baseline and serial 
measures of free and total serum testosterone and serum estradiol and estrone. In males treated 
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772610] of the increases in tota l and free testosterone remained within the reference range, except at 
the 360 mg BID dose where the dose group means on Day 8 and Day 14 exceeded the upper 
limit of normal ( ULN ). Most of the estradiol concentrations observed in males remained within 
the reference range, but the mean male estrone concentrations dropped to the lower limit of 
quantification in all dose groups except 15 mg BID.  
These changes in aromatase-dependent hormone levels in the male subjects treated with AG-348 
are consistent with inh ibition of human aromatase, and were reversible within 14 days upon 
cessation of dosing. The study did not enroll enough female subjects to draw any definitive conclusions regarding serial changes in aromatase-dependent hormones over time. 
Phase 2 Study in Adult Subjects with PK Deficiency 
As of a data cutoff of 27 March 2017, among the 52 subjects with PK deficiency who had 
received AG -348 in this study, 50 (96.2%) subjects had experienced at least 1 AE. Adverse 
events that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects across both cohorts included headache (23 [44.2%] subjects); insomnia (20 [38.5%] subjects); nausea (19 [36.5%] subjects); viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (9  [17.3%] subjects); arthralgia and fatigue (8 [15.4%] subjects each); back pain, 
cough, dizziness, hot flush, and vomiting (7 [13.5%] subjects each); and diarrhea and influenza (6 [11.5%] subjects each). 
Thirty -seven of 52 (71.2%) subjects who had received AG- [ADDRESS_772611]  1 AE that 
was considered by [CONTACT_256217]- related. Related AEs that occurred in ≥ 10% 
of AG -348-treated subjects included insomnia (17 [32.7%] subjects), nausea (15 [28.8%] 
subjects), headache (13 [25.0%] subjects), and hot flush (6 [11.5%] subjects). The majority of AEs were assessed by [CONTACT_587360] ( CTCAE ) Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were 
12 (23.1%) subjects with at least 1 reported AE that was CTCAE Grade ≥ 3. Adverse events that 
were Grade ≥ 3 included hypertrigly ceridemia (3  [5.8%] subjects); anemia and insomnia 
(2 [3.8%] subjects each); and hemolysis, colitis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, influenza, 
pharyngitis, postprocedural hemorrhage, dizziness, and hypertension (1 [1.9%] subject each).    Of these, 6  (11.5%) subjects had at least 1 Grade ≥ 3 AE that was considered study drug- related, 
including anemia and hypertriglyceridemia (2  [3.8%] subjects each) as well as hemolysis, 
pharyngitis, dizziness, and insomnia (1 [1.9%] subject each). 
No deaths have been reported in this study.  A total of 9 (17.3%) subjects had experienced at least 1 SAE as of the data cutoff date. A total of 
12 SAEs were reported in 9 subjects, including anemia in 2 (3.8%) subjects; and hemolysis, colitis, enteritis, mesenteric vein thrombosis , influenza, pharyngitis, cholelithiasis, 
postprocedural hemorrhage, osteoporosis, and musculoskeletal weakness in 1 (1.9%) subject each. Six SAEs were reported as being possibly or probably related to AG-348: osteoporosis, hemolysis, anemia ( 2 events), pharyngitis, and musculoskeletal weakness (the latter of which 
was determined to be nonserious after the data cutoff date). In addition, an SAE of

[IP_ADDRESS]. Risk of Withdrawal Hemolysis 
Acute hemolysis  upon sudden withdrawal of AG-[ADDRESS_772616] speaking with the study medical monitor for guidance on appropriate dose 
adjustment to avoid withdrawal hemolysis in subjects who experience a sustained increase in Hb. Any dose modification should be per protocol  (Table 1 ).

AG-[ADDRESS_772617]/inverse agonist which has been documented to affect wakefulness and cognition in humans. No effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies ( Schwartz 2011) . 
Insomnia has been classified as an identified risk of AG-348 treatment, as described in the Investig ator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Risk of Bone Mineral Density Decrease  
AG-[ADDRESS_772618] from 52 treated subjects experienced a medically important event of osteoporosis (Grade 2), which was assessed as likely due to aromatase inhibition.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Risk of Transaminase Increases 
Transient increases in transaminases have been observed with AG -348, as described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. No SAE s or cases of suspected drug -induced liver injuries have been 
reported. Liver function test results should be monitored per protocol. Transaminase increase is an AE of special interest (AESI) for AG -348 (refer to  Section  11.1.5 for details).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Risk of Triglyceride Increases  
Transient increases in triglycerides have been observed with AG -348, as described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. One observed case was an SAE that recovered after AG -[ADDRESS_772619] been reported.

Page 36  [IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Risk of Photosensitivity 
AG-[ADDRESS_772620] of this is to enhance oxygen delivery at the tissue level, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic consequences of the anemia. AG -348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 12 hours following a 
single dose) in 2,3- DPG in [ADDRESS_772621] elevated 2,3 -DPG levels, it is theoretically possible that 
decreases in 2,3 -DPG that precede correction of the anemia could result in a temporary decrease 
of oxygen delivery at the tissue level resulting in clinical symptoms (eg, increased fatigue).  
Subjects should not discontinue dosing without first speaking with the treating Investigator; abrupt discontinuation of AG-[ADDRESS_772622] who experience a substantial increase in Hb may result in withdrawal hemolysis.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
Study AG348-C-003 is a Phase 2, open- label, 2-arm, multicenter, randomized, dose- ranging 
study in adult subjects with PK deficiency; the study will be divided in to a Core Perio d and an 
Extension Period. During the Core Period, subjects will receive multiple doses of AG-348 for up 
to 24 weeks; subjects who are eligible can enter the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up 
to 2 years following the end of the Core Period.  
Subjec ts with PK deficiency confirmed by [CONTACT_587361]. At the Week 24 visit, subjects who safely tolerate AG -348 
and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible to immedia tely roll over to the 
Extension Period for continued treatment. Subjects who complete treatment at the end of the 
Core Period (24 weeks) will undergo follow -up assessment [ADDRESS_772628] discontinues at any other time (including discontinuation during the Core or Extension Period), follow-up assessments will be conducted [ADDRESS_772629] to follow-up. 
For the Core Period, up to 25 subjects will be initially randomized on an open-label, 1:1 basis to 
each of 2 BID doses of AG-348 (up to 50 subjects;  Figure  2).

Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 41  The dose of Arm 1 is 300 mg of AG -348 administered PO q12h (ie, BID). The dose of Arm [ADDRESS_772630] of 
4 levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H, and all other mutations as “other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_76478]  1 of the indi cated mutations; subjects with more than  
1 stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion. 
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been selected from the AG348-C-001 SAD 
study and AG348-C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult subjects to represent the range of doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP.  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible subject population and because the underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected subjects is heterogeneous due to the wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is deemed important to focus closely on dose findings in this first-inpatient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 administered BID, a DRT will be established to review study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348 as indicated.  
The D RT will monitor safety on an on going basis  and meet at regular intervals of approximately 
every 6  weeks, or ad hoc  as necessary, for as long as any subjects are still in the Core Period to 
review AEs, VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis), and ECGs. The DRT will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical activity (eg, changes from baseline in Hb). These DRT meetings will also include data review for all subjects that may be under treatment in the Extension Period.  
If there are no sub jects still being treated in the Core Period, and the only subjects on treatment 
are those in the Extension Period, then the frequency of the DRT meetings will reduce to approximately every [ADDRESS_772631] visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period. When all the subjects are in the Extension Period, PK/PD data will no longer be reviewed by [CONTACT_550627]. The DRT will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer. 
Beginning [ADDRESS_772632] is dosed in the Core Period or ad hoc as necessary, and 
proceeding according the schedule indicated above (approximately every [ADDRESS_772633] completed the Core Period), the DRT will review cumulative safety data, available PK/PD 
data, and clinical activity data.  
Based on the DRT’s recurring, the DRT may exercise 1 or more of the following options during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 subjects at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm 3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not 
exceed 360  mg BID; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than BID.

Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 42  • Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm 3).  
Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to allow further review, for 
example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity.  
• Re-assign subject’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to mat ch the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the subjects in the terminated arm will remain in their original arm, ie, they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. 
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in  [ADDRESS_772634] clinical relevance.  
The DRT may exercise 1 or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatment without change.  
• Re-assign subjects’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer, and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical activity.  
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinic al data (eg, for 
unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity).  
The data that the DRT will review to make these decisions are expected to include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Obser vations:  All AEs, VS, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs. 
• PK and PD Observations:  Includes changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP, except when all 
subjects are in the Extension Period. 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  Includes changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  LDH, EPO, hepcidin, total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin 
saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772635] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy adult subjects. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
Subjects in the Extension Period will undergo a gradual dose- taper regimen  to identify the 
optimal maintenance dose for each  (defined as the dose that results in ≤ 1.0 g/dL decrease in Hb 
compared to the pre- taper Hb value on at least 2 measurements following each dose taper step) 
on a per-subject basis (Section  9.7.3).

Page 43  Due to the potential for AG -348- mediated aromatase inhibition , combined with the known risk 
of osteoporosis in subjects with congenital hemolytic anemias (Steer, et al. 2017; Wong, et al. 
2014 ), DXA scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening (if subject has not had prior 
DXA scan within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain bone mineral density and T and Z scores. These 
data are intended to serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling subjects, and are deemed of particular importance for  those who may enter the longer- term 
Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatment (Core Period). All subjects will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks [ADDRESS_772636] additional DXA scans at Months 12, 18, 24, and 30. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (eg, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing arm. Randomization and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_772637]’s dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772638] dose of study treatment. During the Core Period, subjects will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 (Days 8, 
15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Subjects who safely tolerate AG 348 through Week 24 (Core Period) may be eligible to immediately enter the Extension Period for continued treatment.  
Study v isits for safety and clinical activity assessments will occur approximately every 3 months 
during the Extension Period for up to 2 years after the end of the Core Period, except during the dose taper part of the Extension Period when weekly visits will be performed (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
for details). All subjects will undergo a follow -up assessment [ADDRESS_772639] dose of the Extension Period except for those who may continue treatment in an extension study (to be designed) after having completed the Extension Period. 
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including SAEs, AESIs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (eg, hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis); physical examination findings (including neurological ex amination); VS; 
12-lead ECGs, and DXA scans. Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone [total and free], estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX), 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3 levels, total cholesterol, HDL-C, 
and triglycerides.  
Follow-up assessments will be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28) for subjects who do not enter 
the Extension Period and will include physical examination, weight, performance status, VS, 12-lead ECGs, lab oratory evaluations (hematology, Hp, EPO levels, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies, urinalysis; lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and transfusion record.

AG-348 for subjects who discontinue prior to completion of the Core Period and for those who discontinue in the Extension Period. Menstruating female subjects will also be required to keep a paper -based menstrual cycle diary throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702.  
Pharmacodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for determination of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling will be conducted on the first approximately 10 subjects total treated in Arms 1 and 2 of the Core Period ( Appendix 1.3) while limited PK/PD 
sampling will be conducted on the remainder of treated subjects  (Appendix 1.4).  Limited trough 
sampling will be conducted every 3 months during the Extension Period ( Appendix 1.2).  
 
 
 
 
7.2. Rationale for the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG-[ADDRESS_772640] safely tolerated dose (Arm 1: 300 mg BID) and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD activity (Arm 2: 50  mg BID) from the forerunner AG348-C-002 MAD study in healthy adult 
subjects.  
Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms and/or 
implementation of an additional dose arm will be based on DRT review of safety, PK and PD data, and indica tors of clinical activity collected from all subjects treated in Arm [ADDRESS_772641] 
dose and schedule should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in subjects with PK deficiency compared with healthy adult subjects.  
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to subjects include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587362] (potentially) large increases in Hb level ( Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2) . Measures intended 
to maximize the opportunity for subject s with demonstrated safety and tolerability  to continue to 
derive benefit from any observed clinical activity of AG -348 include the option for continued 
treatment in the Extension Period.  
A comprehensive series of safety evaluations, including laboratory parameters, physical 
examinations  (including neurological examination), VS, 12-lead ECGs, and monitoring for SAEs 
and AEs, will be conducted to evaluate the safety profile of AG-[ADDRESS_772642] 2 different doses of the study drug to 
assess its PK and PD profiles.

Page 45  Consistent with the design of many Phase 2 studies, pre liminary evaluation of the potential PD

7.3. Rationales Related to Dosing  
 Rationale for the Starting Dose 7.3.1.
Prior to execution of this study, the Sponsor conducted 2 clinical studies of AG -348 in healthy 
adult subjects, including a SAD study (AG348-C-001) and a MAD (14-day, BID) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these [ADDRESS_772643] been dosed with 
AG-348. In vitro investigations, also reported in the Investigator’s Brochure, had previously demonstrated that AG- 348 increased the activity of WT PKR approximately to the same extent 
as it did a series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasonable to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AG-348 in healthy subjects in a controlled Phase 1 setting as a more efficient means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of subjects with PK deficiency.  
The MAD study demonstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248]-348 doses from 60 mg BID to 
360 mg BID (including 120 mg QD) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposures resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_772644] dose ranging study in subjects with PK deficiency were selected to be 300 mg BID (Arm 1)  and 50 mg BID (Arm 2). These doses were 
demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy adult subject studies.  
 Rationale for the Dose Range 7.3.2.
The availability of ATP is proposed as being critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane 
integrity (Section 5.1). T he dose ranges from 50 mg BID to 300 mg BID may result in clinically 
effective modulation of PKR in PK deficiency subjects if the mutated enzyme is responsive to AG-348 in a similar manner to the WT enzyme in healthy subjects. However, there are many 
different mutations in PKR that result in PK deficiency, and these mutations produce variable effects on the enzyme in terms of catalytic activity and thermal stability. It is not known if different mutations will respond clinically in a similar manner to the same exposure to AG -348. 
Therefore, it is prudent to study the range of safe and pharmacodynamically relevant doses as specified in this study, and to allow flexibility for the DRT to analyze the evolving study data to adapt the dose and schedule of administration of AG-348 to produce the optimal combination of safety, tolerability, and PD, and, potentially, clinical response. 
 Rationale for the Duration of Dosing  7.3.3.
The initial treatment duration of 24 we eks (6 months) for the Core Period was chosen for this 
proof-of-concept trial for 2 principal reasons: 1) to begin establishing a safety database 
addressing the chronic administration of AG- 348; and 2) to allow sufficient time for clinical 
response to treatment to appear.  

Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 46  It is anticipated that this treatment, if successful, may be taken for life, as PK deficiency is a 
genetically determined inborn error of metabolism. Therefore, it is important to begin to investigate the long -term safety of the treatment. As will be discussed below, the safety package 
supports the treatment duration of 6 months.  
Red blood cell turnover is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 120 days (4 months), although it may be shorter in some 
populations of pyruvate kinase deficient RBCs  (Mentzer, et al. 1971) . Different PKR mutations 
produce a variety of physiologic consequences. In mutations where normal or nearly normal levels of PKR  protein persist, but the protein catalytic function is impaired, an improvement in 
PKR functional activity might be seen relatively quickly upon exposure to AG-348. However, in cases where the PKR mutation results in an unstable mutant, PKR protein levels  may be low and 
additional time may be required for stabilization of the newly synthesized mutant enzyme in developi[INVESTIGATOR_587261].  
This study plans up to 24 weeks of dosing with AG-348 during the Core Period with the 
possibility of continued dosing beyond 24 weeks during the Extension Period, up to 2 years, in subjects for whom AG- 348 is safely tolerated and demonstrates clinical acti vity.  
The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline M3(R2) on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorisation for Pharmaceuticals recommends that clinical trials of a duration between [ADDRESS_772645] equivalent duration, and clinical trials lasting beyond 6  months should be supported by 6-month rodent and 9-month nonrodent 
studies. This guidance allows for clinical trials of longer duration to be initiated based on 3 
months of nonclinical data, and for clinical dosing in serious or life-threatening indications to be extended based on complete chronic rodent data and in-life and necropsy data in the nonrodent (and complete histopathology in the nonrodent provided within an additional 3 months).  
For the current investigational product (AG- 348), 13- week, repeat -dose toxicology studies have 
been completed and are summarized in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol and in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure. Considering that PK deficiency is a serious condition with an unmet 
medical need, it is appropriate to initiate this clinical study with the available nonclinical data.  
 Rationale for Ident ification of Individual Optimal Maintenance Dose and Gradual 7.3.4.
Dose -Taper Regimen  
AG-348 has proven efficacious across a range of doses in this study, with several subjects having achieved and maintained clinically meaningful increases in Hb at doses < [ADDRESS_772646] been implemented in this study only for safety/tolerability reasons and in subjects with Hb values reaching > 13.5 g/dL (for women) or > 15.0 g/dL  (for men).  
In subjects who have a sustained increase in Hb while continuing to tolerate their randomized dose of either 50 mg BID or 300 mg BID, there is no provision in the current protocol for dose de-escalation. However, it is possible and even likely that some subjects may maintain improved Hb values at a lower dose of AG-348.  
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.[ADDRESS_772647]’s dose while maintaining a desirable Hb level.  
Subjects remaining on study are receiving AG-348 across a wide range of doses (from 300 mg BID to 5 mg QD). These observations indicate that the optimal maintenance dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772648] and cannot be determined in advance. Consequently, individual optimal maintenance doses will be determined empi[INVESTIGATOR_587262].  
An additional justification for implementing a gradual dose taper is the finding that abrupt 
cessation of treatment with AG -348, which was implemented for 2 responsive subjects in the 
Core Period with Hb values over the protocol-defined threshold, resulted in withdrawal hemolysis and anemia. Therefore, it is not known whether a sharp decrease in AG-348 dosing (eg, from 300 mg BID to 50 mg BID) would have the same effect as a treatment interruption; however, the scenario is  theoretically possible in subjects with an individual optimal 
maintenance dose > 50 mg BID.  
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], there is sufficient reasonable cause. In the event of su ch action, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to each Investigator. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

The site will provide a request for randomization form (including the subject’s confirmed genotype) to the study Medical Monitor. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587374] r the specific mutations expected to be most frequently enrolled. The PKR  mutation 
stratification factor will consist of 4  levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H, and all other mutations 
as “other”). Since this is an open label study, randomization will not be blinded. 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure. 
8.6. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Subjects will be 
withdrawn from study-related procedures and treatments under any of the following conditions: 
 
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 54  • Withdrawal of consent. 
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity.  
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation 
in the trial.  
• Subject requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication (Se ction  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• Investigator decision 
• Protocol violation (nonadherence to protocol requirements). 
• Pregnancy.  
• Lost to follow-up. 
Should a subject decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-
defined study observations up to the time of the subject’s withdrawal as completely as possible and to determine the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event a subject is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be informed. If 
there is  a medical reason for withdrawal, the subject will remain under the supervision of the 
Investigator until the AE  resolves, is declared chronic by [CONTACT_737], or the subject is lost to 
follow-up. 
When a subject withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation, if known, 
must be recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_772664] 12 weeks of assigned dosing for reasons other than AEs may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.

9.1. Description of Stu dy Drug  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules will be provided as 5 mg, 25 mg, or 100 mg (free -base 
equivalent) of AG-[ADDRESS_772665] gelatin 
capsules.  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the supply of any specific capsule strength should the evolving trial experience demonstrate that the specific  capsule strength fills no additional need beyond the other capsule 
strengths available. Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for further details regarding study drug. 
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in whit e, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements.  
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
The recommended storage condition and expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061] (where required) are stated on the product label. 
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to  Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25 subjects will be randomized to any 1 of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomization will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587375] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-[ADDRESS_772666] qualifies for and is randomized into the study. Subjects in the Extension Period will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core Period, unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the Core Period (the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg BID).  
9.5. Blinding  
This is a n open-label study; no blinding methods will be used. 
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial 2 treatment arms, (Arm  1 and Arm 2) in the Core Period, AG-348 will be 
administered PO BID (approximately q12h, with a minimum of 10 hours bet ween doses) over a 
24-week treatment period. Starting with Day  1, dosing will be continuous; there will be no rest 
periods. Subjects who do not meet any of the treatment withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.6) may 
continue treatment for the entire 24 -week treatment period.  
Clinical Study Protocol AG348-C-003 Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment #5, Version 6.0 30 June 2017  
Page 56  Subjects will be dispensed the appropriate number of Sponsor-packaged, labeled bottles to allow 
for dosing until the next scheduled visit. The amount of study drug dispensed should be sufficient to  provide an adequate reserve supply of AG-348 to ensure uninterrupted dosing in the 
event of an unexpected delay for the next scheduled study visit (seven extra days of dosing supply are recommended during the Core Period; 14 extra days is recommended duri ng the 
Extension Period). 
Subjects will be given a dosing diary to be used for each 28-day dosing period. They should 
record relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (eg, confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses).  
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing diary (see Section  9.9).  
Subjects should be instructed to take their daily dose at approximately the same times each day except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Subjects who undergo extensive PK/PD sampling during the Core Period (see  Appendix 1.3) 
should be instructed from Week [ADDRESS_772667] the dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
Subjects receiving limited PK/PD sampling during the Core Period (see  Appendix 1.4)  should be 
instructed to bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits and to ta ke the AM dose 
following PK/PD blood draws.  Subjects receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_772668] limited PK/PD on 
other visit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, subjects will bring in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following PK/PD blood draws. Subjects not continuing into the Extension Period are not required to take the Week 24/Day 169 morning dose of AG -348 after the required PK/PD blood samples are collected, as these subjects will be 
discontinuing the study. 
A minimum of [ADDRESS_772669] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587376]. 
Subjects will receive their first dose of AG -348 in the clinic on Day 1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis (except for in-clinic visit days, as described above). 
9.7. Criteria for Dose Escalation, Dose Modification, or Discontinuation 
of Study Drug  
Intra -subject dose escalations will b e permitted in this study under [ADDRESS_772670], the 
DRT may decide to re-assign subjects’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose 
and schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the subjects in the terminated arm will remai n in their originally assigned arm; ie, they will not count towards the enrollment quota of 
the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted.

Dosing modifications, as outlined below, will be implemented following discussions with the 
Medical Monitor.  
Subjects should be advised not to discontinue dosing without first speaking with the treating 
Investigator—abrupt discontinuation of AG-[ADDRESS_772675]’s dose of AG-348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb levels

All subjects in the Extension Period who are receiving doses > 25 mg BID will undergo an 
individual and gradual dose- taper regimen  to identify their individual optimal maintenance 
doses, defined as the dose that results in ≤ 1.0 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin compared to the pretaper Hb value on at least 2 weekly measurements following each dose taper step. The 
minimum dose target is 25  mg BID.

After each dose reduction, the subject will remain on the reduced dose for a period of [ADDRESS_772680] reduced dose. If Hb (mean of 
these 2 Hb levels)  has decreased by ≤ 1.0 g/dL from the pre taper value, the dose should be 
decreased to the next level at the 3 week visit, and the process repeated. If, at any step during this process, Hb (mean of levels after 1 week and 2 weeks at a reduced dose) has decreased by > 1.0 g/dL below the pretaper Hb value, the subject’s dose should be increased to the next higher 
dose level.  
Table 4  shows the Schedule of Assessments during the dose- taper regimen . The Hb values used 
to guide dose taper deci sions ( pre-dose taper , after 1 and 2 weeks of dose taper at each step) 
should be those provided by [CONTACT_2237]. In exceptional cases when these central 
laboratory Hb values are not available at the visit [ADDRESS_772681]’s home by a visiting nurse, at the local physician’s office, or at a local laboratory, with the samples being shipped promptly to the central laboratory.

resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of suspension of dosing, and for Grade 4 AEs, unless the benefits outweigh the risks of resuming treatment and are approved by [CONTACT_317418] ( Section  9.7.1). Other reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.6. 
9.8. Duration of Subject Participation  
The duration of treatment for all subjects  will be up to 24 weeks in the Core Period. Subjects 
who safely tolerate AG -348 and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of AG-348 
treatment may be eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued treatment (up to 2 years following completion of the Core Period). 
9.9. Treatment Compliance  
During in-clinic visits, doses of AG-[ADDRESS_772684] under the supervision of clinical facility personnel. For at -home dosing, subjects will be given a dosing diary to be used 
for the duration of the 24-week Core Period; the diary will also be used by [CONTACT_587380]. Subjects should record relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (eg, confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses) and return the diary at each study visit. 
9.10. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability r ecords indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6992], and return to the 
Sponsor or its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_1034]). These records will adequately document that the subjects were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from the Sponsor. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and subject numbers. A monitor will review drug accountability at the site on a schedule agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_587381]. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587264], if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard Operating Pr ocedures  and documented. All material cont aining AG -348 will be treated 
and disposed of as hazardous waste in accordance with governing regulations.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomitant Therapy Requiring Careful Monitoring (Use with Caution)  
The following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587265]. If this is not possible, subjects receiving these drugs should be adequately monitored. 
• Corticosteroids (sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 and weak CYP3A4 inducers). 
• Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 4.4).  
• Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 4.1).  
• Sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 (listed in Appendix 4.5).  
• Proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (listed in Appendix 4.6 ) should be 
used with caution. Antacids such as magnesium hydroxide and  alum inum hydroxide can 
be used with AG-348.  
• AG-348, being a potential CYP3A4 inducer, has the potential to reduce the effectiveness 
of oral contraceptives. Therefore, women using oral contraceptives must also utilize a 
barrier method while enrolled in the stud y and till at least [ADDRESS_772692] dose of 
study drug, as specified in Inclusion Criterion 12 (see Section 8.2).  
• Drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin (including some common sulfa 
antibiotics [including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim], cephalosporins, salicylates, and 
aminophylline) should be used with caution with the understanding that subjects with 
elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin may potentially be at risk for kernicterus syndrome (Strauss, et  al. 2006). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to acceptable local standards of medical care. The expected subject comedications deferoxamine, deferasirox, deferiprone, and oral penicillin are not expected to int eract with AG -348. Subjects 
may receive analgesics, anti -emetics, anti -infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as 
medically indicated and consistent with the guidance in the previous [ADDRESS_772693] 1 mg of f olic acid for the duration of the study. 
All concomitant medications, including transfusions of blood products, procedures performed during the study, including those used to treat AEs, will be recorded on the eCRF.

Page 65  9.12. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea  
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti- emetic and antidiarrheal or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, if subjects experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, these may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follows: 
• Nausea/vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron 
(Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Not recommended are 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP3A4 inhibitor), ondansetron (Zofran; CYP3A4 inducer), chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP3A4 inducer), prochlorperazine (Compazine; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been reported), and granisetron (Kytril; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been reported). 
• Diarrhea: recommended management includes standard clinical dosing with 
Kaopectate or other nonabsorbable anti-diarrheals, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Lomotil), 
or loperamide (Imodium). Loperamide is the least preferred choice because it is both 
a substrate and inhibitor for CYP3A4, a substrate for CYP2B6, and a substrate for P-gp. 
• For the use of any medications not specifically mentioned above the Investigator may 
confer with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.

A complete physical examination (including neurological examination; genital and rectal 
examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow up Visit (Week 28). The neurological examination must include an assessment of general orientation and mental status including level of alertness (assess as normal or abnormal and specify any abnormality).  
Limited , focused physical examinations will be performed at all other visits during the Core 
Period. Focused physical examinations, including neurological examination, will continue every 3 months during the Extension Period; a complete physical examination will be performed at Month 30.  
Any f indings will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Height will be collected at Screening only.  
  Vital Signs  10.5.2.
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will 
be obtained accordi

The 12-lead ECGs should be obtained following 5 minutes of recumbency. ECGs will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts are present, or if machine/equipment errors occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings wi ll be 
recorded as AEs.  
  DXA Scans  10.5.4.
DXA scans (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening to obtain T and Z scores and bone 
mineral density that will serve as a baseline measure for all enrolling subjects. An additional DXA scan for the Core Period will be conducted in the interval between Week  24 and Week 28, 
and scans will be conducted at Months 12, 18, 24, and 30 during the Extension Period as indicated in the Schedules of Assessments  (Appendix 1.2).  All redacted DXA scan reports must 
be held at the study site and will be collected by [CONTACT_1034]. 
  Safety Laboratory Assessments 10.5.5.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Laboratory values obtained prior to Screening and RBC antibodies obtained at Scre ening will be 
performed at a local laboratory. On -study clinical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by 
a central laboratory. If Investigators believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain safety 
laboratory results from their own local laboratories on the day of the subject's visit, and before the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their discretion to do so. Investigators should be aware that since the Hb level is a secondary endpoint of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab must still be collected, since it will serve as the official lab result for this study.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be collected according to the Schedules of Assessments 
(Appendix 1). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing will 
be followed by

has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_772714] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered stu dy drug -related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An A E can 
arise from any use of the drug (eg, off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
  Suspected Adverse Reaction  11.1.2.
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which t here is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.

An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, eg, the Investigator’s Brochure. 
  Serious Adverse Event  11.1.4.An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death . 
• Life-threatening (meaning that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred; ie, it does not include a reaction which hypothetic ally might 
have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form). 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study (eg, surgery performed earlier than planned).

those that have increased to ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_772716] decreased to < 2.5 × baseline. If a dose adjustment is being considered, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor and refer to Section  9.7.1. 
In the event of a transaminase increase of > 2.5 × baseline or  1 that has increased to ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_772717] be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of nonleading questions (eg, “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and spontaneous reports from subjects. 
All AEs (serious and nonserious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the appropriate source documentation and eCRF.  
Treatment -emergent abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if 
there are accompanying symptoms; if additional diagnostic evaluations or medical (including 
drug therapy) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737].

Page 77  Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes: 
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded). 
• The date of onset of the event. 
• The date of resolution of the event. 
• Whether the event is serious or not. 
• Intensity of the event (see below for definitions). 
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions). 
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (eg, temporary interruption in dosing); drug treatment required; nondrug treatment requ ired; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59359] (complete SAE page); diagnostic procedure

Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03 ( Appendix 3).  
Relationship  to study drug administration wi ll be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
•  Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE 
is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the study treatment.  
•  Possibly Related:  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and 
the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587395]. An attribution of possibly related means that there are facts  in evidence to 
suggest a possible relationship. 
•  Probably Related:  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and 
the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_587396], or the study treatment was th e most likely cause of the AE. An attribution of 
probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a probable relationship.  
For the purpose of safety analyses related to final database review, all AEs that are classified as Possibly Relate d or Probably Related will be considered treatment -related AEs.  
11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs (eg, spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnanc y in a

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_772753], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added) ; 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subjects, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The he alth 
of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject's best interest when providing medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions in volve risks and 
burdens.

5. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a re search ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any SAEs. No change to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
6. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_62383]. Research in subjects with a particular diagnosis or healthy adult subjects requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The responsibility for

preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
15. For medical research using identifiable human mate rial or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.

19. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious subjects, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for i nvolving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give 
informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
20. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their re search on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy 
of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
1. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.

• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current 
proven intervention exists.  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the 
subjects who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
3. At the conclusion of the study, subjects entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
4. The physician must fully inform the subject which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a subject to participate in a study or the subject's decision to withdraw from the study must never i nterfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
5. In the treatment of a subject, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if, in the physician's judgment, it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate i ts safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be 
recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

Methodology: 
Study AG3 48-C-003 is a Phase 2, open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging study in  
adult patients with PK deficiency ; the study will be divided in to a Core Period and an Extension Period. 
During the Core Period, patients will  receive multiple doses of AG -348 for up to 24 weeks; patients who 
are eligible can enter the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up to 2 years following the end of the 
Core Period. Patients with PK deficiency confirmed by [CONTACT_29617] (RBC) PK enzyma tic assay 
performed at Screening will be eligible to participate in this study. At W eek 25, patients who safely 
tolerate AG-348 and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible to immediately roll over to 
the E xtension Period for continued treat ment.  Patients who complete treatment at the end of the Core 
Period  (24 weeks ) will undergo follow- up assessment [ADDRESS_772762] dose of study drug. If a 
patient discontinues at any other time (including early discontinuation or discontinuation during the Core 
or Extension Period), the follow -up assessment s will be conducted 4 weeks after discontinuation . 
Patients with toxicity suspected to be related to study drug will continue follow- up until the  adverse 
event (AE) resolves, is declared chronic by [CONTACT_737],  or the patient is lost to follow -up.  
For the Core Period, up to 25 patients will be initially randomized on an open- label  1:1 basis to each of 
two twice -daily (BID) doses of AG-348 ( up to 50 patients  total; see Figure  1, Study Schema). The dose 
of Arm  1 is 300 mg of A G-348 administered orally  (PO)  every 12  hours (q12h, BID). The dose of Arm 2 
is 50 mg of A G-348 administered PO q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587404]. The PKR  mutation stratification facto r will consist of 4  levels ( R510Q, 
R486W , and  R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_587405]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned 
based on Sponsor ’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been selected from the AG348 -C-001 single ascending 
dose (SAD) and AG348-C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of doses/exposures that w ere safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-
maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP .  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected pa tients is heterogen eous due to the wide 
variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is important to focus closely on dose findings in this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 
administered q12h, a Data Review Team (DRT) will be establi shed to review study data on a regular 
basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348.

The DRT  will monitor safety on an on -going basis and meet at regular intervals  of approximately every  
6 weeks, or ad hoc , as necessary,  for as long as any patients are still in the Core Period  to review AEs, 
vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis), and electrocardi ograms ( ECG s). The DRT  will also review available PK/PD data and 
indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from baseline in Hb). These DRT meetings will also include 
data review for all patients that may be under treatment in the Extension Period. If there are no patients 
still being treated  in the Core Period, and the only patients being treated  are those in the Extension 
Period, then the frequency of the DRT meetings will reduce to approximately every 3 months in order to 
match the frequency of patient visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period. The DRT will be 
comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical 
Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer.   
Beginning [ADDRESS_772763] patient is dosed in the Core Period or ad hoc as necessary,  and 
proceeding according to  the schedule indicated above ( approximately every [ADDRESS_772764] completed 
the Core Period ), the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data , and clinical 
activity data . Based on the DR T’s recurring reviews, the DRT may exercise one or more of the 
following options during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; the dose for Arm 3 may  be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will no t exceed 360  mg q12h; 
and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 
(and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to all ow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of 
signs of clinical activity . 
• Re-assign patients ’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this ca se, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and 
schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT may exercise one or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatment without change; 
• Re-assign patients’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer, and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical activity; 
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinical data (eg, for unacceptable 
safety/tolerability, poor PD  response, or lack of signs of clinical activity ). 
The data that the DRT  will review to make these decision s is expected to  include, but are not necessarily 
limited to, the  following:

• Safety O bservations:  all AEs; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECG;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP; 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
ETCO ( Core Period only), LDH, EPO , hepcidin, total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and 
transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772765] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule  in a potential third dosing arm will be  
determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling 
sched ules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no effect. U nacceptable AEs are defined as ≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at least possibly related to AG -348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to 
≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it 
observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs  that would make it difficult to support long-term dosing. 
Patients in the Extension Period will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core Period, 
unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the Core Period 
(the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h) , or unless the treating Investigator exercises 
the option for intra- patient dose escalation (see Section  9.7.2) .  
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for 
those who enter the longer term Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatm ent (Core Period ). 
All patients will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks [ADDRESS_772766] additional DXA scans at Months 18 and 30. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the stu dy (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing  arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible e arly termination of [ADDRESS_772767] arm, 
the study could enroll up to a maximum of  75 patients .

Dose Modifications for Safety and/or Increase in Hb Level  
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an individual 
patient’s dose of AG -348 will be based on AEs and/or observed changes in Hb level as describe d in 
Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2. The same criteria for dose modifications will  apply in the Extension

conducted separately within each dose arm, or pooled when appropriate  Analyses of safety and of 
indicators of clinical activity  will be conducted for the Core Period, Extension Period, and  overall, if 
applicable. For the Core Period, the data to be analyzed will include all collected data through 24 weeks 
of treatment for patients who directly enter the Extension period. For patients who do not enter the 
Extension Period, the analyses will inc lude all collected data through the duration of treatment 
(24 weeks or less) plus 4  week follow up data. For patients who move directly from the Core to the 
Extension Period, the 4 week follow up data will be analyzed as part of the Extension Period. 
Summa ries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demographic data 
including genotype, safety measurements, PK, PD parameters and indicators of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled across all dose groups where 
appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [ SD], median, minimum, and maximum). 
Populations for analysis will include a Safety Analysis Set , a PK Analysis Set, and an Efficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis set will include all patients who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment; this population will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data  and the default analysis 
set for all data analyses unless otherwise stated. Patients will be classified according to treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or 
as the first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . The PK Analysis Set will include 
all patients in the Safety Analysis Set with sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD activity of AG -[ADDRESS_772784] 50% compliance with their 
assigned dos e intensity for at least 4  weeks of continued dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be 
performed on subsets of patients with other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity 
and/or duration of dosing. The Efficacy Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned treatment.  
 
 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the 
incidence of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) (new  or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_92869] (SOC), preferred term, CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action taken 
with study drug, and relationship to study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summarie s will be produced for 
all TEAEs, treatment -related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_192158]), 
SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be 
provided for any deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or reduction of study drug dose, and 
AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment . Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are 
considered treatment -emergent, where treatment- emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at 
the day of first administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_772785] 
dose of study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subsequently considered drug- related by [CONTACT_587415].

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK deficiency ) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in non -
spherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from mild or fully 
compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and life- long chronic hemolytic anemia 
associated with severe, debilitating co -morbidities. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is caused by 
[CONTACT_587353], which results in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR) in the red blood cell (RBC). As shown in the diagram below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible 
step in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, and formation of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecul e ATP. PKR is 
thus a key enzyme for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed that ATP levels are critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity  (van Wijk and 
van Solinge 2005).

Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycerate; 
ADP = adenosine diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6- bisphosphate; PEP = 
phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in PKR that have been described have a deleterious effect on PKR 
catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or protein expression. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is 
associated with reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell mat uration. Mature 
erythrocytes lack mitochondria relying predominantly on glycolysis to generate ATP. It is hypothesized that insufficient energy production promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired 
maintenance of cellular membrane homeostasis.  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and 
compound heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_772794] been identified in patients with PK deficiency  to date, and the majority of these 
mutations are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005) . The prevalence of PK 
deficiency , based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is 
estimated at 51 cases per million in the Caucasian population ( Beutler and Gelbart 2000). 
Some patients with PK deficiency  have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254] ( Christensen, et al. 2011 ; Ghidini, et al. 1991; Hennekam, et al. 1990). 
Infants with PK deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with h epatosplenomegaly, 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is associated  with a

high risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires 
supportive treatment with intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia 
caused by [CONTACT_587354] , as well as supportive transfusion to keep 
their hematocrit (HCT) levels  >60%. 
Adults with PK deficiency  are reported to have life-long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associated co -morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co- morbidities 
include f requent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute on 
chronic hemolytic anemia  (Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life-
threatening iron deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256]. 
The current therapeutic options for patients with PK deficiency  are supportive. Most require life-
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long-
term surveillance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion-independent patients, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587418] ( Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and 
decrease bilirubin levels in some patients. However, this intervention is associated with 
significant morbidity including infection risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis.

metabolism in vivo . Biochemical experiments demonstrate that AG -348 is a potent, pan- activator 
of many PKR alleles associated with PK deficiency . Pyruvate kinsase d eficiency  red cells and 
their progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_587419], including a build-up of PEP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and lowered 
ATP levels. Treatment of PK deficiency  patient red cells ex vivo with AG-[ADDRESS_772796] wild type (WT) PKR enzymes and ex

5.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mutants (mPKR) in vitro , ex vivo , and 
in vivo . Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG-348 Investigator’s

markers was evaluated in human RBCs. AG-348 dose-response curves in human whole blood 
showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI-8702 is a weak activator of the PKR enzyme . In 
whole blood from mice treated with AG -348, 
13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating AG -348- mediated  activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG-[ADDRESS_772799] ATP consistent with activation of PKR.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from patients with PK deficiency . AG-348 activated PKR and induced metabolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK deficiency  patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzymatic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_772800]/inverse 
agonist and an aromatase inhibitor, no effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in toxicology studies ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that neither AG -348 nor AGI-8702 exhibited 
significant inhibition of the human ether-à- go-go related gene (hERG) current ( concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inhibition  [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular ( CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose 
level. No effects were seen in AG -348 G ood Labor atory Practice (GLP) -compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587289]- Dawley rats.  AG-348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose -dependent emetic activity in the ferret at ≥ 30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of AG-348 were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous 
(IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) was administered PO in the food-effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG-348 in animal 
species is characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma clearance 
(CLp), and high volume of distribution at steady- state (V
ss) in rats, dogs, and monkeys.

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
AG-348 has a medium to long a pparent terminal half -life (t1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability  was observed for AG-348 in animals. A high- fat diet led to 
lower oral absorption of AG-348 in monkeys. 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1%) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0 24hr) following 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively. M etabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_772801] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248]-348. There was evidence of metabolism -dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely irreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG-[ADDRESS_772802] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG-348 has the 
potential to cause an in duction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 substrates. 
The routes of metabolism for AG-348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributing > 70% 
of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute < 4% each.  
AG-348 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P- gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P-gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but does not inhibit BCRP. AGI-8702 is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP under the concentrations 
tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
In rats, the no-observed- effect-level/no -observed-adverse- effect -level (NOEL/NOAEL), 
determined as 2000 mg/kg, was associated with area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC
0-12hr) values 223- to 526-fold the projected human efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In dogs, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC
0-12hr value 5.7-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The NOEL/NOAEL in do gs 
was 10 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 0.8-fold the projected efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In monkeys, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, with only non- adverse emesis and 
body weight loss seen; this dose was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 70-fold the projected 
efficacious AUC [ADDRESS_772803] appropriate species for further evaluation in toxicology studies.  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) in cynomolgus monkeys was defined in non- GLP 5 -day and 
14-day repeat -dose studies as emesis , inappetence, and weight loss. These toxicities became dose 
limiting at AUC 0-12hr values 27- to 34-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and 
30 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
precluded meaningful evaluation of other toxicities at this exposure level. Potential other effec ts 
at this exposure level were observed in  a number hematology and serum chemistry parameters as 
well as in lymphoid organs. Additionally, minimal potential effects in kidneys (ren al 
tubulointerstitial nephritis) and heart (myocardial degeneration), which could not be 
differentiated from spontaneous background lesions, were seen when monkeys were exposed to 
AG-348 AUC 0-12hr values ≥ 27- to 34-fold the projected human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value.  
In GLP -compliant 28-day monkey study, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose twice daily 
[BID] ) was  the NOAEL. Effects were limited to increased liver weights without serum chemistry 
or microscopic correlate. At this dosage level, the Day 27 AUC 0-12hr values were 8.9 - and 
8.5-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females respectively. In the same 
study, the low dosage of 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose) resulted in AUC 0-12hr values that 
approximated the efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and there were no test article- related effects seen. 
The next highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day (25 mg/kg/dose) was the NOEL and was associated with 
AUC 0-12hr values 3.1- and 2.6- fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females 
respectively.   
In the GLP-compliant 28-day rat study, the NOAEL in males was the highest dose tested, 600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose), and the NOAEL  in females was the lowest dose tested, 
20 mg/kg/day (10  mg/kg/dose). At the 600 mg/kg/day dosage level in males, AG-348- related 
findings were limited to mild effects on hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, and microscopic findings in the adrenal gland (minimal to mild vacuolation of the adrenal zona 
glomerulosa and decreased thickness of the zona fasciculate), liver (minimal to mild 
hepatocellular hypertrophy), kidney (minimal tubular vacuolation), pancreas (minimal to moderate decreased zymogen granules), heart (minimal myocardial vacuolation), and prostate 
(minimal to mild decreased secretion). A ll findings were fully reversible over the 14- day 
recovery period with the exception of decreased serum glucose levels and decreased prostate 
secretion. In females, the highest dosage tested was 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) ; adverse 
effects observed were similar to those observed in the 600 mg/kg/day males, with the exception that in females, fewer effects in hematology and serum chemistry parameters were seen, and also in females, adverse effects in the reproductive organs consistent with aromatase inhib ition were 
observed.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermatid retention, and Leydig cell 
hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at dose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. These effects were either not present or present with incidence and severity 
similar to that of the vehicle group  in lower dose levels. Adve rse effects in females included 
uterine atrophy and increased folding of the luminal surface ; these effects were defined as 
adverse at the dose level at which they ar e expected to impair fertility   
In the 13- week repeat -dose study in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified, and no new 
effects were ident ified when compared to the 4- week repeat -dose study. Similar to what occurred 
on the 4-week study, inappetence and emesis during the initial 1-2 weeks of dosing occurred, precluding evaluation of higher doses.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with  an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). In the 
GLP -compliant 28- day rat study, histologic effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
[ADDRESS_772804] at the mid - and high-dosage levels (100 and 200 mg/kg/day)  
and included incomplete corpora lutea; ovarian follicular cysts; ovarian cystic, luteinized 
follicles; uterine atrophy; vaginal mucification; and altered cyclicity. A lthough these f indings 
were minimal to mild and were fully reversible  (over 14 days), they were considered adverse and 
the next lower dosage evaluated, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose BID) was the NOAEL in females. The Day 27 AUC
0-12hr value associated with this dosage level  was 6.9-fold the projected 
human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The potential for aromatase inhibition effects occurring in 
female rats at AUC 0-12hr values > 6.9-fold and < [ADDRESS_772805] been exposed to AG-348 in 2 clinical studies , a single  
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these 
subjects exposed to a single AG-348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under fasted and fed conditions; and [ADDRESS_772806] clinical trial in which patients with PK deficiency will be treated with AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic s 
The pharmacokinetics ( PK) of AG -348 showed low to moderate variab ility between subjects. 
After single doses of AG -348 from  30 to 2500 mg, AG-348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587258] (T
max). There appeared to be some lengthening 
of the period of absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] T max and a less than 
proportional increase in maximum plasma  concentration (C max). Dose-normalized area under the 
curve ( AUC ) generally remained constant over the dose range studied, suggesting that AG-348 
total expos ure increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean t 1/2 ranged from 17.8 to 20.4 
hours when samples were collected through 72 hours and from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were collected through 120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contributed little to 
overall exposure of AG- 348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587420]
0-12 and area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), suggesting a 
shorter effective half -life of approximately 3 to 6 hours. AG-348 was extensively distributed 
(mean apparent volume of distribution [V z/F] range of 271 to 1148 L) and had a moderate rate of 
clearance (geometric mean clearance [CL/F] range of 10.3 to 13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG-348 
excreted in urine ranged from 0.0145 to 0.0209 across the dose levels suggesting that renal 
excretion plays a minor role in the systemic elimination of AG -348. 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG-348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours (q12h) 
to [ADDRESS_772807] dose. AG -348 exposure observed after repeated dosing for 14 days at doses of 
120 mg every 24 hours (q24h) to [ADDRESS_772808] was greater at higher doses ; lower doses of [ADDRESS_772809] US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) high fat meal, showed that food likely has a minimal effect on the PK of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,3- DPG was observed at 
[ADDRESS_772810]-dose . The mean decrease 
at 24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_772811] dose; the concentration of ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_772812] dose on 
Day 14. The magnitude of the increase in ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg BID to 700 mg BID. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well- tolerated among healthy volunteers  at doses that produced strong 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP . 
After a single AG -348 dose, treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by > [ADDRESS_772813] 
at any time on study (either under fasted or fed conditions) included headache (22%), nausea 
(14%), and contact [CONTACT_587421] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of AG-348 for 
14 days, TEAEs that occurred in > 5% of all AG -348- treated subjects across all  cohorts included 
headache ( 13.9%), nausea (13.9%), vomiting (8.3 %), decreased ap petite (8.3%), feeling hot 
(8.3%), restlessness (8.3%), and dizziness, fatigue, vessel puncture site bruise,  hyperhidrosis, 
dermatitis allergic, and drug eruption (5.6% each). 
A dose-relationship was apparent with regard to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primarily nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing 
dose. Nausea and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the single  dose study 
and only at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD  study. Nausea and vomit ing were not observed at any 
dose ≤ 360 mg in either the single or multiple dose studies. 
All but 1 TEAE reported to date has been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The only 
Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferas e [ALT] ; aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with 700 mg  AG-348 BID. 
33 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
The event was considered to be possibly related to AG- 348, was declared  a DLT , and led to 
study drug discontinuation, following which the elevated liver transaminases resolved. 
Altogether, 3 of 6 subjects  treated with AG -348 at 700 mg BID  discontinued study drug in the 
MAD study: the subject described above with Grade [ADDRESS_772814] 
discontinued in the SAD study due to an adverse event (AE).  
No deaths or other serious AEs  (SAEs) have been reported in any clinical study of AG -348. 
Furthermore, no DLTs  were observed  after a single administration of AG -348 at doses of 30 mg 
to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG-348 for 14 days at daily doses of 15 mg to 700 mg  BID except for the event of Grade 3 elevated liver function tests described above. 
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the AG348-C-[ADDRESS_772815] of the estradiol concentrations observed in 
males remained within the reference range, but the mean male estrone concentrations dropped to 
the lower limit of quantification in all dose groups except 15 mg q12h. These changes in aromatase -dependent hormone levels in the male subjects treated with AG -348 are consistent 
with inhibition of human aromatase, and were reversible within 14 days upon cessation of dosing. The study did not enroll enough female subjects to draw any definitive conclusions regarding serial changes in aromatase-dependent hormones over time. 
As of as this protocol amendment (Study AG348-C-003, Version 5.0), 1 patient with PK 
deficiency (  year -old  1151C>T [T384M]/1529G>A [R510Q]) treated with 300 mg 
AG-348 BID experienced an increase in hemo globin (Hb) from baseline  g/dL (  g/L) to 
 g/dL (  g/L) and a decrease in serum bilirubin at Day 17. The patient’s treatment was 
suspended for 2 days, according to the dose modification guidance in Amendment 2, and then resumed at 100 mg BID on Day 19. The Hb level decreased to  g/dL (  g/L) by [CONTACT_2006] 21 
(before increasing again upon resuming AG- 348) and was associated with an increase in serum 
bilirubin and symptoms of nausea and headache that were similar to symptoms the patient had 
previously noted during hemolytic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. This patient’s course suggests a robust Hb response 
to AG-[ADDRESS_772816] study that will be conducted in patients with  PK deficiency . This 
study is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and potential indicators of 
clinical activity of AG -348 administered for up to 24 weeks . This study will also evaluate the PK  
profile of AG-348 and its metabolite AGI-8702, the P D responses in ATP and 2,3- DPG 
34 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
following administration of AG -348, and the clinical activity of AG-348 in PK deficiency 
patients . Two previous double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials of AG -348 conducted in 
healthy adult male and female volunteers (AG348-C-001, a SAD study ; and AG348-C-002, a 
MAD study ) have established an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for AG -348 for up to 
14 days of both once-daily (QD) and BID dosing at exposures that result in significant PD 
changes in who le blood levels of the glycolytic metabolites 2,3- DPG and ATP . Due to the 
potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (D XA) 
scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data will serve as baseline measures 
of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients (see Section  7.1 for more details).  
The target population of this study consists of adult males and females with a diagnosis of PK 
deficiency , who are anemic but non-transfusion dependent. Non-transfusion dependent patients 
are preferred for this study  in order to reduce any potential confounding effect of transfusion 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587290]. The safety, tolerability, and PK/PD findings in this study will form the basis for subsequent clinical 
development of AG-348. 
The Extension Period is offered in order to allow for longer study of AG-[ADDRESS_772817] to the following study design elements: 
• The initial doses for Arms [ADDRESS_772818] been selected on the basis of safety and 
tolerability observations already carefully made in two predecessor clin ical trials in 
adult healthy male and female volunteers;  
• The specified inclusion/exclusion criteria have been carefully considered to avoid 
enrollment of subjects for whom exposure to the study drug might pose a hazard; 
• A designated Data Review  Team ( DRT) consisting of the overall study Coordinating 
Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer has been established to meet 
regularly a t approximately 6-week intervals t hroughout the duration of the Core 
Period, and approximately every [ADDRESS_772819] the dose of patients in one or both of the initial two study arms, and/or 
implement one new study dose arm. If one new dosing arm is implemented  in the

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
Study AG348-C-003 is a Phase 2, open- label, two -arm, multicenter, randomized, dose- ranging 
study in adult patients with PK deficiency ; the study will be divided in to a Core Period and an 
Extension Period. During the Core Period, patients will receive multiple doses of AG -348 for up 
to 24 weeks ; patients who are eligible can enter  the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up to 
2 years following the end of the Core Period. Patients with PK deficiency  confirmed by [CONTACT_587422]. At W eek 25, 
patients who safely tolerate AG-348 and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible 
to immediately roll over to the Extension Period  for continued treatment. Patient s who complete  
treatment at the end of  the Core Period  (24 weeks ) will undergo follow-up assessment [ADDRESS_772826] dose of study drug. If a patient  discontinues at any other time  (including early 
discontinuation or discontinuation during the Core or Extension Period), follow-up assessment s 
will be conducted [ADDRESS_772827] to follow -up. 
For the Core Period, up to 25 patients  will be  initially  randomized on an open- label,  1:1 basis to 
each of two BID doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients; see Figure  3, Study Schema). The dose of 
Arm 1 is 300 mg of AG -348 administered orally q12h (BID). The dose of Arm 2 is 50 mg o f 
AG-348 administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587423] . The PKR  mutation stratification factor will consist of 
4 levels ( R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is 
defined by [CONTACT_587424]; patients with more than one 
stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion. 
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been selected from the AG348 -C-001 SAD 
study and AG348-C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of 
doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP.  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogeneous due to the wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is deemed important to focus 
closely on dose findings in this first- in-patien t study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this 
study with 2 different doses of AG-348 administered q12h, a DRT  will be established to review 
study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG- 348 as 
indicated .  
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals of approximately 
every 6 weeks, or ad hoc as necessary,  for as long as any patients are still in the Core Period  to 
review AEs, VS , clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, c oagulation, and 
urinalysis), and ECGs . The DR T will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical 
activity (e.g., changes from baseline in Hb).  These DRT meetings will also include data review 
40 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
for all patients that may be under treatment in the Extension Period. If there are no patients still 
being treated  in the Core Period, and the only patients on treatment are those in the Extension 
Period, then the frequency of the DRT meetings will reduce to approximately every 3 months in order to match  the frequency of patient visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period. 
The DRT  will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, 
Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical 
Officer.  
Beginning [ADDRESS_772828] patient is dose d in the Core Period or ad hoc  as necessary,  and 
proceeding according the schedule indicated above ( approximately every [ADDRESS_772829] 
completed the Core Period ), the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data, 
and clinical activity data . Based on the DRT ’s recurring , the DRT  may exercise one or more of 
the following options during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm 3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not 
exceed 360  mg q12h; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm 3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or 
suspended to allow further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, 
poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity. 
• Re-assign patient’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm 
will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. 
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to  ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT may exercise one or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatment without change; 
• Re-assign patients’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer , and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical 
activity;  
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinical data (eg,  for 
unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity ). 
The data that the DRT  will review to make these decisions is expected to include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs ; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs ;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP;  
41 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  ETCO (Core Period only), LDH, EPO , hepcidin, total and indirect bilirubin, 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772830] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential 
third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive 
or limited PK/PD sampling sche dules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the safety data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a 
decision to terminate enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no e ffect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as 
≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute (NCI)  CTCAEv4.03) that are assessed as at least 
possibly related to AG-348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is transient in duration (<  24 hours) or able to be medically 
managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if it observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficult to support long-term dosing. 
Patients in the Extension Period will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core 
Period, unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the 
Core Period (the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h) , or unless the treating 
Investigator exercises the option for intra- patient dose escalation (see Section  9.7.2).  
Due t o the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, DXA scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will 
be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day 1) to 
obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline meas ure of bone mineral 
density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for those who may enter the longer term Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatment (Core Period). Al l 
patients will have a second DXA scan in the i nterval between Weeks [ADDRESS_772831] additional DXA scans at Months 18 and 30. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the 
randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing 
arm. Randomization and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left 
enrolling. 
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_772832] arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 patients.

the Core  Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baselin e (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 
(Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and 
monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 1 6, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG 348 through 
Week 24  (Core Period) may be eligible to immediately enter the Extension Period for continued 
treatment. Study visits for safety and clinical activity assessments will occur approximately 
every [ADDRESS_772834] dose of the Extension Period . 
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including determination  of SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis ); physical examination findings; VS; 12 lead ECGs, and DXA 
scans . Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone 
[total and free], estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers ( osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX), 
25-hydroxy vitamin D 2 and D3 levels , total cholesterol, HDL -C, and triglycerides. Follow-up

assessments w ill be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28) for patients who do not enter the 
Extension Period and will include physical examination, weight, performance status, VS, 12-lead 
ECGs , laboratory evaluations (hematology, Hp, EPO levels, serum chemistry, coagulation 
studies, urinalysis; lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and transfusion record. These follow-up 
assessments will be performed approximately 4 weeks  after discontinuation of AG-348 for 
patients who discontinue prior to completion of the Core Period and for those who discontinue in 
the Extension Period. Menstruating f emale patients will also be required to keep a paper -based  
menstrual cycle diary throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702. Pharmacodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for 
determination of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling  will be conducted on 
the first approximately 1 0 patients total treated in Arms 1 and 2 of the Core Period (see 
Appendix 15.1, Table 7) while  limited PK/PD sampling will be conducted on the remainder of 
treated  patients (see Appendix 15.1, Table 8).  Limited trough sampling will be conducted every 
3 months during the Extension Period ( Appendix 15.1, Table 6). 
 
 
 
 
7.2. Justification of the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK 
and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_772835] 
safely tolerated dose ( Arm 1: 300 mg BID)  and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD 
activity (Arm 2 : 50 mg BID ) from the forerunner AG348-C-002 MAD study in healthy 
volunteers. Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms 
and/or implementation of an additional dose arm  will be based on DRT review of safety , PK and 
PD data, and indicators of clinical activity  collected from all patients treated in Arm [ADDRESS_772836] dose and schedule should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in patients 
with PK deficiency compared with healthy volunteers.  
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to patients include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587425] (potentially) large increases in Hb level (Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2). Measures intended 
to maximize the opportunity for p atients with demonstrated safety and tolerability  to continue to 
derive benefit from any observed clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_772837] two different doses of the study drug to 
assess its PK  and PD profile s.  
Consistent with the design of many Phase 2 studies, preliminary evaluation of the potential PD 
and clinical activity of AG -348 are secondary objectives of this study . The latter will include 
assessments of the PK/PD relationship between AG-348 and the biomarkers ATP and 2,3- DPG, 
 
7.3. Rationale for the Starting Dose , Dose Range , and Duration of Dosing  
Prior to  execution of this study, Agios conducted two clinical studies of AG-348 in healthy 
volunteers, including a SAD study ( AG348-C-001) and a MAD (14 day q12h) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these two studies, [ADDRESS_772838] been dosed with 
AG-348. In vitro  investigations, also reported in the IB, had previously demonstrated that 
AG-348 increased the activity of wild -type PKR approximately to the same extent as it did a 
series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasonable to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AG-348 in healthy subjects in a controlled P hase 1 setting as a more 
efficient means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of patients with PK deficiency.  
The MAD stu dy demonstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248]-348 doses from 60 mg q12h 
to 360 mg q12h (including 120 mg q24h) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposures resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_772839] dose ranging study in patients with PK deficiency were selected to be 300 mg q12h (Arm 1) and 50 mg q12h (Arm 2). These doses were 
demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy volunteer studies. The availability of ATP is proposed as being critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity (see Section  5.1). 
The dose ranges from 50 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h may result in clinically effective modulation 
of PKR in PK deficiency patients if the mu tated enzyme is responsive to AG- 348 in a similar 
manner to the wild -type enzyme in healthy subjects. However, there are many different 
mutations in PKR that result in PK deficiency, and these mutations produce variable effects on 
the enzyme in terms of catalytic activity and thermal stability. It is not known if different 
mutations will respond clinically in a similar manner to the same exposure to AG -348. 
Therefore, it is prudent to study the range of safe and pharmacodynamically relevant doses as 
specifi ed in this study, and to allow flexibility for the DRT  to analyze the evolving study data to 
adapt the dose and schedule of administration of AG-348 to produce the optimal combination of 
safety, tolerability, and PD,  and, potentially, clinical response. 
Justification for Duration of Dosing  
The initial treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 months) for the Core Period  was chosen for this 
proof-of-concept trial for 2 principal reasons: 1) to begin establishing a safety database 
addressing the chronic administration of AG- 348; and 2) to allow sufficient time for clinical 
response to treatment to appear.  
45 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
It is anticipated that this treatment, if successful, may be taken for life, as PK deficiency is a 
genetically determined inborn error of metabolism. Therefore, it is important to begin to 
investigate the long -term safety of the treatment. As will be discussed below, the safety package 
supports the treatment duration of 6 months.  
Red blood cell turnover is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 120 days (4 months), although it may be shorter in some 
populations of pyruvate kinase deficient RBCs ( Mentzer, et al. 1971) . Different PKR mutations 
produce a variety of physiologic consequences. In mutations where normal or nearly normal 
levels of PKR protein persist, but the protein’s catalytic function is impaired, an improvement in 
PKR functional activity might be seen relatively quickly upon exposure to AG-348. However, in 
cases where the PKR mutation results in an unstable mutant, PKR protein levels may be low and additional time may be required for stabilization of the newly synthesized mutant enzyme in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_587292].   
This study plans up to 24 weeks of dosing with AG-348 during the Core Period with the 
possibility of continued dosing beyond 24 weeks during the Extension Period in patients for 
whom AG- 348 is safely tolerated and demonstrates clinical activity. The International 
Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) Guideline M3(R2) on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the 
Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorisation for Pharmaceuticals, recommends that clinical trials of a duration between [ADDRESS_772840] equivalent duration, and clinical trials lasting beyond 
6 months should be supported by 6-month rodent and 9-month non-rodent studies. This guidance allows for clinical trials of longer duration to be initiated based on 3 months of nonclinical data, and for clinical dosing in serious or life- threatening indications to be extended based on complete 
chronic rodent data and in-life and necropsy data in the non-rodent (and complete histopathology in the non-rodent provided within an additional 3 months).  
For the current investigational product (AG-348), 13- week, repeat d ose toxicology studies in the 
rat and monkey have been completed and are summarized in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol and 
in the current Investigator Brochure prepared to support initiation of this clinical study. 
Considering that PK deficiency is a serious condition with an unmet medical need, it is 
appropriate to initiate this clinical study with the available nonclinical data. Six -month rodent 
and nine-month monkey toxicology studies were initiated in January 2015, and the Sponsor will 
report the results of these studies in each applicable regulatory region as required before any patients will be treated for greater than 6 months (i.e., enter the Extension Period).  
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. In the event of such action, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to each Investigator. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patient s; 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements;  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the study drug; 
46 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
• Other administrative reasons.  
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to the Sponsor or 
the Sponsor’s designee. Patients who have participated in the Extension Period may be able to screen for eligibility in a study for a second generation allosteric PKR activator, if such a 
compound is available at that time , and after a suitable washout period has been observed. 
[ADDRESS_772841] meet all of the following criteria during the 
Screening or other specified period: 
1. Signed written informed consent obtained prior to performing any study procedure, 
including screening procedures.  
2. Male or female, aged [ADDRESS_772842] documented clinical laboratory confirmation of PK deficiency  by 
[CONTACT_587426] e enzymatic assay performed at Screening  either  by a designated 
central laboratory  or by [CONTACT_587364]’s local hematology laboratory . 
Patients with prior documentation of PK deficiency by [CONTACT_587427] a 
reconfirmatio n of this result during Screening as a condition of enrollment. 
a. In the event that a patient’s screening pyruvate kinase enzymatic assay is negative 
(i.e., shows normal pyruvate kinase activity), the patient will be eligible for enrollment if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a mutant genotype that has been previously documented in the literature to be associated with PK deficiency. If the 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a previously undescribed mutation in the PKR gene, then the eligibility for enrollment will be determined on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_269722] [INVESTIGATOR_587263]. If no mutation is defined, then the patient will not be eligible. 
5. ALL patients must have  a blood sample for genotypic characterization of the mutant PKR 
gene performed by [CONTACT_587366].  The designated central 
laboratory-determined genotype will generally serve as the basis for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587293]. However, patients whose genotype has already been determined by [CONTACT_587428], with the approval of the Medical Monitor, in case of unexpected delay in return of the designated central laboratory result 
during the Screening Period. Enrollment on the basis of a result from a laboratory other 
than the designated central genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587294] a sample sent to the designated central 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_314336]. 
6. All patients  must have genotypic characterization of the UGT1A1 gene performed by a 
designated central laboratory to document whether they may have underlying Gilbert's Disease. Patients with Gilbert’s Disease are eligible to enroll. 
7. Males must have Hb ≤ 12.0 g/dL; females must have Hb ≤ 11.0 g/dL . 
[ADDRESS_772843] be considered transfusion independent as defined by: [CONTACT_375650]

17. The patient experienced AEs during the Core Period that are considered by [CONTACT_587413]’s designated Medical Monitor or Responsible Medical 
Officer to pose a significant safety risk to the patient if treatment were to be extended.  
8.4. Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_587432] (see Section  8.2 and Section  8.3, 
respectively) have been satisfied and that the patient is eligible  for participation in this clinical 
study. The site will submit to the Sponsor an Eligibility form for each eligible patient and the Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first dose of 
AG-348. 
8.5. Patient Randomization  
Patients who have been confirmed as eligible will be randomized in an equal ratio to a treatment 
arm (e.g., 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on which arms are open). The site will provide a request for 
52 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
randomization form (including the patient’s confirmed genotyp e) to the study Medical Monitor.  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587433]. The PKR  mutation 
stratification factor will consist of 4 levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations 
(“other”).  Since this is an open label study, randomization will not be blinded . 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure. 
8.6. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients have the r ight to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Patients will be 
withdrawn from study-related procedures and treatments under the following conditions: 
• Withdrawal of consent; 
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity ; 
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation 
in the trial; 
• Patient  requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication ( Section 9.11.2);  
• Investigator decision; 
• Protocol violation: non-adherence to protocol requirements; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Lost to follow-up. 
Should a patient  decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-
defined study observations up to the time of t he patient’s withdrawal as completely as possible 
and to determine the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be informed. If 
there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain und er the supervision of the 
Investigator until satisfactory health is returned.  
When a patient  withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all effo rts will 
be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_772852] 12 weeks of assigned 
dosing for reasons other than AEs  may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.

9. STUDY TREATMENT  
9.1. Description of Study Drug  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules will be provided as 5 mg, 25 mg , or 100 mg (free -base 
equivalent ) of AG-348 sulfate hydrate without excipi[INVESTIGATOR_587295] (5  mg), Swedish 
orange (25 mg), or white opaque (100 mg) gelatin capsules (size 2 capsules for all dose 
strengths).  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor reserves the right to 
discontinue the supply of any specific capsule strength should the evolving trial experience 
demonstrate that the specific capsule strength fills no additiona l need beyond the other capsule 
strengths available.  Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for further details regarding study 
drug. 
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in white, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements . 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
AG-[ADDRESS_772853] be stored at room temperature of 15 to 30°C (59 - 86°F).  
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25  patients will be randomized to any one of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomization will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are 
open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587375] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-348 each patient  receives will be dependent upon which dose arm  is open for enrollment 
when the patient  qualifies for and is randomized into the study. Patients in the Extension Period 
will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core Period, unless the DRT had 
reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the Core Period (the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h ).  
9.5. Blinding  
This is an open-label study; no blinding methods will be used. 
54 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial two treatment arms, (Arm 1 and Arm 2) in the Core Period, AG-348 will be 
administered orally BID (approximately q12h with a minimum of 10 hours between doses ) over 
a 24 week treatment period . Starting with Day 1, dosing will be  continuous; there will be no rest 
periods. Patients  who do not meet any of the treatme nt withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.5) may 
continue treatment for the entire 24 -week treatment period . 
Patients will be dispensed the appropriate number of Sponsor-packaged, labeled bottles to allow 
for 28 days of dosing until the next scheduled visit. The amount of study drug dispensed should 
be sufficient to provide an adequate reserve supply of AG-348 to ensure uninterrupted dosing in 
the event of an unexpected delay for the next scheduled study visit (7 extra days of dosing supply 
is recommended during the Core Period; 14 extra days is recommended during the Extension Period).  
Patients w ill be given a dosing diary to be used for each [ADDRESS_772854] relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). 
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing diar y (see 
Section  9.9).  
Patients should be instructed to take their daily dose at approximately the s ame time s each day  
except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Patients who undergo extensive PK/PD sampling during the Core Period (see Appendix 15.1, 
Table 7) should be instructed from Week [ADDRESS_772855] the dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
Patients receiving limited PK/PD sampling  during the Core Period (see Appendix 15.1, Table 8) 
should be instructed to bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits  and to take the AM 
dose following PK/PD blood draws.  Patients receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_772856] limited PK /PD on 
other visit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, patients will bring 
in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following PK/PD blood draws. Patients not 
continuing into the Extension Period are not required to take the Week 24/Day 169 morning dose 
of AG -348 after the required PK/PD blood samples are collected, as these pati ents will be 
discontinuing the study. 
A minimum of [ADDRESS_772857] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587376]. 
Patients will rec eive their first dose of AG-348 in the clinic on Day 1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis (except for in -clinic visit days, as described above). 
[ADDRESS_772858], the 
DRT  may decide to re-assign patients’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose 
and schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patient s in the terminated arm will 
remain in their originally assigned arm; i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of 
the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. Second, a treating Investigator, with Medical Monitor approval, may elect to i ncrease the dose for a patient in Arm  2 (50 mg BID) or a 
potential third arm of the study (if < 300 mg BID) to 300 mg BID if the patient is adequately tolerating his/her current dose and if their Hb has not reached at least the lower limit of the normal gender- adjusted reference range as specified by [CONTACT_119094] (male: 
13.0 g/dL; female: 11.6 g/dL) after at least [ADDRESS_772859] completed the 12-week visit during the Core Period and had a ll assigned 
tests/procedures for that visit before an intra- patient dose escalation will be allowed. An intra -
patient dose escalation may also be made later than the [ADDRESS_772860] speaking with the treating 
Investigator—abrupt discontinuation of AG-348 dosing in a patient who experience a substantial 
increase in Hb may result in withdrawal hemolysis.  
9.7.1. Dose Modification for Safety 
The Investigator wil l monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of the patient’s 
dose of AG-348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb levels (see Section  9.7.2).  
56 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
Table 1: Dose Modification for Adverse Events Deemed at Least Possibly Related to 
AG-348 
Adverse Events(s)  AG-348 Dose Adjustment

Grade 2  None required; Investigator and Medical Monitor judgment to manage as for 
Grade 3. 
Grade 3  Suspend dosing1;  
If event resolves to Grade [ADDRESS_772861] a 1 dose level reduction and discuss the 
advisability of additional dose modification with the Medical Monitor (see 
Table  2 below).  
If event does not resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_772862] to discuss with the Medical Monitor tapering the dose of AG -348 in order to 
mitigate potential withdrawal hemolysis (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section  9.7.2 ). 
Dose modifications for Grade [ADDRESS_772863] be immediately and permanently discontinued.  
It should be noted that if the initial dose of 300 mg BID selected for Arm 1 demonstrates an 
unacceptable safety profile resulting in multiple patients  undergoing dose modifications, the 
DRT  may exercise its option to re -assign these patients’ dose and schedule to match the dose and 
schedule of another study arm (for example, Arm 2 of the study, or to match the dose and 
schedule of a [potential]  Arm 3, if implemented ). 
9.7.2. Dose Modification for Increase in Hemoglobin Level  
It is presently unknown to what magnitude, how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or even whether, AG- [ADDRESS_772864] the dose of AG-348 as outlined in Tabl e 2 per the following guidelines  and with Medical 
Monitor approval. 
• Males: If Hb > 15.0 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test, reduce dose by [CONTACT_2669] 
1 dose level ( Table 2) and discuss the advisability of additional dose modification or 
suspension with the Medical Monitor. 
• Females: If Hb > 13.5 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test , reduce dose by [CONTACT_2669] 
1 dose level ( Table 2) and discuss the advisability of additional dose modification or 
suspension with the Medical Monitor. 
• The treating Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor questions relating to 
additional dose modifications and the need for additional unscheduled Hb monitoring 
on an as needed basis.

9.7.3. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587296] 3 AEs that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of suspension of d osing, and for 
Grade 4 AEs, unless the benefits outweigh the risks of resuming treatment and are approved by 
[CONTACT_1689] ( Section  9.7.1). Oth er reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.5. 
9.8. Duration of Patient  Participation  
The duration of treatment for all patients will be up to 24 weeks in the Core Period. Patients who 
safely tolerate AG -348 and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of AG-348 
treatment  may be eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued 
treatment (up to 2 years following completion of the Core Period). 
9.9. Treatment Compliance  
During in- clinic visits, d oses of AG-348 will be ingested by [CONTACT_587435]. For at -home dosing, patients will be given a dosing diary to be used 
58 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
for the duration of the 24- week Core T reatment Period ; the diary will also  be used  by [CONTACT_587436]. Patients should record relevant information regarding their 
study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed 
doses) and return the diary at each study visit. 
9.10. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. 
The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. 
Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], and return to Agios or its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_171032]) . These records will adequately 
document that the patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from Agios. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_587297] (if applicable), and patient numbers. An 
unblinded monitor will review drug accountability at the site on a schedule agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_587381]. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587298], if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Sta ndard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documented. All material containing AG-348 will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste in accordance with governing regulations. 
9.11. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Treatments  
9.11.1. Prior Medications and Procedures  
All medications administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to, or from Screening Visit #[ADDRESS_772866] day of study drug administration , whichever interval is longer , 
are to be recorded on the source documentation and included in the eCR F. 
9.11.2. Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications and procedures administered from 28 days prior to, or from 
Screening Visit #[ADDRESS_772867] be recorded in the appropriate section of the source documentation and eCRF  along with dosage information, dates of administration, and reason for 
use.  
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in  this study : 
• Investigational drugs must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_772868] dose 
of study drug; 
59 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
• Products known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 9) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly induce CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 10) must be discontinued within 28 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit P- gp transport er (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 11) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Digoxin must be discontinued w ithin 5  days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents ( EPOs , granulocyte colony stimulating factors, 
thrombopoietins, etc) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_772869] dose 
of study drug. [Folic acid [ADDRESS_772870] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume 
(MCV) prior to enrollment in the study]; 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must 
be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_772871] dose of study drug;  
• As the target population for this study consists of transfusion independent patients and transfusion of blood products could confound key endpoints of the study, blood 
transfusions of any type must be strictly avoided except in cases of compelling medical need. If medical circumstances permit, the Medical Monitor should be 
contact[CONTACT_587382]. 
Drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin (including some common sulfa 
antibiotics  [including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim] , cephalosporins, salicylates, and 
aminophylline) should be used with caution with the understanding that patients with elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin may potentially be at risk for kernicterus syndrome ( Strauss, et  
al. 2006). 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 15.4, Table 9) are not permitted for use with 
AG-348. Based on modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD 
study, moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not appear to pose a risk to patients dosed with 
AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and its own metabolism, 
presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG-348 is 
expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore, administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(listed in Appendix 15.4, Table 10) is not permitted with AG -348. Corticosteroids may induce 
CYP3A4. Although the use of corticosteroids is not prohibited, their use should be minimized as much as medically feasible.  
Strong inhibitors of drug transport (listed in Ap pendix 15.4, Table 11) are not permitted for use 
with AG-348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348. 
[ADDRESS_772872] utilize barrier methods as per the 
Inclusion Criteria  14 (Section  8.2) while taking AG -348. 
The expected patient co -medications deferoxamine, deferasirox, deferiprone, and oral penicillin 
are not expected to interact with AG -348. 
9.11.3. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All 
intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti -
infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as medically indicated and consistent with the 
guidance in the previous two sections. Patients may continue iron chelation therapy with 
deferoxamine, deferasirox , or deferiprone. Patients must continue taking at least  [ADDRESS_772873] sun exposure. When exposure to sunlight is anticipated for longer than 15 minutes, the 
patient should be instructed to apply factor 30 or higher sunscree n to exposed areas and wear 
protective clothing and sunglasses. 
9.11.5. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea 
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti- emeti c and antidiarrheal  or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, if patients experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea these 
may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follows: 
• Nausea/ vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron 
(Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Prom ethazine is a 
substrate for CYP 2B6, and it is presently unknown if the potential for 2B6 induction 
after AG -[ADDRESS_772874] of 
promethazine. Not recommended are aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP3A4 inhibitor), 
ondansetron (Zofran; CYP3A4 inducer), chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP3A4 
inducer), prochlorperazine (Compazine; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has

9.11.6. Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Patients should be advised to refrain from altering their normal exercise routine for the first [ADDRESS_772875] of this is to enhance 
oxygen delivery at the tissue level, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic 
consequences of the anemia. AG-348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 12 hours following a single dose) in 2,3- DPG in two prior clinical trials with healthy adult male 
and female volunteers. In patients with 
PK deficiency  who have elevated 2,3 -DPG levels , it is 
theoretically possible that decreases in 2,3- DPG that precede correction of the anemia could 
result in a temporary decrease of oxygen delivery at the tissue level resulting in clinical 
symptoms (e.g., increased fatigue).  
As discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol and in the Investigator Brochure, AG-[ADDRESS_772876]/inverse agonist. No effects of histamine H3 
modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Nonetheless, patients should be monitored for potential AEs  related to wakefulness and insomnia ( Schwartz 
2011). 
Patients should be advised not to discontinue dosing without first speaking with the treating 
Investigator—abrupt discontinuation of AG-[ADDRESS_772877] dose of study 
treatment.   
During the Core Treatment Period, patients will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through 
Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 
12) and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG-348 
through Week 24 (Core Period) and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of 
AG-[ADDRESS_772878] dose of the Extension Period. 
Although not encouraged,  as a convenience for patients who travel long distances to the study 
site, in-clinic visits on Day 8 and Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care 
physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]. For details, 
please refer to Table 5 in Appendix 15.1 : Schedule of Assessments.  For patients having their

Whenever more than one assessment is scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments 
should be performed in the order of least invasive to most invasive assessment (e.g., VS  first, 
ECG, blood draw). The timing of these assessments should allow the PK blood draw to occur at 
the exact nominal time. The order of procedures may be revised with prior discussion between 
Sponsor and Site. 
Minor adjustments to the timing , number of planned safety monitoring procedures (e.g., VS , 
ECG, blood draw), and PK/PD assessments may be made during the course of the study based on 
collected data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring and will not require a protocol 
amendment. These minor changes will require prior approval from the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or Responsible Medical Officer) as well as appropriate documentation in the study 
records. The addition of new safety monitoring procedures or other assessments will require a 
protocol amendment. 
10.2. Informed Cons ent and Confirmation of Eligibility  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential patient  and a signed and 
dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed. Separate informed consent forms will be used for the Core and Extension Periods. 
Patient ’s eligibility will be confirmed at Screening and within 24  hours prior to study treatment 
dose. If a patient  is determined to be ineligible, the patient  will be excluded from participation.  
10.3. Demogr aphic Data, Medical and Medication History  
Patient demographic data, including gender, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity, will be 
obtained at Screening. Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_171053], as appropriat e.  
Medication history, including all relevant prior medical history and current medical conditions, will be obtained at the Screening assessment and on Day -1; all concomitant medications 
administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to , or from Screening Visit #[ADDRESS_772882] day of study drug administration, which ever interval is longer,  should be reported in the 
source documentation and eCRF . Investigators will be asked to provide information on the 
patient’s history of any medical  diagnoses (e.g., iron overload) and surgical procedures (e.g., 
64 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
splenectomy, cholecystectomy) pertaining to their diagnosis of PK deficiency and prior available 
complete blood counts (CBCs) over the preceding 6 months and transfusion history over the 
preceding 12 months prior to the date of signing informed consent.  
10.4. PKR Enzymatic Assay and PKR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587299]. PKR enzymatic assays  will be conducted at  
 or any participating investigative site’s local hematology 
laboratory. PKR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_362339]  
10.5. Safety Assessments  
10.5.1. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination ( including neurological examination; genital and rectal 
examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be obtained at 
Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow up Visit (Week 28). The  neurological examination 
must include an assessment of general orientation and mental status including  level of alertness 
(assess as normal or abnormal and specify any abnormality).  Limited focused physical 
examinations will be performed at all other visits  during the Core Period. Focused physical 
examinations, including neurological examination, will continue every 3 months during the 
Extension Period; a complete physical examination will be performed at Month  30. Any findings 
will be recorded on the eCRF . Height will be collected at Screening only . 
10.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will be obtained according to the according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out of range BP or heart rate measurements will be repe ated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). 
The ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that reports  the heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, 
QTcB (Bazett correction formula; may also be calculated ), and QTcF intervals (may also be 
calculated) . Only QTcF (not QTcB) will be used for determination of eligibility. 
The 12-lead ECGs should be obtained following 5 minutes of recumbency. ECGs will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts ar e present, or if 
machine/equipment errors occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.4. DXA Scans  
DXA scans (hip a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening to obtain T and Z scores and bone 
mineral density that will serve as a baseline measure for all enrolling patients . An additional 
DXA scan for the Core Period will be conducted in the interval between Week 24 and Week 28, 
65 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
and scans will be conducted at Months 18 and 30 during the Extension Period as indicated in th e 
Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1).  All redacted DXA scan reports must be held at the 
study site and will be collected by [CONTACT_1034]. 
10.5.5. Safety  Laboratory Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Labor atory values obtained prior to S creening and RBC antibodies obtained at Screening will be 
performed at a local laboratory.  On-study c linical laboratory evaluation s are to be performed by 
a central laboratory. If Investigators believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain safety 
laboratory results from their own local laboratories on the day of the subject's visit, and before 
the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their 
discretion to do so. Investigators should be aware that since the Hb  level is a secondary endpoint 
of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab 
must still be collected , since it  will serve as the official lab result for this study . 
Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be collected according to the Schedules of Assessments (Appendix 15.1). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing 
will be followed by [CONTACT_587439] e judgment of the 
Investigator. Please note that serum estradiol , free and total testosterone, and CBC will be 
collected  in the AM at any [ADDRESS_772883] 2 days apart in addition to 
Baseline/Day  1 (total of 3 time points prior to Day 1 dosing).  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be determined:  
Hematology:  HCT , Hb, RBC count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent 
reticulocyte count, MCV , mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean 
corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC),  red cell distribution width 
(RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with automated  (or manual, 
as indicated) differential, ANC , and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC), and platelet count. In the event that the designated central 
laboratory for the study is unable to provide a valid result for any specific component of the defined CBC for a specific patient, the site 
may be asked to have the test performed at their local laboratory. 
The result of the local CBC will be entered into the study database along with the local normal reference range. G6PD (may be 
conducte d at Mayo Medical Laboratories [[COMPANY_002]ster, MN]  or any 
participating investigative site’s local hematology laboratory)  and 
RBC antibody screen will be performed at Screening only  
Other EPO, Hp, COHb , ETCO (at a subset of sites during the Core Period), 
hepcidin, 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3. 
Measurement of ETCO by [CONTACT_587440]® Monitor 
Assessment of ETCO as measured by [CONTACT_587441]® Monitor device 
will be performed at a limited number of participating study s ites on 
consenting patients during the Core Period. The patient will be fitted 
66 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
with small single -use, disposable nasal prongs attached to a cannula 
that is connected to the CoSense®  monitor. The patient breathes 
normally and the CoSense®  monitor collects a nd analyzes the 
patient’s exhaled air within approximately 5 minutes, generating a 
measurement of end tidal carbon monoxide in parts per million 
(ppm). This value is entered into the clinical database. The 
assessment will be performed according to the schedule detailed in Section  
15.1, Table 5. Carbon monoxide is produced in a 1:1 ratio 
from the breakdown of heme and ha s been correlated with the rate of 
hemolysis ( Christensen, et al. 2015; Christensen, et al. 2016). 
Serum Chemistry:  alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, carbon dioxide (CO 2) or bicarbonate, 
albumin, total protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, LDH , ALT, AST , total bilirubin , indirect 
bilirubin , (and estimated creatinine clearance or GFR for screening 
only, as appropriate).  
Sex Hormones : testosterone (total and free), estrone, and estradiol. FSH  will only be 
performed at Screening for female patient s only for confirmation of 
post-menopausal status. 
Bone Turnover serum osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX. 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_587300], HDL -C, triglycerides.  
Iron Panel  iron, total iron -binding capacity ( TIBC ), transferrin  saturation, 
ferritin.  
Coagulation Studies: fibrinogen, aPTT, INR . 
Urinalysis : color and appearance, pH, specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, pregnancy screen (dipstick), occult 
blood. Microscopic inspection of sediment will only be performed 
for cause or to investigate an abnormal dipstick finding per the Investigator’s discretion . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Serology  
A blood sample for serology, including HBsAg, HCV Ab screen, and HIV1 and HIV2 Ab, is to 
be collected from all patients at Screening.  
10.5.6. Menstrual Cycle Diary  
Menstruating f emale patients will be required to fill out a  paper -based  menstrual cycle diary each 
month in order to monitor any changes. Diaries will be dispensed and collected as indicated in 
67 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Patients will record the start date, stop date, and 
any notable ch aracteristics  of each menstrual cycle.  
10.5.7. Adverse Events  
Each patient  will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study 
from signing o f the informed consent through all scheduled study follow-up visits,  or withdrawal 
of consent, whichever occurs first. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably 
related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_772884]- treatment also are to be reported.  
Adverse events  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587389]. On dosing visits , all AEs (elicited and spontaneously reported) will be 
continuously evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. At any non- dosing day visit, AEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. An y AEs already documented at a previous 
assessment and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits or assessment time points as necessary. If these AEs have resolved, this will be documented. 
All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE grading system ( Appendix 15.3 ).  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  11. 
10.6. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The first approximately 10 patients treated  in the Core Period, contingent on clinical site 
feasibility,  will undergo e xtensive PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 7. The 
remainder of treated patients will undergo limited PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, 
Table 8. The i n-clinic visit on Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician 
if necessary  and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413] . In this  instance, PK 
sampling  will not be required on Day 22. (Additional details regarding Day 8 and Day  22 visits 
performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician can be found in Table 5 in  Appendix 15.1: 
Schedule of Assessments: Core Period .) During the Extension Period, predose PK samples will 
be drawn for the measurement of trough levels of AG-348 and AGI-8702 at each study visit 
(every 3  months ; see Appendix 15.1, Table 6).  
The collection times for post- dose PK samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PK draw at [ADDRESS_772885] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Samples for PK and PD assessments may be retained for up to [ADDRESS_772886] approximately 10 patients treated  in the Core Period, contingent on clinical site 
feasibility, will undergo extensive PD sampling for 2,3- DPG and ATP as detailed in 
Appendix 15.1, Table 7. The remainder of treated patients will undergo limited PD for 2,3- DPG 
and ATP sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 8. During the Extension Period, predose 
PD samples will be drawn for the measurement of  trough levels of 2,3- DPG, ATP ,  
 at each study visit (every 3  months ; see Appendix 15.1, Table 6).  
[ADDRESS_772887]-dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PD draw at [ADDRESS_772888] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments during the Core Period will include 2,3- DPG, ATP,  
 
 The i n-clinic visit on Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary 
care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]. In this  
instance, PD sampling will not be required on Day 22. (Additional details regarding Day 8 and Day 22 visits performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician are stated i n Table 5 in 
Appendix 15.1: Schedule of Assessments. )

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF  from time of the signing informed consent 
through the Follow- up Visits  for randomized patients. All AEs should be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
All SAEs will be followed through [ADDRESS_772892] dose of study treatment or until the SAE has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that 
occur > [ADDRESS_772893] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can 
arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
11.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that the re is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure. 
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form; 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned); 
71 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defec t; 
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The document entitled FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premarketin g 
Clinical Evaluation (FDA 2009) provides guidance on how the measurement of various 
laboratory parameters may be used to assess a given drug’s potential to cause severe liver injury (i.e., irreversible liver failure that is fatal or requires liver transpla ntation). Such cases are 
suggested by [CONTACT_587442]: 
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3-fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic) control 
drug or placebo; 
2. Among trial patient s showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum 
total bilirubin to >  2×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP ); 
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferases 
and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre- existing acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
Clinical safety laboratory results compatible with the definition of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) stated above must be repeated for confirmation as soon as possible, and if confirmed, will 
be scored as an unacceptable AE  and reported to FDA as a serious unexpected AE. 
11.2. Procedures for Reporting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Each patient  must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patient s. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_17491]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE 
and must be recorded in the appropriate source documentation and eCRF . Treatment -emergent 
72 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 30 March 2016 
 
abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if there are 
accompanying symptoms; if additional diag nostic evaluations or medical (including drug 
therapy) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_148606]. Although it is an objective of this study to determine if treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_772894] be promptly reported by [CONTACT_587443] (see below ). Deaths and AEs assessed 
as life -threatening are to be reported immediately and SAEs that meet other criteria are to be

If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local IRB/IEC will be promptly notified based on local regulations where required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk 
to human subjects. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents in the database. All 
new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after signing the informed consent through the final Follow- up Visit (Day  29 ± 3 days)  
must be recorded. Adverse events that are ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation 
[ADDRESS_772896] dose of study treatment, or until the SAE has resolved.  
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes: 
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded); 
• The date of onset of the event; 
• The date of resolution of the event; 
• Whether the event is serious or not; 
• Intensity of the event (see below for definitions); 
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions); 
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary interruption in dosing); drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823] (complete SAE pa ge); 
diagnostic procedure performed; patient  discontinued from the study (complete End 
of Study visit); 
• Outcome: patient  recovered without sequelae; patient  recovered with sequelae; event 
ongoing; patient  died (notify the Medical Monitor immediately, and complete the 
SAE form).  
Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix 15.3).  
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
• Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to 
the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587444].  An attribution of possibly related means that there are facts in 
evidence to suggest a possible relationship. 
• Probably Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_587445] t reatment than by 
[CONTACT_22714], or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  An 
attribution of probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a 
probable relationship. 
For the purpose of safety analyses related to final dat abase review, all AEs that are classified as 
possible or probable will be considered treatment- related AEs.

11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnancy in a 
participating female patient or a female partner of a participating male patient that occurs during 
this study or within [ADDRESS_772897] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s 
designee on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the delivery or elective abortion. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form ( e.g., maternal 
serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_772898]-
ovulation methods, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 
24 weeks of AG -348 in patients with  PK deficiency . Therefore, analyses will be primarily 
descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conduct ed separately within each dose arm, or pooled where appropriate. A nalyses of safety and 
of indicators of clinical activity  will be conducted for the Core Period, Extension Period, and  
overall , if applicable. For the Core Period, the data to be analyzed will include all collected data 
through 24 weeks of treatment for patients who directly enter the Extension period. F or pa tients 
who do not enter the Extension Period, the analyses will include all collected data through the 
duration of treatment (24 weeks or less) plus 4 week follow up data. For patients who move directly from the Core to the Extension Period, the 4 week fol low up data will be analyzed as 
part of the Extension Period. 
12.1. Sample Size Estimation  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size in each dose arm  may be  determined by 
[CONTACT_5870]. I n order to evaluate the primary objective of safety and tolerability of AG-348 in 
Arm 1 and Arm 2, up to a maximum of 25 patients may be randomized onto each a rm. The 
actual number of patients enrolled into Arms 1 and 2 will depend on the safety reviews and 
decisions made by [CONTACT_550627] . In addition, up to 25 additional patients may be enrolled to evaluate 
an additional dose arm (Arm 3; see Section  7.1). As for Arms [ADDRESS_772899] T. Therefore,  up 
to approximately  75 total patients may be enrolled in this study across 2 to 3 dose arms. 
Table 4 provides the probability within a dose arm of detecting 1 or more AEs with varying 
sample size and the true underlying AE rates.

25 98% 93% 72% 
 
12.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following patient  populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation 
of the data:  
• Safety Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of safety 
[ADDRESS_772900] treatment 
received if assigned treatment is never received . Unless otherwise stated, the Safety 
Analysis Set will be the default analysis set for all data analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: All patients in the Safety Analysis Set w ith sufficient 
plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD activity of 
AG-348 will also be based on the PK analysis set.  
• Efficacy  Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and achieve at least 50% 
compliance with their assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continuous 
dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be performed on subsets of patients with 
other degrees  of compliance with their assigned dose intensity and/or duration of 
dosing. The Efficacy  Analysis Set w ill be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to the actual 
treatment received an d whether they underwent an intra- patient dose escalation, 
where treatment received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least 
once, or as the first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . 
 
 
 If such analyses are performed, they will be 
described in a separate PK Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) and may be reported separately in a 
stand -alone report. 
12.3. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. When summarizing AE data, partial 
dates will be imputed as described in the SAP . Additional rules addressing the handling of 
missing data will be detailed in the SA P. 
12.4. Interim Analysis 
No formal statistical interim analysis will be conducted. Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627] , who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity data at regular intervals (approximately every [ADDRESS_772901] completed the 
Core Period ) throughout the duration of the Core Period . The DRT ’s decisions to suspend, 
terminate, or open a potential third dosing arm, or re- assign patients’ dosing in a terminated arm 
to match the dose and schedule of another arm of the study will be based on the totality of the data including, safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity (e.g., changes in Hb levels). 
Additional interim reviews of data may be conducted to support decision making concerning the 
current clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety 
concerns.

12.5. Statistical Methodology  
12.5.1. General Methods  
This study will be primarily descriptive in nature; therefore, there will be no formal hypothesis 
testing. Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and 
demographic data including genotype, safety measurements , PK, PD par ameters and indicators 
of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled 
across all dose groups where appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) 
and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  
The study database will be locked and statistical analysis will be performed after all patients have completed the Core Period. The results of this analysis will be presented in a clinical study report (CSR). Additional data collected during the Extension Period  after the CSR database lock  
will be analyzed for inclusion in a subsequent CSR addendum. 
12.5.2. Disposition  
A summary of the disposition of patient s will be presented, including the number enrolled, the 
number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations 
will be listed.  
12.5.3. Exposure and Safety Analyses 
Patients will receive multiple PO doses of AG-348 over a 24- week treatment period. The actual 
dose and duration in days of AG-348, as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual dose received and actual duration) and the rel ative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of 
dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_368801].  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of TEAEs  (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_230782] (SOC), preferred term, CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action taken 
with study drug, and relationship to the study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summaries will be 
produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_364557]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be p rovided for deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or 
reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment- emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at the day of first 
administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_772902] dose of 
study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subseque ntly considered drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS  data, presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for 
[ADDRESS_772903], a grading system based on the upper and/or lower 
limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
No formal hypothesis- testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
Electrocardiogram analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal 
and clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes  from baseline in PR, QRS, and 
heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals will be summarized by [CONTACT_587446].  Full 
details of the QTc analysis  including correction methods used will be described in the SAP. 
Data collected from the menstrual diaries such as the start and stop dates of the menses and the 
patient reported characteristics of the menses will be presented in a by -patient listing. Addi tional 
descriptions of the data may also be performed. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587447] e arm.  
12.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 
and the metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire 
population. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the following descriptive 
statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, minimum and maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. PK analyses will be described in a separate PK 
SAP. 
12.5.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each 
dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. P harmacodynamic parameters will 
be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean , SD, coefficient of variation %, 
median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %.  PD 
analyses will be described in a separate P D SAP . 
12.5.6. Aromatase Hormone Analysis  
The analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriat e graphic displays and statistical 
analyses to evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will 
include summaries of actual values and change from b aseline using appropriate descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, min and max) as described above.  
 
These analyses will present information by [CONTACT_587448], and analyses of a pooled

[ADDRESS_772909] Screening Visit.  
3 In-clinic visits on Day 8 and Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by 
[CONTACT_413]; in these instances PK/PD sampling would not be required and dispensing of study medicati on would not be performed. For the Day 8 visit 
performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician, the primary care medical office will collect a blood sample for hematology  using the blood sample 
collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_587301] e designated central laboratory. The kit will be sent to the primary care physician’s office. No 
other testing or procedures will be asked of the primary care physician on Day 8 [VS and serum chemistry will not be required ]. The 12 -lead ECG scheduled 
for D ay 8 will instead be performed at the main study center on Day 15. For the Day 22 visit performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician, the primary 
care medical office will collect a blood sample for hematology using the blood sample collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_587302]. The kit will be sent to the primary care physician’s office. No other testing or procedures will be asked of the primary care 
physician on Day 22. [VS, serum chemistry, coagulation, haptoglobin, EPO level, carboxyhemoglobin, and PK/PD samples will not be required.] The 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram scheduled for Day 22 will instead be performed at the main study center on Day 43 (Week 6). For patients ha ving their Day 8 and/or

the original Screening DXA scan.  
11 Laboratory evaluations (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis) are to be collected in the morning.  These should be collected 
following an overnight fast on Baseline Day 1 W eek 6 (Day 43), Week 12 (Day 85), Week 24 (Day 169), and Follow -up Week 28 (Day 197), when the lipid 
samples are also included.  
12 Three Screening/Baseline samples will be collected for complete blood count (CBC). Samples will be collected in the AM on 3 different days; the samples 
collected on Baseline/Day  1 may comprise one of these ; samples may be taken at the same time as Screening/Baseline hormone assessments  (any [ADDRESS_772913] 2 days apart ). CBC will include HCT, Hb, red blood cell (RBC) count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent reticulocyte count,

15.4. Potential Drug Interactions  
Stron g inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. Based on 
modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD study, it is thought 
that moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and induces its own 
metabolism, presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with 
AG-348 is expected to reduce AG- 348’s efficacy. Therefore , administration of strong CYP3A4 
inducers (listed in Table 10) with AG-348 is not permitted . Strong inhibitors of drug transport 
(listed in Table 11) are not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Digoxin is not permitte d for use with AG-348.

15.5. Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_772928], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added); 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subjects, including 
those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject 's best interest when providing 
medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that u ltimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the indi vidual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic int erventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most i nterventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
[ADDRESS_772929], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a 
consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe 
arrangements for post- study access by [CONTACT_364309].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee b efore the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the 
research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor 
ongoing studies. The researcher mus t provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any SAE s. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_163046]. Research on subjects or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician 
or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protec tion of research subjects 
[ADDRESS_772930]'s freely-given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations 
where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done 
only af ter consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
[ADDRESS_772931]'s dissent 
should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subject s, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them una ble to give 
informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the com pleteness and accuracy 
of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative 
and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affi liations and conflicts of interest 
should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MED ICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.  
[ADDRESS_772932] current proven intervention, except in the following 
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the 
subject s who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, subject s entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benef its that result from it, for example, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the subject  which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of  a subject  to participate in a study or the subject 's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a subject , where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject  or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, m ade publicly available.

Methodology: 
Study AG348-C-003 is a Phase 2, open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging study in  
adult patients with PK deficiency ; the study will be  divided in to a Core Period and an Extension Period. 
During the Core Period, patients will  receive multiple doses of AG -348 for up to 24 weeks; patients who 
are eligible can enter the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up to 2 years following the end of the 
Core Period. Patients with PK deficiency confirmed by [CONTACT_29617] (RBC) PK enzymatic assay 
performed at Screening will be eligible to participate in this study. At W eek 25, patients who safely 
tolerate AG-348 and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible to immediately roll over to 
the E xtension Period for continued treatment. Patients who complete treatment at the end of the Core 
Period  (24 weeks ) will undergo follow- up assessment [ADDRESS_772937] dose of study drug. If a 
patient discontinues at any other time (including early discontinuation or discontinuation during the Core 
or Extension Period), the follow -up assessment s will be conducted 4 weeks after discontinuation . 
Patients with toxicity suspected to be related to study drug will continue follow -up until the  adverse 
event (AE) resolves, is declared chronic by [CONTACT_737],  or the patient is lost to follow -up.  
For the Core Period, up to 25 patients will be initially randomized on an open- label  1:1 basis to each of 
two twice -daily (BID) doses of AG-348 ( up to 50 patients  total; see Figure  1, Study Schema). The dose 
of Arm  1 is 300 mg of A G-348 administered oral ly (PO)  every 12  hours (q12h, BID). The dose of Arm 2 
is 50 mg of A G-348 administered PO q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587404]. The PKR  mutation stratification factor will consist of 4  levels ( R510Q, 
R486W , and  R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_587405]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned 
based on Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been selected from the AG348 -C-001 single ascending 
dose (SAD) and AG348-C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult volunteers to 
represent the range of doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-
maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP .  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogeneous due to the wide 
variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is important to focus closely on dose findings in 
this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 
administered q12h, a Data Review Team (DRT) will be establi shed to review study data on a regular 
basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348. 
The DRT  will monitor safety  on an on -going basis and meet at regular intervals  of approximately every  
4

6 weeks, or ad hoc , as necessary,  for as long as any patients are still in the Core Period  to review AEs, 
vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis), and electrocardiograms ( ECG s). The DRT  will also review available PK/PD data and 
indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from baseline in Hb). These DRT meetings will also include 
data review for all patients that may be under treatment in the Extension Period. If there are no patients 
still being treated  in the Core Period, and the only patients being treated  are those in the Extension 
Period, then the frequency of the DRT meetings will reduce to approximately every 3 months in order to match the frequency of patient visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period. The DRT will be 
comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical 
Pharmacologist, Statis tician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer.   
Beginning [ADDRESS_772938] patient is dosed in the Core Period or ad hoc as necessary,  and 
proceeding according to  the schedule indicated above ( approximately every [ADDRESS_772939] completed 
the Core Period ), the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data , and clinical 
activity data . Based on the DR T’s recurring reviews, the DRT may exercise one or more of the 
following options during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; the dose for 
Arm 3 may  be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360 mg q12h; 
and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 
(and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to allow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity . 
• Re-assign patients ’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and sch edule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and 
schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT may exercise one or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatment without change; 
• Re-assign patients’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer, and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical activity; 
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinical data (eg, for unacceptable 
safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity ). 
The data that the DRT  will review to make these decision s is expected to  include, but are not necessarily 
limited to, the  following:  
• Safety O bservations:  all AEs; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry,

coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECG;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP; 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_772940] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in th e 14- day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule  in a potential third dosing arm will be  
determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling 
schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as ≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at least possibly related to AG -348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, and/o r diarrhea that is transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to 
≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it 
observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficul t to support long-term dosing. 
Patients in the Extension Period will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core Period, 
unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the Core Period 
(the DRT will not pr opose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h).  
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline 
measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for 
those who ente r the longer term Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatment  (Core Period ). 
All patients will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks [ADDRESS_772941] additional DXA scans a t Months 18 and 30. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing  arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in the e vent that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_772942] arm, 
the study could enroll up to a maximum of  75 patients .

Dose Modifications for Safety and/or Increase in Hb Level  
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an individual 
patient’s dose of AG -348 will be based on AEs and/or observed changes in Hb level as described in 
Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2. The same criteria for dose modifications will  apply in the Extension 
Period as in the Core Period.

be administered with water and may be administered with or without food. 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration :  
Not applicable.  
Duration of treatment:  
The duration of treatment for all patients in the Core Period will be up to 24 weeks. Patients who safely 
tolerate AG -348 and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of AG-348 treatment may be 
eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension P eriod  for continued treatment  (up to 2 years following 
completion of the Core Period). 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety:  
Monitoring of AEs in randomized patients , including determination of serious AEs (SAEs ) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, 
coagulation); physical examination findings  (including neurological examination) ; VS; 12-lead ECGs , 
and D XA scans. Adverse events will be graded using CTC AE, Version 4.03. Serum sex hormone levels 
(testosterone  [total and free] , estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (serum osteocalcin -N-mid 
and serum C- terminal telopeptide [CTX]),  25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3, total cholesterol, high -
density lipopr otein -cholesterol (HDL -C), and triglycerides will be monitored for evidence of potential 
inhibition of aromatase by [CONTACT_147248]-348. Menstruating f emale patients will also keep a paper- based  menstrual 
cycle diary throughout the study.

Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments during the Core Period will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary 
objectives),  
 
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_772959] dose and the morning 
Day 15 dose, and additional trough levels of ATP and 2,3-DPG will be obtained. During the Extension 
Period, predose PD samples will be drawn for the measurement of trough levels of 2,3 -DPG, ATP ,  
 at each study visit (every 3  months; see Appendix 15.1, Table  6). A denosine triphosphate  
and 2,3 DPG will be analyzed using qualified assays to determine concentrations in whole blood. 
Pharmacodynamic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 will be computed based on observed whole blood 
ATP and 2,3- DPG conc entrations.  
Statistical methods : 
The primary objective during the Core Period of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG -348 in patients with  PK deficiency . Therefore, analyses will be 
primarily descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conducted separately within each dose arm, or pooled when appropriate Analyses of safety and of 
indicators of clinical activity  will be conducted for the Core Period, Extension Period, and  overall , if 
applicable.  For the Core Period, the data to be analyzed will include all collected data through 24 weeks 
of treatment for patients who directly enter the Extension period. For patients who do not enter the 
Extension Period, the analyses will include all collected da ta through the duration of treatment 
(24 weeks or less) plus 4  week follow up data. For patients who move directly from the Core to the 
Extension Period, the 4 week follow up data will be analyzed as part of the Extension Period. 
Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demographic data 
including genotype, safety measurements, PK, PD parameters and indicators of clinical activity. Data

from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled across all dose groups where 
appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. Categorical variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_271296] (mean, standard deviation [SD ], median, minimum, and maximum). 
Populations for analysis will include a Safety Analysis Set , a PK Analysis Set, and an Efficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis set will include all patients who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment; this population will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data  and the default analysis 
set for all data analyses unless otherwise stated. Patients will be classified according to treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or as the first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . The PK Analysis Set will include 
all patients in the Safety Analysis Set with sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD activity of AG -[ADDRESS_772960] 50% compliance with their 
assigned dos e intensity for at least 4  weeks of continued dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be 
performed on subsets of patients with other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity 
and/or duration of dosing. The Efficacy Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned treatment.  
 
 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the 
incidence of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) (new  or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_92869] (SOC), preferred term, CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action taken 
with study drug, and relationship to study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summarie s will be produced for 
all TEAEs, treatment -related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_192158]), 
SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be 
provided for any deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment . Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are 
considered treatment -emergent, where treatment- emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at 
the day of first administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_772961] 
dose of study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was subsequently considered drug- related by [CONTACT_587415]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline 
relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for selected laboratory parameters 
based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  Where applicable CTCAE terms do 
not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower limits of no rmal will be used to classify the 
results.  
Electrocardiogram  analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal and 
clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes from baseline in  the portion of the ECG 
wave from the  beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex  (PR), QRS, heart rate -

Data collected from the menstrual diaries such as the start and stop dates of the menses and the pati ent 
reported characteristics of the menses will be presented in a by -patient listing. Additional descriptions of 
the data may also be performed.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications 
prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587417]. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 and the 
metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire population. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the followi ng descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, 
coefficient of variation %, median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient 
of variation.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each dose 
group, and where appropriate for the entire population. Pharmacodynamic parameters will be 
summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, 
minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %.  
Analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriate graphic displays and statistical analyses to 
evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will include summaries of 
actual values and change from baseline using appropriate descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, min 
and max) as described above.  
Analyses evaluating indicators of potential clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_772962] bilirubin, EPO, 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation (serum iron/iron binding capacity). Characterization of Hb  response 
(e.g., % of patients whose Hb increases by a certain amount), as well as time to Hb response, and duration of Hb response will be explored, among others. 
The study database will be locked and statistical analysis will be performed after all patients have 
completed the Core Period. The results of this analysis will be presented in a clinical study report (CSR). 
Additional data collected during the Extension Period after the CSR database lock will be analyzed for 
inclusion in a subsequent CSR addendum. 
Interim Review  
No formal statistical analysis will be conducted. Sa fety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_587335] , who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity data at regular intervals 
(approximately every [ADDRESS_772963] completed the Core Period ) throughout the duration of the study. 
The composition of the DRT , its meeting schedule, the data to be reviewed , and the decisions it is 
empowered to make have been described previously. 
Additional interim reviews of data may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current 
clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety concerns.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK deficiency ) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in non -
spherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from mild or fully 
compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and life- long chronic hemolytic anemia 
associated with severe, debilitating co -morbidities. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is caused by 
[CONTACT_587353], which results in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR) in the red blood cell (RBC). As shown in the diagram below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible 
step in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, and formation of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. PKR is 
thus a key enzyme for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed 
that ATP levels are critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity  (van Wijk and 
van Solinge 2005).

Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycerate; 
ADP = adenosine diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6 -bisphosphate; PEP = 
phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in PKR that have been described have a deleterious effect on PKR 
catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or protein expression. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is 
associated with reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell mat uration. Mature 
erythrocytes lack mitochondria relying predominantly on glycolysis to generate ATP. It is hypothesized that insufficient energy production promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired 
maintenance of cellular membrane homeostasis.  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and 
compound heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_772970] been identified in patients with PK deficiency  to date, and the majority of these 
mutations are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005) . The prevalence of PK 
deficiency , based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is 
estimated at 51 cases per million in the Caucasian population ( Beutler and Gelbart 2000). 
Some patients with PK deficiency  have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254] ( Christensen, et al. 2011 ; Ghidini, et al. 1991; Hennekam, et al. 1990). 
Infants with PK deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with h epatosplenomegaly, 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is associated  with a

high risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires 
supportive treatment with intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia 
caused by [CONTACT_587354] , as well as supportive transfusion to keep 
their hematocrit (HCT) levels  >60%. 
Adults with PK deficiency  are reported to have life-long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associated co -morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co- morbidities 
include f requent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute on 
chronic hemolytic anemia  (Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life-
threatening iron deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256]. 
The current therapeutic options for patients with PK deficiency  are supportive. Most require life-
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long-
term surveillance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion-independent patients, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587418] ( Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and 
decrease bilirubin levels in some patients. However, this intervention is associated with 
significant morbidity including infection risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis. 
5.2. AG-[ADDRESS_772971] activity and normalizes red cell 
metabolism in vivo . Biochemical experiments demonstrate that AG -348 is a potent, pan- activator 
of many PKR alleles associated with PK deficiency . Pyruvate kinsase d eficiency  red cells and 
their progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_587419], including a build-up of PEP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and lowered 
ATP levels. Treatment of PK deficiency  patient red cells ex vivo with AG-[ADDRESS_772972] wild type (WT) PKR enzymes and ex 
vivo studies in blood from mice, monkeys and humans indicate that AG- [ADDRESS_772973] the underlying pathology of PK deficiency  and, importantly, provid e 
clinical benefit to patients.  
5.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mutants (mPKR) in vitro , ex vivo , and 
in vivo . Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG-348 Investigator’s

markers was evaluated in human RBCs. AG-348 dose-response curves in human whole blood 
showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI-8702 is a weak activator of the PKR enzyme . In 
whole blood from mice treated with AG -348, 
13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating AG -348- mediated  activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG-[ADDRESS_772975] ATP consistent with activation of PKR.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from patients with PK deficiency . AG-348 activated PKR and induced metabolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK deficiency  patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzymatic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_772976]/inverse 
agonist and an aromatase inhibitor, no effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in toxicology studies ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that neither AG -348 nor AGI-8702 exhibited 
significant inhibition of the human ether-à- go-go related gene (hERG) current ( concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inhibition  [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular ( CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose 
level. No effects were seen in AG -348 G ood Labor atory Practice (GLP) -compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587289]- Dawley rats.  AG-348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose -dependent emetic activity in the ferret at ≥ 30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of AG-348 were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous 
(IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) was administered PO in the food-effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG-348 in animal 
species is characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma clearance 
(CLp), and high volume of distribution at steady- state (V
ss) in rats, dogs, and monkeys.

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
AG-348 has a medium to long a pparent terminal half -life (t1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability  was observed for AG-348 in animals. A high- fat diet led to 
lower oral absorption of AG-348 in monkeys. 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1%) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0 24hr) following 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively. M etabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_772977] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248]-348. There was evidence of metabolism -dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely irreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG-[ADDRESS_772978] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG-348 has the 
potential to cause an in duction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 substrates. 
The routes of metabolism for AG-348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributing > 70% 
of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute < 4% each.  
AG-348 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P- gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P-gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but does not inhibit BCRP. AGI-8702 is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP under the concentrations 
tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
In rats, the no-observed- effect-level/no -observed-adverse- effect -level (NOEL/NOAEL), 
determined as 2000 mg/kg, was associated with area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC
0-12hr) values 223- to 526-fold the projected human efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In dogs, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC
0-12hr value 5.7-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The NOEL/NOAEL in do gs 
was 10 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 0.8-fold the projected efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In monkeys, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, with only non- adverse emesis and 
body weight loss seen; this dose was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 70-fold the projected 
efficacious AUC [ADDRESS_772979] appropriate species for further evaluation in toxicology studies.  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) in cynomolgus monkeys was defined in non- GLP 5 -day and 
14-day repeat -dose studies as emesis , inappetence, and weight loss. These toxicities became dose 
limiting at AUC 0-12hr values 27- to 34-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and 
30 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
precluded meaningful evaluation of other toxicities at this exposure level. Potential other effec ts 
at this exposure level were observed in  a number hematology and serum chemistry parameters as 
well as in lymphoid organs. Additionally, minimal potential effects in kidneys (ren al 
tubulointerstitial nephritis) and heart (myocardial degeneration), which could not be 
differentiated from spontaneous background lesions, were seen when monkeys were exposed to 
AG-348 AUC 0-12hr values ≥ 27- to 34-fold the projected human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value.  
In GLP -compliant 28-day monkey study, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose twice daily 
[BID] ) was  the NOAEL. Effects were limited to increased liver weights without serum chemistry 
or microscopic correlate. At this dosage level, the Day 27 AUC 0-12hr values were 8.9 - and 
8.5-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females respectively. In the same 
study, the low dosage of 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose) resulted in AUC 0-12hr values that 
approximated the efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and there were no test article- related effects seen. 
The next highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day (25 mg/kg/dose) was the NOEL and was associated with 
AUC 0-12hr values 3.1- and 2.6- fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females 
respectively.   
In the GLP-compliant 28-day rat study, the NOAEL in males was the highest dose tested, 600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose), and the NOAEL  in females was the lowest dose tested, 
20 mg/kg/day (10  mg/kg/dose). At the 600 mg/kg/day dosage level in males, AG-348- related 
findings were limited to mild effects on hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, and microscopic findings in the adrenal gland (minimal to mild vacuolation of the adrenal zona 
glomerulosa and decreased thickness of the zona fasciculate), liver (minimal to mild 
hepatocellular hypertrophy), kidney (minimal tubular vacuolation), pancreas (minimal to moderate decreased zymogen granules), heart (minimal myocardial vacuolation), and prostate 
(minimal to mild decreased secretion). A ll findings were fully reversible over the 14- day 
recovery period with the exception of decreased serum glucose levels and decreased prostate 
secretion. In females, the highest dosage tested was 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) ; adverse 
effects observed were similar to those observed in the 600 mg/kg/day males, with the exception that in females, fewer effects in hematology and serum chemistry parameters were seen, and also in females, adverse effects in the reproductive organs consistent with aromatase inhib ition were 
observed.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermatid retention, and Leydig cell 
hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at dose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. These effects were either not present or present with incidence and severity 
similar to that of the vehicle group  in lower dose levels. Adve rse effects in females included 
uterine atrophy and increased folding of the luminal surface ; these effects were defined as 
adverse at the dose level at which they ar e expected to impair fertility   
In the 13- week repeat -dose study in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified, and no new 
effects were ident ified when compared to the 4- week repeat -dose study. Similar to what occurred 
on the 4-week study, inappetence and emesis during the initial 1-2 weeks of dosing occurred, precluding evaluation of higher doses.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with  an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). In the 
GLP -compliant 28- day rat study, histologic effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
[ADDRESS_772980] at the mid - and high-dosage levels (100 and 200 mg/kg/day)  
and included incomplete corpora lutea; ovarian follicular cysts; ovarian cystic, luteinized 
follicles; uterine atrophy; vaginal mucification; and altered cyclicity. A lthough these f indings 
were minimal to mild and were fully reversible  (over 14 days), they were considered adverse and 
the next lower dosage evaluated, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose BID) was the NOAEL in females. The Day 27 AUC
0-12hr value associated with this dosage level  was 6.9-fold the projected 
human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The potential for aromatase inhibition effects occurring in 
female rats at AUC 0-12hr values > 6.9-fold and < [ADDRESS_772981] been exposed to AG-348 in 2 clinical studies , a single  
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these 
subjects exposed to a single AG-348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under fasted and fed conditions; and [ADDRESS_772982] clinical trial in which patients with PK deficiency will be treated with 
AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic s 
The pharmacokinetics ( PK) of AG -348 showed low to moderate variab ility between subjects. 
After single doses of AG -348 from  30 to 2500 mg, AG-348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587258] (T max). There appeared to be some lengthening 
of the period of absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] T max and a less than 
proportional increase in maximum plasma  concentration (C max). Dose-normalized area under the 
curve ( AUC ) generally remained constant over the dose range studied, suggesting that AG-348 
total expo sure increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean t 1/2 ranged from 17.8 to 20.4 
hours when samples were collected through 72 hours and from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were 
collected through 120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contribute d little to 
overall exposure of AG- 348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587420] 0-12 and area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), suggesting a 
shorter effective half -life of approximately 3 to 6 hours. AG-348 was extensively distributed 
(mean apparent volume of distribution [V z/F] range of 271 to 1148 L) and had a moderate rate of 
clearance (geometric mean clearance [CL/F] range of 10.3 to 13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG-[ADDRESS_772983] only partially been analysed and the Clinical Study Report is in preparation but not yet completed.

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG-348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours (q12h) 
to [ADDRESS_772984] dose. AG -348 exposure observed after repeated dosing for 14 days at doses of 
120 mg every 24 hours (q24h) to [ADDRESS_772985] was greater at higher doses ; lower doses of [ADDRESS_772986] US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) high fat meal, showed that food likely has a minimal effect on the PK of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After  a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,3- DPG was observed at 
[ADDRESS_772987]-dose . The mean decrease 
at 24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_772988] 
dose; the concentration of ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_772989] dose on 
Day 14. The magnitude of the increase in ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg 
BID to 700 mg BID. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well- tolerated among healthy volunteers  at doses that produced stron g 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP . 
After a single AG -348 dose, treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by > [ADDRESS_772990] 
at any time on study (either under fasted or fed conditions) included headache (22%), nausea 
(14%), and contact [CONTACT_587421] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of AG-348 for 
14 days, TEAEs that occurred in > 5% of all AG -348- treated subjects across all  cohorts included 
headache ( 13.9%), nausea (13.9%), vomiting (8.3 %), decreased appetite (8.3%), feeling hot 
(8.3%), restlessness (8.3%), and dizziness, fatigue, vessel puncture site bruise,  hyperhidrosis, 
dermatitis allergic, and drug eruption (5.6% each). 
A dose-relationship was apparent with regard to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primaril y nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing 
dose. Nausea and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the single  dose study 
and only at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD  study. Nausea and vomiting were not obser ved at any 
dose ≤ 360 mg in either the single or multiple dose studies. 
33 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
All but 1 TEAE reported to date has been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The only 
Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ; aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with 700 mg  AG-348 BID. 
The event was considered to be possibly related to AG- 348, was declared  a DLT , and led to 
study drug discontinuation, following which the elevated liver transaminases resolved. 
Altogether, 3 of 6 subjects  treated with AG -348 at 700 mg BID  discontinued study drug in the 
MAD study: the subject described above with Grade [ADDRESS_772991] 
discontinued in the SAD study due to an adverse event (AE).  
No deaths or other serious AEs  (SAEs) have been reported in any clin ical study of AG -348. 
Furthermore, no DLTs  were observed  after a single administration of AG -348 at doses of 30 mg 
to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG-348 for 14 days at daily doses of 15 mg to 700 mg  BID except for the event of Grade 3 elevated liver function tests described above. 
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the AG348-C-[ADDRESS_772992] study that will be conducted in patients with PK deficiency . This 
study is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and potential indicators of 
clinical activity of AG -348 administered for up to 24 weeks . This study will also evaluate the PK  
profile of AG-348 and its metabolite AGI-8702, the P D responses in ATP and 2,3- DPG 
following administration of AG -348, and the clinical activity of AG-348 in PK deficiency 
patients . Two previous double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials of AG -348 conducted in 
healthy adult male and female volunteers (AG348-C-001, a SAD study ; and AG348-C-002, a 
MAD study ) have established an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for AG -348 for up to 
14 days of both once-daily (QD) and BID dosing at exposures that result in significant PD 
changes in whole blood levels of the glycolytic metabolites 2,3- DPG and ATP . Due to the 
potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (D XA) 
scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data will serve as baseline measures 
of bone mineral density for all enrolling pati ents (see Section  7.1 for more details).  
The target population of this study consists of adult males and females with a diagnosis of PK 
deficiency , who are anemic but non-transfusion dependent. Non-transfusion dependent patients 
are preferred for this study  in order to reduce any potential confounding effect of transfusion 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587313]. The safety,

tolerability, and PK/PD findings in this study will form the basis for subsequent clinical 
development of AG-348. 
The Extension Period is offered in order to allow for longer study of AG-[ADDRESS_772993] to the following study design elements: 
• The initial doses for Arms [ADDRESS_772994] been  selected on the basis of safety and 
tolerability observations already carefully made in two predecessor clinical trials in adult healthy male and female volunteers;  
• The specified inclusion/exclusion criteria have been carefully considered to avoid enrollment of subjects for whom exposure to the study drug might pose a hazard; 
• A designated Data Review  Team ( DRT) consisting of the overall study Coordinating 
Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer has been established to meet 
regularly a t approximately 6-week intervals throughout the duration of the Core 
Period, and approximately every [ADDRESS_772995] the dose of patients in one or both of the initial two study arms, and/or implement one new study dose arm. If one new dosing arm is implemented  in the 
Core Period , the dose selected will not exceed [ADDRESS_772996] dose that

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
Study AG348-C-003 is a Phase 2, open- label, two -arm, multicenter, randomized, dose- ranging 
study in adult patients with PK deficiency ; the study will be divided in to a Core Period and an 
Extension Period. During the Core Period, patients will receive multiple doses of AG -348 for up 
to 24 weeks ; patients who are eligible can enter  the Extension Period to receive AG -348 for up to 
2 years following the end of the Core Period. Patients with PK deficiency  confirmed by R BC PK 
enzymatic assay performed at Screening will be eligible to participate in this study. At W eek 25, 
patients who safely tolerate AG-348 and demonstrate clinical activity of AG -348 may be eligible 
to immediately roll over to the Extension Period  for continued treatment. Patient s who complete  
treatment at the end of  the Core Period  (24 weeks ) will undergo follow-up assessment [ADDRESS_773001] dose of study drug. If a patient  discontinues at any other time  (including early 
discontinuation or discontinuation during the Core or Extension Period), follow-up assessment s 
will be conducted [ADDRESS_773002] to follow -up. 
For the Core Period, up to 25 patients  will be  initially  randomized on an open- label,  1:1 basis to 
each of two BID doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients; see Figure  3, Study Schema). The dose of 
Arm 1 is 300 mg of AG -348 administered orally q12h (BID). The dose of Arm 2 is 50 mg o f 
AG-348 administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587423] . The PKR  mutation stratification factor will consist of 
4 levels ( R510Q, R486W, and R479H ) and all other  mutations (“other”). Mutation status is 
defined by [CONTACT_587424]; patients with more than one 
stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion. 
The doses for each arm of the Core Period have been  selected from the AG348 -C-001 SAD 
study and AG348-C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of 
doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects 
on 2,3- DPG and ATP.  
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogeneous due to the wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is deemed important to focus 
closely on dose findings in this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this 
study with 2 different doses of AG-348 administered q12h, a DRT  will be established to review 
study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG- 348 as 
indicated .  
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals of approximately 
every 6 weeks, or ad hoc as necessary,  for as long as any patients are still in the Core Period  to 
review AEs, VS , clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and 
urinalysis), and ECGs . The DR T will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical 
activity (e.g., changes from baseline in Hb).  These DRT meetings will also in clude data review 
40 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
for all patients that may be under treatment in the Extension Period . If there are no patients still 
being treated  in the Core Period, and the only patients on treatment are those in the Extension 
Period, then the frequency of the DRT mee tings will reduce to approximately every 3 months in 
order to match the frequency of patient visits (and new data collection) in the Extension Period. 
The DRT  will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating Investigators, 
Medical Monitor , Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical 
Officer.  
Beginning [ADDRESS_773003] patient is dose d in the Core Period or ad hoc  as necessary,  and 
proceeding according the schedule indicated above ( approximately every [ADDRESS_773004] 
completed the Core Period ), the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data, 
and clinical activity data . Based on the DRT ’s recurring , the DRT  may exercise one or more of 
the following options during the Core Period: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm  3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not 
exceed 360  mg q12h; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or 
suspended to allow further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, 
poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity. 
• Re-assign patient’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to  match the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm 
will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment 
quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. 
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT may exercise one or more of the following options during the Extension Period: 
• Continue treatme nt without change; 
• Re-assign patients’ doses and schedule to an existing dose and schedule that has been 
determined to be safer , and/or have a better PD response, or produce signs of clinical 
activity;  
• Terminate or suspend treatment to allow further review of clinical data (eg,  for 
unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical 
activity ). 
The data that the DRT  will review to make these decisions is expected to include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs ; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs ;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP;  
41 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773005] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling sche dules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the safety data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a 
decision to terminate enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no e ffect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as 
≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute (NCI)  CTCAEv4.03) that are assessed as at least 
possibly related to AG-348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is transient in duration (<  24 hours) or able to be medically 
managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if it observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficult to support long-term dosing. 
Patients in the Extension Period will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core 
Period, unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the 
Core Period (the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h).  
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, DXA scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day 1) to 
obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral 
density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for those who may 
enter the longer term Extension Period after completing 24 weeks of treatment (Core Period). Al l 
patients will have a second D XA scan in the interval between Weeks [ADDRESS_773006] additional DXA scans at Months 18 and 30.. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing 
arm. Randomization and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left 
enrolling. 
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_773007] arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 patients.

The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an 
individual patient’s dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773008] dose of study treatment. During the Core  Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baselin e (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 
(Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and 
monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 1 6, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG 348 through 
Week 24  (Core Period) may be eligible to immediately enter the Extension Period for continued 
treatment. Study visits for safety and clinical activity assessments will occur approximately 
every [ADDRESS_773009] dose of the Extension Period . 
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies, and urinalysis ); physical examination findings; VS; 12 lead ECGs, and DXA 
scans . Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone 
[total and free], estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers ( osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX), 
25-hydroxy vitamin D 2 and D3 levels , total cholesterol, HDL -C, and triglycerides. Follow-up 
43 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
assessments w ill be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28)  for patients who do not enter the 
Extension Period and will include physical examination, weight, performance status, VS, 12-lead 
ECGs , laboratory evaluations (hematology, Hp, EPO levels, serum chemistry, coagulation 
studies, urinalysis; lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and transfusion record. These follow-up 
assessments will be performed approximately 4 weeks  after discontinuation of AG-348 for 
patients who discontinue prior to completion of the Core Period and for those who discontinue in 
the Ex tension Period. Menstruating f emale patients will also be required to keep a paper -based  
menstrual cycle diary throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702. Phar macodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for 
determination of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling  will be conducted on 
the first approximately 1 0 patients total treated in Arms 1 and 2 of the Core Period (see 
Appendix 15.1, Table 7) while  limited PK/PD sampling will be conducted on the remainder of 
treated  patients (see Appendix 15.1, Table 8).  Limited trough sampling will be conducted every 
3 months during the Extension Period ( Appendix 15.1, Table 6). 
 
 
 
 
7.2. Justification of the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK 
and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773010] 
safely tolerated dose ( Arm 1: 300 mg BID)  and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD 
activity (Arm 2 : 50 mg BID ) from the forerunner AG348-C-002 MAD study in healthy 
volunteers. Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms 
and/or implementation of an additional dose arm  will be based on DRT review of safety , PK and 
PD data, and indicators of clinical activity  collected from all patients treated in Arm [ADDRESS_773011] dose and schedule should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in patients 
with PK deficiency compared with healthy volunteers.  
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to patients include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587452] (potentially) large increases in Hb level (Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2) . Measures intended 
to maximize the opportunity for p atients with demonstrated safety and tolerability  to continue to 
derive benefit from any observed clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773012] two different doses of the study drug to 
assess its PK  and PD profile s.  
Consistent with the design of many Phase 2 studies, preliminary evaluation of the potential PD 
and clinical acti vity of AG-348 are secondary objectives of this study . The latter will include 
assessments of the PK/PD relationship between AG-348 and the biomarkers ATP and 2,3- DPG, 
 
7.3. Rationale for the Starting Dose , Dose Range , and Duration of Dosing  
Prior to  execution of this study, Agios conducted two clinical studies of AG-348 in healthy 
volunteers, including a SAD study ( AG48-C-001) and a MAD (14 day q12h) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these two studies, [ADDRESS_773013] been dosed with AG-348. In vitro  investigations, also reported in the IB, had previously demonstrated that 
AG-348 increased the activity of wild -type PKR approximately to the same extent as it did a 
series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasonable to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AG-348 in healthy subjects in a controlled P hase 1 setting as a more 
effici ent means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of patients 
with PK deficiency.  
The MAD stu dy demonstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248]-348 doses from 60 mg q12h 
to 360 mg q12h (including 120 mg q24h) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposures resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_773014] dose ranging study in patients with PK deficiency were selected to be 300 mg q12h (Arm 1) and 50 mg q12h (Arm 2). These doses were 
demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy volunteer studies. The availability of ATP is 
proposed as being critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity (see Section  5.1). 
The dose ranges from 50 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h may result in clinically effective modulation 
of PKR in PK deficiency patients if the mutated enzyme is responsive to AG -348 in a similar 
manner to the wild -type enzyme in healthy subjects. However, there are many different 
mutations in PKR that result in PK deficiency, and these mutations produce variable effects on 
the enzyme in terms of catalytic activity and thermal stability. It is not known if different 
mutations will respond clinically in a similar manner to the same exposure to AG -348. 
Therefore, it is prudent to study the range of safe and pharmacodynamical ly relevant doses as 
specified in this study, and to allow flexibility for the DRT  to analyze the evolving study data to 
adapt the dose and schedule of administration of AG-348 to produce the optimal combination of safety, tolerability, and PD,  and, potent ially, clinical response . 
Justification for Duration of Dosing  
The initial treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 months) for the Core Period  was chosen for this 
proof-of-concept trial for 2 principal reasons: 1) to begin establishing a safety database 
address ing the chronic administration of AG -348; and 2) to allow sufficient time for clinical 
response to treatment to appear.  
45 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
It is anticipated that this treatment, if successful, may be taken for life, as PK deficiency is a 
genetically determined inborn error of metabolism. Therefore, it is important to begin to 
investigate the long -term safety of the treatment. As will be discussed below, the safety package 
supports the treatment duration of 6 months.  
Red blood cell turnover is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 120 days (4 months), although it may be shorter in some 
populations of pyruvate kinase deficient RBCs ( Mentzer, et al. 1971) . Different PKR mutations 
produce a variety of physiologic consequences. In mutations where normal or nearly normal 
levels of PKR protein persist, but the protein’s catalytic function is impaired, an improvement in 
PKR functional activity might be seen relatively quickly upon exposure to AG -348. However, in 
cases where the PKR mutation results in an unstable mutant, PKR protein levels may be low and 
additional time may be required for stabilization of the newly synthesized mutant enzyme in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_587292].   
This study plans up to 24 weeks of dosing with AG-348 during the Core Period with the 
possibility of continued dosing beyond 24 weeks during the Extension Period in patients for 
whom AG- 348 is safely tolerated and demonstrates clinical activity. The International 
Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) Guideline M3(R2) on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the 
Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authori sation for Pharmaceuticals, 
recommends that clinical trials of a duration between [ADDRESS_773015] equivalent duration, and clinical trials lasting beyond 
6 months should be supported by 6-month rodent and 9-month non-rodent studies. This guidance allows for clinical trials of longer duration to be initiated based on 3 months of nonclinical data, and for clinical dosing in serious or life-threatening indications to be extended based on complete 
chronic rodent data and in-life and necropsy data in the non-rodent (and complete histopathology 
in the non-rodent provided within an additional 3 months).  
For the current investigational product (AG-348), 13-week, repeat dose toxicology studies in t he 
rat and monkey have been completed and are summarized in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol and 
in the current Investigator Brochure prepared to support initiation of this clinical study. 
Considering that PK deficiency is a serious condition with an unmet medical ne ed, it is 
appropriate to initiate this clinical study with the available nonclinical data. Six -month rodent 
and nine-month monkey toxicology studies were initiated in January 2015, and the Sponsor will report the results of these studies in each applicable regulatory region as required before any 
patients will be treated for greater than 6 months (i.e., enter the Extension Period).  
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. In the event of such action, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to each Investigator. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patient s; 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements;  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the study drug; 
46 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
• Other administrative reasons.  
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to the Sponsor or 
the Sponsor’s designee. Patients who have participated in the Extension Period may be able to screen for eligibility in a study for a second generation allosteric PKR activator, if such a 
compound is available at that time , and after a suitable washout period has been observed. 
[ADDRESS_773016] meet all of the following criteria during the 
Screening or other specified period:

including screening procedures.  
2. Male or female, aged [ADDRESS_773017] a reconfirmation of this result during Screening as a condition of enrollment. 
a. In the event that a patient’s screening pyruvate kinase enzymatic assay is negative 
(i.e., shows normal pyruvate kinase activity), the patient will be eligible for enrollment if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a mutant genotype that has been previously documented in the literature to be associated with PK deficiency. If the 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a previously undescribed mutation in the PKR gene, then the eligibility for enrollment will be determined on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_269722] [INVESTIGATOR_587263]. If no mutation is defined, then the patient will not be eligible. 
5. All patients must have genotypic char acterization of the mutant PKR gene performed by 
[CONTACT_587366].  
6. All patients must have genotypic characterization of the UGT1A1 gene performed by a 
designated central laboratory to document whether they may have underlying Gilbert's 
Disease. Patients with Gilbert’s Disease are eligible to enroll. 
7. Males must have Hb ≤ 12.0 g/dL; females must have Hb ≤ 11.0 g/dL . 
8. All patients must be considered transfusion independent as defined by: [CONTACT_375650] [ADDRESS_773018] undergone prior 
splenectomy. For s plenectomized patient s: 
a. Must have undergone their procedure at least [ADDRESS_773019] be current in their vaccinations for Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV13), 
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PPSV23), Quadrivalent Meningococcal vaccine, 
and Haemophilus influenzae  type b  as recommended by [CONTACT_587429]'s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization P ractices 
(ACIP) or immunization advisory groups in Canada and the European Union (for 
patients enrolled in Canada and the EU). [http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-schedule.pdf] [Any missing vaccinations may be administered during the screening per iod. 
If the 
patient requires both PCV13 and PPSV23, PCV13 must be given  before PPSV23, if 
possible. Administration of PPSV23 should follow PCV13 by [CONTACT_2669] 8 weeks; it is 
permissible to give PCV13 during Screening followed by [CONTACT_93297]23 following the 
initiation of AG -348 treatment. ] 
10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2 ( Appendix 15.2).

17. The patient experienced AEs during the Core Period that are considered by [CONTACT_587413]’s designated Medical Monitor or Responsible Medical 
Officer to pose a significant safety risk to the patient if treatment were to be extended.  
8.4. Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_3433] e 
Investigator to ensure that the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section  8.2 and Section  8.3, 
respectively) have been satisfied and that the patient is eligible for participation in this clinical 
study. The site will submit to the Sponsor an Eligibility form for each eligible patient and the 
Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first dose of 
AG-348. 
8.5. Patient Randomization  
Patients who have been confirmed as eligible will be randomized in an equal ratio to a treatment 
arm (e.g., 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on which arms are open). The site will provide a request for 
randomization form (including the patient’s confirmed genotype) to the study Medical Monitor.  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587433]. The PKR  mutation 
stratification factor will consist of 4  levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations 
(“other”).  Since this is an open label st udy, randomization will not be blinded. 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure. 
[ADDRESS_773026] the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Patients will be 
withdrawn from study- related procedures and treatments under the following conditions: 
• Withdrawal of consent; 
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity ; 
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation 
in the trial; 
• Patient  requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication ( Section 9.11.2);  
• Investigator decision; 
• Protocol violation: non-adherence to protocol requirements; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Lost to follo w-up. 
Should a patient  decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-
defined study observations up to the time of the patient’s withdrawal as completely as possible 
and to determine the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be informed. If 
there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the 
Investigator until satisfactory health is returned.  
When a patient  withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_773027] 12 weeks of assigned 
dosing for reasons other than AEs  may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.

9. STUDY TREATMENT  
9.1. Description of Study Drug  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules will be provided as 5 mg, 25 mg , or 100 mg (free -base 
equivalent ) of AG-348 sulfate hydrate without excipi[INVESTIGATOR_587295] (5  mg), Swedish 
orange (25 mg), or white opaque (100 mg) gelatin capsules (size 2 capsules for all dose 
strengths).  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. Please see the Investigat or’s 
Brochure for further details regarding study drug.  
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in white, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and label ing will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements . 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
AG-[ADDRESS_773028] be stored at room temperature of 15 to 30°C (59 - 86°F).  
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25  patients will be randomized to any one of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomiz ation will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are 
open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587375] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-348 each patient  receives will be dependent upon which dose arm  is open for enrollment 
when the patient  qualifies for and is randomized into the study. Patients in the Extension Period 
will continue on the dose they were randomized to in the Core Period, unless the DRT had reason to establish a different dose/schedule during the course of the Core Period (the DRT will not propose a dose higher than 360 mg q12h ).  
9.5. Blinding  
This is an open-label study; no blinding methods will be used. 
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial two treatment arms, (Arm 1 and Arm 2) in the Core Period, AG-348 will be 
administered orally BID (approximately q12h with a minimum of 10 hours between doses ) over 
a 24 week treatment pe riod. Starting with Day 1, dosing will be  continuous; there will be no rest 
54 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
periods. Patients  who do not meet any of the treatment withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.5) may 
continue treatment for the entire [ADDRESS_773029] relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). 
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing diary (see 
Section  9.9).  
Patients should be instructed t o take their daily dose at approximately the s ame time s each day  
except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Patients who undergo extensive PK/PD sampling during the Core Period (see Appendix 15.1, 
Table 7) should be instructed from Week [ADDRESS_773030] the dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
Patients receiving limited PK/PD sampling  during the Core Period (see Appendix 15.1, Table 8) 
should be instructed to bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits  and to take the AM 
dose following PK/PD blood draws.  Patients receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_773031] limited PK /PD on 
other visit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, patients will bring 
in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_773032] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587376]. 
Patients will receive their first dose of AG -348 in the clinic on Day 1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis (except for in -clinic visit days, as described above). 
9.7. Criteria for Dose Escalation, Dose Modification, or Discontinuation 
of Study Drug  
No intra- patient dose escalations will be permitted in this study  unless the DRT  decides to re -
assign patients’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
originally assigned arm; i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose 
dose and schedule is being adopted. All dosing modifications , as outlined below, will be 
implemented following discussions with the  Medical Monitor. The same criteria for dose 
modifications  or discontinuation of study drug apply in the Extension Period as in the Core 
Period. 
55 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
9.7.1. Dose Modification for Safety 
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of the patient’s 
dose of AG-348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb levels (see Section  9.7.2).  
Table 1: Dose Modification for Adverse Event s Deemed at Least Possibly Related to 
AG-348 
Adverse Events(s)  AG-348 Dose Adjustment

Grade 2  None required; Investigator and Medical Monitor judgment to manage as for 
Grade 3. 
Grade 3  Suspend dosing;  
If event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of 
suspension, resume dosing with 1 dose level reduction (see Table  2 below ).  
If event does not resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_773033] be immediately and permanently discontinued.  
It should be noted that if the initial dose of 300 mg BID selected for Arm 1 demonstrates an 
unacceptable safety profile resulting in multiple patients  undergoing dose modifications, the 
DRT  may exercise its option to re -assign these patients’ dose and schedule t o match the dose and 
schedule of another study arm (for example, Arm 2 of the study, or to match the dose and schedule of a [potential]  Arm 3, if implemented ). 
9.7.2. Dose Modification for Increase in Hemoglobin Level  
It is presently unknown to what magnitude, how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or even whether, AG- [ADDRESS_773034] the dose of 
AG-348 as outlined in Table  2 per the following guidelines and with Medical Monitor approval.

[CONTACT_1689] ( Section  9.7.1). Oth er reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.5. 
9.8. Duration of Patient  Participation  
The duration of treatment for all patients will be up to 24 weeks in the Core Period. Patients who 
safely tolerate AG -348 and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of AG-348 
treatment  may be eligible to immediately roll over to the Extension Period for continued 
treatment (up to 2 years following completion of the Core Period). 
9.9. Treatment Compliance  
During in- clinic visits, d oses of AG-348 will be ingested by [CONTACT_587435]. For at -home dosing, patients will be given a dosing diary to be used 
for the duration of the 24- week Core T reatment Period ; the diary will also  be used  by [CONTACT_587436]. Patients should record relevant information regarding their 
study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed 
doses) and return the diary at each study visit. 
9.10. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. 
The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. 
[ADDRESS_773036] or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountabi lity records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], and return to Agios or 
its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_171032]). These records will adequately 
document that the patients were pro vided the doses as specified in the protocol and should 
reconcile all study drug received from Agios. Accountability records will include dates, 
quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient numbers. An 
unblinded monitor will review drug accountability at the site on a schedule agreed to by [CONTACT_429]. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_941] S tudy 
Monitor after database lock has occurred. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587298], if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documented. All material cont aining AG -[ADDRESS_773037] be recorded in the appropriate section of the 
source documentation and eCRF  along with dosage information, dates of administration, and 
reason for use.  
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in this study : 
• Investigational drugs must be discontinued [ADDRESS_773038] dose of study 
drug; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 9) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly induce CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 10) must be discontinued within 28 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit P- gp transport er (listed in Appendix 15.4, 
Table 11) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Digoxin must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents ( EPOs , granulocyte colony stimulating factors, 
thrombopoietins, etc) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773039] dose

of study drug. [Folic acid [ADDRESS_773040] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume 
(MCV) prior to enrollment in the study]; 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773041] dose of study drug;  
• As the target population for this study consists of transfusion independent patients and transfusion of blood products could confound key endpoints of the study, blood transfusions of any type must be strictly avoided except in cases of compelling 
medical need. If medical circumstances permit, the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587454] y transfusions are administered. 
Drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin (including some common sulfa antibiotics  [including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim] , cephalosporins, salicylates, and 
aminophylline) should be used with caution with the understanding that patients with elevated 
levels of unconjugated bilirubin may potentially be at risk for kernicterus syndrome ( Strauss, et  
al. 2006). 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 15.4, Table 9) are not permitted for use with 
AG-348. Based on modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD 
study, moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not appear to pose a risk to patients dosed with 
AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and its own metabolism, 
presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG-348 is 
expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore, administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(listed in Appendix 15.4, Table 10) is not permitted with AG -348.  
Strong inhibitors of drug transport (listed in Appendix 15.4, Table 11) are not permitted for use with AG-348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Induction of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_147248]- [ADDRESS_773042] utilize barrier methods as per the 
Inclusion Criteria  14 (Section  8.2) while taking AG -348. 
Short -term (≤ 14 days at a time, and ≤ 28 days total during the 24 week treatment period) use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, intra- nasal, and systemic glucocorticoids is permitted for acute medical 
indications. Every effort should be made to minimize total duration of glucocorticoid therapy and 
utilize alternative treatments. Patients must be off glucocorticoids for at least 28  days prior to 
Day 1 of AG-348 dosing as per Exclusion Criterion #11 ( Section  8.3). For patients who require 
chronic inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, Investigators should confer with the Medical Monitor for additional guidance. 
[ADDRESS_773043] with AG -348. 
9.11.3. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All 
intercurrent  medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti -
infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as medically indicate d and consistent with the 
guidance in the previous two sections. Patients may continue iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine, deferasirox , or deferiprone. Patients must continue taking at least  [ADDRESS_773044] sun exposure. When exposure to sunlight is anticipated for longer than 15 minutes, the patient should be instructed to apply factor 30 or higher sunscreen to exposed areas and wear 
protective clothing and sunglass es. 
9.11.5. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea 
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti- emetic and antidiarrheal  or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, if patients experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea these 
may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follows: 
• Nausea/vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron 
(Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Prom ethazine is a 
substrate for CYP 2B6, and it is presently unknown if the potential for 2B6 induction 
after AG -[ADDRESS_773045] of 
promethazine. Not recommended are aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP3A4 inhibitor), ondansetron (Zofran; CYP3A4 inducer), chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP3A4 
inducer), prochlorperazine (Compazine; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been reported ), and granisetron (Kyt ril; CYP 3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been 
reported);  
• Diarrhea: recommended management includes standard clinical dosing with 
Kaopectate or other non- absorbable anti -diarrheals, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Lomotil), 
or loperamide (Imodium). Loperamide is the least preferred choice because it is both 
a substrate and inhibitor for CYP3A4, a substrate for CYP2B6, and a substrate for 
P-gp. 
• For the use of any medications not specifically mentioned above the Investigator may confer with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
[ADDRESS_773046] of this is to enhance 
oxygen delivery  at the tissue level, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic 
consequences of the anemia. AG-348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 
12 hours following a single dose) in 2,3- DPG in two prior clinical trials with healthy adult male 
and female volunteers. In patients with PK deficiency  who have elevated 2,3 -DPG levels , it is 
theoretically possible that decreases in 2,3- DPG that precede correction of the anemia could 
result in a temporary decrease of oxygen delivery at the tissue l evel resulting in clinical 
symptoms (e.g., increased fatigue).  
As discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol and in the Investigator Brochure, AG-[ADDRESS_773047]/inverse agonist. No effects of histamine H3 
modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Nonetheless, patients should be monitored for potential AEs  related to wakefulness and insomnia ( Schwartz 
2011). 
[ADDRESS_773048] dose of study 
treatment.   
During the Core Treatment Period, patients will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through 
Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12) and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG-348 
through Week 24 (Core P eriod) and for whom the Investigator agrees with continuation of 
AG-[ADDRESS_773049] dose of the Extension Period. 
Although not encouraged,  as a convenience for patients who travel long distances to the study 
site, in-clinic visits on Day 8 and Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care 
physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]. For details,

Whenever more than one assessment is scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments 
should be performed in the order of least invasive to most invasive assessment (e.g., VS first, 
ECG, blood draw). The timing of these assessments should allow the PK blood draw to occur at 
the exact nominal time. The order of procedures may be revised with prior discussion between 
Sponsor and Site. 
Minor adjustments to the timing , number of planned safety monitoring procedures (e.g., VS , 
ECG, blood draw), and PK/PD assessments may be made during the course of the study based on 
collected data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring and will not require a protocol 
amendment. These minor changes will require prior approval from the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or Responsible Medical Officer) as well as appropriate documentation in the study 
records. The addition of new safety monitoring procedures or other assessments w ill require a 
protocol amendment. 
10.2. Informed Consent and Confirmation of Eligibility  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential patient  and a signed and 
dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study specific procedur es are performed. 
Separate informed consent forms will be used for the Core and Extension Periods. 
Patient ’s eligibility will be confirmed at Screening and within 24  hours prior to study treatment 
dose. If a patient  is determined to be ineligible, the patient  will be excluded from participation.  
10.3. Demographic Data, Medical and Medication History  
Patient demographic data, including gender, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity, will be 
obtained at Screening. Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_171053], as appropriate.  
Medication history, including all relevant prior medical history and current medical conditions, 
will be obtained at the Screening assessment and on Day -1; all concomitant medications 
administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to Day 1 should be reported in the 
source documentation and eCRF . Investigators will be asked to provide information on the 
patient’s history of any medical diagnoses (e.g., iron overload) and surgical procedures (e.g., 
splenectomy, cholecystectomy) pertaining to their diagnosis of PK deficiency and prior available 
63 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
complete blood counts (CBCs) over the preceding 6 months and transfusion history over the 
preceding 12  months prior to the date of signing informed consent.  
10.4. PKR Enzymatic Assay and PKR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587266]. PKR enzymatic assays will be conducted at  
 PKR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_362339]  
 
10.5. Safety Assessments  
10.5.1. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination ( including neurological examination; genital and rectal 
examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be  obtained at 
Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow up Visit (Week 28). The  neurological examination 
must include an assessment of general orientation and mental status including  level of alertness 
(assess as normal or abnormal and specify any abnorm ality).  Limited focused physical 
examinations will be performed at all other visits  during the Core Period. Focused physical 
examinations, including neurological examination, will continue every 3 months during the Extension Period; a complete physical examination will be performed at Month  30. Any findings 
will be recorded on the eCRF . Height will be collected at Screening only . 
10.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will be obtained according to the according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. 
Out of range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtaine d according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). 
The ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures the portion of the ECG wave from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS interval on an electrocardiogram (QRS) complex ( PR), QRS, QT, QTcB (Bazett correction 
formula), and QTcF. Only QTcF (not QTcB) will be used for determination of eligibility. 
The 12-lead ECGs should be obtained following [ADDRESS_773053] 7  days prior to Day 1 dosing. ECGs will be repeated if clinically 
significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts are present, or if machine/equipment errors 
occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings will be re corded as AEs.  
10.5.4. DXA Scans  
DXA scans (hip a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening to obtain T and Z scores and bone 
mineral density that will serve as a baseline measure for all enrolling patients . An additional 
DXA scan for the Core Period will be conduct ed in the interval between Week  24 and Week 28, 
64 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
and scans will be conducted at Months 18 and 30 during the Extension Period as indicated in the 
Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1).  All redacted DXA scan reports must be held at the 
study site and will be collected by [CONTACT_1034]. 
10.5.5. Safety Laboratory Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Labor atory values obtained prior to S creening and RBC antibodies obtained at Screening will be 
performed at a local laboratory.  On-study c linical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by 
a central laboratory. If Investigators believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain safety 
laboratory results from their own local laboratories on the day of the subject's visit, and before 
the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their 
discretion to do so. Investigators should be aware that since the Hb  level is a secondary endpoint 
of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab 
must still be collected , since it  will serve as the official lab result for this st udy. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be collected according to the Schedules of Assessments (Appendix 15.1). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing 
will be followed by [CONTACT_587388]. Please note that serum estradiol , free and total testosterone, and CBC will be 
collected  in the AM  at any [ADDRESS_773054] 2 days apart in addition to 
Baseline/Day  1 (total of 3 time points prior to Day 1 dosing).  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be determined:  
Hematology:  HCT , Hb, RBC count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent 
reticulocyte count, MCV , mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean 
corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC),  red cell distribution width 
(RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with automated  (or manual, 
as indicated) differential, ANC , and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC), and platelet count. In the event that the designated central 
laboratory for the study is unable to provide a valid result for any 
specific component of the defined CBC for a specific patient, the site 
may be asked to have the test perfo rmed at their local laboratory. 
The result of the local CBC will be entered into the study database 
along with the local normal reference range. G6PD and RBC 
antibody screen will be performed at Screening only  
Other EPO, Hp, COHb , 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3. 
Serum Chemistry:  alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, carbon dioxide (CO
2) or bicarbonate, 
albumin, total protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, LDH , ALT, AST , total bilirubin , indirect 
bilirubin , (and estimated creatinine clearance or GFR for screening 
only, as appropriate).  
65 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
Sex Hormones : testosterone (total and free), estrone, and estradiol. FSH  will only be 
performed at Screening for female patient s only for confirmation of 
post-menopausal status. 
Bone Turnover serum osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX. 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_587300], HDL -C, triglycerides.  
Iron Panel  iron, total iron -binding capacity ( TIBC ), transferrin  saturation, 
ferritin.  
Coagulation Studies: fibrinogen, aPTT, INR . 
Urinalysis : color and appearance, pH, specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, 
bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, pregnancy screen (dipstick), occult blood. Microscopic inspection of sediment will only be performed 
for cause or to investigate an abnormal dipstick finding per the 
Investigator’s discretion . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Serology  
A blood sample for serology, including HBsAg, HCV Ab screen, and HIV1 and HIV2 Ab, is to 
be collected from all patients at Screening.  
10.5.6. Menstrual Cycle Diary  
Menstruating f emale patients will be required to fill out a  paper -based  menstrual cycle diary each 
month in order to monitor any changes. Diaries will be dispensed and collected as indicated in 
the Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Patients will record the start date, stop date, and 
any notable ch aracteristics  of each menstrual cycle.  
10.5.7. Adverse Events  
Each patient  will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study 
from signing o f the informed consent through all scheduled study follow-up visits,  or withdraw al 
of consent, whichever occurs first. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably 
related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_773055]- treatment also are to be reported.  
Adverse events  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587389]. On dosing visits , all AEs (elicited and spontaneously reported) will be 
continuously evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. At any non- dosing day visit, AEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. An y AEs already documented at a previous 
assessment and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits or assessment time points as necessary. If these AEs have resolved, this will be documented. 
All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE grading system ( Appendix 15.3 ).  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  11. 
[ADDRESS_773056] approximately 10 patients treated  in the Core Period, contingent on clinical site 
feasibility,  will undergo e xtensive PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 7. The 
remainder of treated patients will undergo limited PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, 
Table 8. The i n-clinic visit on Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician 
if necessary  and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413] . In this  instance, PK 
sampling will not be required on Day 22. (Additional details regarding Day 8 and Day  22 visits 
performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician can be found in Table 5 in  Appendix 15.1: 
Schedule of Assessments: Core Period .) During the Extension Period, predose PK samples will 
be drawn for the measurement of trough levels of AG-348 and AGI-8702 at each study visit 
(every 3  months ; see Appendix 15.1, Table 6).  
The collection times for post- dose PK samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PK draw at [ADDRESS_773057] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collect ion will be recorded. 
Samples for PK and PD assessments may be retained for up to [ADDRESS_773058] approximately 10 patients treated  in the Core Period, contingent on clinical site 
feasibility, will undergo ex tensive PD sampling for 2,3- DPG and ATP as detailed in 
Appendix 15.1, Table 7. The remainder of treated patients will undergo limited PD for 2,3- DPG 
and ATP sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 8. During the Extension Period, predose 
PD samples will be drawn for the measurement of  trough levels of 2,3- DPG, ATP ,  
 at each study visit (every 3  months ; see Appendix 15.1, Table 6).  
The collection times for post-dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PD draw at [ADDRESS_773059] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments during the Core Period will include 2,3- DPG, ATP,  
 
 The i n-clinic visit on Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary 
care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]. In this  
instance, PD sampling will not be required on Day 22. (Additional details regarding Day 8 and Day 22 visits performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician are stated i n Table 5 in 
Appendix 15.1: Schedule of Assessments. )

Blood samples will be stored at the site and regularly transported at -80°C ±10 C to the 
bioanalytical laboratory for analysis. Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual.  
10.8. Ordering of Blood Sample Collection  
When more than 1 blood sample is collected at the same nominal time, the samples will be collected in the following order:  
1. Safety laboratory assessments  
2. PK  
3. PD (2,3 DPG, ATP)

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF  from time of the signing informed consent 
through the Follow- up Visits  for randomized patients. All AEs should be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
All SAEs will be followed through [ADDRESS_773063] dose of study treatment or until the SAE has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_773064] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can 
arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
11.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that the re is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure. 
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form; 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned); 
70 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The document entitled FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premar keting 
Clinical Evaluation (FDA 2009) provides guidance on how the measurement of various 
laboratory parameters may be used to assess a given drug’s potential to cause severe liver injury (i.e., irreversible liver failure that is fatal or requires liver tra nsplantation). Such cases are 
suggested by [CONTACT_587442]: 
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3-fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic) control 
drug or p lacebo;  
2. Among trial patient s showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum 
total bilirubin to >  2×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP ); 
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferases 
and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre- existing acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
Clinical safety labor atory results compatible with the definition of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) stated above must be repeated for confirmation as soon as possible, and if confirmed, will 
be scored as an unacceptable AE  and reported to FDA as a serious unexpected AE. 
11.2. Proc edures for Reporting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Each patient  must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patient s. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_17491]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE 
and must be recorded in the appropriate source documentation and eCRF . Treatment -emergent 
71 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if there are 
accompanying symptoms; if additional diagnostic evaluations or medical (including drug 
therapy) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug 
discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]. Although it is an objective of this study to determine if treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_773065] be promptly reported by [CONTACT_587443] (see below ). Deaths and AEs assessed 
as life -threatening are to be reported immediately and SAEs that meet other criteria are to be

If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local IRB/IEC will be promptly notified based on local regulations 
where required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk 
to human subjects. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents in the database. All 
new events , as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after signing the informed consent through the final Follow- up Visit (Day  29 ± 3 days)  
must be recorded. Adverse events that are ongoing at the time of treatment dis continuation 
[ADDRESS_773067] dose of study treatment, or until the SAE has resolved.  
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes: 
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded); 
• The date of onset of the event; 
• The date of resolution of the event; 
• Whether the event is serious or not; 
• Intensity of the event (see below for definitions); 
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions); 
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary interruption in dosing); drug t reatment required; non -drug treatment required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823] (complete SAE page); diagnostic procedure performed; patient  discontinued from the study (complete End 
of Study visit); 
• Outcome: patient  recovered w ithout sequelae; patient  recovered with sequelae; event 
ongoing; patient  died (notify the Medical Monitor immediately, and complete the 
SAE form).  
Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix 15.1).  
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
• Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to 
the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587444].  An attribution of possibly related means that there are facts in 
evidence to suggest a possible relationship. 
• Probably Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_587455], or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  An 
attribution of probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a probable relationship. 
For the purpose of safety analyses related to final database review, all AEs that are classified as 
possible or probable will be considered treatment- related AEs.

11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnancy in a 
participating female patient or a female partner of a participating male patient that occurs during 
this st udy or within [ADDRESS_773068] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s 
designee on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the delivery or e lective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_773069]-
ovulation methods, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 
24 weeks of AG -348 in patients with  PK deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primarily 
descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conduct ed separately within each dose arm, or pooled where appropriate. A nalyses of safety and 
of indicators of clinical activity  will be conducted for the Core Period, Extension Period, and  
overall , if applicable. For the Core Period, the data to be analyzed will include all collected data 
through 24 weeks of treatment for patients who directly enter the Extension period. F or patients 
who do not enter the Extension Period, the analyses will include all collected data through the 
duration of treatment (24 weeks or less) plus 4 week follow up data. For patients who move directly from the Core to the Extension Period, the 4 week follow up data will be analyzed as part of the Extension Period. 
12.1. Sample Size Estimation  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size in each dose arm  may be  determined by 
[CONTACT_5870]. I n order to evaluate the primary objective of safety and tolerability of AG -348 in 
Arm 1 and Arm 2, up to a maximum of 25 patients may be randomized onto each a rm. The 
actual number of patients enrolled into Arms 1 and 2 will depend on the safety reviews and 
decisions made by [CONTACT_550627] . In addition, up to 25 additional patients may be enrolled to evaluate 
an additional dose arm (Arm 3; see Section  7.1). As for Arms [ADDRESS_773070] T. Therefore,  up 
to approximately  75 total patients may be enrolled in this study across 2 to 3 dose arms. 
Table 4 provides the probability within a dose arm of detecting 1 or more AEs with varying sample size and the true underlying AE rates.  
Table 4: Sample Size Estimation  
Sample Size  True Underlying AE Rate  
15% 10% 5% 
5 56% 41% 23% 
10 80% 65% 40% 
15 91% 79% 54% 
25 98% 93% 72% 
 
12.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following patient  populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation 
of the data:  
• Safety Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of safety 
[ADDRESS_773071] treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . Unless o therwise 
stated, the Safety Analysis Set will be the default analysis set for all data analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: All patients in the Safety Analysis Set w ith sufficient 
plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD activity of 
AG-348 will also be based on the PK analysis set.  
• Efficacy  Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and achieve at least 50% 
compliance with their assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continuous 
dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be performed on subsets of patients with 
other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity and/or duration of 
dosing. The Efficacy  Analysis Set w ill be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned 
treatment.  
 
 
 If such analyses are performed, they will be 
described in a separate PK Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) and may be reported separately in a 
stand -alone report. 
12.3. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. When summarizing AE data, partial 
dates will be imputed as described in the SAP . Additional rules addressing the handling of 
missing data will be detailed in the SA P. 
12.4. Interim Analysis 
No formal statistical interim analysis will be conducted. Safety data will be reviewed on an 
ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627] , who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity data at regular intervals (approximately every [ADDRESS_773072] completed the 
Core Period ) throughout the duration of the Core Period . The DRT ’s decisions to suspend, 
terminate, or open a potential third dosing arm, or re- assign patients’ d osing in a terminated arm 
to match the dose and schedule of another arm of the study will be based on the totality of the data including, safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity (e.g., changes in Hb levels). 
Additional interim reviews of data may  be conducted to support decision making concerning the 
current clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety 
concerns.  
12.5. Statistical Methodology  
12.5.1. General Methods  
This study will be primarily descriptive in nature; therefore, there will be no formal hypothesis testing. Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and 
76 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
demographic data including genotype, safety measurements , PK, PD par ameters and indicators 
of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled 
across all dose groups where appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) 
and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  
The study database will be locked and statistical analysis will be performed after all patients 
have completed the Core Period. The results of this analysis will be presented in a clinical study 
report (CSR). Additional data collected during the Extension Period  after the CSR database lock  
will be analyzed for inclusion in a subsequent CSR addendum. 
12.5.2. Disposition  
A summary of the disposition of patient s will be presented, including the number enrolled, the 
number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations 
will be listed.  
12.5.3. Exposure and Safety Analyses 
Patients will receive multiple PO doses of AG-348 over a 24- week treatment period. The actual 
dose and duration in days of AG-348, as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual dose received and actual duration) and the rel ative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of 
dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_368801].  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and the incidence of TEAEs  (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_230782] (SOC), preferred term, CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action taken with study drug, and relationship to the study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summaries will be 
produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_364557]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be p rovided for deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or 
reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment- emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at the day of first 
administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_773073] dose of 
study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subseque ntly considered drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS  data, presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for 
selected laboratory parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  
Where applicable CTCAE terms do not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower 
limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
No formal hypothesis- testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
77 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 3, Version 4.0 10 November 2015 
 
Electrocardiogram analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abn ormal 
and clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes  from baseline in PR, QRS, and 
heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals will be summarized by [CONTACT_587446].  Full 
details of the QTc  analysis including correction methods used will be described in the SAP. 
Data collected from the menstrual diaries such as the start and stop dates of the menses and the 
patient reported characteristics of the menses will be presented in a by -patient listing. Additional 
descriptions of the data may also be performed. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and 
summarized by [CONTACT_587456] m and dose arm. 
12.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 
and the metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire 
population. Pharmacokinetic parame ters will be summarized using the following descriptive 
statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, minimum and maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. PK analyses will be described in a separate PK SAP. 
12.5.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each 
dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. P harmacodynamic parameters will 
be summarized using the following descriptive statistics : n, mean, SD , coefficient of variation %, 
median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %.  PD 
analyses will be described in a separate P D SAP . 
12.5.6. Aromatase Hormone Analysis  
The analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriate graphic displays and statistical analyses to evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will 
include summaries of actual values and change from b aseline using appropriate descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, min and max) as described above.  
 
These analyses will present information by [CONTACT_587448], and analyses of a pooled 
AG-[ADDRESS_773074] bilirubin, EPO, ferritin, and transferrin saturation 
(serum iron/iron binding capacity). Characterization of Hb response which will include, but is 
not limited to percent of patients w ith increase in Hb , time to Hb response, and duration of Hb 
response w ill be explored .

performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician, the primary care medical office will collect a blood sample for hematology  using the blood sample 
collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_587301] e designated central laboratory. The kit will be sent to the primary care physician’s office. No 
other testing or procedures will be asked of the primary care physician on Day 8 [VS and serum chemistry will not be required ]. The 12 -lead ECG scheduled 
for D ay 8 will instead be performed at the main study center on Day 15. For the Day 22 visit performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician, the primary 
care medical office will collect a blood sample for hematology using the blood sample collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_587302]. The kit will be sent to the primary care physician’s office. No other testing or procedures will be asked of the primary care 
physician on Day 22. [VS, serum chemistry, coagulation, haptoglobin, EPO level, carboxyhemoglobin, and PK/PD samples will not be required.] The 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram scheduled for Day 22 will instead be performed at the main study center on Day 43 (Week 6). For patients ha ving their Day 8 and/or 
Day [ADDRESS_773080].  
4 Medical history, including all relevant prior medical  history, current medical conditions, and hematology profile (CBCs) over prior 6 months, will be obtained 
at the Screening assessment.  
5 A complete physical examination (including neurological ex amination; genital and rectal examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) 
will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow up Visit (Week 28), or Week [ADDRESS_773081] include an assessment of general orientation and mental status including level of alertness (assess as normal or abnormal and 
specify any abnormality). Limited focused physical examinations will be performed at all other specified visits. Height to be collected at Screening only.  
[ADDRESS_773082] be performed at the same imaging center on the same DXA machine as 
the original Screening DXA scan.  
10 Laboratory evaluations (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation st udies, and urinalysis) are to be collected in the morning. These should be collected 
following an overnight fast on Baseline Day 1 Week 6 (Day 43), Week 12 (Day 85), Week 24 (Day 169), and Follow -up Week 28 (Day 197), when the lipid 
samples are also includ ed. 
11 Three Screening/Baseline samples will be collected for complete blood count (CBC). Samples will be collected in the AM on 3 d ifferent days; the samples 
collected on Baseline/Day  1 may comp rise one of these ; samples may be taken at the same time as Screening/Baseline hormone assessments  (any [ADDRESS_773083] 2 days apart ). CBC will include HCT, Hb, red blood cell (RBC) count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent reticu locyte count, 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution wid th (RDW), white 
blood cell (WBC) count with automated (or manual, as indicated) differential, absolute neutrophil cou nt (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and 
platelet count. In the event that the designated central laboratory for the study is unable to provide a valid result for any specific compon ent of the defined 
CBC for a specific patient, the site may be asked  to have the test performed at their local laboratory. The result of the local CBC will be entered into the study 
database along with the local normal reference range.  
12  The second Screening he matology (CBC) should be drawn in the morning (does not have to be fasting), and may be drawn at the same time the patient returns 
for the second estradiol and free and total testosterone sample. 
13 Haptoglobin will be performed prior to dosing on Day 1, at the end of Week 3, the end of Week 12, the end of Week 24, and the  end of Week 28.

15.4. Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. Based on 
modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD study, it is thought 
that moderat e inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and induces its own 
metabolism, presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG-348 is expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore , administration of strong CYP3A4 
inducers (listed in Table 10) with AG-348 is not permitted . Strong inhibitors of drug transport 
(listed in Table 11) are not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348.

15.5. Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_773096], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added); 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a wh ole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subjects, including 
those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject 's best interest whe n providing 
medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and ef fects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessi bility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
[ADDRESS_773097], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a 
consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe 
arrangements for post- study access by [CONTACT_364309].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee b efore the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the 
research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor 
ongoing studies. The researcher mus t provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any SAE s. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_163046]. Research on subjects or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician 
or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protec tion of research subjects 
[ADDRESS_773098]'s freely-given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations 
where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done 
only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
[ADDRESS_773099]'s dissent 
should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subject s, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative 
and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaratio n should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084],  diagnostic or therapeutic value and if 
the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.  
[ADDRESS_773100] current proven intervention, except in the following 
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the 
subject s who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, subject s entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benef its that result from it, for example, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the subject  which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of  a subject  to participate in a study or the subject 's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a subject , where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject  or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffe ring. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, m ade publicly available.

Title of Study:  
A Phase 2, Open Label, Randomized, Dose Ranging, Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic and 
Pharmacodynamic Study of AG-348 in Adult Patients with Pyruvate Kinase Deficienc y 
Study C enter(s):  
This study will be conducted at multiple  study centers. 
Phase of D evelopment: 2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG -348 administration in patients with 
pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency ). 
Secondary:  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG -348 and the metabolite AGI-8702. 
• Evaluate the pharmacodynamic ( PD) response of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 
2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3- DPG) after administration of AG-348. 
• Evaluate indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 in patients with PK deficiency , including changes 
in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), reticulocyte count, haptoglobin (Hp), carboxyhemoglobin 
(COHb ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total and indirect bilirubin, erythropoietin  (EPO) , ferritin, 
and transferrin saturation  (serum iron/iron binding capacity) . 
Methodology: 
Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_773105] dose of study drug. Patients with toxicity suspected 
to be related to study drug will continue follow- up until the  adverse event (AE) resolves, is declared 
chronic by [CONTACT_737], or the patient is lost to follow-up.

Initially, up to 2 5 patients will be randomized on a n open -label  1:1 basis to  each of two twice -daily 
(BID) doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients  total; see Figure  1, Study Schema). The dose of Arm 1 is 
300 mg of A G-348 administered orally every 12  hours (q12h, BID). The dose of Arm 2 is 50 mg of 
AG-348 administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587458]. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 4  levels ( R510Q, 
R486W , and  R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_587405]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned 
based on Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm have been selected from the forerunner AG348-C-001 single ascending dose 
(SAD) and AG348 -C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult volunteers to 
represent the range of doses/exposure s that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-
maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP . 
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogenous due to the wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is important to focus closely on dose findings in 
this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 
administered q12h, a Data Review Team (DRT) will be establi shed to review study data on a regular 
basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348. 
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately every  
6 weeks), or ad hoc , as necessary, to review AEs, vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms ( ECG s) on enrolled patients. 
The DRT  will also review available PK/PD da ta and indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from 
baseline in Hb). The DRT will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor,  Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.   
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773107] patient is dosed or ad hoc as necessary, 
the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data , and clinical activity data . Based on 
the DR T’s recurring 6  week reviews, the DRT may exercise one or more of the following options: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; the dose for 
Arm 3 may  be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360 mg q12h; 
and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 
(and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to allow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of 
signs of clinical activity . 
• Re-assign patients ’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and

schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT  will perform these evaluations on a recurring 6 -week basis. The data that the DRT  will review 
to ma ke these decision s is expected to  include, but are  not necessarily limited to, the  following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECG;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP; 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773109] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule  in a potential third dosing arm will be  
determined  by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling 
schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical 
activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as ≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at 
least possibly related to AG -348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to 
≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it 
observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficult to support long-term dosing. 
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline 
measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for 
those who may enter the longer term safety extension after completing the current study. All patients 
will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks 24 and 28. The safety extension will 
address additiona l follow -up DX A scanning.  
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing  arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in  the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.

cycle diary throughout the study. 
Indicators of Clinical Activity : 
Monitoring of potential indicators of clinical activity will include evaluating change s in Hb, HCT , 
reticulocyte count, COHb, LDH, total and indirect bilirubin, EPO , ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773128] non-
compartmental  methods based on observed plasma AG-348 and AGI-8702 concentrations. 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives), 
 
. Approximately 
the first [ADDRESS_773129] dose and the morning Day  15 dose, and additional trough levels of ATP and 2,3- DPG 
will be obtained. A denosine triphosphate and 2,3 DPG will be analyzed using qualified assays to 
determine concentrations in whole blood. P harmacodynamic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 will be 
computed based on observed whole blood ATP and 2,3-DPG concentrations.

AG-348 in patients  with PK deficiency . Therefore, analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature; no 
formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conducted separately within each dose 
arm, or pooled when appropriate. 
Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demographic data 
including genotype, safety measurements, PK, PD parameters and indicators of clinical activity. Data 
from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled across all dose groups where 
appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [SD ], median, minimum, and maximum). 
Populations for analysis will include a Safety Analysis Set , a PK Analysis Set , and an Ef ficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis set will include all patients who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment; this population will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data  and the default analysis

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK deficiency ) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in non -
spherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from mild or fully 
compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and life- long chronic hemolytic anemia 
associated with severe, debilitating co -morbidities. PK deficiency  is caused by [CONTACT_587464], which results in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR)  in the red blood cell 
(RBC) . As shown in the diagram below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible step in 
glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PE P) to pyruvate, and formation of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. PKR is thus a key enzyme 
for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed that ATP levels are 
critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity  (van Wijk and van Solinge 2005 ). 
Figure  2: Red Cell Glycolysis  
 
Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycerate; 
ADP = adenosine diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6 -bisphosphate; PEP = 
phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in PKR that have been described have a deleterious effect on PKR catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or  protein expression. PK deficiency  is associated with 
reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell maturation. Mature erythrocytes lack mitochondria relying predominantly on glycolysis to generate ATP. It is hypothesized that insufficient energy produ ction promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired maintenance of 
cellular membrane homeostasis.  
PK deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and compound 
heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_773145] been identified in patients with PK deficiency  to date, and the majority of these mutations 
are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005 ). The prevalence of PK deficiency , 
based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is estimated at 51 
cases per million in the Caucasian population  (Beutler and Gelbart 2000 ). 
Some patients with PK deficiency  have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254] ( Christensen, et al. 2011; Ghidini, et al. 1991 ; Hennekam, et al. 1990 ). 
Infants with PK deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with hepatosplenomegaly,  
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is associated  with a 
high risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires

supportive treatment with intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia 
caused by [CONTACT_587354] , as well as supportive transfusion to keep 
their hematocrit (HCT) levels  >60%.  
Adults with PK deficiency  are reported to have life -long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associat ed co -morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co- morbidities 
include frequent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute on 
chronic hemolytic anemia ( Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life -
threatening iron deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256].  
The current therapeutic options for patients with PK deficiency  are supportive. Most require life-
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long -
term surveillance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion -independent patients, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587418] (Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000 ) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and decrease bilirubin levels in some patients. However, this intervention is  associated with 
significant morbidity including infection risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis.

metabolism in vivo . Biochemical experiments demonstrate that AG -348 is a potent, pan- activator 
of many PKR alleles associated with PK deficiency . PK deficiency  red cells and their 
progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_178486] i n metabolism associated with defective glycolysis, 
including a build- up of PEP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3- DPG), and lowered ATP levels. 
Treatment of PK deficiency  patient red cells ex vivo with AG- [ADDRESS_773148] wild type (WT) PKR enzymes and ex vivo  studies in 
blood from mice, monkeys and human s indicate that AG -[ADDRESS_773149] the underlying pathology of PK deficiency  and, importantly, provide clinical 
benefit to patients.  
5.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies wer e conducted to characterize the ability of 
AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mutants (mPKR) in vitro , ex vivo , and 
in vivo . Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG -348 Investigator’s 
Brochure

AG-[ADDRESS_773150] 
markers was evaluated in human RBCs. AG -348 dose -response curves in human whole blood 
showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI -8702 is a weak activator of the PKR  enzyme . In 
whole blood  from mice treated with AG -348, 13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating  AG-348- mediated  activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG -[ADDRESS_773151] ATP consistent with activation of PKR.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from patients with PK deficiency . AG- 348 activated PKR and  induced metabolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK deficiency  patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzymatic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_773152]/inverse 
agonist and an aromatase inhibitor , no effects of histamine H3 mod ulation have  been observed  in 
safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were seen in toxicology studies ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that n either AG -348 nor AGI -8702 exhibited 
significant inhibition of the human ether -à-go-go related gene (hERG) current ( concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inh ibition  [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular ( CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose 
level. No effects were seen in AG -348 G ood Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587289] -Dawley rats.  AG-348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose- dependent emetic activity in the ferret at ≥  30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of AG- 348 were performed 
in Spr ague -Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous 
(IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) 
was administered PO in the food -effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG -348 in animal 
species is characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma clearance 
(CLp), and high volume of distribution at steady -state (V ss) in rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
AG-348 has a medium to long apparent terminal half -life (t1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability (F) was observed for AG -[ADDRESS_773153] 2015 
 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1% ) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0 24hr) following 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively . Metabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_773154] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 (testo sterone 6β -hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′ -hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. There was 
evidence of metabolism -dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely irreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG- [ADDRESS_773155] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG -348 has the 
potential to cause an induction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 substrates.  
The routes of metabolism for AG -348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributing >  70% 
of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the 
remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute <  4% each.  
AG-348 is a s ubstrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P -gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but 
does not inhibit BCRP. AGI -8702 is not an inhibitor of P -gp or BCRP under the c oncentrations 
tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
In rats, the no -observed -effect level/no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOEL/NOAEL), 
determined as 2000 mg/kg, was associated with area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-12hr) values 223 - to 526 -fold the projected human efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In dogs, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC
0-12hr value 5.7 -fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The NOEL/NOAEL in dogs 
was 10 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 0.8 -fold the projected efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In monkeys, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, with only non- adverse emesis and 
body weight loss seen; this dose was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value [ADDRESS_773156] appropriate species for further evaluation in toxicology studies.  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) in cynomolgus monkeys was defined in non- GLP 5 -day and 
14-day repeat -dose studies as emesis, inappetence, and weight loss. These toxicities became dose 
limiting at AUC 0-12hr values 27 - to 34 -fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and  
precluded meaningful evaluation of other toxicities at this exposure level. Potential other effects 
at this exposure level were observed in  a number hematology and serum chemistry parameters as 
well as in l ymphoid organs. Additionally, minimal potential effects in kidneys (renal 
[ADDRESS_773157] 2015 
 
tubulointerstitial nephritis) and heart (myocardial degeneration), which could not be 
differentiated from spontaneous background lesions, were seen when monkeys were exposed to 
AG-348 AUC 0-12hr values ≥  27- to 34 -fold the projected human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value.  
In GLP -compliant 28 -day monkey study , the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose twice daily 
[BID]) was  the NOAEL. Effects were limited to increased liver weights without s erum chemistry 
or microscopic correlate. At this dosage level, the Day 27 AUC 0-12hr values were 8.9 - and 
8.5-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females respectively. In the same 
study, the low dosage of 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose) resulted in AUC 0-12hr values that 
approximated the efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and there were no test article- related effects seen. 
The next highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day (25 mg/kg/dose) was the NOEL and was associated with 
AUC 0-12hr values 3.[ADDRESS_773158] dose tested, 
600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose) , and the NOAEL  in females was the lowest dose tested, 
20 mg/kg/day (10  mg/kg/dose). At the 600 mg/kg/day dosage level in males, AG -348- related 
findings were limited to mild effects on hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, and microscopic findings in the adrenal gland (minimal to mil d vacuolation of the adrenal zona 
glomerulosa and decreased thickness of the zona fasciculate), liver (minimal to mild hepatocellular hypertrophy), kidney (minimal tubular vacuolation), pancreas (minimal to moderate decreased zymogen granules), heart (minimal myocardial vacuolation), and prostate 
(minimal to mild decreased secretion). All findings were fully reversible over the [ADDRESS_773159] dosage tested was 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) ; adverse 
effects observed were similar to those observed  in the 600 mg/kg/day males, with the exception 
that in females, fewer effects in hematology and serum chemistry parameters were seen, and also in females, adverse effects in the reproductive organs consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
observed.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermat id retention, and Leydig cell 
hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at dose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. These effects were either not present or present with incidence and severity 
similar to that of the vehicle grou p in lower dose levels . Adve rse effects in females included 
uterine atrophy and increased folding of the luminal surface ; these effects were defined as 
adverse at the dose level at which they ar e expected to impair fertility   
In the 13- week repeat -dose stu dy in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified, and no new 
effects were identified when compared to the 4- week repeat -dose study. Similar to what occurred 
on the 4- week study, inappetence and emesis during the initial 1 -2 weeks of dosing occurred, 
precl uding evaluation of higher doses.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). In the 
GLP -compliant [ADDRESS_773160] at the mid - and high-dosage levels (100 and 200 mg/kg/day)  
and included  incomplete corpora lutea; ovarian follicular cysts; ovarian cystic, luteinized 
follicles; uterine atrophy; vaginal mucification; and altered cyclicity. A lthough these findings

were minimal to mild and were fully reversible  (over 14 days), they were considered adverse and 
the next lower dosage evaluated, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose BID) was th e NOAEL in 
females. The Day 27 AUC 0-12hr value associated with this dosage level was 6.9 -fold the projected 
human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The potential for aromatase inhibition effects occurring in 
female rats at AUC 0-12hr values >  6.9-fold and <  53-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value 
has been addressed in a 13- week rat study. In this study using doses between the NOAEL and 
LOAEL in the [ADDRESS_773162] been exposed to AG -348 in 2 clinical studies , a single  
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these 
subjects exposed to a single AG -348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under f asted and fed conditions; and [ADDRESS_773163] clinical trial in which patients with PK deficiency will be treated with 
AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic s 
The PK of AG -348 showed low to moderate variability between subjects. After single doses of 
AG-348 from  30 to 2500 mg, AG- 348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587318] (T max). There appeared to be some lengthening of the period of 
absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] T max and a less than proportional increase in 
maximum concentration (C max). Dose- normalized area under the curve ( AUC ) generally 
remained constant over the dose range studied, suggesting that AG -348 total exposure increased 
in a dose -proportional manner. The mean t 1/2 ranged from 17.8 to 20. 4 hours when samples were 
collected through 72 hours and from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were collected through 
120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contributed little to overall exposure of 
AG-348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587420] 0-12 and area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), suggesting a shorter effective half -
life of approximately 3 to 6 hours. AG -348 was extensively distributed (mean apparent volume 
of distribution [V z/F] range of 271 to 1148 L) and had a moderate rate of clearance (geometric 
mean clearance [CL/F] range of 10.3 to 13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG -348 excreted in urine 
ranged from 0.0145 to 0.0209 across the dose levels suggesting that renal excretion plays a minor r ole in the systemic elimination of AG -348. 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG -348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours ( q12h) 
to [ADDRESS_773164] 2015 
 
120 mg every 24 hours (q24h) to [ADDRESS_773165] was greater at higher doses ; lower doses of [ADDRESS_773166] US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) high fat meal, showed that food likely has a minimal effect on the PK of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,[ADDRESS_773167] -dose . The mean decrease 
at 24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_773168] 
dose; the concentration of ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_773169] dose on 
Day 14.  The magnitude of the increase in ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg 
BID to 700 mg BID.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well -tolerated among healthy volunteers  at doses that produced stron g 
pharmacodynamic effects on 2,3 -DPG and ATP . 
After a single AG -348 dose, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by >  [ADDRESS_773170] 
at any time on study (either under fasted or fed conditions) included headache (22%), nausea 
(14%), and contact [CONTACT_587421] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of AG -348 for 
14 days, TEAEs that occurred in >  5% of all AG -348- treated subjects across all  cohorts included 
headache ( 13.9%), nausea ( 13.9%), vomiting ( 8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), feeling hot 
(8.3%), restlessness (8.3%), and dizziness, fatigue, vessel puncture site bruise,  hyperhidrosis, 
dermatitis allergic , and drug eruption (5.6% each) . 
A dose- relationship was apparent with regard to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primarily nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing dose. Nausea and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the single  dose study 
and only at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD study. Nausea and vomiting were not observed at any 
dose ≤ 360 mg in either the single or multiple dose studies . 
All but 1 TEAE reported to date has been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The only 
Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ; aspartate 
[ADDRESS_773171] 2015 
 
aminotransferase [AST] ) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with 700  mg AG-348 BID. 
The event was considered  to be possibly related to AG -348, was declared  a DLT , and led to 
study drug discontinuation, following which the elevated liver transaminases resolved. 
Altogether, 3 of 6 subjects  treated with AG -348 at 700  mg BID  discontinued study drug in the 
MAD study : the subject described above with Grade  [ADDRESS_773172]  
discontinued in the SAD  study due to an adverse event (AE).  
No deaths or other serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported in any clinical study of AG-348. Furthermore, no DLTs  were observed  after a single administration of AG -348 at doses 
of 30 mg to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG -348 for 14 days at daily doses of 
15 mg to 700 mg BID except for the event of Grade 3 elevated liver function tests described 
above . 
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), the AG348 -C-[ADDRESS_773173] study that will be conducted in patients with PK deficiency . This 
study is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and potential indicators of 
clinical activity of AG -348 administered for up to 24 weeks . This study will also evaluate the PK  
profile of AG-348 and its metabolite AGI -8702, the P D responses in ATP and 2,3- DPG 
following administration of AG -348, and the clinical activity of AG -348 in PK deficiency 
patients . Two previous double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trials of AG -348 conducted in 
healthy adult male and female volunteers (AG 348-C-001, a SAD study ; and AG348-C-002, a 
MAD study ) have established an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for AG -348 for up to 
14 days of both once -daily (QD) and BID dosing at exposures that result in significant 
pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in  whole blood levels of the glycolytic metabolites 2,3 -DPG 
and ATP . Due to the potential for AG -348- mediated aromatase inhibition, dual -energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (D XA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not 
had prior DXA s can within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data will serve as 
baseline measures of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients (see Section  7.1 for more 
details).  
The target population of this study consists of adult males and females with a diagnosis of PK 
deficiency, who are anemic but non -transfusion dependent. Non -transfusion dependent patients 
are preferred for this study  in order to reduce any potential confounding effect of transfusion 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587290].  The safety, 
[ADDRESS_773174] 2015 
 
tolerability, and PK/PD findings in this stud y will form the basis for subsequent clinical 
development of AG -348. 
5.3.1. Summary of Overall Safety Management Plan 
Measures to  minimize the risks to patients enrolled in this study have been taken with respect to 
the following study design elements:  
• The initia l doses for Arms [ADDRESS_773175] been selected on the basis of safety and 
tolerability observations already carefully made in two predecessor clinical trials in 
adult healthy male and female volunteers;  
• The specified inclusion/exclusion criteria have been carefully considered to avoid enrollment of subjects for whom exposure to the study drug might pose a hazard;  
• A designated Data Review  Team ( DRT) consisting of the overall study Coordinating 
Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, 
Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer has been established to meet 
regularly a t approximately 6-week intervals throughout the duration of the study to 
review the accumulating study data and will exercise options to suspend en rollment to 
one or both of the initial two study dose arms, discontinue enrollment to one or both 
of the initial two study dose arms, adjust the dose of patients in one or both of the 
initial two study arms, and/or implement one new study dose arm . If one new dosing 
arm is implemented, the dose selected will not exceed [ADDRESS_773176] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID dosing 
study in healthy volunteers. Group cohort stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587319] (CTCAEv4.03 grade) and frequency of AEs are 
defined;  
• Dose modification and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587291];  
• Guidance for permitted, prohibited, and cautionary concomitant medications is specified based on the estimated potential for drug -drug interactions from hepatic 
cytochrome enzyme interactions with AG -348. 
• Due to the potential for AG -348- mediated aromatase inhibition, bone mineral density 
will be monitored using D XA scans (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) at Baseline (if patient has not had 
prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day  1) and between Week  24 and Week 28.  
In the event that any clear and unequivocal
, previously unidentified/unexpected  toxicitie s occur 
in pre-clinical toxicology studies, the Sponsor will notify the Investigators, IRB s/EC s, and 
regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will also report these  to the DRT for review and discussion 
of appropriate actions, which may include, but are not necessarily limited to:   
• Amending the protocol to adjust the inclu sion/exclusion criteria (e.g., to exclude 
patients with certain at -risk concurrent conditions); and/or  
• Amending the protocol to a djust safety monitoring procedures (e.g., to require 
additional monitoring of specified adverse events , physical examinations,  clinical 
laboratory testing, ECG monitoring, or other testing as appropriate ); and/or  
• Adjusting the dose of an arm of the study as appropriate; and/or  
[ADDRESS_773177] 2015 
 
• Adjusting the dose modification and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] ( Section  9.7); and/or  
• Adjusting the patient wi thdrawal criteria ( Section  8.6); or 
• Terminating the trial.

6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
6.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is  to: 
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG -348 administration in 
patient s with PK deficiency . 
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are to : 
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG -348 and the metabolite AGI -8702. 
• Evaluate the PD response of ATP  and 2 ,3-DPG after administration of AG -348. 
• Evaluate indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 in patient s with PK deficiency , 
including changes in hemoglobin (Hb), HCT , reticulocyte count, haptoglobin (Hp), 
carboxyhemoglobin ( COHb ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total and indirect 
bilirubin, erythropoietin (EPO) , ferritin, and transferrin saturation  (serum iron/iron 
binding capacity ). 
 
6.4. Study Measures and Endpoints  
6.4.1. Safety Measures and Endpoints  
Safety will be evaluated by:  
• Monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs  and AEs leading to 
discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, 
coagulation); physical examination findings; vital signs  (VS); 12 lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs); and D XA scans . Adverse events will be graded using 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , Version 4.03. Serum sex 
hormone levels (testosterone [total and free] , estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover 
markers (serum osteocalcin -N-mid and serum C -terminal telopeptide [CTX]), 25-
hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3, total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein -cholesterol  
(HDL -C), and triglycerides will be monitored for evidence of potential inhibition of 
[ADDRESS_773179] 2015 
 
aromatase by [CONTACT_147248] -348. Menstruating female patients will also keep a paper -based  
menstrual cycle diary throughout the study. 
6.4.2. Clinical Activity Measures and Endpoints  
• Monitoring of potential indicators of clinical activity will include evaluating change s 
in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp,  COHb,  LDH, total and indirect bilirubin, EPO , 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
6.4.3. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints  
The PK and PD profile of AG -348 will be evaluated by:  
• Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773180] non- compartmental methods based on 
observed plasma AG -348 and AGI-8702 concentrations. 
• Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives), 
 
 
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773181] to follow -up. 
Initially, up to 25 patie nts will be randomized on an open- label,  1:1 basis to each of two BID 
doses of AG -348 ( up to 50  patie nts; see Figure  3, Study Schema) . The dose of Arm 1 is 300 mg 
of AG -348 administered orally q12h (BI D). The dose of Arm  2 is 50  mg o f AG -348 
administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587465]. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 4  levels 
(R510Q, R486W, and R479H ) and all other mutations (“other”).  Mutation status is defined by 
[CONTACT_587424]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm have been selected from the fo rerunner AG348 -C-001 SAD study and 
AG348 -C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of doses/exposures 
that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects on 2,[ADDRESS_773182]- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this 
study with 2 different doses of AG -348 administered q12h, a DRT  will be established to review 
study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG -348 as 
indicated .  
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately 
every 6 weeks) , or ad hoc as necessary,  to review AEs, VS , clinical laboratory (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs  on enrolled patients. The DRT will 
also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from baseline 
in Hb). The DRT  will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.  
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773183] patient is doses or ad hoc as 
necessary, the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data, and clinical 
[ADDRESS_773184] 2015 
 
activity data . Based on the DRT ’s recurring 6 -week reviews , the DRT  may exercise one or more 
of the following options:  
• Continue tr eatment and enrollment in existing arms without change.  
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm  3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm  3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not 
exceed 360  mg q12h; and the dose r egimen may be less frequent than q12h.  
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or 
suspended to allow further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, 
poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinical activity.  
• Re-assign patient’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm 
will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure representation of patient s with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT  will perform these evaluations on a recurring 6 -week basis. The data that the DRT  will 
review to make these decisions is expected to include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs ; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs ;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP;  
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG -[ADDRESS_773185] dose that demonstrated acceptab le safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling sche dules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the safety data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a 
decision to terminate enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no e ffect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as 
≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at least possibly related to AG -348, with the 
exception of Grade 3 headache, hot fla sh/flushing, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is 
transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it observes a 
frequency of Gra de 2 AEs that would make it difficult to support long -term dosing. 
Due to the potential for AG -348- mediated aromatase inhibition, DXA scan (hip a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will 
be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day  1) to 
[ADDRESS_773186] a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks 24 and 28. The safety extension will 
address additional follow -up D XA scanning.  
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing arm. Randomization  and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left 
enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_773187] arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 patients.

The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an 
individual patient’s dose of AG -[ADDRESS_773188] dose of study treatment. During 
the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baselin e (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 
(Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 1 2 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and 
monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 1 6, 20, and 24 ). Patients who safely tolerate AG [ADDRESS_773189] not to enter the safety extension, study discharge 
will occur 4 weeks (Week 2 8 or earlier) followin g the last dose of study treatment at the final 
follow -up assessment.  
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies , and urinalysis ); physical examination findings; VS; 12 lead ECGs , and DXA 
scans . Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone 
[total and free], estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX ), 25-
hydroxy vitamin D 2 and D3 levels , total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein -cholesterol  (HDL -
C), and triglycerides . Follow -up assessments w ill be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28)  and will 
include physical examination, weight,  performance status, VS, 12-lead ECGs , laboratory 
evaluations  (hematology, Hp, EPO  levels, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis; 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and t ransfusion record.  Menstruating f emale patients will also be 
required to keep a paper -based  menstrual cycle diary throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702. Pharmacodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for 
determination  of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling  will be conducted on 
the first approximately 1 0 patients total treated in Arms 1 and 2 (see Appendix 15.1 , Table  6) 
while  more limited PK/PD sampling will be conducted on additional patients t reated if 
enrollment in Arm 1 or Arm  2 is expanded or if an alternate dosing arm is added (see 
Appendix 15.1 , Table  7).  
 
 
 
 
7.2. Justification of the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this  study are to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK 
and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773190] 
safely tolerated dose ( Arm 1: 300  mg BID)  and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD 
activity (Arm 2 : 50 mg BID ) from the forerunner AG348 -C-002 MA D study in healthy 
volunteers. Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms 
and/or implementation of an additional dose arm will be based on DR T review of  safety , PK and 
PD data, and indicators of clinical activity  collected from all patients treated in Arm [ADDRESS_773191] dose and schedul e should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in patients 
with PK deficiency compared with healthy volunteers.   
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to patients include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587452] (potentially) large increases in Hb level (Section  9.7.1  and Section  9.7.2 ). Measures intended 
[ADDRESS_773192] two different doses  of the study drug to 
assess its PK  and PD  profile s.  
Consistent with the design of many Phase 2 studies, preliminary evaluation of the potential PD 
and clinical activity of AG -348 are secondary objectives of this study . The latter will include 
assessments of the PK/PD relationship between AG -348 and the biomarkers ATP and 2,3- DPG, 
 
7.3. Rationale for the Starting Dose , Dose Range , and Duration of Dosing  
Prior to  execution of this study, Agios conducted two clinical studies of AG -348 i n healthy 
volunteers, including a SAD study ( AG48-C- 001) and a MAD (14 day q12h) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these two studies, [ADDRESS_773193] been dosed with 
AG-348. In vitro  investigations, also reported in the IB, had previously demonstrated that 
AG-348 increased the activity of wild -type PKR approximately to the same extent as it did a 
series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasona ble to study the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD of AG -348 in healthy subjects in a controlled Phase 1 setting as a more 
efficient means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of patients with PK deficiency.  
The MAD stu dy dem onstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248] -348 doses from 60 mg q12h 
to 360 mg q12h (including 120 mg q24h) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3 -DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposures 
resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_773194] dose ranging study in pat ients with PK deficiency 
were selected to be 300 mg q12h (Arm 1) and 50 mg q12h (Arm 2). These doses were demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy volunteer studies. The availability of ATP is proposed as being critical for optimally maintainin g RBC membrane integrity (see Section  5.1). 
The dose ranges from [ADDRESS_773195] 2015 
 
Justification for Duration of Dosing  
The treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 months) was chosen for this proof -of-concept  trial for 
2 principal reasons: 1) to begin establishing a safety database addressing the chronic 
administration of AG -348; and 2) to allow sufficient time for clinical response to treatment to 
appear.  
It is anticipated that this treatment, if successful,  may be taken for life, as PK deficiency is a 
genetically determined inborn error of metabolism. Therefore, it is important to begin to 
investigate the long -term safety of the treatment. As will be discussed below, the safety package 
supports the treatment  duration of 6 months.  
Red blood cell turnover is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 120 days (4 months), although it may be shorter in some populations of pyruvate kinase deficient RBCs  (Mentzer, et al. 1971 ). Different PKR mutations 
produce a variety of physiologic consequences. In mutations where normal or nearly normal levels of PKR protein persist, but the protein’s catalytic function is impaired, an improvement in PKR funct ional activity might be seen relatively quickly upon exposure to AG -348. However, in 
cases where the PKR mutation results in an unstable mutant, PKR protein levels may be low and additional time may be required for stabilization of the newly synthesized mutant enzyme in developi[INVESTIGATOR_587292].   
This study plans up to 24 weeks of dosing with AG -348 with the possibility of continued dosi ng 
beyond 24 weeks on a safety extension in patients for whom AG -348 is safely tolerated and 
demonstrates clinical activity. The ICH Guideline M3(R2) on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the 
Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorisation for Pha rmaceuticals, 
recommends that clinical trials of a duration between [ADDRESS_773196] equivalent duration, and clinical trials lasting beyond 
6 months should be supported by 6 -month rodent and 9 -month non -rodent studies. This guidance 
allows for clinical trials of longer duration to be initiated based on 3 months of nonclinical data, and for clinical dosing in serious or life- threatening indications to be extended based on complete 
chronic rodent data and in -life and necropsy data in the non -rodent (and complete histopathology 
in the non -rodent provided within an additional 3 months).  
For the current investigational product (AG -348), 13- week, repeat dose toxicology studies in the 
rat and monkey have been completed and are summarized in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  of this protocol and 
in the current Investigator Brochure prepared to support initiation of this clinical study . 
Considering that PK  deficiency is a serious condition with an unmet medical need, it is 
appropriate to initiate this clinical study with the av ailable nonclinical data. Six -month rodent 
and nine -month monkey toxicology studies were initiated in January 2015, and the Sponsor will 
report the results of these studies in each applicable regulatory region as required.  
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. In the event of such action, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to each Investigator.  
[ADDRESS_773197] ances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patient s; 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements;  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of the  study drug;  
• Other administrative reasons.  
Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to the Sponsor or 
the Sponsor’s designee.  
[ADDRESS_773198] meet all of the following criteria during the Screening or 
other specified period:  
1. Signed written informed consent obtained prior to performing any study procedure, including screening procedures.

(i.e., shows normal pyruvate kinase activity), the patient will be eligible for 
enrollment if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a mutant genotype that has been previously documented in the literature to be associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency. If the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587250] a previously undescribed mutation in the PKR gene, then the eligibility for enrollment will be determined on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_269722] [INVESTIGATOR_587263]. If no mutation is defined, then the patient will not be eligible.

8.4. Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_587432] (see Section  8.2 and Section  8.3, 
respectively) have been satisfied and that the patient is eligible for participation in this clinical study. T he site will submit to the Sponsor an Eligibility form for each eligible patient and the 
Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first dose of 
AG-348. 
8.5. Patient Randomization  
Patients who have been confirmed as eligible  will be randomized in an equal ratio to a treatment 
arm (e.g., 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on which arms are open) . The site will provide a request for 
randomization form (including the patient’s confirmed genotype) to the study Medical Monitor.  
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587468]. The PKR mutation 
stratification factor will consist of 4  levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations 
(“other”).  Since this is an open label study, randomization will not be blinded . 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure.  
8.6. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Patients wi ll be 
withdrawn from study -related procedures and treatments under the following conditions:  
• Withdrawal of consent;  
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity ; 
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation in the trial;  
• Patient requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication ( Section 9.11.2 ); 
• Investigator decision;  
• Protocol viola tion: non -adherence to protocol requirements;  
• Pregnancy;  
• Lost to follow -up. 
[ADDRESS_773211] 2015 
 
Should a patient decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol -
defined study observations up to the time of the patient’s withdrawal as completely as possible 
and to determine the reason for withdrawal . 
In the event a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be informed. If 
there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the 
Investigator until satisfactory health is returned.  
When a patient  withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to comple te and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_773212] 12 weeks of assigned dosing for 
reasons other than AEs may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
[ADDRESS_773213] 2015 
 
9. STUDY TREATMENT  
9.1. Description of Study Drug  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules will be provided as 5 mg, 25 mg , or 100  mg (free -base 
equivalent ) of AG-348 sulfate hydrate without excipi[INVESTIGATOR_587320] o paque (5  mg), Swedish 
orange (25 mg) , or white opaque ( 100 mg) gelatin capsules (size 2 capsules for all dose 
strengths).  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. Please see the Investigator’s 
Brochure for further details regarding study drug.  
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in white, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements . 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
AG-[ADDRESS_773214] be stored at room temperature of 15 to 30°C 
(59 - 86°F).  
All study drug prod ucts must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737].  
9.4. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25  patients will be  randomized to any one of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomiz ation will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are 
open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587469] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-348 each patient receives will be dependent upon which dose  arm is open for enrollment 
when the patient qualifies for and is randomized into the  study.  
9.5. Blinding  
This is an open- label study; no blinding methods will be used.  
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial two treatment arms, (Arm 1 and Arm  2), AG-348 will be administered orally BID 
(approximately every 12 hours  with a minimum of 10 hours  between doses ) over a 24 week 
treatment period . Starting with Day 1, dosing will be  continuous; there will be no rest periods . 
Patients  who do not meet any of the treatment withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.5) may continue 
treatment for the entire [ADDRESS_773215] relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each 
daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). 
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing diary (see 
Section  9.9). 
Patients should be instructed t o take their daily dose at approximately the s ame time s each day  
except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Patients who undergo extensive PK/PD sampling (see Appendix 15.1 , Table  6) should be 
instructed  from Week [ADDRESS_773216] the 
dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
Patients receiving limited PK/PD sampling (see Appendix 15.1 , Table 7) should be instructed to 
bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits  and to take the AM dose following PK/PD 
blood draws .  
Patients receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_773217] limited PKPD on 
other v isit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, patients will bring 
in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following  PK/PD blood draws .  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_773218] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the 
Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587376] . 
Patients will receive their first dose of AG  -348 in the clinic on Day  1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis.  
9.7. Criteria for Dose Escalation, Dose Modification, or Discontinuation 
of Study Drug  
No intra -patient dose escalations will be permitted in this study  unless the DRT  decides to re -
assign patients’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
originally assigned arm; i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose 
dose and sch edule is being adopted. All dosing modifications , as outlined below , will be 
implemented following discussions with the  Medical Monitor.  
9.7.1. Dose Modification for Safety 
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of the patient’s dose of AG -348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb level s (see Section  9.7.2 ). 
[ADDRESS_773219] 2015 
 
Table 1: Dose Modification for Adverse Events Deemed at Least Possibly Related to 
AG-348 
Adverse Events(s)  AG-348 Dose Adjustment

Grade 2  None required; Investigator and Medical Monitor judgment to manage as for 
Grade 3. 
Grade 3  Suspend dosing;  
If event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of 
suspension, resume dosing with 1 dose level reduction (see Table  2 below ).  
If event does not resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_773220] be immediately and permanently discontinued.   
It should be noted that if the initial dose of 300 mg BID selected for Arm 1 demonstrates an 
unacceptable safety profile resulting in multiple subjects undergoing dose modifications, the DRT  may exercise its option to re -assign these patient s’ dose and schedule to match the dose and 
schedule of another study arm (for example, Arm 2 of the study, or to match the dose and 
schedule of a [potential]  Arm 3, if implemented ). 
9.7.2. Dose Modification for Increase in Hemoglobin Level  
It is presently unknown to what magnitude, how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or even whether, AG -[ADDRESS_773221] the dose of 
AG-348 as outlined in Table  2 per the  following guidelines  and with Medical Monitor approval . 
• Males: If Hb >  15 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test , suspend dosing until Hgb 
≤ 13.5 g/dL; then resume dosing with a [ADDRESS_773222] 2015 
 
• Females: If Hb >  13.5 g/dL  and confirmed with a secon d test , suspend dosing until 
Hb ≤  12.5 g/dL; then resume with a 1 dose level reduction.  
• The treating Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor questions relating to 
dose modifications on an as needed basis.

[CONTACT_1689]  (Section  9.7.1 ). Other reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.5. 
9.8. Duration of Patient  Participation  
The duration of treatment for all patients on this study will be up to [ADDRESS_773224] relevant information 
regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses)  and return the diary at each study visit . 
9.10. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a 
pharmacist or other appropriate individual.  
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], and r eturn to Agios or 
its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_171032]). These records will adequately 
[ADDRESS_773225] 2015 
 
document that the patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should 
reconcile all study drug received from Agios. Accountability records will include dates, 
quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient numbers. An 
unblinded monitor will review drug accountability at the site on a schedule agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_587381]. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587321] s designee or , if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documented. All material containing AG -[ADDRESS_773226] Follow -up Visit ( Week 28/Day  197) must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the source documentation and eCRF  along with dosage information, dates 
of administra tion, and reason for use.  
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in this study : 
• Investigational drugs must be discontinued [ADDRESS_773227] dose of study 
drug;  
• Products known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4 , 
Table  8) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day  1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly induce CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.4 , 
Table  9) must be discontinued within 28 days prior to Day  1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit P- gp transport er (listed in Appendix 15.4 , 
Table  10) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day  1 dosing; 
• Digoxin must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day  1 dosing; 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents ( erythropoietins, granulocyte col ony stimulating 
factors, thrombopoietins, etc) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773228] dose of study drug. [Folic acid [ADDRESS_773229] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume  
(MCV) prior to enrollment in the study];  
[ADDRESS_773230] 2015 
 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must 
be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773231] dose of study drug;  
• As the target population for this study consists of transfusion independent patients and transfusion of blood products could confound key endpoints of the study, blood 
transfusions of any type must be strictl y avoided except in cases of compelling 
medical need. If medical circumstances permit, the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587382].  
Drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin (including some common sulfa 
antibiotics  [including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim] , cephalosporins, salicylates, and 
aminophylline) should be used with caution with the understanding that patients with elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin may potentially be at risk f or kernicterus syndrome  (Strauss, et  
al. 2006 ). 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibito rs of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 15.4 , Table  8) are not permitted for use with 
AG-348. Based on modeling of AG -348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD 
study, moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not appear to pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG- 348 induces CYP3A4 and its own metabolism, 
presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG -348 is 
expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore, administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(listed in Appendix 15.4 , Table  9) is not permitted with AG -348.  
Strong inhibitors of drug transport (listed in Appendix 15.4 , Table  10) are not permitted for use 
with AG- 348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Induction of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_147248] -[ADDRESS_773232] utilize barrier methods as per the Inclusion Criteria  14 (Section  8.2) while taking AG -348. 
Short -term (≤ 14 days at a time, and ≤ 28 days total during the 24 week treatment period) use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, intra- nasal, and systemic glucocorticoids is permitted for acute medical 
indications. Every effort should be made to minimize total duration of glucocorticoid therapy and 
utilize alternative treatments. Patients must be off glucocorticoids for at least 28  days prior to 
Day 1 of AG -348 dosing  as per Exclusion C riterion #11 ( Section  8.3). For patients who require 
chronic inhaled glucocorticoid therapy, Investigators should confer with the Medical Monitor for additional guidance.  
The expected patient co -medications deferoxamine, deferasirox , deferiprone, and oral penicillin 
are not expected to interact with AG -348. 
[ADDRESS_773233] 2015 
 
9.11.3. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All 
intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti -
infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as medically indicated and consistent with the 
guidance in the previous two sections. Patients may continue iron chelation therapy with 
deferoxamine and deferasirox.  Patients must continue taking [ADDRESS_773234] y factor 30 or higher sunscreen to exposed areas and wear 
protective clothing and sunglasses.  
9.11.5. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea 
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24  weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti -emetic and antidiarrheal  or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, if patients experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea these 
may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follows:  
• Nausea/vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron (Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Prom ethazine is a 
substrate for CYP 2B6, and it is presently unknown if the potential for 2B6 induction 
after AG -[ADDRESS_773235] of 
promethazine. Not recommended are aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP 3A4 inhibitor), 
ondansetron (Zofran; CYP 3A4 inducer),  chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP 3A4 
inducer), p rochlorpera zine (Compazine; CYP 3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has 
been reported ), and granisetron (Kytril; CYP 3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been 
reported);  
• Diarrhea: recommended management includes standard clinical dosing with Kaopectate or other non -absorbabl e anti -diarrheals, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Lomotil), 
or loperamide (Imod ium). Loperamide is the least preferred choice because it is both 
a substrate and inhibitor for CYP3A4, a substrate for CYP2B6, and a substrate for 
P-gp. 
• For the use of any medications  not specifically mentioned above the Investigator may 
confer with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
9.11.6. Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Patients should be advised to refrain from altering their normal exercise routine for the first [ADDRESS_773236] of this is to enhance 
oxygen delivery at the tissue level, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic 
consequences of the anemia. AG -348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 
12 hours following a single dose) in 2,3- DPG in two prior clinical trials with healthy adult male 
and female volunteers. In patients with PK deficiency  who have elevated 2,3 -DPG levels , it is 
theoretically possible that decreases in 2,3 -DPG that precede correction of the anemia could 
result in a temporary decrease of oxygen delivery at the tissue level resulting in clinical 
symptoms (e.g., increased fatigue).  
As discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  of this protocol and in the Investigator Brochure, AG -[ADDRESS_773237]/inverse agonist. No effects of histamine H3 
modulation have been observed in safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Nonetheless, patients should be monitored for potential adverse events related to wakefulness and insomnia  
(Schwartz 2011 ). 
[ADDRESS_773238] d ose of study 
treatment.   
During the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through 
Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 
12) and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate and 
demonstrate one or more indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 through Week 24 may be 
eligible to immediately enter a s afety  extension for continued treatment upon agreement of the 
treating Investigator and the Medical Monitor. For patients who finish  treatment, Study 
Discharge will occur 4 weeks (Week 28 or earlier) following the last dose of study treatment at 
the final follow -up assessment.  
Although not encouraged,  as a convenience for patients who travel long  distances to the study

Abbreviations: ECG  = electrocardiogram; EPO  = erythropoietin; PK/PD  = pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics; 
VS = vital signs  
Whenever more than one assessment is scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments 
should be performed in the order of least invasive to m ost invasive assessment (e.g., VS first, 
ECG, blood draw). The timing of these assessments should allow the PK blood draw to occur at 
the exact nominal time. The order of procedures may be revised with prior discussion between 
Sponsor and Site. 
Minor adjustmen ts to the timing , number of planned safety monitoring procedures (e.g., VS, 
ECG, blood draw) , and PK/PD assessments may be made during the course of the study based on 
collected data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring and will not require a protocol 
amendment. These minor changes will require prior approval from the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor (or Responsible Medical Officer) as well as appropriate documentation in the study 
records. The addition of new safety monitoring procedures or other assessments w ill require a 
protocol amendment . 
10.2. Informed Consent and Confirmation of Eligibility  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential patient  and a signed and 
dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study specific procedur es are performed.  
Patient’s eligibility will be confirmed at Screening and within 24  hours prior to study treatment 
dose. If a patient  is determined to be ineligible, the patient  will be excluded from participation.  
10.3. Demographic Data, Medical and Medication History 
Patient demographic data, including gender, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity, will be obtained at Screening. Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_587471], as appropriate.  
Medication history, including all relevant prior medical history and current medical conditions, 
will be obtained at the Screening assessment and on Day -1; all concomitant medications 
administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to Day 1 should be reported in t he 
source documentation and eCRF . Investigators will be asked to provide information on the 
patient’s history of any medical diagnoses (e.g., iron overload) and surgical procedures (e.g., 
splenectomy, cholecystectomy) pertaining to their diagnosis of PK de ficiency and prior available 
[ADDRESS_773242] 2015 
 
complete blood counts (CBCs) over the preceding 6 months and transfusion history over the 
preceding 12  months prior to the date of signing informed consent.   
10.4. PKR Enzymatic Assay and PKR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587299]. PKR enzymatic assays will be conducted at  
 . PKR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_362339]  
 
10.5. Safety Assessments  
10.5.1. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination ( including neurological examination; genital and rectal 
examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be obtained at 
Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow up Visit (Week 28). The neurological examination 
must include an assessment of general orientation and mental status including  level of alertness 
(assess as normal or abnormal and specify any abnormality).  For patients rolling o ver to the 
safety extension, the last physical examination will occur at Week 24. Limited focused physical 
examinations will be performed at all other visits. Any findings will be recorded on the eCRF . 
Height will be collected at Screening only . 
10.5.2. Vital Sign s 
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will 
be obtained according to the according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1 ). Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. 
Out of range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discr etion. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  15.1 ). The 
ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures PR, 
QRS, QT, QTcB (Bazett correction formula), and QTcF (Frederica’s correction). Only QTcF 
(not QTcB) will be u sed for determination of eligibility.  
The [ADDRESS_773243] 7  days prior to Day  1 dosing. ECGs will be repeated if clinically 
significant abnormalities are observ ed, if artifacts are present, or if machine/equipment errors 
occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.4. DXA Scans  
DXA scans (hip a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  to obtain T and Z scores  that will 
serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients . A second DXA 
scan will be conducted in the interval between Week 24 and Week  28 as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  15.1 ). All redacted DXA scan reports must be held at the 
study site and will be collected by [CONTACT_1034].  
[ADDRESS_773244] 2015 
 
10.5.5. Safety Laboratory Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Labor atory values obtained prior to S creening and RBC antibodies obtained at Screening will be 
performed at a local laboratory.  On-study c linical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by 
a central laboratory. If Investigators believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain safety 
laboratory results from their own local laboratories on the day of the subject's visit, and before 
the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their 
discretion to do so. I nvestigators should be aware that since the Hb level is a secondary endpoint 
of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab 
must still be collected , since it  will serve as the official lab result for this st udy. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  15.1 ). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing 
will be followed by [CONTACT_587388].  Please note that serum estradiol , free and total testosterone, and complete blood 
count (CBC)  will be collected  in the AM  at any [ADDRESS_773245] 2 days 
apart in addition to Baseline /Day  1 (total of 3 time points prior to Day  1 dosing).  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be determined:  
Hematology:  HCT , Hb, RBC count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent 
reticulocyte count, MCV , mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean 
corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC),  red cell distribution width 
(RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with automated  (or manual, 
as indicated) differentia l, ANC , and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC), and platelet count. In the event that the designated central 
laboratory for the study is unable to provide a valid result for any specific component of the defined CBC for a specific patient, the site 
may be asked to have the test performed at their local laboratory. 
The result of the local CBC will be entered into the study database along with the local normal reference range. G6PD and RBC 
antibody screen will be performed at Screening only  
Other EPO, Hp, COHb , 25-hydroxy vitamin D2 and D3 . 
Serum Chemistry:  alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, carbon dioxide (CO
2) or bicarbonate, 
albumin, total protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, uric acid, LDH , ALT, AST , total bilirubin , indirect 
bilirubin , (and estimated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration 
rate for screening only, as appropriate) . 
Sex Hormones : testosterone (total and free), estrone, and estradiol. FSH will only be 
performe d at Screening for female patient s only for confirmation of 
post- menopausal status . 
[ADDRESS_773246] 2015 
 
Bone Turnover serum osteocalcin -N-mid and CTX . 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_587300], HDL -C, triglycerides.  
Iron Panel  iron (F e), total iron -binding capacity ( TIBC), transferrin  saturation, 
ferritin.  
Coagulation Studies: fibrinogen , aPTT, INR . 
Urinalysis : color and appearance, pH, specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, 
bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, pregnancy screen (dipstick), occult 
blood. M icroscopic inspection of sediment  will only be performed 
for cause or to investigate an abnormal dipstick finding per the Investigator’s discretion . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Serology  
A blood sample for serology, including HBsAg, HCV Ab screen, and HIV1 and HIV2 Ab, is to 
be collected from all patients at Screening.  
10.5.6. Menstrual Cycle Diary  
Menstruating f emale patients will be required to fill out a  paper -based  menstrual cycle diary each 
month in order to monitor any changes. Diaries will be dispensed and collected as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1 ). Patients will record the start date, stop date, and 
any notable characteristics  of each menstrual cycle.  
10.5.7. Adverse Events  
Each patient will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study 
from signing of the informed consent through all scheduled study follow -up visits, or withdraw al 
of consent, whichever occurs first . In addition, SAEs that are as sessed as possibly or probably 
related to study treatment that occur >  [ADDRESS_773247] -treatment also are to be reported.  
AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587472]. On dosing visits, all AEs (elicited a nd spontaneously reported) will be 
continuously evaluated by [CONTACT_303595] . At any non -dosing day visit, AEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing w ill be reviewed at subsequent visits or assessment time 
points as necessary. If these AEs have resolved, this will be documented.  
All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE grading system ( Appendix 15.2 ). 
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  11. 
[ADDRESS_773248] approximately 10 patients treated , contingent on clinical site feasibility,  will undergo 
extensive PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1 , Table  6. The remainder of treated patients 
will undergo l imited PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1 , Table 7 . The i n-clinic visit on 
Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary  and must be 
approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413] . In this  instance , PK sampling  will not be 
required  on Day 22. ( Additional details regarding Day 8 and Day 22 visits performed by [CONTACT_4677]’s primary care physician can be found  in Table 5  in Appendix 15.1 : Schedule of 
Assessments. ) 
The collection times for post- dose PK samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PK draw at [ADDRESS_773249] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Samples for PK and PD assessments may be retained for up to [ADDRESS_773250]- dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PD draw at [ADDRESS_773251] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. The actual ti me point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP,  
 
The i n-clinic visit on Day 22 may be performed 
by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a 
case by [CONTACT_413] . In this instance, PD sampling will not be required  on Day 22. ( Addit ional 
details regarding Day 8 and Day 22 visits performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician are 
stated in Table 5  in Appendix 15.1 : Schedule of Assessments. )

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events and S AEs will be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF  from time of the signing informed consent 
through the Follow -up Visits  for randomized patients . All AEs should be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s  stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es).  
All SAEs will be followed through [ADDRESS_773258] dose of study treatment or until the SAE 
has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur >  [ADDRESS_773259] -treatment also are to be reported . 
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
11.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can 
arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose . 
11.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the d rug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or  severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure.  
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening means that the patient  was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form;  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but 
planned prior to study entry are not con sidered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned);  
[ADDRESS_773260] 2015 
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical eve nts include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The document entitled FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing 
Clinical Evaluation (FDA 2009 ) provides guidance on how the measurement of various 
laboratory parameters may be used to assess a given drug’s potential to cause severe liver injury (i.e., irreversible liver failure that is fatal or requires liver transplantation). Such cases are 
sugges ted by [CONTACT_587442]:  
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3- fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non- hepatotoxic) control 
drug or placebo;  
2. Among trial patient s showing  such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum total bilirubin to >  2×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
elevated serum  ALP ); 
3. No other reason can b e found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferases 
and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre -existing acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
Clinical safety laboratory results compati ble with the definition of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) stated above must be repeated for confirmation  as soon as possible, and if confirmed, will 
be scored as an unacceptable AE  and reported to FDA as a serious unexpected AE.  
11.2. Procedures for Reporting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non- leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected  during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patient s. 
All AEs (serious and non- serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE 
[ADDRESS_773261] be recorded in the appropr iate source documentation and eCRF . Treatment -emergent 
abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if there are 
accompanying symptoms; if additional diagnostic evaluations or medical (including drug 
therapy) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786]. Although it is an objective of this study to determine if treatment with AG -[ADDRESS_773262] be promptly reported by [CONTACT_587393] (see below ). Deaths and AEs assessed 
as life -threatening are to be reported immediately and SAEs that meet other criteria are to be 
reported within [ADDRESS_773263] Information:

If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local In stitutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will be promptly notified based on local regulations w here required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all 
serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects . 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents in the database. All 
new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after signing the informed consent through the final Follow -up Visit (Day  29 ± 3 days)  
must be recorded. Adverse events that are ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation 
[ADDRESS_773264] dose of study treatment, or until the SAE has resolved.  
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes:  
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded);  
• The date of onset of the event;  
• The date of resolution of the event;  
• Whether the event is serious or not;  
• Intensity of th e event (see below for definitions);  
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions);  
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary interruption in dosing); drug treatment required; non -drug treatment  required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823] (complete SAE page); diagnostic procedure performed; patient  discontinued from the study (complete End 
of Study visit);  
• Outcome: patient  recovered without sequelae; patient  recovered wi th sequelae; event 
ongoing; patient died (notify the Medical Monitor immediately, and complete the 
SAE form).  
Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix 15.1 ). 
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
• Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to 
the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587444].  An attribution of possibly related means that there are facts in 
evidence to suggest a possible relationship.  
• Probably Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE was more likely  explained by [CONTACT_587455], or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  An 
attribution of probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a 
probable relationship.  
For the purpose of  safety analyses related to final database review, all AEs that are classified as 
possible or probable will be considered treatment -related AEs.  
[ADDRESS_773265] 2015 
 
11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnancy in a 
participating female patient or a female pa rtner of a participating male patient that occurs during 
this study or within [ADDRESS_773266] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s 
designee  on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congen ital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_773267] 2015 
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerabi lity of up to 
24 weeks of AG -348 in patients with PK deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primarily 
descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted.  All analyses will be 
conduct ed separately within each dose arm, or pooled where appropriate.  
12.1. Sample Size Estimation  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size in each dose arm  may be  determined by 
[CONTACT_5870]. I n order to evaluate the primary objective of safety and tolerability of AG -348 in 
Arm 1 and Arm  2, up to a maxi mum of 25 patients may be randomized onto each arm. The 
actual number of patients enrolled into Arms 1 and 2 will depend on the safety reviews and 
decisions made by [CONTACT_550627] . In addition, up to 25 additional patients may be enrolled to evaluate 
an additiona l dose arm (Arm  3; see Section  7.1). As for Arms [ADDRESS_773268] T. Therefore,  up 
to approximately  75 total patients may be enrolled in this study across 2 to 3 dose arms.  
Table  4 provides the probability within a dose arm of detecting 1 or more AEs with varying 
sample size and the true underlying AE rates.  
Table 4: Sample Size Estimation  
Sample Size  True Underlying AE Rate  
15% 10% 5% 
5 56% 41% 23% 
10 80% 65% 40% 
15 91% 79% 54% 
25 98% 93% 72% 
 
12.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following patient  populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation 
of the data:  
• Safety Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of safety 
data.  Patients will be classified according to treatment received, where treatment 
received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once,  or as the 
first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . Unless otherwise 
stated, the Safety Analysis Set will be the default analysis set for all data analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set: All patients in the Safety Analysis Set  with 
sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD 
activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773269] 2015 
 
• Efficacy  Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and achieve at least 50% 
compliance with their assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continuous 
dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be performed on subsets of patients with 
other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity and/or duration of 
dosing. The Efficacy  Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned 
treatment.  
 
 If such analyses are performed, they will be 
described in a separate PK Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP) and may be reported separately in a 
stand -alone report.  
12.3. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. When summarizing AE data, partial 
dates will be imputed as described in the SAP. Additional rules addressing the handling of 
missing data will be detailed in the SA P. 
12.4. Interim Analysis 
No formal statistical interim analysis will be conducted. Safety data will be reviewed on an 
ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627] , who will meet to review s afety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity data at regular intervals (approximately every 6 weeks) throughout the duration of the 
study. The DRT ’s decisions to suspend, terminate, or open a potential third dosing arm, or re -
assign patients’ dosing in  a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of another arm of the 
study will be based on the totality of the data including, safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity (e.g., changes in Hb levels).  
Additional interim reviews of data may be cond ucted to support decision making concerning the 
current clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety concerns.  
12.5. Statistical Methodology  
12.5.1. General Methods  
This study will be primarily descriptive in nature; therefore, there will be no formal hypothesis 
testing. Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and 
demographic data including genotype, safety  measurements , PK, PD par ameters and indicators 
of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled 
across all dose groups where appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749].  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) 
and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  
[ADDRESS_773270] 2015 
 
12.5.2. Disposition  
A summary of the disposition of patient s will be presented, in cluding the number enrolled, the 
number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations 
will be listed.  
12.5.3. Exposure and Safety Analyses 
Patients will receive multiple PO doses of AG -348 over a 24- week treatment perio d. The actual 
dose and duration in days of AG -348, as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of 
actual dose received and actual duration) and the relative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of 
dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_368801].  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of TEAEs  (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_230782] (SOC), preferred term (PT), CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action 
taken with study drug, and relationship to the study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summaries will 
be produced for all TEAEs, treatment -related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_587473]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or 
reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment.  
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at the day of first 
administration of study drug,  throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_773271] dose of 
study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subsequently considered drug -related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS data, presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for 
selected laboratory parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  
Where applicable CTCAE term s do not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower 
limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
No formal hypothesis -testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
Electrocardiogram analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal and clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes  from baseline in PR, QRS, and 
heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals will be summarized by [CONTACT_587446].  Full 
details of the QTc analysis  including correction methods used will be described in the SAP.  
Data collected from the menstrual diaries such as the start and stop dates of the menses and the 
patient reported characteristics of the menses will be presented in a by -patient listing. Additional 
descriptions of the data may also be performed.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587474].  
[ADDRESS_773272] 2015 
 
12.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 
and the metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire 
population. Pharmacokinetic parameters will  be summarized using the following descriptive 
statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, minimum and maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. PK analyses will be described in a separate PK 
SAP. 
12.5.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each 
dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. P harmacodynamic p arameters will 
be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean , SD, coefficient of variation %, 
median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %.  PD 
analyses will be described in a separate P D SAP . 
12.5.6. Aromatase Hormone Analysis  
The analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriat e graphic displays and statistical 
analyses to evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will 
include summaries of  actual values and change from baseline using appropriate descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, min and max) as described above.  
 
These analyses will present information by [CONTACT_587448] , and analyses of a pooled 
AG-[ADDRESS_773273] bilirubin, EPO, ferritin, and transferrin saturation 
(serum iron/iron binding capacity).  Characterization of Hb response which will include, but is

15.4. Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong i nhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Table  8) are not permitted for use with AG -348. Based on 
modeling of AG -348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD study , it is thought 
that m oderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not pose a  risk to patients dosed with AG -348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG -348 induce s CYP3A4 and induces its own 
metabolism, presumably via CYP3A4. The us e of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with 
AG-348 is expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. T herefore , administration of strong CYP3A4 
inducers (listed in Table  9) with AG- 348 is not permitted . Strong inhibitors of drug transport 
(listed in Table  10) are not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348.

15.5. Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_773304], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh,  Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added); 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medi cal research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subject s, including 
those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health 
of my subject  will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject 's best interest when providing 
medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to pa rticipation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well -being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiv eness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
[ADDRESS_773305], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a 
consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe 
arrangements for post -study access by [CONTACT_364309].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee b efore the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor 
ongoing studies. The researcher mus t provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any SAE s. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_163046]. Research on subject s or healthy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician 
or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects 
[ADDRESS_773306]'s freely -given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
25. For medical research using ident ifiable human material or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done 
only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
[ADDRESS_773307]'s dissent 
should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subject s, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the r esults of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy 
of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative 
and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.  
[ADDRESS_773308] current proven intervention, except in the following 
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no curren t proven 
intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the 
subjects who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, subject s entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benef its that result from it, for example, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or 
benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the subject  which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of  a subject  to participate in a study or the subject 's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a subject , where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject  or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating 
suffe ring. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, m ade publicly available.

Title of Study:  
A Phase 2, Open Label, Randomized, Dose Ranging, Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic and 
Pharmacodynamic Study of AG-348 in Adult Patients with Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency 
Study C enter(s):  
This study will be conducted at multiple  study centers. 
Phase of D evelopment: 2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG -348 administration in patients  with 
pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency ). 
Secondary:  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG -348 and the metabolite AGI-8702. 
• Evaluate the pharmacodynamic ( PD) response of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 
2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3- DPG) after administration of AG -348. 
• Evaluate indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 in patients with PK deficiency , including changes 
in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), reticulocyte count, haptoglobin (Hp), carboxyhemoglobin 
(COHb ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total and indirect bilirubin, erythropoietin  (EPO) , ferritin, 
and transferrin saturation  (serum iron/iron binding capacity) . 
Methodology: 
Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_773311] dose of study drug. Patients with toxicity 
suspected to be related to study drug will continue follow-up until the adverse event (AE) resolves, is 
declared chronic by [CONTACT_737], or the patient is lost to follow-up.

Initially, up to 2 5 patients will be randomized on a n open -label  1:1 basis to  each of two twice -daily 
(BID) doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients  total; see Figure  1, Study Schema). The dose of Arm 1 is 
300 mg of A G-348 administered orally every 12  hours (q12h, BID). The dose of Arm 2 is 50 mg of 
AG-348 administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587458]. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 4  levels ( R510Q, 
R486W , and  R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_587405]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned 
based on Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm have been selected from the forerunner AG348-C-001 single ascending dose 
(SAD) and AG348 -C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult volunteers to 
represent the range of doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-maximal  PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP . 
Because PK deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogenous due to the wide variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is important to focus closely on dose findings in 
this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 
administered q12h, a Data Review Team (DR T) will be establi shed to review study data on a regular 
basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348. 
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately every  
6 weeks), or ad hoc , as necessary, to review AEs, vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms ( ECG s) on enrolled patients. 
The DRT  will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical act ivity (e.g., changes from 
baseline in Hb). The DRT will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, treating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor,  Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.   
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773312] patient is dosed or ad hoc as necessary, 
the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data , and clinical activity data . Based on 
the DR T’s recurring 6  week reviews, the DRT may exercise one or more of  the following options: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; the dose for 
Arm 3 may  be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360 mg q12h; 
and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 
(and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or sus pended to allow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of 
signs of clinical activity . 
• Re-assign patients ’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and

schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT  will perform these evaluations on a recurring 6 -week basis. The data that the DRT  will review 
to make these decision s is expected to  include, but are  not necessarily limited to, the  following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECG;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP; 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773313] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule  in a potential third dosing arm will be  
determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical 
activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as ≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at 
least possibly related to AG -348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to 
≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it 
observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficult to support long-term dosing. 
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not had prior DXA scan 
within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended to serve as a baseline 
measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed of particular importance for 
those who may enter the longer term safety extension study after completing the current study. Al l 
patients will have a second DXA scan in the interval between Weeks 24 and 28. The safety extension study will separately address additional follow-up DX A scanning.  
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization 
scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing  arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_773314] arm, 
the study could enroll up to a maximum of  75 patients .

Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives),  
.  
 Approximately 
the first [ADDRESS_773328] dose and the morning Day 15 dose, and additional trough levels of ATP and 2,3- DPG 
will be obtained. A denosine triphosphate and 2,3 DPG will be analyzed using qualified assays to 
determine concentrations in whole blood. P harmacodynamic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 will be 
computed based on observed whole blood ATP and 2,3-DPG concentrations.  
Statistical methods : 
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24  weeks of 
AG-348 in patients with  PK deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature; no 
formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conducted separately within each dose 
arm, or pooled when appropriate. 
Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demographic data 
including genotype, safety measurements, PK, PD parameters and indicators of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled across all dose groups where 
appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [SD ], median, minimum, and maximum). 
Populations for analysis will include a Safety Ana lysis Set , a PK Analysis Set, and an Efficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis set will include all patients who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment; this population will be the primary set for the analysis of safety data  and the default analysis 
set for all data analyses unless otherwise stated. Patients will be classified according to treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or 
as the first treatment received if as signed treatment is never received . The PK Analysis Set will include 
all patients in the Safety Analysis Set with sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. 
Results of the potential PD activity of AG -348 will also be based on the PK analysis se t. The Efficacy

assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continued dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be 
performed on subsets of patients wi th other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity 
and/or duration of dosing. The Efficacy Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned treatment.  
 
 
Adverse events wil l be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_92869] (SOC), preferred term (PT), CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action 
taken with study drug, and relationship to study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summarie s will be 
produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_587463]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings 
will be provided for any deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment . Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events 
that are considered treatment- emergent, where treatment- emergent is defined as any AE with onset 
beginning at the day of first administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_773330] dose of study  drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or 
was subsequently considered drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematolog y, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline 
relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for selected laboratory parameters 
based on the baseline CTCA E grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  Where applicable CTCAE terms do 
not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
Electrocardiogram  analyses will include individual patient listings and summa ries of abnormal and 
clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes from baseline in PR, QRS, QTc intervals 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_587416].  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587474]. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 and the 
metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire population. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation %, median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation.   
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize P harmacodynamic parameters for 2,3- DPG and ATP for 
each dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. Pharmacodynamic parameters will be 
summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, 
minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK deficiency ) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in non -
spherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from mild or fully 
compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and life- long chronic hemolytic anemia 
associated with severe, debilitating co -morbidities. PK deficiency  is caused by [CONTACT_587464], which results in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR) in the red blood cell (RBC) . As shown in the diagram below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible step in 
glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, and formation of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. PKR is  thus a key enzyme 
for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed that ATP levels are critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity  (van Wijk and van Solinge 2005).

Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycerate; 
ADP = adenosine diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6 -bisphosphate; PEP = 
phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in PKR that have been described have a deleterious effect  on PKR 
catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or protein expression. PK deficiency  is associated with 
reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell maturation. Mature erythrocytes lack mitochondria relying predominantly on glycolysis to generate ATP. It is hypothesized that 
insufficient energy production promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired maintenance of 
cellular membrane homeostasis.  
PK deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and compound 
heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_773338] been identified in patients with PK deficiency  to date, and the majority of these mutations 
are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005 ). The prevalence of PK deficiency , 
based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is estimated at 51 cases per million in the Caucasian population ( Beutler and Gelbart 2000). 
Some patients with PK deficiency  have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254] ( Christensen, et al. 2011 ; Ghidini, et al. 1991; Hennekam, et al. 1990). 
Infants with PK deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with hepatosplenomegaly, 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is associated  with a 
high risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires

supportive treatment with intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia 
caused by [CONTACT_587354] , as wel l as supportive transfusion to keep 
their hematocrit (HCT) levels  >60%. 
Adults with PK deficiency  are reported to have life-long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associated co -morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co- morbidities 
include frequent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute on 
chronic hemolytic anemia ( Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life-
threatening iron deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256]. 
The current therapeutic options for patients with PK deficiency  are supportive. Most require life-
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long -
term surveillance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion-independent patients, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587355] ( Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and decrease bilirubin levels in some patients. However, this intervention is associated with significant morbidity including infe ction risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis. 
5.2. AG-[ADDRESS_773339] activity and normalizes red cell 
metabolism in vivo . Biochemical experiments demonstrate that AG -348 is a potent, pan- activator 
of many PKR alleles associated with PK deficiency . PK deficiency  red cells and their 
progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_171029], including a build-up of PEP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and lowered ATP levels. 
Treatment of PK deficiency  patient red cells ex vivo with AG-[ADDRESS_773340] wild type (WT) PKR enzymes and ex vivo  studies in 
blood from mice, monkeys and humans indicate that AG- [ADDRESS_773341] the underlying pathology of PK deficiency  and, importantly, provide clinical 
benefit to patients.  
5.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mutants (mPKR) in vitro, ex vivo , and 
in vivo . Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG-348 Investigator’s 
Brochure  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacology 
AG-[ADDRESS_773342] 
markers was evaluated in human RBCs. AG -348 dose-response curves in human whole blood 
showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI-8702 is a weak activator of the PKR enzyme . In 
whole blood from mice treated with AG -348, 13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating AG -348- mediated  activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG-[ADDRESS_773343] s of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from patients with PK deficiency . AG-348 activated PKR and induced metabolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3 -DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic  pathway activity in RBCs from PK deficiency  patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzymatic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_773344]/inverse agonist and an aromatase inhibitor, no effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in 
safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in toxicology studies ( Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that neither AG -348 nor AGI-8702 exhibited 
significant inhibition of the hum an ether -à-go-go related gene (hERG) current ( concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inhibition  [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular ( CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose 
level. No effects were seen in AG -348 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)- compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587289]- Dawley rats.  AG-348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose -dependent em etic activity in the ferret at ≥ 30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of AG-348 were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) 
was administered PO in the food-effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG-348 in animal 
species is characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma cle arance 
(CLp), and high volume of distribution at steady- state (V
ss) in rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
AG-348 has a medium to long a pparent terminal half -life (t1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability (F) was observed for AG-348 in a nimals. A high -fat diet led 
to lower oral absorption of AG-348 in monkeys.

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1%) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0 24hr) follow ing 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively. M etabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_773345] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248]-348. There was evidence of metabolism -dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely i rreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG-[ADDRESS_773346] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG-348 has the 
potential to cause an induction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP 3A4 substrates. 
The routes of metabolism for AG-348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributing > 70% of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute < 4% each.  
AG-348 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P- gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P-gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but does not inhibit BCRP. AGI-8702 is not an inhibitor of P- gp or BCRP under the concentrations 
tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
In rats, the no-observed- effect level/no -observed -adverse- effect level (NOEL/NOAEL), 
determined as 2000 mg/kg, was associated with area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve fro m 0 to 12 hours (AUC
0-12hr) values 223- to 526-fold the projected human efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In dogs, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC
0-12hr value 5.7-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The NOEL/NOAEL in dogs 
was 10 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 0.8-fold the projected efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In monkeys, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, with only non- adverse emesis and 
body weight loss seen; this dose was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 70-fold the projected 
efficacious AUC [ADDRESS_773347] appropriate species for further evaluation in toxicology studies.  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) in cynomolgus monkeys was defined in non- GLP 5 -day and 
14-day repeat -dose studies as emesis , inappetence, and weight loss. These toxicities became dose 
limiting at AUC 0-12hr values 27- to 34-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and 
precluded meaningful evaluation of other toxicities at this exposure level. Potential other effec ts 
at this exposure level were observed in  a number hematology and serum chemistry paramet ers as 
well as in lymphoid organs. Additionally, minimal potential effects in kidneys (renal 
27 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
tubulointerstitial nephritis) and heart (myocardial degeneration), which could not be 
differentiated from spontaneous background lesions, were seen when monkeys were exposed to 
AG-348 AUC 0-12hr values ≥ 27- to 34-fold the projected human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value.  
In GLP -compliant 28-day monkey study, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose twice daily 
[BID] ) was  the NOAEL. Effects were limited to increased liver weights without serum chemistry 
or microscopic correlate. At this dosage level, the Day 27 AUC 0-12hr values were 8.9 - and 
8.5-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females respectively. In the same 
study, the low dosage of 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose) resulted in AUC 0-12hr values that 
approximated the efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and there were no test article- related effects seen. 
The next highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day (25 mg/kg/dose) was the NOEL and was associated with 
AUC 0-12hr values 3.1- and 2.6- fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females 
respectively.   
In the GLP-compliant 28-day rat study, the NOAEL in males was the highest dose tested, 600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose), and the NOAEL  in females was the lowest dose tested, 
20 mg/kg/day (10  mg/kg/dose). At the 600 mg/kg/day dosage level in males, AG-348- related 
findings were limited to mild effects on hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, and microscopic findings in the adrenal gland (minimal to mild vacuolation of the adrenal zona 
glomerulosa and decreased thickness of the zona fasciculate), liver (minimal to mild hepatocellular hypertrophy), kidney (minimal tubular vacuolation), pancreas (minimal to moderate decreased zymogen granules), heart (minimal myocardial vacuolation), and prostate 
(minimal to mild decreased secretion). All findings were fully reversible over the [ADDRESS_773348] dosage tested was 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) ; adverse 
effects observed were similar to those observed  in the 600 mg/kg/day males, with the exception 
that in females, fewer effects in hematology and serum chemistry parameters were seen , and also 
in females, adverse effects in the reproductive organs consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
observed.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermatid retention, and Leydig cell 
hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at dose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. These effects were either not present or present with incidence and severity 
similar to that of the vehicle group in lower dose levels. Adve rse effects in females included 
uterine atrophy and increased folding of the luminal surface ; these effects were defined as 
adverse at the dose level at which they ar e expected to impair fertility   
In the 13- week repeat -dose study in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified, and no new 
effects were identified when compared to the 4 -week repeat -dose study. Similar to what occurred 
on the 4-week study, inappetence and emesis during the initial 1-2 weeks of dosing occurred, precluding evaluation of higher doses.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). In the 
GLP -compliant 28-day rat study, histologic effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in the female reproductive tract at the mid - and high-dosage levels (100 and 200 mg/kg/day)  
and included incomplete corpora lutea; ovarian follicular cysts; ovarian cystic, luteinized 
follicles; uterine atrophy; vaginal mucification; and altered cyclicity. A lthough these findings 
28 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
were minimal to mild and were fully reversible  (over 14 days), they were considered adverse and 
the next lower dosage evaluated, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose BID) was the NOAEL in 
females. The Day 27 AUC 0-12hr value associated with this dosage level was 6.9 -fold the projected 
human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The potential for aromatase inhibition effects occurring in 
female rats at AUC 0-12hr values > 6.9-fold and < [ADDRESS_773349] been exposed to AG-348 in 2 clinical studies , a single  
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these 
subjects exposed to a single AG-348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under fasted and fed conditions; and [ADDRESS_773350] clinical trial in which patients with PK deficiency will be treated with 
AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic s 
The PK of AG-348 showed low to moderate variability between subjects. After single do ses of 
AG-348 from  30 to 2500 mg, AG-348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587318] (T max). There appeared to be some lengthening of the period of 
absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] T max and a less th an proportional increase in 
maximum concentration (C max). Dose-normalized area under the curve ( AUC ) generally 
remained constant over the dose range studied, suggesting that AG-348 total exposure increased 
in a dose-proportional manner. The mean t 1/2 ranged from 17.8 to 20.4 hours when samples were 
collected through 72 hours and from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were collected through 
120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contributed little to overall exposure of 
AG-348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587420] 0-12 and area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), suggesting a shorter effective half -
life of approximately 3 to 6 hours. AG-348 was extensively distributed (mean apparent volume 
of distribution [V z/F] range of 271 to 1148 L) and had a moderate rate of clearance (geometric 
mean clearance [CL/F] range of 10.3 to 13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG-34 8 excreted in urine 
ranged from 0.0145 to 0.0209 across the dose levels suggesting that renal excretion plays a minor role in the systemic elimination of AG -348. 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG-348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours (q12h) 
to [ADDRESS_773351] dose. AG -348 exposure observed after repeated dosing for 14 days at doses of

120 mg every 24 hours (q24h) to [ADDRESS_773352] was greater at higher doses ; lower doses of [ADDRESS_773353] US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) high fat meal, showed that food likely has a minimal effect on the PK of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,3- DPG was observed at 
[ADDRESS_773354]-dose . The mean decrease 
at 24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_773355] 
dose; the concentration of ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_773356] dose on 
Day 14. The magnitude of the increase in ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg 
BID to 700 mg BID. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well- tolerated among healthy volunteers.  
After a single AG -348 dose, treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by > [ADDRESS_773357] 
at any time on study (either under fasted or fed conditions) included headache (22%), nausea 
(14%), and contact [CONTACT_587421] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of AG-348 for 14 
days, based on blinded data, TEAEs that occurred in > [ADDRESS_773358] to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primarily nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing 
dose. Nause a and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the single  dose study 
and only at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD  study. Nausea and vomiting were not observed at any 
dose ≤ 360 mg in either the single or multiple dose studies. 
All but 1 TEAE reported to date has been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The only 
Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ; aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with [ADDRESS_773359] received (AG -348 versus  placebo) remains 
[ADDRESS_773360] discontinued in the SAD study due to an adverse event (AE).  Four subjects , at doses of 
[ADDRESS_773361] discontinued for a cutaneous rash. 
No deaths or other serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported in any clinical study of 
AG-348. Furthermore, no DLTs  have been  declared  after a single administration of AG -348 at 
doses of 30 mg to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG-348 for 14 days at daily doses of 120 mg to 1400 mg (although the event of Grade [ADDRESS_773362]’s treatment assignment is 
unblinded). 
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the AG348-C-[ADDRESS_773363] study that will be conducted in patients with PK deficiency . This 
study is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and potential indicators of 
clinical activity of AG -348 administered for up to 24 weeks . This study will also evaluate the PK  
profile of AG-348 and its met abolite AGI -8702, the P D responses in ATP and 2,3- DPG 
following administration of AG -348, and the clinical activity of AG-348 in PK deficiency 
patients . Two previous double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials of AG -348 conducted in 
healthy adult male and female volunteers (AG348-C-001, a SAD study ; and AG348-C-002, a 
MAD study ) have established an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for AG -348 for up to 
14 days of both once-daily (QD) and BID dosing at exposures that result in significant 
pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in whole blood levels of the glycolytic metabolites 2,3- DPG 
and ATP . Due to the potential for AG-348- mediated aromatase inhibitio n, dual- energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (D XA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening  (if patient has not 
had prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data will serve as 
baseline measures of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients (see Section  7.1 for more 
details).  
The target population of this study consists of adult males and females with a diagnosis of PK 
deficiency , who are anemic but non-transfusion dependent. Non-transfusion dependent patients 
are preferred for this study  in order to reduce any potential confounding effect of transfusion 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587290]. The safety, tolerability, and PK/PD findings in this study will form the basis for subsequent clinical development of AG-348.

review the accumulating study data and will exercise options to suspend enrollment to 
one or both of the initial two study dose arms, discontinue enrollment to one or both 
of the initial two study dose arms, adjust the dose of patients in one or both of the 
initial two study arms, and/or implement one new study dose arm. If one new dosing 
arm is implemented, the dose sele cted will not exceed [ADDRESS_773366] dose 
that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID dosing 
study in healthy volunteers. Group cohort stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587314] (CTCAEv4.03 grade) and frequency of AEs  are

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
6.4.2. Clinical Activity Measure s and Endpoints  
• Monitoring of potential indicators of clinical activity will include evaluating change s 
in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb,  LDH, total and indirect bilirubin, EPO , 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation. 
6.4.3. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints  
The PK and PD profile of AG-348 will be evaluated by: 
• Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773367] non-compartmental methods based on 
observed plasma AG-348 and AGI- 8702 concentrations . 
• Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives), 
 
 
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773368] to follow -up. 
Initially, up to 25 patients  will be randomized on an open- label,  1:1 basis to each of two BID 
doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients; see Figure  3, Study Schema) . The dose of Arm 1 is 300 mg 
of AG -348 administered orally q12h (BI D). The dose of Arm  2 is 50 mg o f AG-348 
administered orally q12h (BID) for [ADDRESS_773369] of 
4 levels ( R510Q, R486W, and R479H ) and all other mutations (“other”).  Mutation status is 
defined by [CONTACT_587424]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion. 
The doses for each arm have been selected from the forerunner AG348-C-001 SAD study and 
AG348 -C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of doses/exposures 
that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects on 2,[ADDRESS_773370]- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this 
study with 2 different doses of AG-348 administered q12h, a DRT  will be established to review 
study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG- 348 as 
indicated .  
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately 
every 6 weeks) , or ad hoc as necessary,  to review AEs, VS , clinical laboratory (hematology, 
clinical chem istry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs  on enrolled patients. The DR T will 
also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from baseline 
in Hb). The DRT  will be comprised of the study Coordinating Investigator, tre ating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.  
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773371] patient is doses or ad hoc as 
necessary, the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data, and clinical 
35 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
activity data . Based on the DRT ’s recurring 6 -week reviews , the DRT  may exercise one or more 
of the following options: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm 3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360  mg q12h; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm 3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or 
suspended to allow further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of signs of clinica l activity.  
• Re-assign patient’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. 
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT  will perform these eva luations on a recurring 6- week basis. The data that the DRT  will 
review to make these decisions is expected to include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs ; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs ;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP;  
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773372] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will mo nitor the safety data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a 
decision to terminate enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined  as 
≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at least possibly related to AG -348, with the 
exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is 
transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. 
The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it observes a 
frequency of Grade  2 AEs that would make it difficu lt to support long- term dosing.  
Due to the potential for AG-348-mediated aromatase inhibition, dual- energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (D XA) scan (hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screening (if patient has not 
36 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
had prior DXA scan within 3 months of Day 1) to obtain T and Z scores. These data are intended 
to serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients, and are deemed 
of particular importance for those who may enter the longer term safety extension study after 
completing the cu rrent study. Al l patients will have a second DXA scan in the interval between 
Weeks 24 and 28. The safety extension study will separately address additional follow-up D XA 
scanning. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the 
randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing 
arm. Randomization and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left 
enrolling. 
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_773373] arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 patients.

The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an 
individual patient’s dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773374] dose of study treatment. During the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baselin e (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 
(Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and 
monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 1 6, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG [ADDRESS_773375] not to enter the extension trial, study 
discharge will occur 4 weeks (Week 2 8 or earlier) following the last dose of study treatment at 
the final follow -up assessment.  
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemis try, 
coagulation studies, and urinalysis ); physical examination findings; VS; 12 lead ECGs, and DXA 
scans . Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone 
[total and free], estrone, and estradiol), and bone turnover markers ( NTX and CTX). Follow-up 
assessments w ill be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28) and will include physical examination, 
weight, performance status, VS, 12-lead ECGs , laboratory evaluations (hematology, Hp, EPO 
levels, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis; lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and transfusion record.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702. Pharmacodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for 
determination of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling  will be conducted on 
the first approximately 1 0 patients total treated in Arms 1 and 2 (see Appendix 15.1, Table 5) 
while  more limited PK/PD sampling will be conducted on additional patients treated if 
enrollment in Arm 1 or Arm  2 is expanded or if an alternate dosing arm is added (see 
Appendix 15.1, Table 6).   
 
 
 
 
7.2. Justification of the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK 
and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773376] 
safely tolerated dose ( Arm 1: 300 mg BID)  and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD 
activity (Arm 2 : 50 mg BID ) from the forerunner AG348-C-002 MAD study in healthy 
volunteers. Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms 
and/or implementation of an additional dose arm  will be based on DRT review of safety , PK and 
PD data, and indicators of clinical activity  collected from all patients treated in Arm [ADDRESS_773377] dose and schedule should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in patients 
with PK deficiency compared with healthy volunteers.  
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to patients include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587425] (potentially) large increases in Hb level (Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2). Measures intended 
to maximize the opportunity for p atients with demonstrated safety and tolerability  to continue to 
[ADDRESS_773378] two different doses of the study drug to 
assess its PK  and PD profile s.  
Consistent with the design of m any Phase 2 studies, preliminary evaluation of the potential PD 
and clinical activity of AG -348 are secondary objectives of this study . The latter will include 
assessments of the PK/PD relationship between AG-348 and the biomarkers ATP and 2,3- DPG, 
 
7.3. Rationale for the Starting Dose and Dose Range  
Prior to  execution of this study, Agios conducted two clinical studies of AG-348 in healthy 
volunteers, including a SAD study ( AG48-C-001) and a MAD (14 day q12h) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these two studies, [ADDRESS_773379] been dosed with 
AG-348. In vitro  investigations, also reported in the IB, had previously demonstrated that 
AG-348 increased the activity of wild -type PKR approximately to the same extent as it did a 
series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasonable to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AG-348 in healthy subjects in a controlled P hase 1 setting as a more 
efficient means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of patients with PK deficiency.  
The MAD stu dy demonstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248]-348 doses from 60 mg q12h 
to 360 mg q12h (including 120 mg q24h) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposure s 
resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_773380] dose ranging study in patients with PK deficiency 
were selected to be 300 mg q12h (Arm 1) and 50 mg q12h (Arm 2). These doses were 
demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy volunteer studies. The availability of ATP is 
proposed as being critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity (see Section  5.1). 
The dose ranges from 50 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h may result in clinically effective modulation 
of PKR  in PK deficiency patients if the mutated enzyme is responsive to AG -348 in a similar 
manner to the wild -type enzyme in healthy subjects. However, there are many different 
mutations in PKR that result in PK deficiency, and these mutations produce variable effects on 
the enzyme in terms of catalytic activity and thermal stability. It is not known if different 
mutations will respond clinically in a similar manner to the same exposure to AG -348. 
Therefore, it is prudent to study the range of safe and pharmacod ynamically relevant doses as 
specified in this study, and to allow flexibility for the DRT  to analyze the evolving study data to 
adapt the dose and schedule of administration of AG-348 to produce the optimal combination of safety, tolerability, and PD,  and, potentially, clinical response.

Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_273900] (see Section  8.2 and Section  8.3, 
respectively) have been satisfied and that the patient is eligible for participation in this clinical 
study. The s ite will submit to the Sponsor an Eligibility form for each eligible patient and the 
Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first dose of 
AG-348. 
[ADDRESS_773391] been confirmed as eligible will be randomized in an equal ratio to a treatment 
arm (e.g., 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on which arms are open). A randomization number will be 
assigned. The site will provide a request for randomization form (including the patient’s 
confirmed genotype) to a central randomization center. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587476] m utations 
expected to be most frequently enrolled. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 
4 levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Since this is an open label study, randomization will not be blinded. 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure. 
8.6. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Patients may 
withdraw or be withdrawn from study- related procedures and treatments under the f ollowing 
conditions: 
• Withdrawal of consent; 
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity ; 
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation 
in the trial; 
• Patient  requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication ( Section 9.11.2);  
• Investigator decision; 
• Protocol violation: non-adherence to protocol requirements; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Lost to follow-up. 
Should a patient  decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-
defined study observations up to the time of the patient’s withdrawal as completely as possible 
and to determine the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be informed. If 
there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the 
Investigator until satisfactory health is returned.  
When a patient  withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_773392] 12 weeks of assigned dosing for 
reasons other than AEs  may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.

All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for further details regardi ng study drug. 
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in white, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) 
induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulato ry requirements . 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
AG-[ADDRESS_773393] be stored at room temperature of 15 to 30°C 
(59 - 86°F).  
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737].  
9.4. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25  patients will be randomized to any one of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomization will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are 
open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587469] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-348 each patient  receives will be dependent upon which dose arm  is open for enrollment 
when the patient  qualifies for and is randomized into the study.  
9.5. Blinding  
This is an open-label study; no blinding methods will be used. 
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial two treatment arms, (Arm 1 and Arm 2), AG- 348 will be administered orally BID 
(approximately every 12 hours with a minimum of 10 hours between doses ) over a 24 week 
treatment period . Starting with Day 1, dosing will be  continuous; there will be no rest periods. 
Patients  who do not meet any of the treatment withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.5) may continue 
treatment for the entire [ADDRESS_773394] relevant information regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each 
daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). 
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing di ary (see 
Section  9.9).  
Patients should be instructed to take their daily dose at approximately the s ame time s each day  
except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Patients who undergo extensive PK/PD sampling (see Appendix 15.1, Table 5) should be 
instructed  from Week [ADDRESS_773395] the 
dose following PK/PD blood draws.  Patients receiving limited PK/PD samp ling (see Appendix 15.1, Table 6) should be instructed to 
bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits  and to take the AM dose following PK/PD 
blood draws.  Patients receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_773396] limited PKPD on 
other visit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, patients will bring 
in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_773397] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the 
Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_587376]. 
Patients will receive their first dose of AG  -348 in the clinic on Day 1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis. 
9.7. Criteria for Dose Escalation, Dose Modification, or Discontinuation 
of Study Drug  
No intra- patient dose escalations will be permitted in this study  unless the DRT  decides to re -
assign patients’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their originally assigned arm; i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose 
dose and schedule is being adopted. All dosing modifications , as outlined below, will be 
implemented following discussions with the  Medical Monitor. 
9.7.1. Dose Modification for Safety 
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of the patient’s dose of AG-348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb levels (see Section  9.7.2).

Table 1: Dose Modification for Adverse Events Deemed at Least Possibly Related to 
AG-348 
Adverse Events(s)  AG-348 Dose Adjustment 
Grade 1  None required. 
Grade 2  None required; Investigator and Medical Monitor judgment to manage as for 
Grade 3. 
Grade 3  Suspend dosing;  
If event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of 
suspension, resume dosing with 1 dose level reduction (see Table  2 below ).  
If event does not resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_773398] of the Medical Monitor to permit subsequent re- escalation to the former  dose level. 
Dosing for an individual patient will be discontinued permanently for Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs 
that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of suspension of dosing, 
unless the benefits outweigh the risks of resuming t reatment and are approved by [CONTACT_22955]. No patients may be re- escalated to their former dose level after a dose modification 
without discussion with the Medical Monitor.   
It should be noted that if the initial dose of 300 mg q12h BID selected for Arm 1 demonstrates an 
unacceptable safety profile resulting in multiple subjects undergoing dose modifications, the 
DRT  may exercise its option to re -assign these patients’ dose and schedule to match the dose and 
schedule of another study arm (for exampl e, Arm 2 of the study, or to match the dose and 
schedule of a [potential]  Arm 3, if implemented ). 
9.7.2. Dose Modification for Increase in Hemoglobin Level  
It is presently unknown to what magnitude, how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or even whether, AG- [ADDRESS_773399] the dose of AG-348 as outlined in Table  2 per the following guidelines and with Medical Monitor approval. 
• Males: If Hb > 15 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test, suspend dosing until Hgb 
≤ 13.5 g/dL; then resume dosing with a 1 dose level reduction.  
• Females: If Hb > 13.5 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test , suspend dosing until 
Hb ≤ 12.5 g/dL; then resume with a 1 dose level reduction.

[CONTACT_1689] ( Section  9.7.1). Other reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.5. 
9.8. Duration of Patient  Participation  
The duration of treatment for all patients on this study will be up to [ADDRESS_773400] relevant information 
regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses) and return the diary at each study  visit. 
9.10. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. 
The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the Inves tigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a 
pharmacist or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], and return to Agios or 
its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_171032]). These records will adequately 
document that the patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all stud y drug received from Agios. Accountability records will include dates, 
quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient numbers. An 
[ADDRESS_773401] not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_941] S tudy 
Monitor after database lock has occurred. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587298], if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documented. All material containing AG-[ADDRESS_773402] Follow- up Visit ( Week 28/Day 197) must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the source documentation and eCRF  along with dosage information, dates 
of administration, and reason for use.  
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in this study : 
• Investigational drugs must be discontinued [ADDRESS_773403] dose of study 
drug; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.3, 
Table 7) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly induce CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.3, 
Table 8) must be discontinued within 28 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit P- gp transport er (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 9) 
must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Digoxin must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents ( erythropoietins, granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors, thrombopoietins, etc) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773404] dose of study drug. [Folic acid [ADDRESS_773405] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume  
(MCV) prior to enrollment in the study]; 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773406] dose of study drug;  
51 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
• As the target population for this study consists of transfusion independent patients 
and transfusion of blood products could confound key endpoints of the study, blood 
transfusions of any type must be strictly avoided except in cases of compelling medical need. If medical circumstances permit, the Medical Monitor should be 
contact[CONTACT_587382]. 
• Other drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin. 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 7) are not permitted for use with 
AG-348. Based on modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Pha se 1 MAD 
study, moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not appear to pose a risk to patients dosed with 
AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and its own metabolism, 
presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG-348 is 
expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore, administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 8) is not permitted with AG -348.  
Strong inhibitors of drug transport (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Induction of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_147248]-[ADDRESS_773407] utilize barrier methods as per the 
Inclusion Crit eria 14 ( Section  8.2) while taking AG -348. 
The expected patient co -medications deferoxamine, deferasirox, and oral penicillin are not 
expected to interact with AG -348. 
9.11.3. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All 
intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti-
infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as medically indicated and consistent with the 
guidance in the previous two sections. Patients may continue iron chelation therapy with 
deferoxamine and deferasirox. Patients must continue taking [ADDRESS_773408] sun exposure. When exposure to sunlight is anticipated for longer than 15 minutes, the 
52 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
patient should be instructed to apply factor 30 or highe r sunscreen to exposed areas and wear 
protective clothing and sunglasses. 
9.11.5. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea 
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti -emetic and antidiarrheal  or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, if patients experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea these 
may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follow s: 
• Nausea/vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron (Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Prom ethazine is a 
substrate for CYP 2B6, and it is presently unknown if the potential for 2B6 induction 
after A G-[ADDRESS_773409] of 
promethazine. Not recommended are aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP3A4 inhibitor), 
ondansetron (Zofran; CYP3A4 inducer), chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP3A4 
inducer), prochlorperazine (Compazine; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has 
been reported ), and granisetron (Kytril; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been 
reported);  
• Diarrhea: recommended management includes standard clinical dosing with Kaopectate or other non- absorbable anti -diarrheals, di phenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Lomotil), 
or loperamide (Imodium). Loperamide is the least preferred choice because it is both a substrate and inhibitor for CYP3A4, a substrate for CYP2B6, and a substrate for P-gp. 
• For the use of any medications not specifically men tioned above the Investigator may 
confer with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
9.11.6. Other Restrictions and Precautions  
Patients should be advised to refrain from altering their normal exercise routine for the first [ADDRESS_773410] of this is to enhance 
oxygen delivery at the tissue level, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic 
consequences of the anemia. AG-348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 12 hours following a single dose) in 2,3- DPG in two prior clinical trials with healthy adult male 
and female volunteers. In patients with 
PK deficiency  who have elevated 2,3 -DPG levels , it is 
theoretically possible that decreases in 2,3- DPG that precede correction of the anemia could 
result in a temporary decrease of oxygen delivery at the tissue level resulting in clinical 
symptoms (e.g., increased fatigue).  
[ADDRESS_773411] dose of study 
treatment.   
During the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through 
Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 
12) and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate and 
demonstrate one or more indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 through Week 24 may be 
eligible to immediately enter a separate extension study for continued treatment upon agreement 
of the treating Investigator and the Medical Monitor. For patients who finish  treatment, Study 
Discharge will occur 4 weeks (Week 28 or earlier) following the last dose of s tudy treatment at 
the final follow -up assessment.  
Whenever more than one assessment is scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments 
should be performed in the order of least invasive to most invasive assessment (e.g., VS  first, 
ECG, blood draw). The timing of these assessments should allow the PK blood draw to occur at 
the exact nominal time. The order of procedures may be revised with prior discussion between 
Sponsor and Site. 
Minor adjustments to the timing , number of planned safety monitoring procedures (e.g., VS, 
ECG, blood draw), and PK/PD assessments may be made during the course of the study based on 
collected data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring and will not require a protocol amendment. These minor changes will require prior approval from the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor (or Responsible Medical Officer) as well as appropriate documentation in the study 
records. The addition of new safety monitoring procedures or other assessments will require a protocol amendment. 
10.2. Informed Consent and Confirmation of Eligibility  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential patient  and a signed and 
dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed.  
Patient ’s eligibility will be confir med at Screening and within 24 hours prior to study treatment 
dose. If a patient  is determined to be ineligible, the patient  will be excluded from participation.  
10.3. Demographic Data, Medical and Medication History  
Patient demographic data, including gender, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity, will be 
obtained at Screening. Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_171053], as appropriate.  
Medication history, including all relev ant prior medical history and current medical conditions, 
will be obtained at the Screening assessment and on Day -1; all concomitant medications 
54 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to Day 1 should be reported in the 
source documentation and eCRF . Investigators will be asked to provide information on the 
patient’s history of any medical diagnoses (e.g., iron overload) and surgical procedures (e.g., 
splenectomy, cholecystectomy) pertaining to their diagnosis of PK deficiency and prior available 
complete blood counts (CBCs) over the preceding 6 months and transfusion history over the 
preceding 12  months prior to the date of signing informed consent.  
10.4. PKR Enzymatic Assay and PKR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587299]. PKR enzymatic assays will be conducted at  
. PKR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_362339]  
. 
10.5. Safety Assessments  
10.5.1. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination (genital and rectal examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow 
up Visit (Week 28). For patients rolling over into extension study, the last physical examination 
will occur at Week 24. Limited focused physical examinations will be performed at all other visits. Any findings will be reco rded on the eCRF . Height will be collected at Screening only . 
10.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will be obtained according to the according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. 
Out of range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). The 
ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, QTcB (Bazett correction formula), and QTcF (Frederi ca’s correction). Only QTcF 
(not QTcB) will be used for determination of eligibility.  
The 12-lead ECGs should be obtained following [ADDRESS_773412] 7  days prior to Day 1 dosing. ECGs will be repeated if  clinically 
significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts are present, or if machine/equipment errors 
occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings will be recorded as AEs. 
10.5.4. DXA Scans  
DXA scans (hip a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be performed at Screeni ng to obtain T and Z scores that will 
serve as a baseline measure of bone mineral density for all enrolling patients . A second DXA 
scan will be conducted in the interval between Week 24 and Week 28 as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1).

10.5.5. Safety Laboratory Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Labor atory values obtained prior to S creening and RBC antibodies obtained at Screening will be 
performed at a local laboratory.  On-study c linical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by 
a central laboratory. If Investigators believe that it is clinically indicated to obtain safety 
laboratory res ults from their own local laboratories on the day of the subject's visit, and before 
the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their 
discretion to do so. Investigators should be aware that since the Hb  level  is a secondary endpoint 
of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab 
must still be collected , since it  will serve as the official lab result for this study . 
Clinical laboratory evaluations are to be colle cted according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 15.1). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing 
will be followed by [CONTACT_587388]. Please note that serum estradiol and free and total testosterone will be collected  in 
the AM  at [ADDRESS_773413] 2 days apart in addition to Baseline/Day  1 
(total of 3 time points prior to Day  1 dosing).  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be determined:  
Hematology:  HCT , Hb, RBC count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent 
reticulocyte count, MCV , mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean 
corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC),  red cell distribution width 
(RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with manual differential, ANC , and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and platelet count. 
G6PD and RBC antibody screen will be performed at Screening only  
Other EPO, Hp, COHb  
Serum Chemistry : alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, carbon dioxide (CO
2), albumin, total 
protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, LDH , ALT, AST , total bilirubin , and indirect bilirubin. 
Sex Hormones : testosterone (total and free), estrone, and estradiol. FSH  will only be 
performed at Screening for female patient s only for confirmation of 
post-menopausal status. 
Bone Turnover serum NTX and CTX. 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_587300], HDL -C, triglycerides.  
Iron Panel  iron (F e), total iron -binding capacity ( TIBC ), percent saturation, 
ferritin.  
Coagulation Studies: fibrinogen, aPTT, INR . 
56 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
Urinalysis : color and appearance, pH, specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, 
bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, pregnancy screen (dipstick), occult 
blood. Microscopic inspection of sediment will only be performed 
for cause or to investigate an abnormal dipstick finding per the Investigator’s discretion . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Serology  
A blood sample for serology, including HBsAg, HCV Ab screen, and HIV1 and HIV2 Ab, is to 
be collected from all patient s at Screening.  
10.5.6. Adverse Events  
Each patient  will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study 
from signing o f the informed consent through all scheduled study follow-up visits,  or withdraw al 
of consent, whichever occurs first. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_773414]- treatment also are to be reported.  
AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587472]. On dosing visits , all AEs (elicited and spontaneously reported) will be 
continuously evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. At any non- dosing day visit, AEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. An y AEs already documented at a previous 
assessmen t and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits or assessment time 
points as necessary. If these AEs have resolved, this will be documented. 
All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE grading system ( Appendix 15.2 ).  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  11. 
10.6. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
10.6.1. Blood Sample Collection and Pharmacokinetic Measurements During Dose 
Escalation 
The first approximately 10 patients treated , contingent on clinical site feasibility,  will undergo 
extensive PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 5. The remainder of treated patients 
will undergo limited PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 6. In- clinic visits on 
Day 8 and Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s prima ry care physician if necessary  and 
must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]; in these instances PK sampling would 
not be required. 
The collection times for post- dose PK samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example,  a PK draw at [ADDRESS_773415] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time  point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Samples for PK and PD assessments may be retained for up to [ADDRESS_773416]- dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PD draw at [ADDRESS_773417] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP,  
  
 In-clinic visits on Day  8 and Day 22 may be 
performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_253320] a case by [CONTACT_413]; in these instances PK sampling would not be required.

The PKR enzyme catalyzes the PEP to pyruvate reaction, with concomitant formation of ATP. 
17. Binding of AG- [ADDRESS_773418]- dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. (For example, a PD draw 
at [ADDRESS_773419] capsule has been ingested.) The 
completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Blood samples will be stored at the site and regularly transported at -80°C ±10 C to the 
bioanalytical laboratory for analysis. Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
10.8. Ordering of Blood Sample Collection  
When more than 1 blood sample is collected at the same nominal time, the samples will be collected in the following order:  
1. Safety laboratory assessments  
2. PK  
3. PD (2,3 DPG, ATP)

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF  from time  of the signing informed consent 
through the Follow-up Visits. All AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
All SAEs will be followed through  [ADDRESS_773420] dose of study treatment or until the SAE 
has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that 
occur > [ADDRESS_773421]- treatment also are to be reported . 
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
11.1.1. Adverse E vent (AE)  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
11.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure. 
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening me ans that the patient  was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form; 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110256]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned); 
60 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
• Congenital anom aly/birth defect;  
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The document entitled FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing 
Clinical Evaluation (FDA 2009) provides guidance on how the measurement of various 
laboratory parameters may be used to assess a given drug’s potential to cause severe liver injury (i.e., irr eversible liver failure that is fatal or requires liver transplantation). Such cases are 
suggested by [CONTACT_587442]: 
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3-fold or greater elevations above the ULN  of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic) control 
drug or placebo; 
2. Among trial patient s showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum 
total bilirubin to >  2×ULN, wit hout initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
elevated serum  ALP ); 
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferases and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre- existing acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
Clinical safety labor atory results compatible with the definition of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) stated above must be repeated for confirmation as soon as possible, and if confirmed, will 
be scored as an unacceptable AE  and reported to FDA as a serious unexpected AE. 
11.2. Proc edures for Reporting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Each patient  must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patient s. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_17491]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE 
[ADDRESS_773422] be recorded in the appropriate source documentation and eCRF . Treatment -emergent 
abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if there are 
accompanying symptoms; if additional diagnostic evaluations or medical (including drug 
therapy ) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug 
discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786]. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology 
should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study must be promptly reported by [CONTACT_587443] (see below ). Deaths and AEs assessed 
as life -threatening are to be reported immediately and SAEs that meet other criteria are to be 
reported within [ADDRESS_773423] Information:

If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local In stitutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will be promptly notified based on local regulations where required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents in the database. All 
new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after signing the informed consent through the final Follow- up Visit (Day  29 ± 3 days)  
must be recorded. Adverse events that are ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation 
should be followed up to [ADDRESS_773424] dose of study treatment, or until the SAE has resolved.  
62 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes: 
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded); 
• The date of onset of the event; 
• The date of resolution of the event; 
• Whether the event is serious or not; 
• Intensity of the event (see below for definitions); 
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions); 
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary 
interruption in dosing); drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823] (complete SAE page ); 
diagnostic procedure performed; patient  discontinued from the study (complete End 
of Study visit); 
• Outcome: patient  recovered without sequelae; patient  recovered with sequelae; event 
ongoing; patient  died (notify the Medical Monitor immediately, and complete the 
SAE form).  
Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix 15.1).  
Relationship  to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
• Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587395].  An attribution of possibly related means that there are facts in 
evidence to suggest a possible relationship. 
• Probably Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_587445] t reatment than by 
[CONTACT_22714], or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  An 
attribution of probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a probable relationship. 
For the purpose of safety analyses related to final dat abase review, all AEs that are classified as 
possible or probable will be considered treatment- related AEs.  
11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). However, any pregnancy in a 
participating female patient or a female partner of a participating male patient that occurs during 
this study or within [ADDRESS_773425] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s 
designee on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the delivery or elective abortion. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form ( e.g., maternal 
serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_773426] dose of AG-348. 
64 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 
24 week s of AG -348 in patients with  PK deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primarily 
descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conduct ed separately within each dose arm, or pooled where appropriate. 
12.1. Sample Size Estimation  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size in each dose arm  may be  determined by 
[CONTACT_5870]. I n order to evaluate the primary objective of safety and tolerability of AG -348 in 
Arm 1 and Arm 2, up to a maximum of 25 patients m ay be randomized onto each a rm. The 
actual number of patients enrolled into Arms 1 and 2 will depend on the safety reviews and decisions made by [CONTACT_550627] . In addition, up to 25 additional patients may be enrolled to evaluate 
an additional dose arm (Arm 3; see Section  7.1). As for Arms [ADDRESS_773427] T. Therefore,  up 
to approximately  75 total patients may be enrolled in this study across 2 to 3 dose arms. 
Table 3 provides the probability within a dose arm of detecting 1 or more AEs with varying sample size and the true underlying AE rates.  
Table 3: Sample Size Estimation  
Sample Size  True Underlying AE Rate  
15% 10% 5% 
5 56% 41% 23% 
10 80% 65% 40% 
15 91% 79% 54% 
25 98% 93% 72% 
 
12.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following patient  populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation 
of the data:  
• Safety Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of safety 
data.  Patients will be classified according to treatment received , where treatment 
received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or as the 
first treatme nt received if assigned treatment is never received . Unless otherwise 
stated, the Safety Analysis Set will be the default analysis set for all data analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set: All patients in the Safety Analysis Set w ith 
sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD 
activity of AG -348 will also be based on the PK analysis set.  
65 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
• Efficacy  Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and achieve at least 50% 
compliance with their assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continuous 
dosing. Additional efficacy analyses may be performed on subsets of patients with 
other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity and/or duration of 
dosing. The Efficacy  Analysis Set w ill be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned 
treatment.  
 
 
 If such analyses are performed, they will be 
described in a separate PK Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP) and may be reported separately in a 
stand -alone report. 
12.3. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. When summarizing AE data, partial 
dates will be imputed as described in the SAP. Additional rules addressing the handling of 
missing data will be detailed in the SA P. 
12.4. Interim Analysis 
No formal statistical interim analysis will be conducted. Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627] , who will meet to review s afety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity data at regular intervals (approximately every 6 weeks) throughout the duration of the 
study. The DRT ’s decisions to suspend, terminate, or open a potential third dosing arm, or re-
assign patients’ dosing in  a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of another arm of the 
study will be based on the totality of the data including, safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity (e.g., changes in Hb levels).  
Additional interim reviews of data may be cond ucted to support decision making concerning the 
current clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety concerns.  
12.5. Statistical Methodology  
12.5.1. General Methods  
This study will be primarily descriptive in nature; therefore, there will be no formal hypothesis 
testing. Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and 
demographic data including genotype, safety measurements , PK, PD par ameters and indicators 
of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled 
across all dose groups where appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) 
and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  
66 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
12.5.2. Disposition  
A summary of the disposition of patient s will be presented, including the number enrolled, the 
number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations 
will be listed.  
12.5.3. Exposure and Safety Analyses 
Patients will receive multiple PO doses of AG-348 over a 24- week treatment perio d. The actual 
dose and duration in days of AG-348, as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual dose received and actual duration) and the relative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of 
dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_368801].  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of TEAEs  (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_230782] (SOC), preferred term (PT), CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action 
taken with study drug, and relationship to the study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summaries will 
be produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_587473]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. 
Individual patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or 
reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment- emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset beginning at the day of first 
administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_773428] dose of 
study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subsequently considered drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS  data, presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for 
selected laboratory parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  
Where applicable CTCAE terms do not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower 
limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
No formal hypothesis- testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
Electrocardiogram analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal and clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes  from baseline in PR , QRS, and 
heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals will be summarized by [CONTACT_587446].  Full 
details of the QTc analysis including correction methods used will be described in the SAP. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant 
medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and 
summarized by [CONTACT_587474].  
12.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent co mpound AG-348 
and the metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire 
67 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Amendment 1, Version 2.0 02 February  2015 
 
population. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the following descriptive 
statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, mini mum and maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. PK analyses will be described in a separate PK SAP. 
12.5.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each 
dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. P harmacodynamic parameters will 
be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, 
median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of var iation %.  PD 
analyses will be described in a separate P D SAP . 
12.5.6. Aromatase Hormone Analysis  
The analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriate graphic displays and statistical analyses to evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will 
include summaries of actual values and change from b aseline using appropriate descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, min and max) as described above.  
 
These analyses will present information by [CONTACT_587448], and analyses of a pooled 
AG-[ADDRESS_773429] bilirubin, EPO, ferritin, and transferrin saturation 
(serum iron/iron binding capacity). Characterization of Hb response which will include, but is 
not limited to percent of patients w ith increase in Hb , time to Hb response, and duration of Hb 
response w ill be explored . 
12.6. Procedures for Reporting Deviations to Original Statistical Analysis 
Plan  
All deviations from the original SAP will be provided in the final clinical study report.

Helsinki (Appendix 15.4).  
The Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation and must submit written documentation of the approval to the Sponsor before he or she can enroll any patient  into the 
study. The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and well -being of the patient s. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB 
approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, informed consent, 
advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patient s, signed Dose Escalation 
Interim Safety Reports, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB. The IRB is to be notified of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with local requirements. Progress reports and notifications of serious unexpected adverse drug 
reactions are to be provided to the IRB according to local regulations and guidelines. 
13.3. Patient  Information and Informed Consent  
The Investigator or tr ained designee will ensure that the patient  is given full and adequate oral 
and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and benefit of the study. Patient s 
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any t ime. The patient  
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
patient  prior to study participation.  
The patient ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-
related procedures. The Investigator must maintain the original, signed consent form. A copy of the signed form must be given to the patient .

13.4. Patient  Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all source documents, study drug accountability records, 
study reports and communications will identify the patient  by [CONTACT_587449]. The 
Investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority(ies) access to the patient’s original medical reco rds for verification of data gathered on 
the source documents and to audit the data collection process. The patient ’s confidentiality will 
be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913]. 
13.5. Protocol Compliance  
The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol. Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement of both the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Changes to the protocol will require written IRB approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_146949], except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patient s. The IRB may provide, if applicable, where regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited 
review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51704](s) in ongoing studies that have the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]. The Sponsor or designee will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patient s, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor (or Responsible Medical 
Officer), if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. Any depar tures from 
the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents/database. 
13.6. Data Management  
A paper or eCRF will be completed for each patient or an electronic data capture system will be 
used. The electronic data capture system  (EDC) ( Medidata Rave®) is a software tool designed to 
ensure quality assurance and facilitate data capture during clinical trials. Through a system regulated workflow that includes barcode scanning and interfaces to medical equipment to avoid manual data entry, study operations performance is controlled and captured in real time. The 
system is fully Code o f Federal Regulations (CFR) [ADDRESS_773430] be completed immediately after the f inal examination. An 
explanation should be given for all missing data. The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, 
completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to the Sponsor. Data collection processes and 
procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of all data changes. The Investigator or 
designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study 
documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit. Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any 
errors or inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respe ctive study 
sites by [CONTACT_25317]. The Investigator or designee will prepare and 
maintain adequate and accurate study documents (medical records, ECGs, AE, and concomitant

medication reporting, raw data collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and 
other pertinent data for each patient  receiving study treatment. The Investigator will allow 
Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory authority inspectors, and the IRB to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study. 
13.7. Source Document/Case Report Form Completion  
Source documents will be completed for each study patient . It is the Investigator’s responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the patient ’s source 
document. The source document should indicate the patient ’s participation in the study and 
should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs and patient  status.  
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the source document as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient  is seen for 
an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after th e final examination. An explanation should be given for all 
missing data.  
The Investigator will sign and date each required assessment for all study patient s. The 
Investigator will retain all completed source documents.

15.3. Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Table 7) are not permitted for use with AG-348. Based on 
modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD study, it is thought 
that moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and induces its own 
metabolism, presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with 
AG-348 is expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore , administration of strong CYP3A4 
inducers (listed in Table 8) with AG-348 is not permitted . Strong inhibitors of drug transport 
(listed in Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348.

15.4. Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_773441], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added); 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed prima rily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subjects, including 
those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject 's best interest when providing 
medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
[ADDRESS_773442], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post- study access by [CONTACT_587477].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This co mmittee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norm s and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any SAE s. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_62383]. Research on subjects or healthy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects 
[ADDRESS_773443]'s freely-given informed consent, 
preferably in writi ng. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations 
where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done 
only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
[ADDRESS_773444]'s dissent 
should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subject s, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent ha ve been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy 
of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative 
and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that 
the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research s tudy will not 
adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.  
[ADDRESS_773445] current proven intervention, except in the following 
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or s afety of an intervention and the 
subject s who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, subject s entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or 
benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the subject  which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a subject  to participate in a study or the subject 's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a subject , where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject  or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, m ade publicly available.

This study will be conducted at multiple  study centers. 
Phase of D evelopment: 2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG -348 administration in patients  with 
pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK Deficiency ). 
Secondary:  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG -348 and the metabolite AGI -8702. 
• Evaluate the pharmacodynamic ( PD) response of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 
2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3- DPG) after administration of AG -348. 
• Evaluate indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 in patients with PK Deficiency , including changes 
in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), reticulocyte count, haptoglobin (Hp), carboxyhemoglobin 
(COHb ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total and indirect bilirubin, erythropoietin  (EPO) , ferritin, 
and transferrin saturation  (serum iron/iron binding c apacity) . 
Methodology: 
Study AG348-C-[ADDRESS_773447] dose of s tudy drug. Patients with toxicity 
suspected to be related to study drug will continue follow-up until the adverse event (AE) resolves, is 
declared chronic by [CONTACT_737], or the patient is lost to follow-up.

Initially, up to 2 5 patients will be randomized on a n open -label  1:1 basis to  each of two twice -daily 
(BID) doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients  total; see Figure  1, Study Schema). The dose of Arm  1 is 
300 mg of A G-348 administered orally every 12  hours (q12h, BID). The dose of Arm 2 is 50 mg of 
AG-348 administered orally q12h (BID). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587478] d ose arms for the specific mutations expected to be 
most frequently enrolled. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 4  levels ( R510Q, 
R486W , and  R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Mutation status is defined by [CONTACT_587405]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned 
based on Sponsor’s discretion.  
The doses for each arm have been selected from the forerunner AG348-C-001 single ascending dose 
(SAD) and AG348 -C-002 multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy adult volunteers to 
represent the range of doses/exposures that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near-maximal PD effects on 2,3- DPG and ATP . 
Because PK Deficiency is a rare disease with a limited eligible patient population and because the 
underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of affected patients is heterogenous due to the wide 
variety of mutations in PKR that cause the disease, it is important to focus closely on dose findings in 
this first- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this study with 2 different doses of AG-348 
administered q12h, a Data Review Team (DRT) will be establi shed to review study data on a regular 
basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG-348. 
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately every  
6 weeks), or ad hoc , as necessary, to review AEs, vital signs (VS), clinical laboratory (hemat ology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms ( ECG s) on enrolled patients. 
The DRT  will also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from 
baseline in Hb). The DRT will be comprised of  the study Coordinating Investigator, treating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor,  Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.   
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773448] patient is dosed or ad hoc as necessary, 
the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data , and clinical activity data . Based on 
the DR T’s recurring 6  week reviews, the DRT may exercise one or more of the following options: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm 3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; the dose for 
Arm 3 may  be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not exceed 360 mg q12h; 
and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enrollment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 and/or Arm 2 
(and/or potential Arm  3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or suspended to allow 
further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, p oor PD response, or lack of 
signs of clinical activity . 
• Re-assign patients ’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their 
original ar m, i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose dose and

schedule is being adopted.  
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure 
representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinic al relevance.  
The DRT  will perform these evaluations on a recurring 6 -week basis. The data that the DRT  will review 
to make these decision s is expected to  include, but are  not necessarily limited to, the  following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECG;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP; 
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb, 
LDH, EPO, total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773449] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID 
dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule  in a potential third dosing arm will be  
determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will monitor the data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a decision to terminate 
enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical 
activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined as ≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at 
least possibly related to AG -348, with the exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, 
vomiting, and/or diarr hea that is transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to 
≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it 
observes a frequency of Grade 2 AEs that would make it difficult to su pport long-term dosing. 
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing arm. Randomization 
and stratification will cease in the event that only a single arm is left enrolling.  
Depending on possible early termination of [ADDRESS_773450] arm, 
the study could enroll up to a maximum of  75 patients .

Monitoring of AEs, including determination of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and AEs leading to 
discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation); physical 
examination findings; VS; and 12- lead ECGs . Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE, Version 
4.03. Serum sex hormone levels (test osterone, estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (serum N-
terminal telopeptide [NTX] and serum C- terminal telopeptide [CTX]), total cholesterol, high -density 
lipoprotein -C (HDL -C), and triglycerides will be monitored for evidence of potential inhibition of 
aromatase by [CONTACT_147248] -348 
Indicators of Clinical Activity :

compartmental methods based on observed plasma AG -348 and AGI -8702 concentrations.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives),  
 
. Approximately 
the first [ADDRESS_773463] dose and the morning Day 15 dose, and additional trough levels of ATP and 2,3- DPG 
will be obtained. A denosine triphosphate and 2,3 DPG will be analyzed using qualified assays to 
determine concentrations in whole blood. P harmacodynamic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 will be 
computed based on observed whole blood ATP and 2,3-DPG concentrations.  
Statistical methods : 
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24  weeks of 
AG-348 in patients with  PK Deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primar ily descriptive in nature; no 
formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conducted separately within each dose 
arm, or pooled when appropriate. 
Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and demograp hic data 
including genotype, safety measurements, PK, PD parameters and indicators of clinical activity. Data 
from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled across all dose groups where 
appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_587483]. Categorical variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation [SD ], median, minimum, and maximum). 
Populations for analysis will include a Safety Analysis Set , a PK Analysis Set, and an Efficacy Analysis 
Set. The Safety Analysis set will include all patients who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment; this population will be the primary set for the an alysis of safety data and the default analysis 
set for all data analyses unless otherwise stated. Patients will be classified according to treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or  
as the first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . The PK Analysis Set will include 
all patients in the Safety Analysis Set with sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773464] 50% compliance with their

performed on subsets of patients with other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity 
and/or duration of dosing. The Efficacy Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients will be classified according to assigned treatment.  
 
 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_92869] (SOC), pr eferred term (PT), CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action 
taken with study drug, and relationship to study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summarie s will be 
produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_587463]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings 
will be provided for any deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events 
that are considered treatment- emergent, where treatment- emergent is defined as any AE with onset 
beginning at the day of first administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period unti l [ADDRESS_773466] dose of study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or 
was subsequently considered drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline 
relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for selected laboratory parameters 
based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  Where applicable CTCAE terms do 
not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower limits of normal will be used to classify the 
results.  
Electrocardiogram  analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal and 
clinically significant ECG results. Actual values and changes from baseline in PR, QRS, QTc intervals 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_587416].  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications 
prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587417]. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 and the 
metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire population. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation %, median, min imum, and maximum, geometric mean, 
and geometric coefficient of variation.   
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize P harmacodynamic parameters for 2,3- DPG and ATP for 
each dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. Pharmacodynamic parameters will be 
summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, 
minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %. 
Analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriate  graphic displays and statistical analyses to

actual values and change from baseline using appropriate descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, min 
and max) as described above.  
Analyses evaluating indicators of potential clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773467] bilirubin, EPO, 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation (serum iron/iron binding capacity). Characterization of Hb  response 
(e.g., % of patients whose Hb increases by a certain amount), as well as time to Hb response, and duration of Hb response will be explored, among others. 
Interim Review  
No formal statistical analysis will be conducted. Sa fety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_587335] , who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity data at regular intervals 
(approximately every 6 weeks)  throughout the duration of the study. The composition of the DRT , its 
meeting schedule, the data to be reviewed , and the decisions it is empowered to make have been 
described previously. 
Additional interim reviews of data may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current 
clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety concerns.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency ( PK Deficiency ) is a glycolytic enzymopathy that results in non-
spherocytic hemolytic anemia with a variable clin ical presentation, ranging from mild or fully 
compensated forms to life -threatening neonatal anemia and life- long chronic hemolytic anemia 
associated with severe, debilitating co -morbidities. PK Deficiency  is caused by [CONTACT_587464], which res ults in defective pyruvate kinase isoform R (PKR) in the red blood cell 
(RBC) . As shown in the diagram below, PKR catalyzes the final and irreversible step in 
glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, and formation of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. PKR is thus a key enzyme 
for maintaining energy homeostasis in erythrocytes, and it has been proposed that ATP levels are 
critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity  (van Wijk and van Solinge 2005).  
Figure  2: Red Cell Glycolysis  
 
Abbreviations:  1,3 DPG = 1,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 2,3 DPG = 2,3 diphosphoglycerate ; 3-PG = 3 -phosphoglycerate; 
ADP = adenosine diphosphate ; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; FBP = fructose 1,6 -bisphosphate; PEP = 
phosphoenolpyruvate; PKR = red blood cell -specific form of pyruvate kinase  
Note: Not all steps in glycolysis are shown.  
The majority of mutations in PKR that have been described have a deleterious effect on PKR 
catalytic activity, protein stability, and/or protein expression. PK Deficiency  is associated with 
reduced RBC survival as well as impaired red cell maturation. Mature erythrocytes lack 
mitochondria relying predominantly on glycol ysis to generate ATP. It is hypothesized that 
insufficient energy production promotes erythrocyte hemolysis due to impaired maintenance of cellular membrane homeostasis.  
PK Deficiency  is an autosomal recessive disease, in which both homozygotes and compound 
heterozygotes develop hemolytic anemia. More than [ADDRESS_773473] been identified in patients with PK Deficiency  to date, and the majority of these mutations 
are single nucleotide missense mutations  (Zanella, et al. 2005 ). The prevalence of PK 
Deficiency , based on the most common pyruvate kinase mutation in Southern Europe, is 
estimated at 51 cases per million in the Caucasian population  (Beutler and Gelbart 2000). 
Some patients with PK Deficiency  have a clinically severe disease course that can present as a 
severe hemolytic anemia in early infancy, requiring immediate care which typi[INVESTIGATOR_587254] ( Christensen, et al. 2011 ; Ghidini, et al. 1991; Hennekam, et al. 1990). 
Infants with PK Deficiency  may have erythroblastosis fetalis with hepatosplenomegaly, 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, and severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is as sociated  with a 
high risk of kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia associated with the hemolytic state often requires

supportive treatment with intensive phototherapy. For other infants, the hyperbilirubinemia 
caused by [CONTACT_587354] , as well as supportive transfusion to keep 
their hematocrit (HCT) levels  >60%. 
Adults with PK Deficiency  are reported to have life-long hemolysis and the subsequent 
associated co -morbidities including anemia and transfusion dependence. Other co- morbiditie s 
include f requent miscarriages, aplastic crises, as well as symptoms associated with an acute on 
chronic hemolytic anemia ( Rider, et al. 2011 ). Since unconjugated bilirubin is often chronically 
elevated, pi[INVESTIGATOR_587255]. Severe and sometimes life-
threatening iron deposition occurs and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_587256]. 
The current therapeutic options for patients with PK Deficiency  are supportive. Most require life -
long treatment, including blood transfusions at a frequency depending on the disease state. Long-
term surveillance for systemic iron overload, even in transfusion-independent patients, is 
standard as is the use of chelation therapy. Case reports of cure by [CONTACT_587355] ( Tanphaichitr, et al. 2000) but have been infrequently performed. 
Splenectomy, while not curative, can reduce the need for supportive blood transfusions and decrease bilirubin levels in some patients. However, this intervention is associated with significant morbidity including infection risk, and possible increased risk of thrombosis. 
5.2. AG-[ADDRESS_773474] activity and normalizes red cell 
metabolism in vivo . Biochemical experiments demonstrate that AG -348 is a potent, pan- activator 
of many PKR alleles associated with PK Deficiency . PK Deficiency  red cells and their 
progenitors are characterized by [CONTACT_587484], 
including a build-up of PEP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and lowered ATP levels. 
Treatment of PK Deficiency  patient red cells ex vivo with AG-[ADDRESS_773475] wild type (WT) PKR enzymes and ex vivo  studies in 
blood from mice, monkeys and humans indicate that AG- [ADDRESS_773476] the underlying p athology of PK Deficiency  and, importantly, provide clinical 
benefit to patients.  
5.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A series of exploratory pharmacology studies were conducted to characterize the ability of AG-348 to activate WT PKR and anemia- associated PKR mut ants (mPKR) in vitro , ex vivo , and 
in vivo . Additional details regarding nonclinical data can be found in the AG-348 Investigator’s 
Brochure

AG-[ADDRESS_773477] 
markers was evaluated in human RBCs. AG -348 dose-response curves in human whole blood 
showed potent activation of PKR, while AGI-8702 is a weak activator of the PKR enzyme . In 
whole blood from  mice treated with AG -348, 13C-glucose labeling through the PKR reaction was 
increased by 80% demonstrating AG -348- mediated  activation of the WT PKR enzyme. AG-[ADDRESS_773478] ATP consistent with activation of PKR.  
The effects of AG -348 on PKR activity and RBC metabolism also were assessed in blood 
samples from patients with PK Deficiency . AG-348 activated PKR and induced metabolic 
changes (increased ATP levels and decreased 2,3- DPG levels) consistent with increased 
glycolytic pathway activity in RBCs from PK Deficiency  patients with different mutations in the 
PKR enzyme.  
Assessments of binding inhibition potential and enzymatic activity were evaluated in a panel of 
[ADDRESS_773479]/inverse agonist and an aromatase inhibitor, no effects of histamine H3 modulation have been observed in 
safety pharmacology or toxicology studies. Effects consistent with arom atase inhibition were 
seen in toxicology studies ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that neither AG -348 nor AGI -8702 exhibited 
significant inhibition of the human ether-à- go-go related gene (hERG) current ( concentration of 
drug that achieved half -maximal inhibition  [IC
50] 29.4 μM and > 10 μM, respectively). 
Additionally, in the monkey cardiovascular ( CV) study, no CV effects were seen at any dose 
level. No effects were seen in AG -348 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)- compliant Irwin and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_587289]- Dawley rats.  AG-348 administered via oral 
gavage had a dose -dependent emetic activity in the ferret at ≥ 30 mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of AG-348 were performed 
in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) routes were evaluated at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mg/kg. A dose of 200 mg (50 mg/kg) 
was administered PO in the food-effect evaluation in monkeys. The PK of AG-348 in animal 
species is characterized by [CONTACT_587357], medium to high total body plasma clearance 
(CLp), and high volume of distribution at steady- state (V
ss) in rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
AG-348 has a medium to long a pparent terminal half -life (t1/2) in the rat, dog, and monkey. 
Medium to high oral bioavailability (F) was observed for AG-348 in animals. A high- fat diet led 
to lower oral absorption of AG-348 in monkeys.

Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
AG-348 showed low brain penetration in rats (brain/plasma ratio of 5.7% to 9.1%) based on area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0 24hr) following 
single and repeated -dose administration, respectively. M etabolism appears to be the major 
elimination pathway for AG -[ADDRESS_773480] inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation). There was no direct inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation) by [CONTACT_147248]-348. There was evidence of metabolism -dependent inhibition of CYP2C19 (largely reversible) and CYP3A4 
(largely irreversible) by [CONTACT_147248] -348. AG-[ADDRESS_773481] inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. AG-348 has the 
potential to cause an induction- related drug -drug interaction (DDI) with sensitive CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 substrates. 
The routes of metabolism for AG-348 are via multiple CYPs with CYP3A4 contributi ng > 70% 
of the total. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C8 contribute approximately 6%, 10%, and 7% to the 
remaining metabolism of AG -348; other isoforms contribute < 4% each.  
AG-348 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P- gp), but not breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP). 
AG-348 is an inhibitor of P-gp (91% and 99% inhibition at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but does not inhibit BCRP. AGI-8702 is not an inhibitor of P-gp or BCRP under the concentrations 
tested (5 and 100 μM). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology 
In rats, the no-observed- effect level/no -observed -adverse- effect level (NOEL/NOAEL), 
determined as 2000 mg/kg, was associated with area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC
0-12hr) values 223- to 526-fold the projected human efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In dogs, clinical observations consistent with anaphylactoid reactions were seen, 
and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 62.5 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC
0-12hr value 5.7-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The NOEL/NOAEL in dogs 
was 10 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 0.8-fold the projected efficacious 
AUC 0-12hr value. In monkeys, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, with only non- adverse emesis and 
body weight loss seen; this dose was associated with an AUC 0-12hr value 70-fold the projected 
efficacious AUC [ADDRESS_773482] appropriate species for further evaluation in toxicology studies.  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) in cynomolg us monkeys was defined in non- GLP 5 -day and 
14-day repeat -dose studies as emesis , inappetence, and weight loss. These toxicities became dose 
limiting at AUC 0-12hr values 27- to 34-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and 
precluded meaningful eva luation of other toxicities at this exposure level. Potential other effec ts 
at this exposure level were observed in  a number hematology and serum chemistry parameters as 
well as in lymphoid organs. Additionally, minimal potential effects in kidneys (renal 
27 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
tubulointerstitial nephritis) and heart (myocardial degeneration), which could not be 
differentiated from spontaneous background lesions, were seen when monkeys were exposed to 
AG-348 AUC 0-12hr values ≥ 27- to 34-fold the projected human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value.  
In GLP -compliant 28-day monkey study, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (75 mg/kg/dose twice daily 
[BID] ) was  the NOAEL. Effects were limited to increased liver weights without serum chemistry 
or microscopic correlate. At this dosage level, the Day 27 AUC 0-12hr values were 8.9 - and 
8.5-fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females respectively. In the same 
study, the low dosage of 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose) resulted in AUC 0-12hr values that 
approximated the efficacious AUC 0-12hr value, and there were no test article- related effects seen. 
The next highest dose of 50 mg/kg/day (25 mg/kg/dose) was the NOEL and was associated with 
AUC 0-12hr values 3.1- and 2.6- fold the projected efficacious AUC 0-12hr value in males and females 
respect ively.   
In the GLP-compliant 28-day rat study, the NOAEL in males was the highest dose tested, 600 mg/kg/day (300 mg/kg/dose), and the NOAEL  in females was the lowest dose tested, 
20 mg/kg/day (10  mg/kg/dose). At the 600 mg/kg/day dosage level in males, AG-348- related 
findings were limited to mild effects on hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters, and microscopic findings in the adrenal gland (minimal to mild vacuolation of the adrenal zona 
glomerulosa and decreased thickness of the zona fas ciculate), liver (minimal to mild 
hepatocellular hypertrophy), kidney (minimal tubular vacuolation), pancreas (minimal to 
moderate decreased zymogen granules), heart (minimal myocardial vacuolation), and prostate 
(minimal to mild decreased secretion). All findings were fully reversible over the 14- day 
recovery period with the exception of decreased serum glucose levels and decreased prostate 
secretion. In females, the highest dosage tested was 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/dose) ; adverse 
effects observed were si milar to those observed in the 600 mg/kg/day males, with the exception 
that in females, fewer effects in hematology and serum chemistry parameters were seen, and also in females, adverse effects in the reproductive organs consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
observed.  
In the 13- week repeat -dose rat study, adverse effects in males were identified in the testes and 
consisted of seminiferous tubular degeneration, spermatid retention, and Leydig cell 
hypertrophy. These effects were defined as adverse at d ose levels at which they are expected to 
impair fertility. These effects were either not present or present with incidence and severity 
similar to that of the vehicle group  in lower dose levels. Adve rse effects in females included 
uterine atrophy and increased folding of the luminal surface ; these effects were defined as 
adverse at the dose level at which they ar e expected to impair fertility   
In the 13- week repeat -dose study in monkeys, no adverse effects were identified, and no new 
effects were identified  when compared to the 4- week repeat -dose study. Similar to what occurred 
on the 4-week study, inappetence and emesis during the initial 1-2 weeks of dosing occurred, 
precluding evaluation of higher doses.  
AG-348 inhibits human aromatase activity with an IC
50 of 2050 nM (based on human placental 
microsomes) and rat aromatase with an IC50 of 493 nM (based on rat ovarian microsomes). In the 
GLP -compliant 28- day rat study, histologic effects consistent with aromatase inhibition were 
seen in the female reproductive tract at the mid - and high-dosage levels (100 and 200 mg/kg/day)  
and included incomplete corpora lutea; ovarian follicular cysts; ovarian cystic, luteinized 
follicles; uterine atrophy; vaginal mucification; and altered cyclicity. A lthough these findings 
28

were minimal to mild and were fully reversible  (over 14 days), they were considered adverse and 
the next lower dosage evaluated, 20 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg/dose BID) was the NOAEL in 
females. The Day 27 AUC 0-12hr value associated with this dosage level was 6.9-fold the projected 
human efficacious AUC 0-12hr value. The potential for aromatase inhibition effects occurring in 
female rats at AUC 0-12hr values > 6.9-fold and < [ADDRESS_773483] been exposed to AG-348 in 2 clinical studies , a single  
ascending dose (SAD) study and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, with 31 of these subjects exposed to a single AG-348 dose under fasted conditions; 5 exposed to 2 doses of 
AG-348 under fasted and fed conditions; and [ADDRESS_773484] clinical trial in which patients with PK Deficiency will be treated with 
AG-348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic s 
The PK of AG-348 showed low to moderate variability between subjects. After single doses of 
AG-348 from  30 to 2500 mg, AG-348 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587318] (T max). There appeared to be some lengthening of the period of 
absorption at higher doses as indicated by [CONTACT_5852] T max and a less than proportional increase in 
maximum concentration (C max). Dose -normalized area under the curve ( AUC ) generally 
remained constant over the dose range studied, suggesting that AG-348 total exposure increased 
in a dose-proportional manner. The mean t 1/2 ranged from 17.8 to 20.4 hours when samples were 
collected thro ugh 72 hours and from 50.3 to 79.3 when samples were collected through 
120 hours. However, this terminal elimination phase contributed little to overall exposure of AG-348, as indicated by [CONTACT_587420]
0-12 and area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), suggesting a shorter effective half -
life of approximately 3 to 6 hours. AG-348 was extensively distributed (mean apparent volume 
of distribution [V z/F] range of 271 to 1148 L) and had a moderate rate of clearance (geometric 
mean clearance [CL/F] range of 10.3 to 13.9 L/hr). The fraction of AG-34 8 excreted in urine 
ranged from 0.0145 to 0.0209 across the dose levels suggesting that renal excretion plays a minor role in the systemic elimination of A G-348. 
The preliminary repeat -dose PK of AG-348 at doses ranging from 15 mg every 12 hours (q12h) 
to [ADDRESS_773485] dose. AG -348 exposure observed after repeated dosing for 14 days at doses of

120 mg every 24 hours (q24h) to [ADDRESS_773486] was greater at higher doses ; lower doses of [ADDRESS_773487] US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) high fat meal, showed that food likely has a minimal effect on the PK of AG -348. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
After a single dose of AG -348, a decrease in the concentration of 2,3- DPG was observed at 
[ADDRESS_773488]-dose . The mean decrease 
at 24 hours was approximately 300 µg/mL at the [ADDRESS_773489] dose; the concentration of ATP was increased on Day [ADDRESS_773490] dose on 
Day 14. The magnitude of the increase in  ATP was similar across the dose range from 60 mg 
BID to 700 mg BID. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Overall, AG -348 has been well- tolerated among healthy volunteers.  
After a single AG -348 dose, treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by > [ADDRESS_773491] 
at any time on study  (either under fasted or fed conditions) included nausea (14%), headache 
(14%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_587334] (each 6%). After repeated dosing of 
AG-348 for 14 days, based on blinded data, TEAEs that occurred in > [ADDRESS_773492] to the incidence of gastrointestinal events, 
primarily nausea and vomiting, with the incidence of such events increasing with increasing 
dose. Nausea and/or vomiting were observed only at doses ≥ 1400 mg in the single  dose study 
and only at doses ≥ 700 BID in the MAD  study. Nausea and vomiting were not observed at any 
dose ≤ 360 mg in either the single or multiple dose studies. 
All but 1 TEAE reported to date has been mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. The only 
Grade 3 TEAE was elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ; aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ) in a single subject in the MAD study treated with [ADDRESS_773493] received (AG -348 versus  placebo) remains 
[ADDRESS_773494] 
discontinued in the SAD study due to an adverse event (AE).  Four subjects, at doses of [ADDRESS_773495] 
discontinued for a cutaneous rash. 
No deaths or other serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported in any clinical study of 
AG-348. Furthermore, no DLTs  have been  declared  after a single administration of AG -348 at 
doses of 30 mg to 2500 mg or after repeat administration of AG-348 for 14 days at daily doses of 120 mg to 1400 mg (although the event of Grade [ADDRESS_773496]’s treatment assignment is 
unblinded). 
Due to preclinical observations pertaining to the potential for inhibition of the aromatase enzyme 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the AG348-C-[ADDRESS_773497] study that will be conducted in patients with PK Defic iency . This 
study is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and potential indicators of 
clinical activity of AG -348 administered for up to 24 weeks . This study will also evaluate the PK  
profile of AG-348 and its metabolite AGI-8702, the P D responses in ATP and 2,3- DPG 
following administration of AG -348, and the clinical activity of AG -348 in PK Deficiency 
patients . Two previous double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials of AG -348 conducted in 
healthy adult male and female volunteers (AG348-C-001, a SAD study ; and AG348-C-002, a 
MAD study ) have established an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for AG -348 for up to 
14 days of both once-daily (QD) and BID dosing at exposures that result in significant 
pharmacodynamic ( PD) changes in whole blood levels of t he glycolytic metabolites 2,[ADDRESS_773498] 
of transfusion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_587290]. The safety, tolerability, and PK/PD findings in this study w ill form the basis for 
subsequent clinical development of AG-348. 
5.3.1. Summary of Overall Safety Management Plan 
Measures to  minimize the risks to patients enrolled in this study have been taken with respect to 
the following study design elements: 
31 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
• The initial d oses for Arms [ADDRESS_773499] been selected on the basis of safety and 
tolerability observations already carefully made in two predecessor clinical trials in 
adult healthy male and female volunteers;  
• The specified inclusion/exclusion criteria have been caref ully considered to avoid 
enrollment of subjects for whom exposure to the study drug might pose a hazard; 
• A designated Data Review  Team ( DRT) consisting of the overall study Coordinating 
Investigator, treating Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharma cologist, 
Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer has been established to meet 
regularly a t approximately 6-week intervals throughout the duration of the study to 
review the accumulating study data and will exercise options to suspend enrol lment to 
one or both of the initial two study dose arms, discontinue enrollment to one or both of the initial two study dose arms, adjust the dose of patients in one or both of the 
initial two study arms, and/or implement one new study dose arm. If one new dosing 
arm is implemented, the dose selected will not exceed [ADDRESS_773500] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day multiple BID dosing 
study in healthy volunteers. Group cohort stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587314] (CTCAEv4.03 grade) and frequency of AEs  are 
defined;  
• Dose modification and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587291]; 
• Guidance for permitted, prohibited, and cautionary concomitant medications is specified bas ed on the estimated potential for drug- drug interactions from hepatic 
cytochrome enzyme interactions with AG -348.

6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
6.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to : 
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of AG-348 administration in 
patient s with PK Deficiency . 
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are to : 
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG-348 and the metabolite AGI-8702. 
• Evaluate the PD response of ATP  and 2,3- DPG after ad ministration of AG -348. 
• Evaluate indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 in patient s with PK Deficiency , 
including changes in hemoglobin (Hb), HCT , reticulocyte count, haptoglobin (Hp), 
carboxyhemoglobin ( COHb ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total and indirect 
bilirubin, erythropoietin (EPO) , ferritin, and transferrin saturation (serum iron/iron 
binding capacity ). 
6.4. Study Measures and Endpoints  
6.4.1. Safety Measures and Endpoints  
Safety will be evaluated by:  
• Monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs  and AEs leading to 
discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, 
coagulation); physical examination findings; vital signs  (VS); and 12 lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Adverse events will be graded using Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03. Serum sex hormone levels (testosterone, estrone, and estradiol), bone turnover markers (serum N- terminal 
telopeptide [NTX] and serum C- terminal telopeptide [CTX]), total cholesterol, high -
density lipoprotein- C (HDL -C), and triglycerides will be monitored for evidence of 
potential inhibition of aromatase by [CONTACT_147248] -348. 
33 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
6.4.2. Clinical Activity Measures and Endpo ints 
• Monitoring of potential indicators of clinical activity will include evaluating change s 
in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, COHb,  LDH, total and indirect bilirubin, EPO , 
ferritin, and transferrin saturation. 
6.4.3. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints  
The PK and PD profile of AG-348 will be evaluated by: 
• Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773501] non-compartmental methods based on 
observed plasma AG-348 and AGI- 8702 concentrations . 
• Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP (secondary objectives), 
 
 
Approximately the first [ADDRESS_773502] to follow -up. 
Initially, up to 25 patients  will be randomized on an open- label,  1:1 basis to each of two BID 
doses of AG-348 (up to 50 patients; see Figure  3, Study Schema) . The dose of Arm 1 is 300 mg 
of AG -348 administered orally q12h (BI D). The dose of Arm  2 is 50 mg o f AG-348 
administered orally q12h (BID) for [ADDRESS_773503] of 
4 levels ( R510Q, R486W, and R479H ) and all other mutations (“other”).  Mutation status is 
defined by [CONTACT_587424]; patients with more than one stratified mutation will be assigned based on Sponsor’s discretion. 
The doses for each arm have been selected from the forerunner AG348-C-001 SAD study and 
AG348 -C-002 MAD studies in healthy adult volunteers to represent the range of doses/exposures 
that were safely tolerated and resulted in maximal or near maximal PD effects on 2,[ADDRESS_773504]- in-patient study. Therefore, in addition to initiating this 
study with 2 different doses of AG-348 administered q12h, a DRT  will be established to review 
study data on a frequent basis and adapt the study design, dose and schedule of AG- 348 as 
indicated .  
The DRT  will monitor safety on an on- going basis and meet at regular intervals (approximately 
every 6 weeks) , or ad hoc as necessary,  to review AEs, VS , clinical laboratory (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs  on enrolled patients. The DR T will 
also review available PK/PD data and indicators of clinical activity (e.g., changes from baseline in Hb). The DRT  will be comprised of the study Coordinating Inves tigator, treating 
Investigators, Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist, Statistician, and Sponsor’s Responsible 
Medical Officer.  
Approximately every [ADDRESS_773505] patient is doses or ad hoc as 
necessary, the DRT  will review cumulative safety  data, available PK/PD data, and clinical 
35 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
activity data . Based on the DRT ’s recurring 6 -week reviews , the DRT  may exercise one or more 
of the following options: 
• Continue treatment and enrollment in existing arms without change. 
• Add 1 new dose arm (Arm  3) to enroll up to 25 patients at a dose to be determined; 
the dose for Arm 3 may be lower or higher than Arm 1 and Arm 2 doses, but will not 
exceed 360  mg q12h; and the dose regimen may be less frequent than q12h. 
• Terminate or suspend enroll ment to allow further review of clinical data in Arm 1 
and/or Arm 2 (and/or potential Arm 3). Enrollment in an arm could be terminated or 
suspended to allow further review, for example, for unacceptable safety/tolerability, poor PD response, or lack of sig ns of clinical activity.  
• Re-assign patient’s doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and 
schedule of another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their original arm, i.e., they will not count to wards the enrollment 
quota of the arm whose dose and schedule is being adopted. 
• Implement specific genotype restrictions to enrollment in one or more arms to ensure representation of patients with genotypes of greatest clinical relevance.  
The DRT  will perf orm these evaluations on a recurring 6 -week basis. The data that the DRT  will 
review to make these decisions is expected to include, but are not necessarily limited to, the 
following:  
• Safety Observations:  all AEs ; VS, clinical laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis), and ECGs ;  
• PK and PD Observations:  including changes in 2,3- DPG and ATP;  
• Indicators of Clinical Activity:  including changes in Hb, HCT, reticulocyte count, Hp, 
COHb,  LDH, EPO , total and indirect bilirubin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.  
If a third dose arm is implemented, the dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773506] dose that demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerance in the 14 -day 
multiple BID dosing study in healthy volunteers. The PK/PD sampling schedule in a potential third dosing arm will be determined by [CONTACT_2728]’s discretion and may follow either the extensive or limited PK/PD sampling schedules as specified.  
The DRT  will mo nitor the safety data in an ongoing manner as described and may make a 
decision to terminate enrollment in an arm if unacceptable AEs are observed, PD activity is limited, and/or markers of clinical activity indicate no effect. Unacceptable AEs are defined  as 
≥ Grade 3 AEs (using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAEv4.03]) that are assessed as at least possibly related to AG -348, with the 
exception of Grade 3 headache, hot flash/flushing, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is 
transient in duration (< 24 hours) or able to be medically managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours. 
The DRT  may also exercise discretion to terminate enrollment in an arm if it observes a 
frequency of Grade  2 AEs that would make it difficu lt to support long- term dosing.  
As the number of enrolling arms changes in the study (for example, from 2 to 3), the randomization scheme will adjust to enable balanced randomization into each actively accruing 
[ADDRESS_773507] arm, the study could enroll up to a maximum of 75 patients.

The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of an 
individual patient’s dose of AG-[ADDRESS_773508] dose of study treatment. During 
the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baselin e (Day 1), weekly through Week 3 
(Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 12), and 
monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 1 6, 20, and 24). Patients who safely tolerate AG [ADDRESS_773509] not to enter the extension trial, study 
discharge will occur 4 weeks (Week 2 8 or earlier) following the last dose of study treatment at 
the final follow -up assessment.  
Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, including determination of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation; safety laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies, and urinalysis ); physical examination findings; VS; and 12 lead ECGs. 
37 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
Additional safety assessments will include monitoring of sex hormone levels (testosterone [total 
and free], estrone, and estradiol), and bone turnover markers ( NTX and CTX). Follow-up 
assessments w ill be conducted on Day 197 (Week 28) and will include physical examination, 
weight, performanc e status, VS, 12-lead ECGs , laboratory evaluations (hematology, Hp, EPO 
levels, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis; lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hormonal testing), AEs, and 
transfusion record.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will include serial blood sampling for PK  profiles of AG -348 and 
its metabolite AGI -8702. Pharmacodynamic evaluations will include serial blood sampling for 
determination of levels of ATP and 2,3 DPG. Extensive PK/PD sampling will be conducted on 
the first approximately 1 0 patients total treated in Arms 1 and 2 (see Appendix 15.1, Table 5) 
while  more limited PK/PD sampling will be conducted on additional patients treated if 
enrollment in Arm 1 or Arm  2 is expanded or if an alternate dosing arm is added (see 
Appendix 15.1, T able 6).   
 
 
 
 
7.2. Justification of the Study Design  
The primary and secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK 
and PD, and indicators of clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773510] 
safely tolerated dose ( Arm 1: 300 mg BID)  and the lowest dose with potentially relevant PD 
activity (Arm 2 : 50 mg BID ) from the forerunner AG348-C-002 MA D study in healthy 
volunteers. Decisions regarding continuing enrollment and treatment in these initial dose arms 
and/or implementation of an additional dose arm  will be based on DRT review of safety , PK and 
PD data, and indicators of clinical activity  collected from all patients treated in Arm [ADDRESS_773511] dose and schedule should the safety, tolerability, PK, and/or PD be different in patients 
with PK Deficiency compared with healthy volunteers.   
Additional safety measures intended to minimize risk to patients include monitoring of AEs by 
[CONTACT_587452] (potentially) large increases in Hb level (Section  9.7.1 and Section  9.7.2). Measures intended 
to maximize the opportunity for p atients with demonstrated safety and tolerability  to continue to 
derive benefit from any observed clinical activity of AG -[ADDRESS_773512] two different doses of the study drug to 
assess its PK  and PD profile s.  
Consistent with the design of many Phase 2 studies, preliminary evaluation of the potential PD 
and clinical activity of AG -348 are secondary objectives of this study . The latter will include 
assessments of the PK/PD relationship between AG-348 and the biomarkers ATP and 2,3- DPG, 
 
7.3. Rationale for the Starting Dose and Dose Range  
Prior to  execution of this study, Agios conducted two clinical studies of AG-348 in healthy 
volunteers, including a SAD study ( AG48-C-001) and a MAD (14 day q12h) study 
(AG348 -C-002). Available details of these studies are discussed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). Between these two studies, [ADDRESS_773513] been dosed with AG-348. In vitro  investigations, also reported in the IB, had previously demonstrated that 
AG-348 increased the activity of wild -type PKR approximately to the same extent as it did a 
series a recombinant mPKRs. Therefore it was deemed reasonable to study the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AG-348 in healthy subjects in a controlled P hase 1 setting as a more 
efficient means of obtaining information than in the actual rare disease population of patients with PK Deficiency.  
The MAD stu dy demonstrated that the exposures produced by [CONTACT_147248]-348 doses from 60 mg q12h 
to 360 mg q12h (including 120 mg q24h) resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) and ATP (increase from baseline). The exposure s 
resulting from doses less than [ADDRESS_773514] dose ranging study in patients with PK 
Deficiency were selected to be 300 mg q12h (Arm 1) and 50 mg q12h (Arm 2). These doses 
were demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in the healthy volunteer studies. The availability of 
ATP is proposed as being critical for optimally maintaining RBC membrane integrity (see Section  5.1). The dose ranges from 50 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h may result in clinically effective 
modulation of PKR in PK Deficiency patients if the mutated enzyme is responsive to AG -348 in 
a similar manner to the wild -type enzyme in healthy subjects. However, there are many different 
mutations in PKR that result in PK Deficiency, and these mutations produce variable effects on 
the enzyme in terms of catalytic activity and thermal stability. It is not known if different mutations will respond clinically in a similar manner to the same exposure to AG -348. 
Therefore, it is prudent to study the range of safe and pharmacod ynamically relevant doses as 
specified in this study, and to allow flexibility for the DRT  to analyze the evolving study data to 
adapt the dose and schedule of administration of AG-348 to produce the optimal combination of safety, tolerability, and PD,  and, potentially, clinical response. 
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
This study may be prematurely terminated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008], there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. In the event of such action, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to each Investigator.

8.4. Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_273900] (see Section  8.2 and Section  8.3, 
respectively) have been satisfied and that the pat ient is eligible for participation in this clinical 
study. The site will submit to the Sponsor an Eligibility form for each eligible patient and the Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first dose of 
AG-348. 
[ADDRESS_773525] been confirmed as eligible will be randomized in an equal ratio to a treatment 
arm (e.g., 1:1 or 1:1:1 depending on which arms are open). A randomization number will be 
assigned. The site will provide a request for randomization form (including the patient’s 
confirmed genotype) to a central randomization center. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_587485]. The PKR mutation stratification factor will consist of 
4 levels (R510Q, R486W, and R479H) and all other mutations (“other”). Since this is an open label study, randomization will not be blinded. 
Please refer to the study manual for the randomization procedure. 
8.6. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Patients may 
withdraw or be withdrawn from study-related procedures and treatments under the following conditions: 
• Withdrawal of consent; 
• Experiences unacceptable toxicity ; 
• Development of an intercurrent medical condition that precludes further participation 
in the trial; 
• Patient  requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication ( Section 9.11.2);  
• Investigator decision; 
• Protocol violation: non-adherence to protocol requirements; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Lost to follow-up. 
Should a patient  decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to  complete and report the protocol-
defined study observations up to the time of the patient’s withdrawal as completely as possible 
and to determine the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the Medical Monitor must be in formed. If 
there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the 
Investigator until satisfactory health is returned.  
When a patient  withdraws from the study, the primary reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of [ADDRESS_773526] 12 weeks of assigned dosing for 
reasons other than AEs  may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.

9. STUDY TREATMENT  
9.1. Description of Study Drug  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules will be provided as 25 mg  or 100 mg (free -base equivalent ) of 
AG-348 sulfate hydrate without excipi[INVESTIGATOR_587325] (25 mg) or white opaque (100 mg) 
gelatin capsules (size 2 capsules for all dose strengths).  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
study. All study drug products will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for further details regarding study drug.  
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
AG-348 sulfate hydrate capsules are packaged in white, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) induction sealed bottles with a child -resistant screw cap.  
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements . 
9.3. Study Drug Storage  
AG-[ADDRESS_773527] be stored at room temperature of 15 to 30° C 
(59 - 86 °F).  
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be dispensed 
only by [CONTACT_112628] a member of the staff specifically authorized by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment  
Up to a maximum of 25  patients will be randomized to any one of the dosing arms in this study. 
Randomization will be balanced 1:1 or 1:1:1, depending on whether 2 or potentially 3 arms are 
open, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_587469] (see Section  8.5). The dose and schedule of 
AG-348 each patient  receives will be dependent upon which dose arm  is open for enrollment 
when t he patient  qualifies for and is randomized into the study.  
9.5. Blinding  
This is an open-label study; no blinding methods will be used. 
9.6. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
For the initial two treatment arms, (Arm 1 and Arm 2), AG- 348 will be administered  orally BID 
(approximately every 12 hours with a minimum of 10 hours between doses ) over a 24 week 
treatment period . Starting with Day 1, dosing will be  continuous; there will be no rest periods. 
Patients  who do not meet any of the treatment withdrawal criteria (see Section  8.5) may continue 
treatment for the entire [ADDRESS_773528] relevant infor mation regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each 
daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses). 
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on return of unused drug and the dosing diary (see 
Section  9.9).  
Patients should be instructed to take their daily dose at approximately the s ame time s each day  
except for dosing on in- clinic visiting days.  
Patients who undergo exten sive PK/PD sampling (see Appendix 15.1, Table 5) should be 
instructed  from Week [ADDRESS_773529] the 
dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
Patients receiving limited PK/PD sampling (see Appendix 15.1, Table 6) should be instructed to 
bring the AM dose with them for all in -clinic visits  and to take the AM dose following PK/PD 
blood draws.  Patients receiving extensive PK/PD sampling on Day [ADDRESS_773530] limited PKPD on 
other visit days. As a general rule, regardless of extensive or limited schedule, patients will bring 
in the AM dose for all visits and take this dose following PK/PD blood draws.  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_773531] difficulty swallowing tablet(s), the 
Medical Moni tor should be contact[CONTACT_587376]. 
Patients will receive their first dose of AG  -348 in the clinic on Day 1 and then may take the 
remaining doses on an outpatient basis. 
9.7. Criteria for Dose Escalation, Dose Modification, or Discontinuation 
of Study Drug  
No intra- patient dose escalations will be permitted in this study  unless the DRT  decides to re -
assign patients’ doses and schedule in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of 
another arm of the study. In this case, the patients in the terminated arm will remain in their originally assigned arm; i.e., they will not count towards the enrollment quota of the arm whose 
dose and schedule is being adopted. All dosing modifications , as outlined below, will be 
implemented follow ing discussions with the Medical Monitor. 
9.7.1. Dose Modification for Safety 
The Investigator will monitor all patients for safety and tolerability. Modification of the patient’s dose of AG-348 will be based on AEs and observed changes in Hb levels (see Section  9.7.2).

Table 1: Dose Modification for Adverse Events Deemed at Least Possibly Related to 
AG-348 
Adverse Event s(s) AG-348 Dose Adjustment 
Grade 1  None required. 
Grade 2  None required; Investigator and Medical Monitor judgment to manage as for 
Grade 3. 
Grade 3  Suspend dosing;  
If event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of 
suspension, resume dosing with 1 dose level reduction (see Table  2 below ).  
If event does not resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_773532] of the Medical Monitor to permit subsequent re- escalation to the former  dose level. 
Dosing for an individual patient will be discontinued permanently for Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs 
that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within approximately 14 days of suspension of dosing, 
unless the benefits outweigh the risks of resuming t reatment and are approved by [CONTACT_22955]. No patients may be re- escalated to their former dose level after a dose modification 
without discussion with the Medical Monitor.   
It should be noted that if the initial dose of 300 mg q12h BID selected for Arm 1 demonstrates an 
unacceptable safety profile resulting in multiple subjects undergoing dose modifications, the 
DRT  may exercise its option to re -assign these patients’ dose and schedule to match the dose and 
schedule of another study arm (for exampl e, Arm 2 of the study, or to match the dose and 
schedule of a [potential]  Arm 3, if implemented ). 
9.7.2. Dose Modification for Increase in Hemoglobin Level  
It is presently unknown to what magnitude, how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or even whether, AG- [ADDRESS_773533] the dose of 
AG-348 as outlined in Table  2 per the following guidelines and with Medical Monitor approval. 
• Males: If Hb > 15 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test, suspend dosing until Hgb 
≤ 13.5 g/dL; then resume dosing with a 1 dose level reduction.  
• Females: If Hb > 13.5 g/dL  and confirmed with a second test , suspend dosing until 
Hb ≤ 12.5 g/dL; then resume with a 1 dose level reduction.

[CONTACT_1689] ( Section  9.7.1). Other reasons for treatment termination are provided in 
Section  8.5. 
9.8. Duration of Patient  Participation  
The duration of treatment for all patients on this study will be up to [ADDRESS_773534] relevant information 
regarding their study drug in the diary (e.g., confirmation that each daily dose was taken, reasons for missed doses) and return the diary at each study visit. 
9.10. Study Drug Acc ountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the clinical facility is the responsibility of the Investigator. 
The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a 
pharmacist or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], and return to Agios or 
its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_171032]). These records will adequately 
document that the patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from A gios. Accountability records will include dates, 
quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient numbers. An 
[ADDRESS_773535] not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
All unused and used study drug will be retained at the site until it is inventoried by [CONTACT_941] S tudy 
Monitor after database lock has occurred. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_587298], if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and documented. All material containing AG-[ADDRESS_773536] Follow- up Visit ( Week 28/Day 197) must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the source documentation and eCRF  along with dosage information, dates 
of administration, and reason for use.  
The following are prohibited at all times during participation in this study : 
• Investigational drugs must be discontinued [ADDRESS_773537] dose of study 
drug; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.3, 
Table 7) must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly induce CYP3A4  metabolism (listed in Appendix 15.3, 
Table 8) must be discontinued within 28 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Products known to strongly inhibit P- gp transport er (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 9) 
must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Digoxin must be discontinued within 5 days prior to Day 1 dosing; 
• Hematopoietic stimulating agents ( erythropoietins, granulocyte colony stimulating 
factors, thrombopoietins, etc) must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773538] dose of study drug. [Folic acid [ADDRESS_773539] be repleted to stability of the Hb and mean corpuscular volume  
(MCV) prior to enrollment in the study]; 
• Anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations, administered for anemia must be discontinued no less than [ADDRESS_773540] dose of study drug;  
51 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
• As the target population for this study consists of transfusion independent patients 
and transfusion of blood products could confound key endpoints of the study, blood 
transfusions of any type must be strictly avoided except in cases of compelling medical need. If medical circumstances permit, the Medical Monitor should be 
contact[CONTACT_587454] y transfusions are administered. 
• Other drugs that displace unconjugated bilirubin from albumin. 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 7) are not permitted for use with 
AG-348. Based on modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD 
study, moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not appear to pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and its own metabolism, 
presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with AG-348 is 
expected to reduce AG -348’s efficacy. Therefore, administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 8) is not permitted with AG -348.  
Strong inhibitors of drug transport (listed in Appendix 15.3, Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. 
Digoxin is not permitted for use with AG -348. 
Induction of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_147248]- [ADDRESS_773541] utilize barrier methods as per the 
Inclusion Criteria  14 (Section  8.2) while taking AG -348. 
The expected patient co -medications deferoxamine, deferasirox, and oral penicillin are not 
expected to interact with AG -348. 
9.11.3. Allowed Concomitant Therapy 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above are permitted during the study. All 
intercu rrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according to 
acceptable local standards of medical care. Subjects may receive analgesics, antiemetics, anti -
infectives (including penicillins), and antipyretics as medically indicated and consistent with the guidance in the previous two sections. Patients may continue iron chelation therapy with 
deferoxamine and deferasirox. Patients must continue taking [ADDRESS_773542] sun exposure. When exposure to sunlight is anticipated for longer than 15 minutes, the 
52 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
patient should be instructed to apply factor 30 or higher sunscreen to exposed areas and wear 
protective clothing and sunglasses. 
9.11.5. Management of Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea 
As the primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of up to 24 weeks of 
AG-348, routine use of prophylactic anti- emetic and antidiarrheal  or other classes of medications 
is prohibited. However, i f patients experience AEs relating to nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea these 
may be treated at the Investigator's clinical discretion with recommended medications as follows: 
• Nausea/vomiting: allowed agents include standard clinical dosing with palonosetron 
(Aloxi), dolasetron (Anzemet), or promethazine (Phenergen). Prom ethazine is a 
substrate for CYP 2B6, and it is presently unknown if the potential for 2B6 induction 
after AG -[ADDRESS_773543] of 
promethazine. Not recommended are aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend; CYP3A4 inhibitor), 
ondansetron (Zofran; CYP3A4 inducer), chlorpromazine (Thorazine; CYP3A4 
inducer), prochlorperazine (Compazine; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has 
been reported ), and granisetron (Kytril; CYP3A4 substrate, QT prolongation has been 
reported);  
• Diarrhea: recommended management includes standard clinical dosing with Kaopectate or other non- absorbable anti -diarrheals, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Lomotil), 
or loperamide (Imodium). Loperamide is the least prefer red choice because it is both 
a substrate and inhibitor for CYP3A4, a substrate for CYP2B6, and a substrate for P-gp. 
• For the use of any medications not specifically mentioned above the Investigator may 
confer with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
9.11.6. Other Rest rictions and Precautions  
Patients should be advised to refrain from altering their normal exercise routine for the first 
[ADDRESS_773544] of this is to enhance 
oxygen delivery at the tissue le vel, thus counteracting to some extent the physiologic 
consequences of the anemia. AG-348 was shown to produce rapid decreases (within the first 
12 hours following a single dose) in 2,3- DPG in two prior clinical trials with healthy adult male 
and female vo lunteers. In patients with PKD who have elevated 2,3- DPG levels , it is 
theoretically possible that decreases in 2,3- DPG that precede correction of the anemia could 
result in a temporary decrease of oxygen delivery at the tissue level resulting in clinical 
symptoms (e.g., increased fatigue).  
[ADDRESS_773545] dose of study 
treatment.   
During the Treatment period, patients will attend visits at baseline (Day 1), weekly through 
Week 3 (Days 8, 15, and 22), triweekly starting at Week 6 through Week 12 (Weeks 6, 9, and 
12) and monthly through Week 24 (Weeks 16, 20, and 24). Patients who saf ely tolerate and 
demonstrate one or more indicators of clinical activity of AG -348 through Week 24 may be 
eligible to immediately enter a separate extension study for continued treatment upon agreement of the treating Investigator and the Medical Monitor. For patients who finish  treatment, Study 
Discharge will occur 4 weeks (Week 28 or earlier) following the last dose of study treatment at 
the final follow -up assessment.  
Whenever more than one assessment is scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessmen ts 
should be performed in the order of least invasive to most invasive assessment (e.g., VS  first, 
ECG, blood draw). The timing of these assessments should allow the PK blood draw to occur at 
the exact nominal time. The order of procedures may be revised with prior discussion between 
Sponsor and Site. 
Minor adjustments to the timing , number of planned safety monitoring procedures (e.g., VS , 
ECG, blood draw), and PK/PD assessments may be made during the course of the study based on 
collected data to ensure a ppropriate safety monitoring and will not require a protocol 
amendment. These minor changes will require prior approval from the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor (or Responsible Medical Officer) as well as appropriate documentation in the study 
records. The addition of new safety monitoring procedures or other assessments will require a protocol amendment. 
10.2. Informed Consent and Confirmation of Eligibility  
A complete description of the study is to be presented to each potential patient  and a signed and 
dated informed consent is to be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed.  
Patient ’s eligibility will be confirmed at Screening and within 24  hours prior to study treatment 
dose. If a patient  is determined to be ineligible, the patient  will be exclud ed from participation. 
10.3. Demographic Data, Medical and Medication History  
Patient demographic data, including gender, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity, will be 
obtained at Screening. Collection of demographic data will be modified by [CONTACT_171053], as appropriate.  
Medication history, including all relev ant prior medical history and current medical conditions, 
will be obtained at the Screening assessment and on Day -1; all concomitant medications 
54 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
administered and procedures conducted within 28 days prior to Day 1 should be reported in the 
source documentation and eCRF . Investigators will be asked to provide information on the 
patient’s history of any medical diagnoses (e.g., iron overload) and surgical procedures (e.g., 
splenectomy, cholecystectomy) pertaining to their diagnosis of PK deficiency and prior available 
complete blood counts (CBCs) over the preceding 6 months and transfusion history over the 
preceding 12  months prior to the date of signing informed consent.  
10.4. PKR Enzymatic Assay and PKR Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_587299]. PKR enzymatic assays will be conducted at  
. PKR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_362339]  
 
10.5. Safety Assessments  
10.5.1. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination (genital and rectal examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator) will be obtained at Screening, Baseline, Week 12, and the Follow 
up Visit (Week 28). For pat ients rolling over into extension study, the last physical examination 
will occur at Week 24. Limited focused physical examinations will be performed at all other 
visits. Any findings will be recorded on the eCRF . Height will be collected at Screening only . 
10.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, will be obtained according to the according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). Vital 
sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. 
Out of range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any 
confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs.  
10.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 15.1). The 
ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, QTcB (Bazett correction formula), and QTcF (Frederica’s correction). Only QTcF (not QTcB) will be used for determination of eligibility.  
The 12-lead ECGs should be obtained following [ADDRESS_773546] 7  days prior to Day 1 dosing. ECGs will be repeated if clinically 
significant abnormalities are observed, if artifacts are present, or if machine/equipment errors 
occur. Any confirmed, clinically significant ECG findings will be recorded as AEs. 
10.5.4. Safety Laboratory Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation Studies, and Urinalysis 
Labor atory values obtained prior to S creening and RBC antibodies obtained at Screening will be 
performed at a local laboratory. On -study c linical laboratory evaluations are to be performed by 
[ADDRESS_773547]'s visit, and before 
the results are returned from the designated central laboratory, they are free to exercise their 
discretion to do so. Investigators should be aware that since the Hb level is a secondary endpoint 
of the study, it behooves them to minimize blood volumes drawn, and samples for the central lab 
must still be collected , since it  will serve as the official lab result for this study . 
Clinical laboratory evalua tions are to be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 15.1). In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing 
will be followed by [CONTACT_587388]. Please note that serum free and total testosterone will be collected at [ADDRESS_773548] 2 days apart in addition to Week 1/Day  1 (total of 3 time points prior to 
Day 1 dosing).  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be determined:  
Hematology:  HCT , Hb, RBC count, absolute reticulocyte count, percent 
reticulocyte count, MCV , mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), mean 
corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC),  red cell distribution width 
(RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with manual differential, 
ANC , and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and platelet count. 
G6PD and RBC antibody screen will be performed at Screening only  
Other EPO, Hp, COHb  
Serum Chemistry : alkaline phosphatase (ALP), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, carbon dioxide (CO 2), albumin, total 
protein, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, LDH , ALT, AST , total bilirubin , and indirect bilirubin. 
Sex Hormones : testosterone (total and free), estrone, and estradiol. FSH  will only be 
performed at Screening for female patient s only for confirmation of 
post-menopausal status. 
Bone Turnover serum NTX and CTX. 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_587300], HDL -C, triglycerides.  
Iron Panel  iron (F e), total iron -binding capacity ( TIBC ), percent saturation, 
ferritin.  
Coagulation Studies: fibrinogen, aPTT, INR . 
Urinalysis : color and appearance, pH, specific gravity, ketones, protein, glucose, 
bilirubin, nitrite, urobilinogen, pregnancy screen (dipstick), occult blood. Microscopic inspection of sediment will only be performed 
for cause or to investigate an abnormal dipstick finding per the

[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Serology  
A blood sample for serology, including HBsAg, HCV Ab screen, and HIV1 and HIV2 Ab, is to 
be collected from all patients at Screening.  
10.5.5. Adverse Events  
Each patient  will be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the study 
from signing o f the informed consent through all scheduled study follow-up visits,  or withdraw al 
of consent, whichever occurs first. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably 
related to study treatment that occur > [ADDRESS_773549]- treatment also are to be reported.  
AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_587486]. On dosing visits , all AEs (elicited and spontaneously reported) will be 
continuously evaluated by [CONTACT_303595] . At any non- dosing day visit, AEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595]. An y AEs already documented at a previous 
assessment and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits or assessme nt time 
points as necessary. If these AEs have resolved, this will be documented. 
All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE grading system ( Appendix 15.2 ).  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  11. 
10.6. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
10.6.1. Blood Sample Collection and Pharmacokinetic Measurements During Dose 
Escalation 
The first approximately 10 patients treated , contingent on clinical site feasibility,  will undergo 
extensive PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 5. The remainder of treated patients 
will undergo limited PK sampling as detailed in Appendix 15.1, Table 6 . In-clinic visits on 
Day 8 and Day 22 may be performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary  and 
must be approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by [CONTACT_413]; in these instances PK sampling would 
not be required. 
The collection times for post- dose PK samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PK draw at [ADDRESS_773550] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a separate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collecti on will be recorded. 
Samples for PK and PD assessments may be retained for up to [ADDRESS_773551]- dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. 
(For example, a PD draw at [ADDRESS_773552] capsule has 
been ingested.) The completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Procedures for sample collection and processing will be provided in a sepa rate study manual. 
The actual time point of each sample collection will be recorded.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments will include 2,3 -DPG, ATP,  
In-clinic visits on Day  8 and Day 22 may be 
performed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician if necessary and must be approved by [CONTACT_253320] a case by [CONTACT_413]; in these instances PK sampling wou ld not be required. 
Figure  4 provides a brief schematic outlining the PKR reaction and how each of these PD 
assessments fits into a complete mechanistic understanding of the action of AG -348. 
Figure  4: PKR Enzymatic Reaction  
 
The PKR enzyme catalyzes the PEP to pyruvate reaction, with concomitant formation of ATP. 
17. Binding of AG-[ADDRESS_773553]- dose PD samples will start from the time that dosing is completed. (For example, a PD draw 
at [ADDRESS_773554] capsule has been ingested.) The 
completion time of each dose will be recorded.  
Blood samples will be stored at the site and regularly transported at -80°C ±10 C to the 
bioanalytical laboratory for analysis. Procedures for sample collection and processing will be 
provided in a separate study manual. 
10.8. Ordering of Blood Sample Collection  
When more than 1 blood sample is collected at the same nominal time, the samples will be 
collected in the following order:  
1. Safety laboratory assessments  
2. PK  
3. PD (2,3 DPG, ATP)  
 
 
 
10.9. Sample Processing, St orage, and Shipment

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
recorded in the source documentation and eCRF  from time of the signing informed consent 
through the Follow-up Visits. All AEs should be monitored until they are resol ved or are clearly 
determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
All SAEs will be followed through [ADDRESS_773555] dose of study treatment or until the SAE 
has resolved. Any SAEs that are assessed as po ssibly or probably related to study treatment that 
occur > [ADDRESS_773556]- treatment also are to be reported . 
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
11.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
11.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  
11.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE  is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure. 
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening. Life -threatening means that the patient  was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form; 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned); 
60 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or 
patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
The document entitled FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing 
Clinical Evaluation (FDA 2009) provides guidance on how the measurement of various 
laboratory parameters may be used to assess a given drug’s potential to cause severe liver injury (i.e., irreversible liver failure that is fatal or requires liver transplantation). Such cases are 
suggested by [CONTACT_587442]: 
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of 3-fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-hepatotoxic) control 
drug or placebo; 
2. Among trial patient s showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum 
total bilirubin to >  2×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
elevated serum  ALP ); 
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferases and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre- existing acute liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
Clinical safety laboratory results compatible with the definition of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI) stated above must be repeated for confirmation as soon as possible, and if confirmed, will 
be scored as an unacceptable AE  and reported to FDA as a serious unexpected AE. 
11.2. Procedures for Reporting  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Each patient  must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeli ng?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patient s. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_17491]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE 
[ADDRESS_773557] be recorded in the appropriate source documentation and eCRF . Treatment -emergent 
abnormal clinical laboratory results should generally be reported as AEs if there are 
accompanying symptoms; if additional diagnostic evaluations or medical (including drug 
therapy) or surgical interventions are undertaken; if a change in study drug dosing or study drug discontinuation is required; or, if the laboratory result is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786]. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology 
should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study must be promptly reported by [CONTACT_587443] (see below ). Deaths and AEs assessed 
as life -threatening are to be reported immediately and SAEs that meet other criteria are to be 
reported within [ADDRESS_773558] Information:

If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of AG -348, the 
Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating Investigators on 
an expedited basis. The local In stitutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will be promptly notified based on local regulations where required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be described in the source documents in the database. All 
new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity or frequency relative to baseline, which 
occur after sig ning the informed consent through the final Follow- up Visit (Day  29 ± 3 days)  
must be recorded. Adverse events that are ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation 
should be followed up to [ADDRESS_773559] dose of study treatment, or until the SAE has resolved.  
62 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes: 
• A medical diagnosis of the event (if a medical diagnosis cannot be determined, a 
descriptio n of each sign or symptom characterizing the event should be recorded); 
• The date of onset of the event; 
• The date of resolution of the event; 
• Whether the event is serious or not; 
• Intensity of the event (see below for definitions); 
• Relationship of the event to study treatment (see below for definitions); 
• Action taken: none; change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary 
interruption in dosing); drug treatment required; non- drug treatment required; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] r equired (complete SAE page); 
diagnostic procedure performed; patient  discontinued from the study (complete End 
of Study visit); 
• Outcome: patient  recovered without sequelae; patient  recovered with sequelae; event 
ongoing; patient  died (notify the Medical Mo nitor immediately, and complete the 
SAE form).  
Intensity  of all AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 ( Appendix 15.1).  
Relations hip to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_587394]:  
• Not Related :  Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_587395].  An attribution of possibly r elated means that there are facts in 
evidence to suggest a possible relationship. 
• Probably Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, 
and the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_587455], or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  An 
attribution of probably related means that there are facts in evidence to suggest a 
probable relationship. 
For the purpose of safety analyses related to final database review, all AEs that are classified as possible or probable will be considered treatment- related AEs.  
11.3. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). How ever, any pregnancy in a 
participating female patient or a female partner of a participating male patient that occurs during 
this study or within [ADDRESS_773560] be reported by [CONTACT_171064]’s 
designee on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the delivery or elective abortion. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_773561] dose of AG-348. 
64 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 
24 weeks of AG -348 in patients with  PK Deficiency. Therefore, analyses will be primarily 
descriptive in nature; no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. All analyses will be conduct ed separately within each dose arm, or pooled where appropriate. 
12.1. Sample Size Estimation  
Due to the rare disease setting, the minimal sample size in each dose arm  may be  determined by 
[CONTACT_5870]. I n order to evaluate the primary objective of safety and tolerability of AG -348 in 
Arm 1 and Arm 2, up to a maximum of 25 patients may be randomized onto each a rm. The 
actual number of patients enrolled into Arms 1 and 2 will depend on the safety reviews and decisions made by [CONTACT_550627] . In addition, up to 25 additional patients may be enrolled to evaluate 
an additional dose arm (Arm 3; see Section  7.1). As for Arms [ADDRESS_773562] T. Therefore,  up 
to approximately  75 total patients may be enrolled in this study across 2 to 3 dose arms. 
Table 3 provides the probability within a dose arm of detecting 1 or more AEs with varying sample size and the true underlying AE rates.  
Table 3: Sample Size Estimation  
Sample Size  True Underlying AE Rate  
15% 10% 5% 
5 56% 41% 23% 
10 80% 65% 40% 
15 91% 79% 54% 
25 98% 93% 72% 
 
12.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following patient  populations (i.e., analysis sets) will be evaluated and used for presentation 
of the data:  
• Safety Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and receive any dose of study 
treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary set for the analysis of safety 
data.  Patients will be classified according to treatment received , where treatment 
received is defined as the assigned treatment if it is received at least once, or as the 
first treatment received if assigned treatment is never received . Unless o therwise 
stated, the Safety Analysis Set will be the default analysis set for all data analyses.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set: All patients in the Safety Analysis Set w ith 
sufficient plasma sample data to assess PK parameters. Results of the potential PD 
activity of AG -348 will also be based on the PK analysis set.  
65 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
• Efficacy  Analysis Set: All patient s who are enrolled and achieve at least 50% 
compliance with their assigned dose intensity for at least 4  weeks of continuous 
dosing. Additional efficacy an alyses may be performed on subsets of patients with 
other degrees of compliance with their assigned dose intensity and/or duration of 
dosing. The Efficacy  Analysis Set w ill be the primary set for the analysis of 
preliminary clinical activity data. Patients  will be classified according to assigned 
treatment.  
 
 
 If such analyses are performed, they will be 
described in a separate PK Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) and may be reported separately in a 
stand -alone report. 
12.3. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. When summarizing AE data, partial dates will be imputed as described in the SAP . Additional rules addressing the handling of 
missing data will be detailed in the SA P. 
12.4. Interim Analysis 
No formal statistica l interim analysis will be conducted. Safety data will be reviewed on an 
ongoing basis by [CONTACT_550627] , who will meet to review safety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity data at regular intervals (approximately every 6 weeks) throughout the duration of the 
study. The DRT ’s decisions to suspend, terminate, or open a potential third dosing arm, or re-
assign patients’ dosing in a terminated arm to match the dose and schedule of another arm of the study will be based on the totality of the data including, sa fety, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical 
activity (e.g., changes in Hb levels).  
Additional interim reviews of data may be conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical study, the sponsor’s development programs in general, or in case of any safety 
concerns.  
12.5. Statistical Methodology  
12.5.1. General Methods  
This study will be primarily descriptive in nature; therefore, there will be no formal hypothesis 
testing. Summaries will be produced for disposition, baseline disease characteristics and 
demographic data including genotype, safety measurements , PK, PD parameters and indicators 
of clinical activity. Data from each AG -348 dose group will be analyzed separately, and pooled 
across all dose groups where appropriate. All data will also be listed by [CONTACT_16749].  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_119395] (number and percentages) and continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  
66 
 

Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
12.5.2. Dispos ition  
A summary of the disposition of patient s will be presented, including the number enrolled, the 
number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations 
will be listed.  
12.5.3. Exposure and Safety Analyses 
Patients will receive multiple PO doses of AG-348 over a 24- week treatment period. The actual 
dose and duration in days of AG-348, as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual dose received and actual duration) and the relative dose intensity (comput ed as the ratio of 
dose intensity and planned dose received/planned duration) will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_368801].  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of TEAEs  (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_230782] (SOC), preferred term (PT), CTCAE Version 4.03 severity, outcome, action 
taken with study drug, and relationship to the study drug by [CONTACT_7169]. Separate summa ries will 
be produced for all TEAEs, treatment- related AEs (those considered by [CONTACT_587473]), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. Individual patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to interruption and/or 
reduction of study drug dose, and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment- emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE wi th onset beginning at the day of first 
administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period until [ADDRESS_773563] dose of 
study drug, or any event that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was 
subsequently considered drug- related by [CONTACT_119573]. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation studies, urinalysis) and VS  data, presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation. Shift analyses will be conducted for 
selected laboratory parameters based on the baseline CTCAE grade to maximum CTCAE grade.  
Where applicable CTCAE terms do not exist, a grading system based on the upper and/or lower 
limits of normal will be used to classify the results.  
No formal hypothesis- testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
Electrocardiogram analyses will include individual patient listings and summaries of abnormal and clinically si gnificant ECG results. Actual values and changes  from baseline in PR, QRS, and 
heart -rate corrected QT interval (QTc) intervals will be summarized by [CONTACT_587446].  Full 
details of the QTc analysis including correction methods used will be described in the SAP. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary. Concomitant 
medications prior to and after the start of the study drug will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_587474].  
12.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameters for the parent compound AG -348 
and the metabolite AGI -8702 for each dose group, and where appropriate, for the entire 
67 
 
Protocol AG348-C-003, Version 1.0 05 January  2015 
 
population. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using the following descripti ve 
statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, median, minimum and maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. PK analyses will be described in a separate PK 
SAP. 
12.5.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be used to  summarize PD parameters for 2,3 -DPG and ATP for each 
dose group, and where appropriate for the entire population. P harmacodynamic parameters will 
be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, coefficient of variation %, 
median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation %. PD 
analyses will be described in a separate P D SAP . 
12.5.6. Aromatase Hormone Analysis  
The analyses of serum sex hormones will use appropriate graphic displays and statistical 
analyses to evaluate patient change from baseline for each parameter. These analyses will 
include summaries of actual values and change from b aseline using appropriate descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, min and max) as described above.  
 
These analyses will present information by [CONTACT_587448], and analyses of a pooled 
AG-[ADDRESS_773564] bilirubin, EPO, ferritin, and transferrin 
saturation (serum iron/iron binding capacity). Characterization of Hb response which will 
include, but is not limited to percent of patients w ith increase in Hb , time to Hb response, and 
duration of Hb response w ill be explored . 
12.6. Procedures for Reporting Deviations to Original Statistical Analysis 
Plan  
All deviations from the original SAP will be provided in the final clinical study report.

13. ADMINSTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS  
13.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the appropriate regulatory requirement(s). The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the study drug as described in 
the protocol and Investigator’s Brochure. Essential clinical documents will be maintained to 
demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and 
retained according to th e appropriate regulations . 
13.2. Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of 
Helsinki (Appendix 15.4).  
The Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the investigation and must submit written documentation of the approval to the Sponsor before he or she can enroll any patient  into the 
study. The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, 
safety, and well -being of the patient s. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB 
approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, informed consent, 
advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patient s, signed Dose Escalation 
Interim Safety Reports, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB. The IRB is to be notified of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with local requirements. Progress reports and notifications of serious unexpected adverse drug 
reactions are to be provided to the IRB according to local regulations and guidelines. 
13.3. Patient  Information and Informed Consent  
The Investigator or trained designee will ensure that the patient  is given full and adequate oral 
and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and benefit of the study. Patient s 
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The patie nt 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
patient  prior to study participation.  
The patient ’s sig ned and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-
related procedures. The Investigator must maintain the original, signed consent form. A copy of the signed form must be given to the patient . 
The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent

medication reporting, raw data collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and 
other pertinent data for each patient  receiving study treatment. The Investigator will allow 
Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory authority inspectors, and the IRB to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study. 
13.7. Source Document/Case Report Form Completion  
Source documents will be completed for each study patient . It is the Investigator’s responsibility 
to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the patient ’s source 
document. The source document should indicate the patient ’s participation in the study and 
should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs and patient  status.  
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the source document as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient  is seen for 
an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be given for all 
missing data.  
The Investigator will sign and date each required assessment for all study patient s. The 
Investigator will retain all completed source documents.  
13.8. Direct Access to Source Data  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_4885]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_782] a representative of the Sponsor (site monitor) and will include on- site review of the 
source documents for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and 
clarification of administrative matters will be performed. The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient  confidentiality is maintained.  
The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and 
regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_54665] (letter, telephone, e- mail, and fax).  
All unused study drug and other study materials are to be returned to the Sponsor or designee after the study has been completed and the database has been locked.  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or the Sponsor’s clinical quality assurance group or designee may request access to all source documents, database, and any other applicable study documentation for an on-site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be 
guaranteed by [CONTACT_737], who must provide support at all times for these activities. 
13.9. Record Retention  
The Investigator will maintain all stu dy records according to ICH- GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirement(s). Records will be retained for at least [ADDRESS_773566] or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s). If the Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must be transferred to a person willing to 
accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs.

15.3. Potential Drug Interactions  
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (listed in Table 7) are not permitted for use with AG-348. Based on 
modeling of AG-348 metabolism and tolerability data from the Phase 1 MAD study, it is thought 
that moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 do not pose a risk to patients dosed with AG-348. 
In-vivo data from the Phase 1 MAD show AG-348 induces CYP3A4 and induces its own 
metabolism, presumably via CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers in combination with 
AG-348 is expected to reduce AG- 348’s efficacy. Therefore , administration of strong CYP3A4 
inducers (listed in Table 8) with AG-348 is not permitted . Strong inhibitors of drug transport 
(listed in Table 9) are not permitted for use with AG-348. 
Digoxin  is not permitted for use with AG -348.

15.4. Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI:  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June [ADDRESS_773575], Republic of 
South Africa, October 1996; 52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000; 
53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added); 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added); and 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008. 
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethica l principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of subjects, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the subject 's best interest when providing 
medical care."  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must in clude studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical  research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
[ADDRESS_773576], incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research st udy. The protocol should describe 
arrangements for post- study access by [CONTACT_364309].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comme nt, guidance and 
approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take 
into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any SAE s. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942].  
16. Medical research  involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_163046]. Research on subjects or healthy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects 
[ADDRESS_773577]'s freely -given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
25. For medical research using identifiable human ma terial or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done 
only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
[ADDRESS_773578]'s dissent 
should be respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subject s, may be done only if the physical or mental condition 
that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumst ances the physician should seek informed consent from the 
legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the 
specific reasons for  involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give 
informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been 
approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of 
their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy 
of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative 
and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made 
publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that 
the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research s tudy will not 
adversely affect the health of the subjects who serve as research subjects.  
[ADDRESS_773579] current proven intervention, except in the following 
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or s afety of an intervention and the 
subject s who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious 
or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
33. At the conclusion of the study, subject s entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or 
benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the subject  which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a subject  to participate in a study or the subject 's decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a subject , where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the subject  or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physi cian's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating 
suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, m ade publicly available.

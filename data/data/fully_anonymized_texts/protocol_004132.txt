Date 8/30/[ADDRESS_395418], biomarkers of 
congestion, and electrocardiogram. “Imminent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” was determined by [CONTACT_320311][INVESTIGATOR_320307]. 
Home M RAs were discontinued and potassium supplementation held if baseline serum 
potassium was >4.0mmol/L. Beta -blockers, ACE -I or angiotenin II receptor blockers were 
continued at home dose. Loop diuretic dosage was increased by [CONTACT_1192] -fold. Patients were seen at 
two office visits in total, baseline at day 1 and final visit on day 7. On day 3, participants had 
serum basic metabolic panel to assess potassium levels and renal function for safety 
assessment.  
 
Intervention  
Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a  1:1 ratio to high -dose (100mg/day) or standard -
dose (25mg/day) spi[INVESTIGATOR_320308].  
 
Randomization, Allocation and Blinding  
Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_320312]<45% in blocks of size 4. 2 by 2 randomization was 
performed via computer mo del generated by a study investigator. Allocations were concealed 
via the locked research pharmacy and the research team was blinded to treatment arm. All 
treatment medications were labeled in a blinded fashion. Subjects received 2 capsules per day 
(if sta ndard dose: 25mg and placebo, if high dose: two 50mg) dispended in vials of 2 capsules.    
 
Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint for the study was defined as change in total body weight at day 7 of the 
study period. Multiple secondary endpoints from day 1 to 7 were assessed. These included a) 
changes in dyspnea assessment scores; Visual Analogue Scale and 7 -Likert scale, b) signs of 
congestion (i.e. JVP, peripheral edema and respi[INVESTIGATOR_320309]), c) 6MWT, d) serum and urinary 
creatinine, sodium, potassium and plasma aldosterone and renin activity and biomarkers of 
congestion and neurohormonal activation, e) furosem ide equivalent of treatment loop diuretics 
doses, e) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] [ADDRESS_395419] was performed per American Thoracic Society guidelines, along with Borg 
scores for dyspnea and fatigue at day 1 and 7. Serum and urinary cr eatinine, potassium, and 
sodium, plasma aldosterone and renin activity, and pro -BNP were assessed at days 1 and 7. 
Other biomarkers of peripheral congestion (CD146), inflammation (interleukin -6, tumor 
necrosis factor -, endothelin -1) oxidative stress (isop rostane) and endothelial activation 
(vascular cell adhesion molecule -1) were assessed at day 1 and 7 and analyzed by [CONTACT_320313] -
MS.  
 
A data monitoring committee of two independent cardiologists was established to evaluate 
safety, with a pre -specified sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_320310]. Safety endpoints 
included changes in serum creatinine levels, eGFR, and the incidence of hyperkalemia during 
the 7 day treatment period. Safety was assessed by [CONTACT_320314], and hyperkalemia. Serious adverse events were defined as death 
and all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

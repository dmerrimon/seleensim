Scientific Background  
There is a significant unmet medical need for treatments that reduce the abuse and 
dependence of addicting drugs, including tobacco, alcohol, cocaine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  In recent years, opi[INVESTIGATOR_831554] e ffective 
treatments for alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554].  The effects on tobacco users is equivocal, with well -
established effects in short -term laboratory studies of subjective effects, but lack of clear 
sustained effect on abstinence, perhaps due to the chronic  negative effects of mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_831555].  
Accumulating evidence indicates that selective antagonism of kappa -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (KORs) 
may provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of depression.  A therapeutic role for KORs in major depressive disorder (MDD) is based upon an emerging scientific literature showing that 
KORs and the endogenous ligand dynorphin are highly expressed within the prefrontal cortico -
striatal loop, which mediates reward and affective states.
[ADDRESS_1154145] preference, an animal 
model of drug relapse.  
CERC- 501 (previously known as LY2456302) is a high -affinity, selective KOR antagonist being 
developed for the treatment of substance abuse  and MDD, by [CONTACT_831558].   
In a mouse model of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_831556], CERC -[ADDRESS_1154146] on symptoms clinically.  
In three previous human trials, CERC -501 has been sh own to be safe and well tolerated at single 
oral doses up to 60 mg.  At multiple daily doses of 10 mg or less, CERC -501 provides substantial 
blockade of KOR as assessed in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies with 
minimal effect on mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_831557] -induced miosis.  
The current study will evaluate the effect of CERC -501 on the latency to start smoking and the 
number of cigarettes smoked during the smoking self- administration period after a 18 -hour 
period of abstinence.   Subjective measures of cravings, positive and negative mood, and 
withdrawal symptoms will also be assessed.   
 
Study Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to:  
To demonstrate that CERC -501 10 mg/day compared to placebo will increase the ability to 
resist smoking, and reduce subsequent ad -lib smoking following overnight nicotine deprivation 
and personalized stress imagery in subjects who are heavy smokers.  
 
Study Design and Methods  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, two -period, cross -over design examining 10 mg/day 
CERC- [ADDRESS_1154147] will “crossover” to the opposite treatment during 
Period 2.  The cr ossover design (within -subject analysis) allows the subject to be their own 
control.  Efficacy for CERC- 501 on smoking behavior will be assessed in two ways:  1) crossover 
comparison of CERC -501 10 mg versus placebo; 2) parallel comparison of CERC -501 10 m g 
versus placebo in Period 1.  Gender will be a stratification variable and approximately 50% of the sample will be female.  
Sequence 1: CERC -501 10 mg for Period 1 and placebo for Period 2  
Sequence 2: Placebo for Period 1 and CERC -501 10 mg for Period 2  
After the screening period, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of two 
sequences (CERC- 501 [10 mg] followed by [CONTACT_831559] -501 [10 mg]).  
Subjects will return to the clinic daily Monday through Friday for supervised stu dy drug 
administration.  On Saturday, Sunday, and holidays the subject will self -administer the study 
drug. All efforts will be made to have subjects come in for daily medication visits, but if a subject is unable to return for supervised study drug admini stration, they will be allowed to 
self-administer the drug. Each period of the crossover treatment consists of a [ADDRESS_1154148]
2 and be discharged from the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96051] (HRU) to undergo approximately 7 (+3) -day washout period followed by 
[CONTACT_831560] [ADDRESS_1154149] of an overnight nicotine deprivation period, followed by 
[CONTACT_831561] (stress).  After the imagery procedure, subjects will have the option of 
initiating a tobacco self -administration session or delaying initiation by [ADDRESS_1154150] cigarette 
(i.e., ability to resist smoking) and the number of cigarettes smoked.  Subjects complete a 
follow -up appointment (approximately 7 +3 days from the second lab session) to evaluate the 
durability of effects.

Statistical Considerations  
PRIMARY AIM 1. Using a double -blind, placebo -controlled parallel- group design, this Phase II 
study will randomize 20 daily smokers to either 10 mg/day CERC -501 or placebo (n=10 per 
group). Following titration to steady state levels, we will evaluate medication effects on stress -
induced changes in smoking behavior in the laboratory.  Prima ry Hypothesis 1. During the 
laboratory component, 10 mg/day CERC -[ADDRESS_1154156] smoking, and reduce subsequent ad -lib smoking following overnight nicotine deprivation 
and personalized stress imagery. Linear mixe d models with medication condition (10mg/day or 
0mg/day) as a within s ubject factor will be used to evaluate, in turn, time to smoking, and 
amount smoked  collected in the laboratory.

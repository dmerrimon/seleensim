2.1 Background and Rationale
Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal Antibody (Ab) of the immunoglobin G1 subclass directed 
towards interleukin (IL) -23p19.  The Ab has been engineered to reduce Fcγ receptor and complement 
binding and potential charge heterogeneity.  Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL -23.
Positive results were observed from 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 clinical trials that evaluated risankizumab 
compared with ustekinumab, placebo, and adalimumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psori asis (Ps).  Results from these pi[INVESTIGATOR_843067], meeting co -primary endpoints of achieving at 
least a 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and static Ph ysician's Global 
Assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) versus comparator or placebo at Week 16 
across all 4 studies.1
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
There is an unmet medical need for effective treatments in pediatric patients with chronic plaque Ps 
who are candidates for systemic therapy.  This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and 
efficacy of risankizumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque Ps from 6 to less than 18 years of 
age.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
In Phase 3 studies of risankizumab in patients with Ps, the majority of subjects receiving risankizumab 
achieved 90% improvement of their disease, and risankizumab was well tolerated.  As with many 
immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function, resulting in a risk of infection.  
This will be monitored by [CONTACT_82644] (AEs) during the treatment and observation 
periods.  In addition, subjects with active systemic infection or clinically important infection will not be 
included in the study.
Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON® -tubercul osis (TB) (or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] 
equivalent)/TB skin test result for TB must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1ofthis protocol.  
Interleukin -[ADDRESS_1171613] of IL -23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre -existing and tumor -induction 
models.7  While there is not enough clinical inf ormation at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with 
risankizumab, this risk is considered small.
Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_23274].  
Therefore, this study requires timely detection, eva luation, and follow -up of laboratory alterations in 
selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety.

independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate observed systemic 
hypersensitivity and anaphylactic events.   The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation 
(Section 6.3).
In conclusion, the benefit -risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriat e for this stage of clinical 
development.[ADDRESS_1171615] yet to be identified; however, no significant risks are expected as planned dosing will be 
equivalent to the adult efficacious dose that is considered safe and well -tolerated.  Due to potential 
immunological issues in very young children, it was determined that children under the age of 6 should 
not be included in this study.
For further details on the safety profile of risankizumab, please see findings from completed studies 
including safety data in the current Investigator's Brochure (IB).1
In view of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit -risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -19 is being evaluated bas ed on real world and clinical trial data.  
At this time, the effects of risankizumab on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.
3OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses, and Estimands
The objective of this study is to evaluate the PK, safety, a nd efficacy of risankizumab in subjects from 
6to less than 18 years of age with moderate to severe plaque Ps.
Primary Efficacy
The primary efficacy objective is to assess the rate of subjects who achieve a) PASI 75 (defined as at least 
75% improvement fro m baseline in PASI) and b) sPGA clear or almost clear (0 or 1) (US only: and 
≥ 2grade improvement from baseline) at Week 16 of initial treatment with study drug based on the 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population (as defined in Section 7.2).
There are no statistical hypotheses corresponding to the co -primary efficacy objectives as efficacy will 
be assessed descriptively, providing estimates with confidence intervals without performing statistical 
testing.

parameters assessed as normal at the initial Screening Visit do not need to be repeated at th e 
repeat Screening Visit
If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation, including the assessment of an 
Interferon -Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube test) or a purified 
protein derivative (tuberculin) ([COMPANY_003]) test (or equival ent), and electrocardiogram (ECG), these 
tests do not need to be repeated at the repeat Screening Visit if they were completed within 
90days since the initial Screening Visit.

risankizumab.  Risankizumab responders (sPGA =0 or 1) will enter Period B and will be re -randomized 
(1:1) to receive no medication until a disease flare or risankizumab every 12 weeks until Wee k 40.  
Subjects randomized to the withdrawal arm in Period B who experience a disease flare on or after 
Week 28 will enter Re -Treatment Period C to receive risankizumab at Weeks 0 and 4 of the 16 -week 
re-treatment period.  Randomization and re -randomizatio n will not be stratified due to the small sample 
size.
For subjects initially randomized to risankizumab in Period A, study duration will be up to approximately 
81 weeks:
Screening period of up to 35 days
Period A:  16 -week treatment period (dosing at Weeks 0 and 4)
Period B:  maximum of 36 -week treatment or withdrawal period
Risankizumab non -responders:  risankizumab dosed at Weeks 16, 28, and 40
Risankizumab responders:  either no treatment or risankizumab dosed at Weeks 16, 28,

Pediatric subjects 6 through < [ADDRESS_1171625] approximate with adult exposure and minimizing 
complexity of dosing schemes.  Further rationale by [CONTACT_843076].
Selection of doses for Part 2 and Part 3 is based on PK modeling from Part 1.  Subjects who weigh 
≥40kg will receive mg risankizumab, while subjects who weigh < 40kg will receive mg 
risankizumab.
During the conduct of the study, if any subject initially assigned to the lower dose of risankizumab has a 
recorded weight ≥40kg at a dosing visit, they w ill receive the standard risankizumab dose ( mg).
Part 1
The main objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the PK and safety of the proposed risankizumab pediatric 
dose based on extrapolation from adult data.  According to an adalimumab study in pediatric pat ients 
with Ps (Study M04 -717),11the median body weight of adolescent patients (age 12 to less than 18 years) 
was 59 kg with a minimum to maximum range of 38 kg to 108 kg.  This largely overlaps with the body 
weight range observed in t he risankizumab adult Phase 3 studies in Ps (38.5 kg to 193 kg) and supports 
the use of the same adult therapeutic dose of  mg risankizumab in Part 1 of this study without a

Part 3
Similar to Part 1, the main objective of Part 3 is to evaluate PK and safety of the selected risankizumab pediatric doses in the 6 to < [ADDRESS_1171627] 16 weeks of data from Part 1 and are mg

Females, Non -Childbearing Potential
A female who is considered of non- childbearing potential does not need to use birth control 
during or following study drug treatment.
Premenopausal female with permanent sterility or permanent infertility due to one of the 
following:
Permanent sterility due to a hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], b ilateral 
oophorectomy;
Non -surgical permanent infertility due to Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, or 
gonadal dysgenesis; investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry 
for these individuals.
Premenarchal female
Females who have not experienced menarche (at least one menstrual period).
(Note:  If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study [e.g., a 
premenarchal female participant experiences menarche], the participant must discuss 
this with the investigator, w ho should determine if a female participant must begin a 
highly effective method of contraception.  If reproductive status is questionable, 
additional evaluation should be considered.)
Females, of Childbearing Potential
Females of childbearing potential mu st avoid pregnancy while taking study drug(s) and for 
at least 140 days (20 weeks or as guided by [CONTACT_843081] (if 
approved), whichever is longer) after the last dose of study drug.
Females must commit to one of the following methods of birth control:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated at 
least 30 days prior to study Baseline Day 1.
Progestogen -only hormonal birth control (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with 
inhibition of ovulation initiated at least 30 days prior to study Baseline Day 1.

All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_117946].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_110991].
Study Parts 1, 3, and 4 are open -label single arm and all subjects will receive the same dose exposure 
equivalent based on body weight (Parts 3 and 4) and the same frequenc y of study drug.
For Part [ADDRESS_1171655]'s treatment 
group assignment in Period A according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_843084].  For subjects re -randomized in Period B of Part 2, the IRT will assign a separate 
randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment in Period B according 
to a separate randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].  Randomization 
for Period A will be done in a 2:1 ratio of risankizumab vs. ustekinumab.  The re -randomization ratio of 
continued treatment with risankizumab vs. no treatment for Period B will be 1:1. Randomization and 
re-randomization will not be stratified due to the small number of subjects.
The blinded efficacy assessor must be independent from all other study activities.  The efficacy assessor 
will remain blinded to each subject's treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data 
during th e course of the study.
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, reg ulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_1171658]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or d rug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadeq uacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device damage or not 
working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
withi n 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical oc currence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipul ated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or accidental 
exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be reported 
whet her associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered 
an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be A Es only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
Page 30 of 107 
STUDY M19 -977  |  Version 5.0 |  EUCT2023- 504156- 10-[ADDRESS_1171659] for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routin e basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/ or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre- existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the ele ctive surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as an 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1171660] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatenin g An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Ano maly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

STUDY M19 -977  |  Version 5.0 |  EUCT2023- 504156- 10-[ADDRESS_1171661] and may require 
medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
sponta neous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterion 
is applicable.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administratio n until 140 days (20 weeks) after 
discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, study procedure -related serious and non- serious AEs will be 
collected from the time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investiga tional Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information [RSI]) and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements , including reporting to Eudravigilance database in accordance with EU Clinical Trial 
Regulation 536/2014.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Areas of Safety Interest/Safety Topi[INVESTIGATOR_843071] A reas of Safety interest (ASI)/Safety 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_843072].  Screening procedures are outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D).  In 
consideration of the ASI, the following supplemental eCRF(s) must be completed if AEs in any of the 
following areas are reported during the study ( Table 2).

Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1171662] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected. The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 
24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event.
6.2 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An external DMC will review safety data throughout the course of the study.
A separa te DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and 
responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data 
to be assessed.  Unblinded ASI events will be presented to the DMC for review on a periodic basis.
6.3 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee
While no concerns with anaphylaxis/systemic hypersensitivity have been identified with the use of 
risankizumab, the sponsor has established an independent, blinded, expert committee to adj udicate 
events of anaphylaxis based on pre -specified definitions.  This independent external AAC will adjudicate 
suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The event terms to 
be adjudicated and the adjudication proce ss are detailed in the AAC Charter.  A supplemental 
Hypersensitivity Reactions Signs and Symptoms eCRF will be used to collect information pertinent to the 
events.  In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_843086].
If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs at the investigative site, in addition to testing 
tryptase and histamine levels, pharmacokinetic and ADA/nAb samples should also be collected.  If a 
systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is observe d or reported while the subject is not at 
the investigative site, every effort should be made to obtain tryptase and histamine levels from the 
treating facility to help better characterize the diagnosis.

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary and secondary analyses.  
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analys is Plan (SAP).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Intent to Treat (ITT) Population in each study part includes all enrolled subjects from Parts 1, 3, and 
4, and all randomized subjects from Part 2.  The ITT Set will be used for all efficacy and baseli ne 
analyses.  For analyses by [CONTACT_843087] 2, only subjects enrolled into the respective study period 
will be included for that period.
The Safety Analysis Population in each study part consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and will be used for all safety analyses.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercurrent Events for the Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints
The efficacy endpoints (defined in Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4, and Section 3.5) will be analyzed 
on the ITT population to address the following pot ential intercurrent events:
1.Binary Endpoints
For subjects with the use of rescue medication, values after the start of rescue medication 
will be excluded from analysis and subjects will be considered non -responders at all time 
points after the start of res cue medication.
Data collected will be used regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug.
2.Continuous endpoints
Values after the use of rescue medication will be excluded.
Data collected will be used regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug.
7.[ADDRESS_1171663] quartiles, and minimum/maximum for continuous data.  In addition, 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be reported.  For continuous endpoints, CIs for means and 
differences between means, respectively, will be based on the normal distribution.  For dichotomous 
endpoints, exact CIs will be provided based on the Clopper -Pearson method for proportions and by [CONTACT_843088] -Nurminen method for differences in proportions.12

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].No statistical testing will be performed in this study.
The efficacy analyses in the ITT population for the different study parts will be performed separately, as 
described in Section 7.6.
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_843089] 95% CI as 
described above.
Seco ndary Efficacy Analysis
Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_843089] 95% CI as described 
above.
Other Efficacy Analyses
Other efficacy analyses will be conducted providing descriptive statistics and 95% CI as descri bed above.
Subgroup Analysis for Efficacy
Details regarding subgroup analyses will be specified in the SAP.
7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Population and will be based on 
treatments the sub jects actually received.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], physical examination, 
laboratory assessments, and vital signs.  The safety analyses in the safety population for the different 
study parts will be performed separately as described in Section 7.6.  Analysis details will be specified in 
the SAP.
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment -
emergent adverse events are defined as those that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of 
study drug and within 140 days/[ADDRESS_1171664] dose of study drug.  The number and percentage 
of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be t abulated using the MedDRA system organ class and preferred 
term, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_82662].  Summaries 
(including percentages and events per 100 patient -years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discont inuation 
and ASI will be provided as well.  Pre -treatment AEs will be summarized separately.
For selected laboratory and vital signs, mean change from baseline and percentage of subjects with 
evaluations meeting criteria for pre -defined Potentially Clinica lly Significant values will be summarized.

7.7 Multiplicity Adjustment and Overall Type I Error Control
Not applicable for this study.
7.8 Sample Size Determination
The sample sizes for the 4 study parts are per the risankizumab Ps pediatric investigational plan (PIP), in 
which it has also been agreed the study does not need to be powered to demonstrate superiority. The 
current study design meets the PIP commitment of at least [ADDRESS_1171669] 80 subjects are age 
12to less than 18 years.13
All enrolled (for Part 2, all randomized) subjects will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint.  
Subjects discontinued from the study prior to Week 16 will be included in the analysis as non -
responders.
Part 1 (age 12 to less than 18 years with severe Ps) and Part 3 (age 6 to less than 12 years with severe 
Ps) are being conducted primarily for PK purposes and will each enroll 12 subjects.  Enrollment of 
12subjects, a sample size typi[INVESTIGATOR_380723] 1 PK and safety/tole rability studies, will be sufficient to 
evaluate and confirm if the dosing is able to provide exposures in pediatric subjects consistent with 
exposures at the therapeutic dose in adult subjects, and to provide sentinel efficacy and safety data 
before expos ing additional subjects with moderate to severe disease.
Assuming observed response rates for each of the co -primary endpoints of 66.7% (8 of 12), 75% (9 of 12) 
or 83.3% (10 of 12), the 95% exact CI will have a width of 34.9 to 90.1, 42.8 to 94.5, or 51.6 to 97.9, 
respectively.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Part 2 will enroll 80 subjects ages 12 to less than 18 years in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 53 subjects will be 
randomized to risankizumab, 27 subjects to ustekinumab).  The assumptions for response rates are 
based on the results for the [ADDRESS_1171670] 
clear (0 or 1).  Assuming an observed response rate of 59% (16 of 27) or 70% (19 of 27) for the 
ustekinumab group and a response rate of 79% (42 of 53) for the risankizumab group, the 95% exact CI 
for the difference between treatment groups will have a width of –2.7 to 42.4 or – 13.9 to 31.9, 
respectively.
Part 4 will enroll 28 subjects (age 6 to less than 12 years). (Japan only: A pproximately 2 adolescents aged 
12to <18 years will be included. )As the design of Parts 3 and 4 only differs by [CONTACT_843090], the 40 subjects (aged 6 to <12 years) enrolled into Parts 3 and 4 ca n be analyzed together if it 
is confirmed in Part 3 that the same dosing regimen is used for both Parts 3 and 4.  Assuming observed 
response rates for each of the co -primary endpoints of 65% (26 of 40), 75% (30 of 40) or 85% (34 of 40), 
the 95% exact CI wi ll have a width of 48.3 to 79.4, 58.8 to 87.3, or 70.2 to 94.3, respectively. Results 
from the approximately 2 Japanese adolescents (ages 12 to < 18 years) will be assessed separately, as 
applicable.

In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]/ pandemic, natural disaster, conflict/combat) 
occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified procedures, [COMPANY_013] may engage with 
study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and 
minimize ris ks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care.  This 
may include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative 
locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local la b instead of a central lab) and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_17168]/or supplies to ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these alternative 
measures must be allowed by [CONTACT_17195]/IEC.  Investigators should notify 
[COMPANY_013] if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Regulatory 
Classification: Class II in the [LOCATION_002] and Class IIb in European Union and United 
Kingdom  for both devices 
Indication : ENSEAL® X1 Tissue Sealers (ENSEAL X1)  
The ENSEAL X1 devices are bipolar electrosurgical instruments for use 
with an electrosurgical generator. They are intended for use during open or 
laparoscopic surgical procedures to  cut and seal vessels, and to cut, grasp 
and dissect tissue during surgery.  
Indications for use include open and laparoscopic general, gynecological, 
urologic, thoracic, and ENT surgical procedures or any procedure where 
vessel ligation (cutting and  sealing), tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dissection, and 
division of vessels, lymphatics, and tissue bundles is performed (e.g. bowel 
resections, hysterectomies, gall bladder procedures, Nissen Fundoplication, 
adhesiolysis, and  oophorectomies). The devices can be used on vessels up 
to and including [ADDRESS_421341] not been shown to be effective for 
tubal sterilization or tubal coagulation for sterilization procedures.  
Generator G11 (GEN11)  
The GEN11 provides radiofrequency power to drive ENSEAL electrosurgical 
instruments that are used during open or laparoscopic  general and 
gynecological surgery to cut and seal vessels and to cut, grasp, and dissect 
tissues. In addition, the generator provides power to drive HARMONIC ultrasonic surgical instruments that are indicated for soft tissue incisions when bleeding contro
l and minimal thermal injury are desired. 
ENSEAL and HARMONIC instruments, when used with the GEN11, have 
not been shown to be effective for sterilization procedures or tubal 
coagulation.  
Objective(s): The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the acceptable 
performance and safety of the ENSEAL X1 and GEN11 devices when used 
per the instructions for use (IFU).  
Overview of 
Study Design:   This prospective, single -arm, multi-center study will collect clinical data in a 
post-market setting by [CONTACT_212638] ( upper gastrointestinal [GI], lower 
GI, and  gynecological). Investigators will perform each procedure using the 
device in compliance with their standard surgical approach and the 
ENSEAL X1 and GEN11 IFUs.  
Subjects will be consented and screened anytime during a period of [ADDRESS_421342]- operatively through discharge and 
again at 28 days (± 14 days) post-surgery; therefore, from the surgery date 
to study exit, the duration will be approximately 6 weeks.  
 
Trial Number: ENG_2019_01 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 34 
Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
Number of 
Subjects :   In order to achieve a total of 230 vessel transections for analysis with a 
minimum of   27 vessel transections in each group (including 4 subgroups in 
upper GI procedure) , a minimum of  133 subjects (maximum of 149 
subjects ) will be included in the study from up to 16 surgery centers in the 
[LOCATION_002] and/or European Union  and/or [LOCATION_008]. The

and while the device is used as indicated in the IFU.  The device nor any 
device components remain in the patient a fter use. 
Criteria for 
Evaluation: The primary performance endpoint will be: 
x Achievement of Grade 3 or lower hemostasis for each vessel 
transection (per the grading scale below): 
o Grade 1: no bleeding at transection site; 
o Grade 2: minor bleeding at transectio n site, no intervention 
needed; 
o Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild intervention 
needed, use of compression, basic energy devices 
(monopolar and/or bipolar) and/or touch- ups with ENSEAL 
X1; or 
o Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, 
venous pooling) requiring intervention such as extensive coagulation or ligation with use of additional hemostatic measures 
(e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, 
other advanced energy products); 
The secondary performance endpoints will be: 
x Distribution of 5-point scale scores for various tasks completed by 
[CONTACT_340517] X1 device (adhesiolysis , lymphatics or tissue bundles 
divided, tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tissue cutting, or tissue dissection); 
x Distribution of hemostasis grading scale for each vessel transect ed; 
and 
x Type, name, and number of additional hemostasis products required 
to achieved hemostasis for Grade 4 vessel transections. 
The safety endpoint will be:
x Occurrence of device-related adverse events (AEs). 
Statistical Analysis:
 Analysis Sets  
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed on the set of subjects in whom the ENSEAL X1 device is utilized during the 
surgical procedure. The summary of all performance 
and safety endpoints 
will be performed by [CONTACT_212638] , procedure subgroup, and on the 
entire pooled set of subjects.

Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_421344] a 
minimum of 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis that the rate of 
Grade 3 or lower hemostatic transections is less than 87.5% when the 
expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_421345] 94.0% based 
on exact binomial test and a one-sided significance level of 0.025. The 
hemostatic transection  grades for vessels are assumed to be indepe ndent 
within a subject and a procedure.  
In order to achieve a total of 230 vessel transections for analysis with a 
minimum of 27 vessel transections in each group (including 4 subgroups in 
upper GI procedure), a minimum of 133 subjects (a maximum of 149 subjects) will be enrolled in the study. 
 
The original sample size of the study was based on the assumption of one 
vessel transection per subject. At the time of amendment [ADDRESS_421346] was estimated to be 1.9 on average. The primary 
endpoint and the study hypothesis are based on hemostasis of vessel 
transection; therefore, the number of subject
s to be enrolled was updated to 
ensure 230 vessel transections.  
 
Performance  Analyses 
The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved ( ≤ 
Grade 3) will be summarized and a n exact 95% confidence interval will be 
estimated for each procedure group ( upper GI, lower GI, and 
gynecological) , the six individual procedure subgroups, and in total. The 
performance goal hypothesis will be evaluated using the lower bound of the 
exact 95% confidence interval and a p -value will be calculated using  e xact 
binomial test. The 95% confidence interval will be estimated based on the 
Clopper -Pearson method. Counts and percentages will be provided for 
type, size, and number of vessels transected, grading scale distribution for 
all vessels transected, number of times ENSEAL X1 touch -ups were 
required, and incidence of requirement for additional measures to obtain 
hemostasis on vessels (othe r advanced energy devices or hemostatic 
measures ).  
Safety Analyses  
All device -related and procedure- related AEs reported during the study will 
be coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_340518] , procedure subgroup and in total. Separate 
summaries will be provided for device -related and procedure- related AEs. 
Serious AEs will be summarized in a similar manner.

Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_421351] tissue during surgery.  
ENSEAL X1 differs primarily in three ways from the earlier version of the device, the ENSEAL® 
G2 Tissue Sealer (ENSEAL G2). 
1. The ENSEAL G2 relied on I-BLADE® Technology to provide compression along the 
device tip, whereas the ENSEAL X1 has a redesigned jaw that provides uniform 
compression without the need for an I-BLADE. 
2. The ENSEAL G2 used a positive temperature coefficient technology to modulate energy 
flow and control temperature at the blade, whereas ENSEAL X1 uses electrical impedance feedback to intelligently monitor tissue conditions and modulate energy delivery to ensure effective sealing while minimizing tissue damage. 
3. The ENSEAL G2 had an integrated seal-and-cut steps for use, whereas ENSEAL X1 
has separated these into intuitive, simplified functions, so that surgeons may now seal without cutting, cut without sealing, or both seal and cut. 
The ENSEAL X1 devices have undergone extensive preclinical testing to ensure that they are capable of producing strong and durable seals for vessels up to 7mm in diameter. Beginning in 2018, the open-surgery version, ENSEAL X1 Large Jaw, was successfully launched. Now, a laparoscopic version, ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw (Figure 1) is being introduced to the market. 
With a shaft diameter of 5 mm, the device will be available in lengths of 25, 37, and 45 cm. The 
curved tapered tip of the device is designed for fine dissection, while being able to capture more 
tissue per bite with stronger graspi[INVESTIGATOR_340507]. The shaft can be rotated a full 360° for easier access to targeted tissue.

The GEN11 supplies energy to the HARMONIC and ENSEAL surgical instruments. It also has a 
touchscreen for easy setup and operation, and a high-resolution display with wider viewing 
angles. Software updates to ensure that the system is operating optimally are available via USB 
memory stick. The generator uses a touchscreen display interface and has a unique receptable

Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
port that accepts either a HARMONIC or an ENSEAL instrument. Connectors (HGA11 for 
HARMONIC and EGA11 for ENSEAL) are used to enable the generator to power legacy 
instruments. 
The ENSEAL X1 device includes several incremental enhancements of the same basic 
technology used with predicate devices. This study is being initiated to evaluate the subject 
devices when used per their instructions for use (IFU) in the following types of procedures: 
upper GI, lower GI, and gynecological.   
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the acceptable performance and safety of the ENSEAL X1 and GEN11 devices when used per the instructions for use (IFU).

3.3 STUDY PROCEDURES 
3.3.1 Procedure Description 
Elective upper GI, lower GI, and gynecological procedures where ENSEAL X1 is indicated 
for use will be performed per the institution’s SOC.  Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-
Investigator can use the device during the vessel transections. For the gynecological 
procedures, the planned use of the ENSEAL X1 device should be for both the hysterectomy and oophorectomy steps of the procedures.  
3.3.2 Identity of Study Products 
The ENSEAL X1 and the GEN11 are the study products for this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Device Description 
ENSEAL X1 
The ENSEAL X1 instrument is a sterile, single-patient-use surgical instrument to 
coagulate and transect vessels up to and including 7 mm in diameter, tissue and/or 
vascular bundles. This device is to be used for soft tissue only. The instrument consists 
of a grip housing assembly, a rotating shaft, a moveable jaw, and a knife. The instrument shaft can be rotated 360° to facilitate visualization and enable easy access to targeted 
tissue. The jaws are in a normally-opened position and can be partially or fully closed by 
[CONTACT_340522]. The jaws are designed for graspi[INVESTIGATOR_340509]. The ENSEAL X1 has separate seal and cut capabilities. The lower 
jaw of the ENSEAL X1 can be used in the open or closed position to deliver energy 
based on the electrode configuration and jaw design. Bipolar energy is delivered when the SEAL button on the device or the MIN foot pedal is pressed. Pressing the CUT button advances the knife the length of the jaws to cut the targeted tissue. The power 
cord is permanently attached to the device and connects the instrument to the generator. 
The ENSEAL X1 instrument is designed for use exclusively with the GEN11 software 
version 2016-1 or later, packaged separately. 
GEN11 
The GEN11 device supplies energy to the HARMONIC and ENSEAL surgical 
instruments. The generator uses a touchscreen display interface and has a unique receptacle port that accepts either a HARMONIC or an ENSEAL instrument. Connectors 
(HGA11 for HARMONIC and EGA11 for ENSEAL) are used to enable the generator to 
power legacy instruments. 
 
Study Number: ENG_2019_01 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 34 
Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
[IP_ADDRESS] Indications 
ENSEAL X1 
The ENSEAL X1 are bipolar electrosurgical instruments for use with an electrosurgical 
generator. They are intended for use during open or laparoscopic surgical procedures to cut and seal vessels, and to cut, grasp and dissect tissue during surgery. 
Indications for use include open and laparoscopic general, gynecological, urologic, 
thoracic, and ENT surgical procedures or any procedure where vessel ligation (cutting 
and sealing), tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dissection, and division of vessels, lymphatics, and tissue 
bundles is performed (e.g. bowel resections, hysterectomies, gall bladder procedures, 
Nissen Fundoplication, adhesiolysis, and oophorectomies). The devices can be used on vessels up to and including [ADDRESS_421359] not been 
shown to be effective for sterilization procedures or tubal coagulation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraindications 
ENSEAL X1 
The efficacy of the ENSEAL X1 for the indication of contraceptive tubal coagulation 
(permanent female sterilization) has not been evaluated and is unknown. The design of 
the ENSEAL tissue sealing device is significantly different from bipolar designs that are 
marketed for the indication of contraceptive tubal coagulation. The design differences 
may affect the efficacy of the procedure and failure rates may not be comparable. 
GEN11 
The use of the GEN11 and the attached instruments are contraindicated when, in the 
judgement of the physician, radiofrequency or ultrasonic surgery would be contrary to 
the best interest of the patient. The instruments are not indicated for incising bone. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Labeling of Study Products 
The ENSEAL X1 has received 510(k) clearance in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA) and has CE Mark in the European Union and United 
Kingdom. The GEN11 has clearance for distribution in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_340523]. The study devices will use 
the cleared labeling. The Sponsor requires no additional labeling in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Accountability of Study Products 
The ENSEAL X1 may be provided to the participating institutions. The GEN11 (including 
footswitches) may be loaned to any institution in the study. Each institution not provided 
with ENSEAL X1 will use devices acquired through normal procurement process. If

Data collected during and after the procedure as defined in Section 3.4. 
3.6.3 Visit 3 – Post-procedure Follow-up Visit 
After the date of surgery, subjects will have a follow-up visit approximately 28 days (± 14 
days) later. This visit can be either an office  visit or a telephone follow-up. Data to be 
collected is defined in Section 3.5.  
3.6.4 Unscheduled Visit(s) 
Any unscheduled visit between Visit 2 and Visit 3 will be documented including the reason 
for the visit. This visit can be either an office visit or a telephone follow-up. Data to be collected is listed in Section 3.5. 
3.6.5 Vessel Image Capture 
The preferred image should be captured during the primary procedure at Visit 2 where the 
vessel (or the tissue bundle containing the vessel) is below the open jaw of the ENSEAL 
X1 device. The image should show the device perpendicular to the vessel. The image 
should have the entire length of the jaw of the ENSEAL X1 device in view. The image will be uploaded to the electronic database capture (EDC) system as either jpeg or pdf file. 
The Sponsor will determine if the image is analyzable and then each image will be 
reviewed and have a vessel size determined (if measurement is feasible) to the nearest 
quarter decimal (e.g., 5.0 mm, 5.25 mm, 5.50 mm, etc.) by [CONTACT_340527]. No reconciliation will be performed 
between the surgeon determination of vessel size (see Section 3.4.2) and the vessel size determined by [CONTACT_340528]. The primary vessel size determination will be by [CONTACT_340529].

5.3 INTERVAL WINDOWS 
Interval windows for the purpose of analysis in this study will not be defined outside of those 
already specified in the protocol for visit scheduling as the collection of data for the primary 
and secondary performance endpoints occurs intra-operatively. The final visit occurs 
approximately 4 weeks after surgery, thus no interval windows need to be defined given the absence of long-term follow-up in this study. The Schedule of Events specifies a window of 
14 days around the scheduling of the 4-week follow-up visit, and any information entered in 
the eCRFs at this visit will correspond to the 4-week visit. There will be no assigning of observations to time points outside of the visit to which they are recorded in the eCRFs.

Where p is the percentage of transections achieving a Grade 3 or lower hemostasis rating 
and 87.5% is set as a performance goal for the lower bound of acceptable hemostasis. A 
95% confidence interval will be calculated for p based on the sample proportion of 
transections where Grade 3 or lower hemostasis was achieved using Clopper-Pearson ’s 
method  and the lower limit of this confidence interval will be compared to 87.5% to evaluate 
the above hypotheses. A p-value will be determined based on exact binomial test.  
Given that multiple transections per subject may occur, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed using appropriate methods to account for the potential correlation among the 
outcomes of multiple transections within the same subject and procedure. Further details of 
this approach will be provided in the SAP. 
5.5 LEVELS OF SIGNIFICANCE 
The hypotheses above will be evaluated using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. 
Estimation of all additional endpoints will be performed using 95% confidence intervals. 
5.6 ANALYSIS SETS 
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed on the set of 
subjects in whom the ENSEAL X1 device is utilized during the surgical procedure. The 
summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_340535]. The hypotheses described in 
Section 5.4 will be evaluated on the pooled set of subjects as data on the ENSEAL X1 Large 
Jaw device demonstrated consistent performance across procedure groups in a similar study (>94% Grade 3 or lower hemostasis achieved for each procedure group).  
5.[ADDRESS_421367] a minimum of 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis when the expected rate of Grade [ADDRESS_421368] 94.0% based on exact binomial test and a one-sided significance level 
of 0.025. The hemostatic transection grades for vessels are assumed to be independent 
within a subject and procedure.   
In order to achieve a total of 230 vessel transections for analysis with a minimum of 27 vessel 
transections in each group (including 4 subgroups in upper GI procedure), a minimum of 133 
subjects (a maximum of 149 subjects) will be enrolled in the study. 
The original sample size of the study was based on the assumption of one vessel transection 
per subject. At the time of amendment [ADDRESS_421369] was 
estimated to be 1.9 on average. The primary endpoint and the study hypothesis are based on 
hemostasis of vessel transection; therefore, the number of subject to be enrolled was 
updated to ensure [ADDRESS_421370] enrollment is planned to account for dropout. A minimum of 27 vessel transections 
in each group (including 4 subgroups in upper GI procedure) is planned to attain optimum 
representation of each of the procedure groups to the whole study sample.    
From a safety perspective on the pooled analysis of 133 subjects and in consideration of rare 
AEs that may occur (e.g., bleeding requiring blood product transfusion), for an event that has 
an incidence rate of, for example, 1%, then in a sample of [ADDRESS_421371] 1 event is 73.7% under a binomial probability model. Thus, this sample 
size provides a high probability of observing rare events if they do occur, and provides 
reasonable assurance to conclude that the likelihood of such AEs is less than 2.8% if they do

Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_421372] 95% confidence interval when [ADDRESS_421373] demographics (age, gender, and race) will be presented in total and by [CONTACT_340536]. Surgical characteristics including, 
at minimum, estimated blood loss, requirement for blood transfusion, and procedure 
duration will be summarized by [CONTACT_212638], procedure subgroup and in total. 
5.9.4 Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved ( ≤ Grade 3) will be 
summarized and an exact 95% confidence interval will be estimated for each procedure group, procedure subgroup, and in total based on Clopper- Pearson’s method. The 
performance goal hypothesis will be tested as descri bed in Section 5.4. 
The analysis of primary endpoint is based on the assumption of independence of 
hemostatic grades within subject and procedure. This assumption of independence and its 
impact on the overall study conclusion will be evaluated through sensitivity analyses and will be described in SAP. 
Counts and percentages will be provided for type, size, and number of vessels transected, 
as well as for the grading scale distribution for all vessels transected, number of times 
ENSEAL X1 touch-ups were required, incidence of requirement for additional measures to 
obtain hemostasis on vessels (other advanced energy devices or hemostatic measures), 
and 5-point scale scores for various tasks completed by [CONTACT_340517] X1 device (adhesiolysis, lymphatics or tissue bundles divided, tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tissue cutting, or tissue dissection).  
All device-related and procedure-related AEs reported during the study will be coded to 
MedDRA. All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_340537], procedure subgroup, and in total. Separate summaries will be 
provided for device-related and procedure-related AEs. Serious AEs will be summarized in a similar manner. 
5.9.5 Plans for Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

clinical characteristics. These analyses will be exploratory and summary statistics for the 
procedure-related parameters will be provided for each subgroup.  
6.[ADDRESS_421375] medical occurrence includes any new, 
undesirable medical experience or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which occurs 
throughout the duration of the clinical study. 
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of a reportable AE. 
A SAE is defined as an AE (as defined in Section 6.1.1) that results in any of the following: 
x Death; 
x A life-threatening illness or injury; 
x A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function; 
x Required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
x Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; 
x Led to a fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: “Death” should not be reported as an AE. The cause of death should be reported as 
the AE . The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown. 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_12695], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE.

date. Any pre-existing condition that has worsened in intensity, frequency, or the character 
of the condition should be recorded as a new AE on the AE eCRF, as an exacerbation of the pre-existing condition and the start date will be recorded as the time when the 
exacerbation occurred.

Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
6.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE.  A change in severity may 
constitute a new reportable AE. 
The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each AE: 
x MILD:  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living. 
x MODERATE:  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
research participant. 
x SEVERE : A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
6.3 RELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to assess the relationship of a reportable AE (as defined 
in Section 6.1.1). Only AEs considered possibly, probably, or causally related to the study 
procedures or the ENSEAL X1 or GEN11 devices are to be recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor. 
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an AE in the study: 
x Not related – Relationship to the procedures or device can be excluded when: 
o The event is not a known side effect of the product category the device 
belongs to or of similar devices and procedures; 
o The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the 
procedures; 
o The event does not follow a known response pattern to the device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 
o The discontinuation of the device application or the reduction of the level 
activation/exposure (when clinically feasible) and reintroduction of its use 
(or increase of the level of activation/exposure), does not impact on the event; 
o The event involves a body-site or an organ not expected to be affected by 
[CONTACT_340538]; 
o The event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment, or other risk factors); 
o Harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; or 
o To establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event. 
x Possible  – The relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled 
out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment). 
 
Study Number: ENG_2019_01 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 34 
Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained 
should also be classified as possible. 
x Probable – The relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the 
event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. 
x Causal relationship – The event is associated with the device or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when: 
o The event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs 
to or of similar devices and procedures; 
o The event has a temporal relationship with the device uses/application or 
procedures; 
o The event involves a body-site or organ that: 
 The device or procedures are applied to; 
 The device or procedures have an effect on; 
o The event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known); 
o The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level 
of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible); 
o Other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical 
condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment) have been 
adequately ruled out; 
o Harm to the subject is due to error in use; or 
o To establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at 
the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
6.[ADDRESS_421377] all AEs (both AEs and SAEs) considered attributable 
(relationship of possible, probable, causal relationship) to the study procedure or the 
ENSEAL X1 or GEN11 devices in the source documents and eCRF.  
Standard medical terminology should be used when recording AEs. In addition, the 
following information should be recorded: 
x Onset date; 
x Resolution date or date of death; 
x Severity of the event; 
x Indication of whether the event is serious; 
x Relationship of AE to the study devices; 
x Relationship of AE to the study procedure; 
x Action taken; 
x Event status; and 
x Was AE anticipated or not (only for SAEs). 
Data related to AEs will be collected until the event resolution, or until the event is 
 
Study Number: ENG_2019_01 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 34 
Version: Amendment 5   11 NOV 2022 
considered stable, or until all attempts to determine the resolution of the event are 
exhausted. All AEs that are unresolved at study completion (or at the last visit completed 
for early withdrawal subjects) will be recorded as ongoing at study end. 
6.4.[ADDRESS_421378] be reported by [CONTACT_340539] 72 hours of becoming aware of the event to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_340540]. A notification containing the pertinent data will be automatically generated by [CONTACT_340541]. If applicable, supporting SAE documentation 
should be de-identified and provided to the Clinical Trial Leader. The report of an SAE by 
a study site does not constitute an admission that study personnel or the user facility (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic) caused or contributed to the event. The study site is also responsible for submitting SAEs to the reviewing IRB/EC per their IRB/EC procedures.  
7.[ADDRESS_421379] complaint may or may not be associated with an AE/SAE.
7.[ADDRESS_421380] be emailed to the Sponsor Customer Complaint team at the following email address: 
[EMAIL_6582] 
The sites will report Product Complaints by [CONTACT_340542]. If a product complaint is related to a safety event, the site must complete an AE eCRF as well. One copy of the processed form should be kept on-site and the device should be retained. Sponsor representatives will organize collection of the device for evaluation as needed. 
7.1.2 Reporting of Approved Marketed Devices and Commercially Available 
Devices (not Ethicon) 
The site should report Product Complaints of non-Ethicon devices that are approved 
marketed devices or commercially available medical devices according to the specific 
product’s manufacturer specifications/guidelines.

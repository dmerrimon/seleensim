Date: January  19, [ADDRESS_226243] common malignancy in women worldwide, and 528,000  new 
cases are diagnosed annually  and approximately 266,000  deaths occur annually from the disease  
[1]. The link between  human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597]  (HPV ) infection and the development of cervical 
cancer is well known [2]. Among more than [ADDRESS_226244] 15 are strongly 
associated with invasive squamous cell cancer of the cervix [3], with  human papi[INVESTIGATOR_61382] 
16 (HPV 16 ) being the most common of these [4-6]. HPV infection is also associated with the 
precursor lesion of cervical cancer, squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] ( SIL) [4-9]. Most low-grade 
squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] ( LSILs ) regress sponta neously [10, 11], though some do progress 
to high-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184] ( HSILs ). These high -grade lesions, particularly 
cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] ( CIN) 3, are associated with high rates of progression to invasive 
cervic al cancer [12, 13]. 
 
Although prophylactic vaccines that would prevent HPV infection and subsequent development of 
cervical cancer are available, they are not effective in individuals who already have acquired HPV. 
Therefore, a therapeutic vaccine, which ca n treat those who are already infected, including women 
diagnosed with HSIL,  is needed but none is clinically available. Such a vaccine would be expected 
to benefit young women (narrowly defined as ≤24 years old and broadly defined as any women 
who still p lans to become pregnant [14]) since a recently recognized and unintended side effect of 
surgical treatments for HSIL such as LEEP is increased incidence of preterm delivery from 4.4% 
to 8.9% [14, 15]. Therefore, t he new treatment guidelines published in 2013 recommends one to 
two years of close observation in young women with cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN) 2. 
Furthermore, an HPV therapeutic vaccine, which only requires injections, can benefit women from 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_190456].  
 
Our group has developed a vaccine consisting of four clinical good manufacturing practice (cGMP) 
grade synthetic peptides covering the HPV type [ADDRESS_226245] reagent as a 
novel vaccine adjuvant (named PepCan). The dose-escalation portion of the Phase I clinical trial of 
the therapeutic vaccine treating wom en with biopsy -confirmed HSILs has recently been completed  
(the final dose phase usi ng the clinically optimal dose of 50 g per peptide is still ongoing) . No 
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)  [vaccine -related allergic and autoimmune adverse events (AEs) > 
Grade 1 and any other AEs  > 2 Grade  2] have been observed. T he highest % of histological 
regression was obse rved in the lowest dose (50 g per peptide) group (5 of 6 or 83%) with the 
overall (50, 100, 250, and 500 g per peptide doses were tested) response rate of 52% (12 of 23). 
Both these rates are  above that of a historical pla cebo group of 22% [16]. Both subjects with HPV 
[ADDRESS_226246] takes 1 year [17-19] to manifest as demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_190509] l regression from 25% to 47% of vulvar intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_190457] 
a similar vaccine [18]. 
 
This phase II clinical trial aims to assess the full clinica l efficacy of PepCan  by [CONTACT_190510] [ADDRESS_226247] which non -16 HPV types this vaccine is effective. Candin®  alone will also 
be examined. Approximately 125  subjects wi ll be screened and 8 0 subjects will be vaccinated over 
3.5 to 4.5 years.  If needed additional year can be added.

 SCIENTIFI C RATIONALE  
1.3.1 Rationale for Using HPV Peptides as the Antigen  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Importance of the T -Cell Responses to HPV 16  E6 Protein in Viral Clearance  
The National Cancer Institute ( NCI)-supported study conducted by [CONTACT_182279] -Barbara Moscicki, MD, 
was one of the first to descr ibe the relationship between viral persistence and development of SILs 
[20-22]. Women were recru ited at the San Francisco State University Medical Clinic and the 
Hayward Planned Parenthood Clinic. A total of 654 women were actively followed via clinic visits 
every 4 months. At the se visits, a sexual -history interview, Pap smear, colposcopy, and HPV -
deoxyribonucleoic acid ( DNA ) testing on cervical lavage specimens were performed. Mayumi 
Nakagawa, MD, PhD [principal investigator (PI)], first studied T -cell immun ity against HPV in 
this cohort.  
 
HPV 16  E6- and E7 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) were demonstrated in subjects who 
had evidence of HPV 16  infections but had not developed SILs [23-25]. In a small cross -sectional 
study, the percentage of subjects who demonstrated HPV 16  E6- and/or E7 -specific CTLs was 
higher in the group of women with HPV 16  infections without SILs than in the group o f women 
with HPV 16  infections who developed SILs [23]. 
 
In women with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -detected cervical HPV 16  infections (from the 
same cohort described above), we examined the association between HPV 16  E6- and E7 -specific 
CTLs and HPV 16  persistence, using a longitudinal study design involvin g multiple CTL assays 
[25]. Women with HPV 16  infections (n=51) were enrolled, along with women who were HPV 16  
negative as controls (n=3). Twenty -two of 40 (55%) women whose HPV [ADDRESS_226248] one E6 CTL response, while none of the nine women who had HPV 16  persistence 
had such a response ( p=.003). This difference was not demonstrated for E7; 25 of 40 (63%) women 
whose HPV [ADDRESS_226249] L responses, and five of nine (56%) women with 
persistent infections had responses ( p=.720). Therefore, the CTL response to E6 appears to be 
important in clearing HPV 16  infection . We also examined whether these T -cells were CD4 - 
and/or CD8 -positive using antibody blocking and T -cell subset separation experiments, and we 
demonstrated that both CD4 - and CD8 -positive T -lymphocytes demonstrated anti -HPV activities 
[24]. 
 
In a subsequent study (same cohort) with the same design, we found similar results using ex vivo  
interferon ( IFN)-γ enzyme -linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assays instead of CTL assays [26]. 
Fourteen of 24 (58%) women whose HPV [ADDRESS_226250] 
once, while none of 10 (0%) women who had HPV 16  persistence had a response ( p=.002). For E7, 
8 of 24 (33%) women whose HPV 16  infections cleared each h ad an E7 CTL response, and none 
of 10 (0%) women with persistence had such a response ( p=.04). These results confirmed the 
importance of T -cell responses to E6 and indicate d that E7 may also play a role.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Importance of the CD8 and CD4 T-Cell Response s to HPV 16  E6 in Regressio n of Cervical 
Lesions  
Eighty -five subjects with recent histories of untreated abnormal Pap smears were recruited from 
the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics 
between 1/11/07 and 7/15/08. HPV -DNA tests using the Linear Array HPV G enotypi[INVESTIGATOR_190458] 
([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and ELISPOT assays using the HPV 16  antigens were 
performed  on cervical cytology specimens (ThinPrep, Cytyc Corporation, Marlborough, MA)  [27, 
28]. From whole -blood –derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ), CD8 T -cell lines 
were established by [CONTACT_190511]8 T -cells with 
autologous mature DCs infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing E6 or E7 (E6 -vac

Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 9 or E7 -vac), and the pattern of immunodominance was examined with ELISPOT assays using 15 -
mer peptides that overlap by 10 amino acids [28]. Evidence of potential antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_190459] -forming units greater than twic e the amount for the n o-peptide control. The subjects 
with subsequent normal histological diagnoses were considered to be regressors (n=28) while those 
with histological diagnoses of CIN 1, 2, or 3 were considered to be persistors (n=37). The 
indeterminate group included subjec ts (n=20) for whom diagnoses were equivocal (such as atypi[INVESTIGATOR_190460]) or for whom insuf ficient 
samples were submitted.  
 
CD8 T -cell responses to the HPV 16  E6 antigen were significantly higher for the regressor group 
compared to the persistor group (54% vs. 24%, p=.04), but this was not observed for the E7 antigen 
(11% for the regressor group, 12% for the persistor group; p =1.00) . The results were the same when 
the analyses included only subjects who were positive for high -risk HPV (n=48, p=0.01 for E6 and 
p=0.64 for E7). These results suggest not only that  CD8 T -cell responses to HPV [ADDRESS_226251] E6 91 –115 (n=11), E7 46 –70 (n=10), 
and E6 46 –70 (n=8). Similar results were obtained when CD4 T -cell response s were studied  in 84 
additional subjects from the same clinic  [29]. Significantly higher responses were seen in the 
regressor group for the E6 antigen compared to the persistor group (45% vs. 20%, p=0.02).  Again 
no such difference was seen for E7 (15% vs. 6%, p=0.25).  Theref ore, HPV 16 E6 protein would be 
an ideal antigen for a therapeutic HPV vaccine.  
 
In vitro investigation has 
unexpectedly revealed that 
the four cGMP peptides 
covering the HPV 16 E6 
protein has maturation 
effects on Langerhans cells 
(LCs) as measured by [CONTACT_25764] -
regulated CD40 
(p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) and CD80 
(p<0.[ZIP_CODE]) levels  [30]. 
These  maturation effects 
are likely  to be due to the 
formation of microparticles 
(Fig. 1) by [CONTACT_190512] (which 
are soluble in acidic pH  of 
the formulation) at a neutral 
pH. As in soluble 
microparticles are likely to 
be phagocytosed by [CONTACT_190513],  the immediate and delayed injection site 
reactions observed during the Phase I clinical trial (Fig. 1) may be due to these microparticles.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Search for a New and Effective Vaccine Adjuvant  
Four  current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) -grade synthetic peptides, covering the HPV 16 
E6 protein, are incorporated into PepCan since it has been shown to contain CD8 and CD4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_190462] w ith SIL regression . The advantages of using synthetic pep tides are (1) ease of 
producing cGMP -grade material, (2) general safety profiles in previous clinical trials [31-38], and 
(3) much lower concern for oncoge nicity of the E6 protein , which have mutagenic properties as 
whole proteins.  
 
The most widely used adjuvant in approved human vaccines is an alum -based adjuvant that has 
been shown to elicit a predominantly Th2 immune response  [39]. Therefore, the alum -based 
adjuvant would be useful in a vaccine designed to boost antibody responses, but not for a vaccine 
designed to stimulate cellular immune responses. Since successful clearance of HPV infection is 
believe d to be induced by [CONTACT_79371] -mediated immunity  17, 18, an adjuvant that would promote such 
immunity  is necessary.  
 
Traditionally, recall antigens, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] a panel of Candida, mumps, and 
Trichophyton, were used as a control to indicate an intact cellular immunity when patients were 
being tested for Tuberculosis by [CONTACT_190514]. T -cell mediated inflammation 
would become evid ent in 24 to 48 hours  [40]. A number of studies, mostly from UAMS, have 
demonstrated that recall antigen injections can also be used to treat common warts  [41-46]. 
Furthermore, several studies have shown that the treatment of warts with recall antigens to be 
effective for not only injected warts but also distant untreated warts [41-45, 47]. This suggested 
that T -cells may have a role in wart regression. In a recently completed Phase I investigational new 
drug study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in which the largest wart was treated with Candin® (Allermed, San 
Diego, CA), a colorless extract of Candida albicans, our group reported complete resolution of the 
treated warts in 82% (nine of 11) of the subjects, and complete resolution of distant untreated warts 
in 75% (six of eight) of the subjects  [47] Furthermore, T -cell responses to the HPV 57 L1 peptide 
were detected in 67% (six of nine) of the complete responders. Because of these immune -enhancing 
and possible anti -HPV effects of Candin ®, the idea of using Candin ® as a vaccine adjuvant came 
about. In vitro  work perfor med by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nakagawa’s group  showed that Candin ® has T -cell 
proliferative effect, and that the most frequently produce d cytokine by [CONTACT_190515] ® 
with and without vacci ne peptides was interleuk in -12 (IL-12), which promotes T -cell response  
[30, 48] 
 
1.3.3 Preclinical Safety Data for the Use of HPV Peptides -Candin ® Vaccine  in M ice 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale  
Although Candin ® antigen is FDA -approved for human use, the HPV peptide -Candin ® 
combination has never been tested. HPV 16  E6 protein has been known to mount T -cell immun ity 
in C57BL/6 mice , so we chose  this animal model to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the 
putative vaccine [49]. Only female mice were  examined because the vaccine is being developed 
for women.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Approach  
The safety of the HPV peptide -Candin® combination was  examined in mice by a multiple -dose 
toxicity study (GLP) . The 25 and 50 g per peptide  doses (corresponding to the two highest doses 
to be used in the human clinical trial) were used, which were 25 times the human equivalent when 
adjusted for body surface area.  These studies were  conducted at the Southern Research Institute.

Formu lation : Because the CD4 and CD8 T -cell responses to HPV 16  E6 protein are significantly 
associated with cervical lesion regression  [27, 29], the proposed vaccine will consist of  four HPV 
16 E6 peptides:  
 
E6 1–45 (Ac-MHQKRTAMFQDPQERPRKLPQLCTELQTTIHDIILECVYCKQQLL -NH2 ) 
E6 46 –80 (Ac-RREVYDFAFRDLCIVYRDGNPYAVCDKCLKFYSKI -NH2 ) 
E6 81 –115 ( Ac-SEYRHYCYSLYGTTLEQQYNKPLCDLLIRCINCQK -NH2 ) 
E6 116 –158 ( Ac-PLCPEEKQRHLDKKQRFHNIRGRWTGRCMSCCRSSRTRRETQL -NH2 ) 
(US Patent No. 8,652,482 ). 
 
The cGMP -grade peptides  were produced by [CONTACT_190516] (San Jose, CA) . The y were 
formulated, vialed, and lyophilized at 550 µg per peptide by [CONTACT_190517], Inc. (Camarillo, CA), 
and were reconstituted with 770 µL of sterile water per vial. After adding Candin ®, the mixture 
was mixed  lightly prior to inoculation.  
 
Schedule : Four administrations 3 weeks apart were planned for the 
Phase I trial; t herefore, we perform ed five administrations in the 
animal study as recommended, but the frequency was  shortened to 
weekly inoculations (days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29). The do rsal side of 
each animal was divided into four  areas, and the anima ls were dosed 
using a volume of 100 µL/mouse on each dosing day. The dose on 
each day was split approximately equally b etween two  sites (areas 
1 and 2 on days1 , 15, and 29;  areas 3 and 4 on day s 8 and 22)  as 
shown in Fig. 2.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Results  
All mice in all dose groups  survived to scheduled necropsy.  
Administration of vehicle, Candin ®, low or h igh dose peptides 
without Candin ®, or low or high dose peptides with C andin ® had 
no effect on body weights, body temperatures, food consumption, 
or absolute or relative organ weights of mice. Clinical signs 
associated with treatment included scabs and sore/ulcer at the 
dosing sites; these signs appeared shortly after dosing, and r esolved with in a few days after 
appearance. Scabs and sore/ulcer at the dosing sites appeared sporadically in all dose groups 
(including the vehicle control) with no dose response in incidence, and were therefore considered 
to have been due to the treatmen t procedure itself rather than to the peptides, Candin ®, or the 
combination. The only change in clinical pathology parameters that was considered to be 
potentially related to peptide and adjuvant administration was a statistically significant but minimal 
elevation in the mean eosinophil count that was observed on Day  32 for mice treated with 50  µg of 
each of the four peptides with  Candin ®, compared to the mean value for mice in the vehicle control 
group.  This finding was transient and was not reported on Da y 60. Microscopic observations on 
Day [ADDRESS_226253] article -related lesions were found in mice that received any formulations containing 
peptide s (Groups 3 -6) and included chr onic-active inflammation consisted of infiltrations of 
neutrophi ls, eosinophils, and  mononuclear cells.  The findings on Day 60 were more chr onic in 
nature.  Primarily mononuclear cells were seen with scattered neutrophils and eosinophils.  
Treatment with the  peptides with or without Candin® , and treatment with Candin®  alone had no 
effect on  the ability of spleen cells to secrete IFN -γ following overnight stimulation.  The only test Fig. 2. Areas of serial

 SUMMARY OF  PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL  
1.4.1 Methods  
A single -arm, open -label, p hase I clinical trial was performed  to evaluate the safety of PepCan in 
adult females with biopsy -confirmed HSIL.  A dose -escalation phase has been completed in which  
doses of 50, 100, 250, and 500 g/peptide/dose (6 subjects/dose level; 4 doses/subject with 3 weeks 
between each dose) were evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the clinically 
optimal dose (COD), and the immunologically optimal dose (IOD).  Blood wa s drawn for CD3 
ELIS POT (to assess CD4 and CD8 responses) and immune suppressor cell analysis before and after 
the second and fourt h injections.  HPV -DNA testing wa s performed before and after the four 
injections.  Clinical response wa s assessed by [CONTACT_190519] 3 months 
after the fourth injection.  Subjects who no longer had HSILs were considered to be complete 
responders, and those with HSILs measuring ≤ 0.2mm2 were considered to be partial responders. 
The final dose phase in which  additional [ADDRESS_226256] s were  vaccinated at the COD  dose of 50 
g/peptide/dose was also performed . 
 
1.4.2 Accrual  
At the end of the Phase I study , 52 subjects were  enrolled, and 34 received the vaccin e. Thirty -one 
subjects c omplete d the study  (mean age of 30.8 ± 6.7 years old). 
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_226257] common AE s were injection -site reactions both immedi ate and delayed ( Table 
2, Fig. 1 ). Although delayed injection -site reaction was defined as occurring at or more than 24 
hours after injection, it was not uncommon for it to appear a few to several days after injection. 
More G rade 2 immediate and delayed injection site reactions , but not del ayed injection -site 
reactions,  were recorded at the higher two doses compared to the lower two doses(odds ratio of 6.3 
[1.98, 20.3], p<0.0001, for the immediate reaction; and 2.0 [0.6, 7.1], p=0.3, for the delayed 
reaction). In most cases, the  injection -site reactions were  are easily managed by [CONTACT_190520][INVESTIGATOR_37184] -the-counter steroid cream. These reactions do not seem to be delayed -type 
hypersensitivity reaction, which  should appear within 72 hours. Based on the timing of their 
appearance, th ese reactions may be manifestation of de novo  immune stimulation [50]. 
 
Other vaccine -related or possibly vaccine -related adverse events, which occurred with ≥ 5% of 
injections, in the order of decreasing number of occurrences, were myalgia, headache, nausea, 
fatigue, hypokalemia, feeling feverish, and flu-like symptoms ( Table 2 ). None of these adverse 
events  was more than grade 2 ; these adverse events  were self -limiting. One subject experienced 
asymptomatic hypokalemia requiring treatment with oral replacement potassium (Micro -K 10 mEq 
per day for 7 day s) during the vaccination phase. Her potassium level increased from 3.0 mEq/L to 
3.4 mEq/L within 3 weeks, and normalized to 3.8 mEq/L within 3 months.  
 
1.4.4 Clinical response  
The histological response rates in order of increasing doses were 50%, 50%, and 33%, and 40% 
(Table 3 ). The overall histological response rate was 45%, and none progressed to cervical 
squamous cell carcinoma. In comparison, a historical placebo group in another clinical trial of HPV 
therapeutic vaccine with a similar study reported a regre ssion rate of 22% [No statistically 
significant differences were detected when histological response rates were compared (1) between 
subjects with entry diagnosis of CIN 2 versus CIN3, (2) between subjects ≤ 25 years of age versus 
> 25 years of age, and (3 ) between subjects who were HPV -16-positive versus those who were not.

Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 15 The mean number of cervical quadrants with visible lesions decreased significantly from 1.9 
quadrants to 0.8 quadrants after vaccination ( p=0.001).  
 
1.4.[ADDRESS_226258] one HPV type present at entry became undetectable in 21 of 31 (70%) patients  (Table 3 ). 
By [CONTACT_42372], the rates were 85%, 50%, 50%, and 40% with the highest undetectability at the lowest 
dose.  
 
1.4.6 Immunological response  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Systemic  
Immunological responses t o HPV -[ADDRESS_226259] one new E6 region 
and for the increase in response being statistically significant ( Table 3 ). The lowest respons e rate 
was observed in the 500 -μg dose level. No immunodominant HPV -16 E6 region was identified and 
the number of regions to which new immune responses were detected was also variable ( Fig. 3 ). 
 
Immune profiling ( Fig. 4 , upper panel) showed statistically s ignificant increases in circulating Th1 
cells after 2 ( p=0.02) and 4 vaccinations ( p=0.0004). Th2 cells initially increased significantly 
(p=0.01) but decreased to below baseline level after 4 vaccinations, although not significantly. Treg 
levels were mini mally changed. The differences in Treg levels prevaccination ( p=0.03) and post -2 
vaccinations ( p=0.04) between these two groups were statistically significant ( Fig. 4 , lower panel).  
 
Fig. [ADDRESS_226260]. Samples from different visits were tested with ove rlappi[INVESTIGATOR_190463], and each region was tested in triplicate. Results are shown for subjects with statistically 
significant increases to the E6 peptides, and the regions with significant increases (paired t -test) are marked by “*”.  
Subjects 4 and 11 also had a significant increase to E7 (marked by “e”), which may represent the first examples of

 RATIONALE FOR PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL  
1.5.[ADDRESS_226262] established HPV infections  
[51]. Gardasil, a q uadrivalent HPV L1 virus -like particle prophylactic vaccine (HPV types 16, 18, 
6, and 11), was the first to be FDA -approved in 2006; a bivalent version (HPV types 16 and 18), 
Cervarix, was approved by [CONTACT_190522]. Clinical trials have demonst rated excellent 
vaccine efficacy in women negative for HPV 16 or HPV 18 [52, 53], but the duration of  protection 
remains to be determined, and a study of the bivalent vaccine showed no evidence of enhanced 
viral clearance in women with pre -existing HPV infections (n=1,259; 35.5% clearance in 
vaccinated group, 31.5% in a group receiving a negative control vaccine, p=NS) [51]. Therefore, 
therapeutic vaccines are needed for cases in which HPV infection is already established and in 
which HPV -related diseases have al ready developed. This is the particularly true because the 
prophylactic vaccine coverage rate in the targeted group (girls aged 13 –17 years) has been reported 
to be only 32% nationally  [54]. Although the standard surgical treatments for HSILs such as LEEP 
are very effective  [14], their unintended side effect of increased incidence of preterm delivery from 
4.4% to 8.9%  [14, 15] has become a concern. Henceforth, the latest guideline no longer 
recomm ends treatment for CIN2 in young women (narrowly defined as ≤24 years old and broadly 
defined as any women who still  plans to become pregnant  [14]). Treatment is  still recommended 
for CIN3 but observation is now consi dered acceptable. A new treatment, which does not alter the 
anatomical integrity of the cervix like the HPV therapeutic vaccine,  is very much needed. In short, 
HPV therapeutic vaccines are needed  because (1) prophylactic vaccines are not effective against 
established HPV infection, (2) utilization of the prophylactic vaccines has been low, (3) therapeutic 
vaccines would leave the cervix intact and would likely not increase the risk of preterm deli veries, 
and (4) therapeutic vaccine maybe effective against other cancers caused by [CONTACT_190523], 
oropharyngeal, penile, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 18 1.5.2 Rationale for Proposed Dose of HPV Peptides  
In the Phase I clinical trial, four dose levels (50, 100, 250, and 500 g per peptide) were tested. 
These  four dose levels were chosen based on information available in the literature. Published 
studies of clinical trials using various peptide vaccines reported using doses that range from 5 –
3,000 g per peptide [31-38]. Optimal doses (and smaller doses if two dose levels were the same) 
for achieving immunogenicity differed greatly among the vaccines: 30 g of 96 -mer malaria 
peptide [31], 500 g of 9 -mer peptide for treating prostate ca ncer [34], 50 g each of 13 HPV 16 
E6 and E7 peptides ranging from 25 to 35 amino acids long [35]. Therefore, the dose levels likely 
to elicit the optimal immunogenicity were chosen.  
 
The dose-escalation portion of the Phase I clinical trial has demonstrated that the 50 
g/peptide/injection was optimal in terms of histological regression, viral clearance, and vaccine -
induced immune responses ( Table 3 ). Therefore, this dose will be used for the Phase II clinical 
trial. 
 
1.5.3 Rationale for Proposed Dose of Candin®  
Three hundred  (300) µL of Candin®  will be administer ed per injection , which was the amount used 
for intralesional injection of warts  [47, 55], as well as the amount of Candin®  as a vaccine adjuvant 
in the Phase I clinical trial. The same amount will be used for the Phase II clinical trial as th is 
amount has been shown to be safe and effective.  
 
1.5.4 Rationale for Proposed Route of Injections  
Intradermal route of administration will be use d to make use of LC s as antigen -presenting cells. A 
Phase I clinical trial of a peptide vaccine for prostate cance r administered through this route has 
shown promising immunogenicity [34]. This route has also been shown to be safe, effective, and 
immunogenic in the Phase I clinical trial, and will be used for the Phase II clinical trial.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_226263] been chosen as the site of administration because of the ease of access as well as 
availability of sufficient data demonstrating efficacy of HPV peptides delivered at these sites [35, 
56]. As injecting in limbs has shown to be safe, effective, and immunogenic in the Phase I clinical 
trial, the same sites will be used for injection in the Phase II clinical trial.  
 
1.5.6 Rationale for Number of Injection s 
In published studies of peptide vaccines, the total number of injections ranged from 2 to 17 [31-
38]. We propose d to use four injections b ecause Hueman et al. demonstrated that immunogenicity 
peaked after four injections (six injections in total were given in the study) [34], and four injections 
appeared to be sufficient in the Phase I clinical trial.  
 
1.5.7 Rationale for Interval between Injections  
The interval between injections ranged from 2 weeks to 90 days in the published studies [31-38], 
but most used a 3 -week interval. Kenter and colleagues reported that peptide vaccine 
immunogenicity measured by [CONTACT_20129] - ELISPOT assay was less p revalent when blood samples were 
drawn [ADDRESS_226264] 
vaccination [35]. Therefore, we chose the 3 -week (± 7 days) interval because it appears to be long 
enough to allow sufficient mounting of immune responses.  As this inte rval has been shown to be 
safe, effective, and immunogenic, the same interval will be used in the Phase II clinical trial.

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, [ADDRESS_226265] is known to take 1 year [17-19] . In the Phase II clinical 
trial, PepCan will be administered as an alternative to LEEP, and histological response will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_190524] -guided quadrant biopsies  [ADDRESS_226266] injection ( Fig. 
6). In a clinical trial which used a similar peptide -based HPV therapeutic vaccine to treat high -
grade vulvar intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184], histological regression increased from 25% to 47%  between [ADDRESS_226267] -vaccinations  [18]. 
 
1.5.9 Rationale for Primary Outcome Measure: Efficacy  
The clinical response to evaluate the vaccine efficacy will  be assessed by [CONTACT_190525] (having had HSIL to qualify for vaccination) and the 
12-Month Visit (± 2 weeks)  (Fig. 6). LEEP will not be performed to assess efficacy, but it will be 
offered at no cost to sub jects who have persistent HSILs at the 12 Mo Visit.  
 
The design of the proposed Phase II trial is single -site, and randomized to 2 treatment arms in a 
double -blinded fashion. We will use a historical placebo group from a clinical trial with similar 
design (i.e., enrollment of subjects with biopsy -proven CIN2/3, and clinical response assessed by 
[CONTACT_190526] 15 month) for comparison  [57]. The overall histological regression rate in the dose -
escalation Phase I clinical trial was 52%  three months after the last vaccination , and this is expected 
to substantially increase with an extended 12-month observation period. [18] Assuming a 
conservative rate of 60%, n=35 in the PepCan arm would give 91% power (two -tailed, =0.05) for 
detecting a statistically significant difference from the historical placebo group which had a 29% 
(34 of 117) regression rate  [57]. Althoug h there is greater uncertainty regarding the Candin® -only 
arm, there is ≥90% power to detect a significant differences between the PepCan and Candin®  
arms under multiple plausible scenarios (for example, regression rates of 67% vs. 29%, or 85% vs. 
50%).  Forty subjects in each arm will be enrolled to ensure that at least 35 subjects in each would 
complete the study. While the use of historical placebo group is not as rigorous as having a 
concurrent placebo group, a concurrent placebo group with biopsy -proven  CIN2/3 that would go 
untreated for 12 months  would be difficult to ethically justify . 
 
1.5.10  Rationale for Secondary Outcome Measure: Safety  
The combination of HPV peptides and Candin®  was first tested in the Phase I clinical trial, and 
appears to be safe as no DLTs  have been reported ( Table 2 ). Safety will be assessed in the same 
manner in the Phase II clinical trial using CTCAE 4.03 . 
 
1.5.11  Rationale for Tertiary Outcome Measures: Immunologi cal Response and Viral Clearance  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Measuring HPV -specific T -Cell Response  
HPV -specific CD3 T -cell responses will be assessed using immune assay such as the IFN -γ 
ELISPOT assay before vaccination, after 2 vaccina tions, 6 months after 4 vaccinations, and 12 
months after 4 vaccinations  (Fig. 6). In order to evaluate the role of CD3 T -cells in vaccine efficacy, 
whether clinical response and viral clearance can be predicted based on the CD3 T -cell activities 
will be assessed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Measuring Circulating Immune Cells  
The level of circulating immune cells, including Th1 cells, Th2 cells, regulatory T -cells (Treg) , and  
myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSC), will be assessed before vaccina tion, after 2 
vaccinations, 6 months after 4 vaccinations , and 12 months after 4 vaccinations . The d ata from the 
Phase I clinical t rial indicate d that PepCan may increase Th1  responses (p=0.02) and decrease Th2

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 20 responses resulting in increased effector immune activity ( Fig. 4 ). Whether the levels of these 
circulating immune cells can be used to predict vaccine efficacy in terms of cli nical response and 
viral clearance will be investigated.  Vaccine effects on these factors will also be examined 
throughout the study  (i.e., 6 and 12 months instead of 3 months).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Measuring Viral Clearance  
HPV -DNA te sting will be performed at the Screening V isit, 6-Month Visit, and 12 -Month Visit 
(Fig. 6). In the Phase II study, an HPV type would be considered to be cleared if it is present at the 
Screening Visit but not at the 6 -Month and 12 -Month Visits.  
 
1.5.12  Rationale of Other Outcome Measures:  Predicting Vaccine Response Using Various Factors 
Such as Age, Oral Contraceptive Use, Smoking History, Circulating Immune Cells, HLA 
Types, HPV Types, Cytokine/Chemokine , and Metabolomic  Profiling; Evaluating Vaccine 
Effect; Determining Cross -Protection a nd Examining Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -Spreading and Cross -
Reactivity as Possible Mechanisms  
Not all vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190467]. Some may have persistent HSIL, 
and some may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It would be valuable to identify 
factors that are associated with a favorable response so an educated decision can be made as to who 
should receive the vaccine.  
 
The Phase I clinical trial has indicated that PepCan is effective in HSILs with HPV [ADDRESS_226268] which non -16 HPV types it is effective  may be 
determined.  Furthermore, epi[INVESTIGATOR_190468] -reactivity  may be investigated as possible 
mechanisms behind cross -protection.  
 
1.5.13  Rationale for Adding a Candin®  Arm  
The resul ts of the dose-escalation portion of the Phase I clinical trial showed similar rates of clinical 
responses in subjects with  HSILs associated (4 of 9 or 44 %) and not associated (8 of 14 or 57 %) 
with HPV 16 suggesting that de novo  immune stimulation presumably from Candin®  plays a major 
role. Therefore, Candin®  only treatment arm will be added to compare efficacy between PepCan 
and Candin® . 
 
1.5.14  Rationa le for Randomization and Double -Blinding  
In order to minimize bias, subjects who are  eligible for vaccination will be randomly assigned to 
one of the two treatment arms (PepCan or Candin® ) in a double -blinded fashion so the subjects 
and study staff (except for p harmacy staff) will not know which treat ment is being administered. 
PepCan and  Candin®  are both clear solutions prepared in the same [ADDRESS_226269] s who qualify for vaccinations are expected to show clinical response 
enabling them to av oid a surgical treatment such as LEEP.  This would be particularly beneficial to 
those who plan to conceive after study participation.

No DLTs were  observed in the phase I trial  (Table 2 ). However, the total number of individuals 
who have received the vaccine is small, and there may  be relative ly rare complications that have 
not surfaced. The m ost commonly reported side effects were local swelling, redness, increased skin

The subjects who are eligible for vaccination will be randomized to two treatment groups ( PepCan  
and Candida) at a 1:[ADDRESS_226271] who exits the study early for any reason, 
the treatment she received will be revealed after completing the Early Termination  Questionnaire.  
 
2 OBJECTIVES  
 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : EFFICACY  
To assess the efficacy of PepCan  and Candin®  in a Phase II clinical trial by [CONTACT_190527] -guided quadrant biopsies  at the 12 -Month 
Visit . Responses will be compared between (1) the PepCan group and a historical placebo group 
[57], (2) the Candin®  group and the same historical placebo group, and (3) the PepCan and 
Candin®  groups. If, upon the 12-Month Visit quadrant  biops ies, a subject does not have any 
evidence of CIN , she would be considered a “complete responder” . If the lesion(s) has (have)  
regressed to  CIN 1,  the subject will be considered to be a “partial responder” . If there is still  CIN 2 
and/or [ADDRESS_226272]  will be considered a “non -responde r”. The 
highest grade among the biopsies will be recorded. In addition to the above analysis of subjects 
who exited after the 12 -Month Visit , another analysis may be performed with addition of  subjects 
who exited the study after the 6 -Month Visit if histological results (biopsy and/or LEEP) are 
available at 6 months .   
 
 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : SAFETY  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_190528] 12 -Month Visit 
according to CTCAE v4.03.

E6 116 -158 ( Ac-PLCP EEKQRHLDKKQRFHNIRGRWTGRCMSCCRSSRTRRETQL -NH2) (US 
Patent No. 8,652,482 ). Commercially prod uced cGMP -grade peptides ( CPC Scientific, San Jose, 
CA) will be examined.  
 
The four peptides will b e provided in a single vial in lyophilize d form  at the 50 μg/peptide/dose , 
and will be stored at -80°C ( ±10°C) except during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_190469].  
 
The UAMS Research Pharmacy will be responsible for peptide receipt, storage, and preparati on

 TREATMENT REGIMEN  
Subjects will receive four injections of PepCan ( 50 µg/peptide/injection) via intradermal injection 
in the extremities with t hree weeks between each injection.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 OVERVIEW  
This is a single site  Phase I I clinical trial of PepCan  for treating women with biopsy -proven HSIL s 
randomized and double -blinded to two treatment arms . Half of the subjects will receive PepCan, 
and the other half will receive Candin®  alone.  The study design closely resembles the latest 
guidelines for treating young women with HSIL  [14]. Study subject s will be patient s attending the 
UAMS Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics with untreated biopsy -proven HSILs  and patients 
referred from other clinics . Four injections (o ne every 3 weeks) of PepCan or Candin®  will be 
intradermally administered in the extremities. Clinical res ponse will be assessed by [CONTACT_190534] -guided biopsy  results  obtained prior to vaccination  and at 12-Month Visit. Safety will 
be monitored fr om the time of enrollment through the 12-Month  Visit. Blood will be drawn for 
laboratory testing and immunological analyses (“blood  test”) prior to injection, after the second  
vaccination , 6 months after the fourth vaccination, and 12 months after the fourth vaccination . 
Blood will be drawn to aid T -cell analyses (“blood draw”) after the first and third v accinati ons, and 
possibly at the Optional Follow -Up and/ or Optional LEEP visits. HPV -DNA testing will be 
performed at Scr eening  and 6- and 12-Mon th Visits (Fig. 6). If a subjec t has persistent HSIL at the 
12-Month Visit or if a subject is withdrawn due to excessive toxicity , she will be given an option 
to return for a LEEP visit.  Alternatively, she may choose to exit the study and be followed by a 
gynecologist  for up to 2 years of observation as recomme nded before surgical treatment [14]. 
 
 RANDOMIZATION TO TREATMENTS  
The study randomization schematic will be constructed by [CONTACT_190535]. Randomization 
will occur after Subject eligibility for vaccinations has been confirmed. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to PepCan or Candin® alone. Randomization will be done in book form 
by [CONTACT_91428].

 MONITORING TOXICITY  
Serious t oxicity will be defined  (using CTCAE v 4.03 ) as drug -related:  
 Grade II or higher allergic reactions. Grade II is defined as  “intervention or infusion 
interruption indicated; responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, 
NSAIDS, narcotics); prophylactic medications indicated for ≤  24 hours ”. Grade III is defined 
as “prolonged (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or brief interruption 
of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151465] (e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates) ”. 
 Grade II or higher autoimmune reactions. Grade II is defined as “evidence of autoimmune 
reaction involving a non -essential organ or function (e.g., hypothyroidism) ”. Grade III is 
defined as “autoimmune reactions i nvolving major organ ( e.g., colitis, anemia, myocardit is, 
kidney) ”. 
 Any Grade III or higher event.  
 
Any subject who experiences  serious  toxicity  will be discontinued from the study.  
 
 INTERRUPTION  
In case of prolonged unavailability of vaccine peptides , such as due to faili ng stability testing and 
need  to manufacture a new lot, all subjects being vaccinated will receive Candin®  for the remaining 
injections.  Subjects starting vaccination will be assigned to the Candin®  group. After a new lo t of 
peptides become available,  randomization will resume with the following possible modifications: 
(1) the number of subjects to be recruited in the Candin®  group will be decreased by [CONTACT_190536]# 202790 A phase II clinical trial of PepCan  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_190451], MD, PhD

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 26 of subjects recruited into the Candin®  group during the interruption, and  (2) the number of subjects 
in the PepCan group will be increased by [CONTACT_190537]®  during the interruption.  To protect study blinding, UAMS  ORRA  Quality 
Assurance will communicate directly with  Research Pharmacy and the statistical team. No 
information rega rding which vaccination (PepCan  or Candin® ) any subjects are receiving will be 
revealed to the rest of the study team including the Principal Investigator.  
 
 STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442]  
4.5.[ADDRESS_226275]  
 A subjec t should be withdrawn from the study at any point if pelvic examination and 
histological analysis show evidence of an invasive squamous cell cervical carcinoma or if there 
is a clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_190470] u nexplained, 
prolonged vaginal bleeding.  This is to allow the subject to receive the proper work -up and 
treatment . The subject may proceed to  the optional LEEP visit if determined to be beneficial 
by a study physician.  Should a cervical cancer diagnosis be confirmed during the subject’s 
study participation, the subject may receive a hysterectomy if it is determined to be medically 
necessary.  
 If a subject becomes pregnant during her participation in the study, a medical monitor will 
determine whether or not s he should be removed from the study.  Medical records will be 
requested  to determine the health of the mother and child.  
 
4.5.2 For study  
 The study enrollment and vaccine administration will be suspended if any subject experiences 
vaccine -related Grad e IV or higher AE. These activities can re -start only after notifying the 
applicable regulatory authorities and with a permission to resume from the Medical Monitor .

8 OUTCOME MEASURES  
 CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS  (UAMS Pathology Laboratory)  
Clinical  response will be assessed (by [CONTACT_190543]) by 
[CONTACT_190544]  (having had HSIL is the inclusion criterion) with 
the quadrant  biops ies performed at the [ADDRESS_226298] will be considered a “complete responder” if the 12 -Month  quadrant biops ies 
are negative for CIN, a “partial responder” if the show  show CIN 1 or a “non -responder” if the 
biopsy shows HSIL  (CIN 2 and/or 3) . In addition to the above analysis of subjects who exited after 
the 12 -Month Visit , another analysis may be performed with addition of  subjects who exited the 
study after the 6 -Month Visit if histological results (biopsy and/or LEEP)  are available at 6 months . 
 
 VIROLOGICAL STUDY  (HPV -DNA  TESTING (Nakagawa Laboratory)  AND 
BACTERIAL TESTING ( University of Chicago Argonne Laboratory ) 
The ThinPrep samples will be tested for the presence of HPV -DNA.  A commercially available kit 
such as the “Linear Array HPV Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_190458]” may be used ([COMPANY_002] Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., 
Alameda, CA ). This kit tests for 37 HPV types ( 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 3 1, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 
53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, IS39, and CP6108 ). 
The human -globin signal will also be assayed as a positive control for sample adequacy for DNA 
content from each sam ple. Positive -control samples (with added HPV plasmid DNA and plasmid -
encoded human -globin gene) and negative -control samples (no HPV plasmid DNA and no human 
-globin gene) will be  provided by [CONTACT_190545]. HPV 
types 31, 33, 35, 52, 58, and 67 will be considered “HPV 16 -Related”, additionally HPV types 18, 
39, 45, 51, 53, 56, 59, 66, 68, 69, 70, 73, and 82 will be considered “High Risk”, and types 6, 11, 
40, 42, 54, 61, 62, 71, 72, 81, 83, 84, and CP6108 will b e considered “Low Risk” [58]. If samples 
are still available after HP V testing, other gene sequencing and gene expression studies may be 
performed  for subjects who agreed in the consent for future use of remaining samples . 
 
The virological response will be assessed by [CONTACT_190546] -DNA testin g results before and after 
vaccination . The subject wil l be considered a “ clearer” if at least one  HPV typ e(s) present before 
vaccination  becomes undetectable at both [ADDRESS_226299] will 
be considered a “persistor”  as long as at least one HPV type was detected at baseline . 
 
The ThinPrep samples will also be 16S rRNA DNA tested to assess the nature and the diversity of 
the cervical microbial community. A commercially available Vaginal Microbiome Genome Mix 
will be used as a positive control, and a li quid in ThinPrep without cervical sampling will be used 
as a negative control. Illumina MiSeq platform will be used for sequencing. The presence and 
abundance of microbiome at the species to phylum levels will be correlated with the vaccine 
response and ot her immunological parameters.

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 38 An immune assay such as an ELISPOT assay to assess the presence of HPV -specific T -cells will 
be performed. After each blood draw, PBMCs will be separated into CD14 + and CD14 – 
populations and cryopreserved. To eliminate interassay variability, all three blood samples (before 
vaccination, after two vaccinations, and after four vaccinations) will be used to establish T -cell 
lines and to perform ELISPOT assays.  CD3 T-cell lines will be established by [CONTACT_190547]3 cells with autologous mature dendritic cells ex posed to HPV [ADDRESS_226300] . ELISPOT assays will be performed as previously described [28]. We typi[INVESTIGATOR_190480] 10  regions within the HPV 16  E6 protein  (E6 1 –25, E6 16 –40, E6 31 –55, E6 46 –70, E6 
61–85, E6 76 –100, E6 91 –115, E6 106 –130, E6 121 –145, and E6 136 –158). The assay will be 
performed in trip licate if sufficient cells  are available . In order to compare each region before 
vaccination and after [ADDRESS_226301] for paired samples will be performed, as described 
previously  [59]. Therefore, each subject will be assessed in terms of the number of regions with 
statistically significant increased T -cell responses after two injections or four injections  determined 
by [CONTACT_2329] S tudent’s paired t-test. Remaining CD3 T -cells may be used to assess the recognition of 
homologous epi[INVESTIGATOR_190481] -risk HPV types, to describe novel epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and/or to assess 
the endogen ous processing of such epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  
 
8.3.2 Measuring Immune  Cells  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Circulating Immune Cells  (Nakagawa Laboratory)  
A small amount of PBMCs ( approximately 3 x 106 cells) from blood draw s at Visit 1, Visit 3, and 
Visit  5 will also be used to monitor levels of circulating immune cells such as Tregs  and MDSC  to 
assess whether vaccination may decrease their levels  [60]. Flow cytometry will be used to 
determine t he number of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+  (Treg) [29] and 
CD11b+CD14+CD33+IL4R
 +HLA -DRint/neg  (MDSC) cell s [29, 61, 62]. T-bet (Th1), GATA3 
(Th2), and/or ROR gammaT (TH17) positive cells may also be examined. The number of 
circulating immune cells  will be determined before vaccination, after two, and after four injections.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cervical Immune Cells  (UAMS Experimental Pathology Core)  
After  routine pathological diagnosis has been  made  from LE EP sample obtained at the Optional 
LEEP Visit, additional sections may be examined for cervical immune cells such as those positive 
for CD3 (T -cell), CD4 (helper T -cell), CD8 (cytotoxic T -cell), CD56 (NK cell) , CD1a (Langerhan 
cells important in antigen presentation), CD20 (B -cell), CD68 (macrophage), FOXP3 (Treg) , T-bet 
(Th1) , and MadCAM -1 (addressin g involved with T -cell infiltration).  Eosinophils (Th2) may also 
be examined.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Others  
Additional analyses that may  be performed using blood samples to assess vaccine response include 
antibody production to HPV proteins, cytokine/chemokine , and metabolomic  responses (Nakagawa 
and Metabolon laborator ies). 
 
9 DATA ANALYSIS  
 ASSESSING EFFICACY  
A historical placebo group, from a previously reported study with a similar study design (i.e., 
enrollment of subjects with biopsy -proven CIN2/3, and clinical response assessed by [CONTACT_190526] 15 
months), will be used for comparison [57]. The strict definition of histolog ical response which only 
considers “complete responders” to be “responders” will be used. Those with any CIN remaining 
would be considered as “non -responders” for the purpose of comparing with the historical placebo  
group . The response rate in PepCan  or Candin®  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190482] 12 -

Version: 19 
Date: January  19, 202 3 Page 39 Month -Visit will be compared with that of the historical placebo group which was 29 .1% (34 of 
117) using binomial  test. The response rates between the PepCan and Candin®  group s will be 
compared  using the Fisher’s exact test . See “ Rationale for Primary Outcome Measure: Efficacy ” 
(Section 1.5.9)  for power analysis and sample size justification.  
 
In addition to the above analysis of subjects who exited after the 12 -Month Visit, another analysis 
may be performed with addition of subjects who exited the study after the 6 -Month Visit if 
histological results (biopsy and/or LEEP) are available at 6 m onths . As 21 patients in the placebo 
arm were removed from the study at 3 or 6 months for having persistent biopsy -proven CIN3  [57], 
the response rate of 24.6%  (34 of 138)  will be used fo r this comparison.  
 
For an intention -to-treat analysis, all subjects who qualified for vaccination will be included 
regardless of whether any vaccinations were received. In the historical placebo group, 149 subjects 
were r andomized and qualified for vaccination  [57]. Therefore, the placebo response rate for this 
analysis will be 22.8% (34 of 149).  
 ASSESSING SAFETY: SUMM ARY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Subjects who received at least one dose of PepCan or Candin®  will be included in safety 
assessments.  Results will be tabulated as shown in Table 2 . The type of adverse reactions, the 
CTCAE grades, and whether the reactions are vaccine -related will be indicated.  
 
 ASSESSING IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND VIRAL CLEARANCE  
9.3.1 Immunological Response  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CD3 T -Cell Response to HPV  
As described above, a  paired  t-test for paired samples will be performed in order to compare each 
region  with increased positivity index after 2 or 4 injections  compared to pre -vaccination , as shown 
in Fig. 3 for the PepCan arm . An analogous analysis will be performed for the Candin® arm, and 
the number of regions with statistically significant increases will be compared between the two 
treatment arms to elucidate the additive effects of the E6 peptides.  
 
A correlation between CD3 T -cell response to HPV and clinical res ponse will be examined by 
[CONTACT_740] a contingency table for a number of subjects with at least one region with statistically 
significant increase to E6 in “responders” and “non -responders”  separately for the PepCan  and 
Candin®  groups . Fisher’s exact test wil l be used.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Circulating Immune Cells  
The changes in percentage of circul ating immune cells such as Th1, Th2, Treg, and MDS C will be 
compared after 2, [ADDRESS_226302] ANOVA will be performed to determine statistical 
significance  separately for the PepCan  and Candin®  groups . 
 
The differences between the percentages of each circulating immune cell types will be compared 
between the “responders” and the  “non -responders” at pre -vaccination, post -[ADDRESS_226303] separately for the PepCan  and Candin®  groups . 
 
9.3.2 Viral Clearance  and Microbial Community  
HPV -DNA and bacterial testing will performed using Thin -Prep samples from Screening, 6 -Month, 
and 12 -Month Visits.

A correlation between clinical response and virological response (at least one HPV type becoming 
undetectable after vaccination) will be examined by  [CONTACT_740] a contingency table for responder vs. 
non-responders and HPV persistence vs. HPV clearance  separately for the PepCan  and Candin®  
groups . Fisher’s exact test will be used.  The presence and abundance of microbial taxa from species 
to phylum level wi ll be correlated with clinical response and other immunological parameters.  
 
 FACTORS CONTRIBUTI NG TO STUDY RECRUITMENT AND RETE NTION  
Based on data provided in “Screening Visit Questionnaire”, “Early Te rmination Questionnaire”, 
and “12 -Month  Visit Questionn aire”, factors that contribute to subject recruitment and reten tion 
may be assessed.  The Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare factors such as frequent use of 
Facebook private group, motivation for entering the study, or having young children will be  
compared between the subjects who are withdrawn  from  the study early and the subjects who 
completed the study.

 DEFINITIONS  
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, symptom, 
or disease that is temporally associated with the use of the vaccine, and it will be graded according 
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. Local and/or 
systemic adverse events may include itching, burning, pain, peeli ng, rash, oozing, redness, 
tenderness, scarring, fever, nausea, dizziness, and wheezi ng. The subjects will be allowed  to use 
and provided analgesics (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) according to the appropriate dosages after 
injections to limit any adverse events that may o ccur.  Any adverse event will be reviewed and  
considered related or not related to the vaccine.  All applicable events will be reported to the IRB 
according to IRB policy 10.2 and the FDA according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is any medical event that : 
 Results in death  
 Is an immediate threat to life  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or  
 Other important medical events that have not resulted in death, are not life -threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious adverse events when, based upon the 
appropriate medical judgment, they are considered to jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above .

Adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until the 12 -Month Visit . 
 
10.2.2  Collecting Procedure  
Adverse events may be uncovered through any of these methods:  
 Observing the subject  
 Asking the subject to keep “Subject Diary”  
 Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject  
 
All adverse events will be recorded in either CRF and/or Communication Note as appropriate.  In 
addition, all adverse events  will be recorded in AERS.  
 
10.2.3  Relationship to the Investigational Drug  
The relationship between the adverse event and the investigational drug should be assessed using 
the following categories:  
 Definitely Related:  A direct cause and effect relationship betwe en the investigational drug and 
the adverse event exists.  
 Possibly Related:  A direct cause and effect relationship between the investigational drug and 
the adverse event has not been clearly demonstrated, but is likely or very likely.  
 Unlikely Related:  A direct cause and effect relationship between the investigational drug and 
the adverse event is improbably, but not impossible.  
 Unrelated:  The adverse event is definitely not associated with the investigational drug.  
 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.3.[ADDRESS_226306] Reporti ng

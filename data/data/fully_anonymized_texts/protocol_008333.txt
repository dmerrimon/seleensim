Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461054] of care for patients with advanced non- small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring targetable driver gene mutations. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] (EGFR ) activating mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) rearrangements 
define the two best characterized molecular subsets of NSCLC, with remarkable sensitivity to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR and ALK, respectively (1 -14). However, most 
patients relapse on TKI  therapy  within 1 -2 years due to  acquired resistance. The underlying 
mechanism of  resistance at the time of progression can guide the choice of next -line therapy. For 
example, 50 -60% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who relapse on a first- or second-generation 
EGFR inhibitor (i.e., erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib) carry  the EGFR T790M gatekeeper 
mutation, and these p atients can be effectively treated with a third -generation T790M- selective 
EGFR TKI  such as osimertinib (8). Similarly, ALK-positive NSCLC patients who relapse on the 
first-generation ALK TKI crizotinib may then be treated with one of several next-generation 
ALK T KIs (e.g., ceritinib, alectinib, with others in development including brigatinib and 
lorlatinib)  (12-14).  
 Once the available TKI options are exhausted, however, chemotherapy becomes the standard of 
care. In randomized trials assessing the efficacy of first -line platinum- based chemotherapy as  the 
control arm in EGFR - or ALK-positive NSCLC ( i.e., LUX -Lung 3 or PROFILE 1014), responses 
were seen in  ~45% of patients with median progression- free survival (PFS) limited to  ~7 months  
(6, 11). T hese trials , however, were performed in treatment -naïve patients. T he efficacy of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients previously treated with multiple TKIs  may be  significantly  
lower , closer to 20- 30% (2, 15, 16).  Patients with EGFR- or ALK-positive NSCLC who exhaust 
TKIs and also  progress on platinum -based chemotherapy have even more limited therapeutic 
options. In a preliminary report of a  phase III study in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC 
who failed crizotinib and prior chemotherapy, docetaxel or pemet rexed led to responses in less 
than 7% of patients  (17), and median PFS was only 1.[ADDRESS_461055] programmed death receptor 1 (PD -1), 
approved in the U.S. to treat advanced NSCLC after progression on  platinum- based 
chemotherapy. This approval was based on randomized studies demonstrating improved overall 
survival in patients treated with  second -line nivolumab compared to  chemotherapy, and a 
favorable safety profile (18, 19). Combining nivolum ab with chemotherapy , or other 
immunotherapeutic agents with a different mechanism of action , may enable a synergistic 
response. In an early -phase study of first-line nivolumab plus platinum- based chemotherapy in 
advanced NSCLC, there were no dose- limiting toxicities , and  responses w ere seen in 33 -47% of 
patients  (20). The m ajority of patients in these studies had EGFR- and ALK -wild-type tumors. 
Thus, the effectiveness of nivolumab combination regimens in EGFR-mutant and ALK -
rearranged patients  remains unknown. In the IMpower150 study, the combination of 
pembrolizumab (another PD-1 inhibitor) with chemotherapy and bevacizumab demonstrated clinical benefit compared to chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC 
including those with EGFR-mutant and ALK -rearranged NSCLC (21). It is plausible that the 
addition of bevacizumab, an anti- angiogenesis agent, may enhance the anti -tumor activity of the 
combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461056] be chemotherapy -naïve.   
 
• Eligible patients who are bevacizumab -eligible  will receive nivolumab plus carboplatin 
and pemetrexed plus bevacizumab for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_20382], pemetrexed and 
bevacizumab maintenance therapy  at the pre -specified doses.  
 
• Eligible patients who are bevacizumab -ineligible will receive nivolumab plus carboplatin 
and pemetrexed for [ADDRESS_461057] of 4 cohort s: 
 
Nivolumab Plus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed Plus Bevacizumab (Cohort s E and F): 
 
• Cohort E : EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC, previously treated with at least one third-
generation EGFR TKI and  are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab -eligible . 
 
• Cohort F : ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC, previously treated with at least one next -
generation ALK TKI and are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab- eligible . 
 
Nivolumab Plus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed (Cohorts G and H): 
 
• Cohort G:  EGFR- mutant advanced NSCLC, previously tr eated with at least one third -
generation EGFR TKI and are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab -ineligible . 
 
• Cohort H : ALK -rearranged advanced NSCLC, previously treated with at least one next -
generation ALK TKI and are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab- ineligible . 
 Our primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of these combinations using objective response rate (ORR) in the treated subjects. Secondary endpoints will include the disease control 
rate (DCR), duration of response (D OR),  duration on treatment,  progression- free survival (PFS)

7 (including PFS rates at 6 months and at 12 months), and overall survival (OS) (including OS 
rates at 1 year and at 2 years) . Safety and tolerability of the combination regimen will be 
assessed. As an exploratory analysis, efficacy endpoints will be calculated in subjects with PD -
L1-expressing tumors (defined as PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumor cells) versus subjects with 
PD-L1-non-expressing tumors. Exploratory endpoints will also include molecular  profiling of 
baseline tumor biopsy tissues to evaluate for biomarkers of response or resistance to the combination therapy (e.g., expression of immunoregulatory molecules such as PD -L1, PD-L2 
cytokines, T- cell subsets ).   
 Efficacy a ssessments (CT chest/abdomen) will be performed every [ADDRESS_461058] 6 
months , after which asses sments will be performed every 12 weeks. Treatment  will continue 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, death or discontinuation from the  study for any other reason. Subjects may be allowed to continue study therapy after 
investigator -assessed progression defined by [CONTACT_197230] 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021], they a re deriving clinical 
benefit and tolerating the study drugs.

8 1.4 Exploratory Objectives 
 
• To assess the ORR, DCR, DOR, duration on therapy, PFS (including PFS rates at 6 
months and 12 months), and OS (including OS rates at 1 year and 2 years) in PD -L1(+) 
and in PD -L1(-) treated subjects . PD-L1(+) will be defined as subjects with tumors that 
express PD -L1 in ≥1% of tumor cells. 
 
• To assess the abundance of immunoregulatory proteins (e.g., PD- L1) in tumor tissue 
samples prior to treatment.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_461060] common cancers in the [LOCATION_002] and in the world for 
decades. It is  the leading cause of cancer -related death s, accounting for over 25% of cases  in the 
[LOCATION_002]  (22). NSCLC comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancers.  The majority of 
NSCLC patients present with advanced or metastatic disease at t he time of diagnosis . For  these 
patients, five-y ear survival rate remains less than 5%  (22). The  current  standard of care first -line 
therapy for advanced NSCLC  without a molecular driver  consists of platinum- based combination 
chemotherapy. First-line platinum doublet chemotherapy regimens generate an ORR of 
approximately 20-35% in advanced NSCLC, with median PFS ranging 4-6 months and overall survival (OS) ranging  8-11 months (23-25). The discovery of subsets of NSCLC harboring 
targetable driver oncogene mutations , such as EGFR mutations or ALK  rearrangements,  has led 
to a paradigm shift in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to NSCLC. The presence of these 
molecular driver al terations in NSCLC  guides patient  treatment , and molecular testin g of 
NSCLC at the time of diagnosis is thus recommended. 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_461061] reported in NSCLC in 2004, and are identified 
in 10-20% of NSCLC patients in the West and 30-40% in Asia (27 ). Clinically, oncogenic EGFR 
mutations are associated with adenocarcinoma histology, never or light smoking history, and 
female gender. The most common activating EGFR  mutations —exon 19 deletions and the 
L858R point mutation in exon 21—account for approximately 90% of EGFR -mutant NSCLC  
cases . In vitro , these mutations lead to constitutively active EGFR and activation of multiple 
downstream signaling pathways that promote survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis  (27, 28).  
 Numerous randomized trials have demonstrated the superior efficacy of EGFR TKI(s) over chemotherapy in patients with advanced EGFR -mutant NSCLC. Selective inhibition of EGFR in 
this patient population using a first -generation EGFR TKI (i.e., erlotinib and gefitinib) leads to 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
9 responses in  60-80% of patients (versus 20-30% in the chemotherapy control arms), with median 
PFS of 8 -14 months (versus 4-6 months in the chemotherapy control arms) (1-8). The median OS 
of patients with advanced EGFR- mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR -directed therapy now 
exceeds  2 years  (29, 30).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_368428], the duration of response to EGFR TKIs is invariably limited because the tumor cells acquire resistance. While n umerous r esistance mechanisms have 
been described , the predominant mechanism  is acquisition of the gatekeeper mutation in EGFR, 
T790M. This mutation  is identified in 50-60% of patients after relapse on a first - or second-
generation EGFR TKI , and leads to increased ATP -binding affinity of the EGFR kinase (26 ). 
Third -generation, irreversible EGFR TKIs such as osimertinib , rociletinib , and EGF816 spare the 
wild-type EGFR , but inhibit the sensitizing EGFR mutants  L858R and exon [ADDRESS_461062] progressed after prior EGFR TKIs, osimertinib is associated with an ORR  of 61% (8). 
Osimertinib has been  approved in the U.S.  for use in this patient population. Furthermore, based 
on the phase III FLAURA trial which compared osimertinib to a first-generation EGFR TKI in untreated EGFR -mutant advanced NSCLC, osimertinib is now considered the standard first- line 
therapy in these patients  (31).   
 However, acquired resistance to third -generation  EGFR TKIs also emerge s, limiting the du ration 
of clinical benefit (8). S tudies investigating resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and/or 
rociletinib have identified a novel EGFR C797S mutation in 20-30% of resistant cases , and copy 
number gains in MET , ERBB2 , and  EGFR (32, 33 ).  Once patients progress on a third -generation 
EGFR TKI, the standard treatment  becomes  platinum-based combination chemotherapy (or 
clinic al trials of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], if an actionable resist ance mechanism is discovered  in an 
individual patient). Platinum-doublet chemotherapy following progression on a prior EGFR TKI  
generally leads to responses in 20 -30% with a PFS of 3-6 months (2, 15, 16). If patients 
subsequently progress on the platinum-based  chemotherapy  or cannot tolerate this regimen , then 
the options become further narrowed to single- agent chemotherapy, clinical trials, or 
immunotherapy. S tudies evaluating single -agent second- line chemotherapy in unselected 
advanced NSCLC have generally demonstrated low response rates (<10%) with short median 
PFS (<3 months) (34, 35 ). Therefore, a significant  unmet need exists for more effective and 
tolerable  treatment options for patients with EGFR -muta nt NSCLC after they exhaust E GFR 
TKIs. 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_461063] identified in a small cohort of 
Japanese NSCLC patients in 2007 (36). Since then, ALK  gene fusions have been found in 3- 7% 
of NSCLCs , associated with never or light smoking history, young er age, and adenocarcinoma 
histology (37). The most common fusion partner for ALK  in NSCLC is the echinoderm 
microtubule associated protein -like 4 ( EML4 ) gene. M ore than [ADDRESS_461064] 
been repo rted, all of which arise from an intrachromosomal inversion event in the short arm of 
chromosome 2 and preserve the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) (38 ). ALK  rearrangements  
result in ligand -independent oligomerization and constitutive activation of ALK, promoting 
downstream survival and proliferation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potent 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
10 transforming capacity  of ALK fusions like EML4- ALK (36, 39). Furthermore, ALK -rearranged 
NSCLC cells are dependent on continued ALK signaling for survival and g rowth  (39).  
 
The remarkable sensitivity of ALK-rearranged NSCLCs to ALK inhibition first became clinically 
evident with crizotinib. Crizotinib was originally synthesized as a potent MET inhibitor, but 
biochemical kinase assays revealed  its additional a ctivity against ALK and ROS1. In the phase I 
study of [ADDRESS_461065] of whom had received prior treatment, 
the ORR was 57% with a dis ease control rate (DCR) of 90%  (9). Crizotinib was granted 
accelerated approval by [CONTACT_941] U .S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 based on the 
remarkable anti -tumor efficacy  demonstrated in phase I/II studies. Subsequently, two 
randomized phase III studies demonstrated the superior efficacy of crizotinib over chemotherapy in both the second- line (ORR 65%, median PFS 7.7 months) and first- line setting (ORR 74%, 
median PFS 10.9 months) (10, 11).   
 Most  patients ultimately relapse on crizotinib due to acquired resistance.  Resistance can arise due 
to a broad array  of mechanisms, including secondary ALK  mutations  (including the most 
common L1196M and G1269A  resistance mutations ), ALK  amplification , and by[CONTACT_368458] (e.g., EGFR, c- KIT activation, MEK activation ) (40 -42). Once ALK-rearranged 
NSCLC patients progress on (or are intolerant of) crizotinib, they may be treated with next-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib , alectinib, and brigatinib, which are FDA -approved. 
Responses to ceritinib and alectinib are seen in ~50% of crizotinib- pre-treated ALK-rearranged 
NSCLC pa tients  (12-14) . Multiple additional next -generation ALK inhibitors including lorlatinib 
are in clinical development. Again, acquired resistance to these TKIs  due to various mechanisms 
limits the duration of responses (43).  
 Following progression on a second-generation ALK TKI (e.g., ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib) and/or third- generation ALK TKI (e.g., lorlatinib), the resistance mechanism (s) operant in an 
individual patient ’s tumor  may guide the choice of next -line therapy (43 ). For example, 
identification of an ALK  resistance mutation (e.g., ALK G1202R) after failure on ceritinib, 
alectinib or brigatinib, may suggest lorlatinib as the next therapy, as lorlatinib has been shown to overcome all known resistance mutations. However, patients still relapse on lorlatinib and typi[INVESTIGATOR_368429].  In this setting, o ptions may include combination 
regimens in clinical trials or standard cytotoxic chemotherapy  (i.e., platinum- based 
combination).  Once these patients also  progress on the platinum-containing chemotherapy, 
treatment u sing single -agent che motherapy  is generally ineffective  (ORR <10%) (17). Better 
treatment options are thus needed for ALK -rearranged NSCLC  patients after they have 
progressed on the available ALK TKIs.    
2.2 Overview of Nivolumab  
 
2.2.1 Nivolumab Pharmacology and Nonclinical Data 
 
Nivolumab ( also referred to as BMS -936558 or MDX-1106) is a fully human, immunoglobulin 
G4 (IgG4) isotype monoclonal antibody directed against the immune checkpoint cell surface receptor , progr ammed death -1 (PD -1) (44 ). PD-1 is predominantly expressed on activated T and 
B lymphocytes and memory T cells. It binds to two known ligands, programmed death-ligand 1 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
11 (PD-L1, also called B7 -H1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD- L2, also called B7 -DC), 
expressed on antigen- presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells (DCs). This interaction leads to  
the inhibition of CD28- mediated  IL-2/IL-10/IL-13 and interferon -γ (IFN -γ) upregulation, and 
inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation, effectively modulating the physiologic peripheral 
T cell response and mediat ing tolerance to self -antigens (45 ).   
 
While PD-1 belongs to the CD28 family of receptors including CD28, CD28 inducible co-
stimulator (ICOS), cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4), and B  and T  lymphocyte 
attenuator (BTLA), nivolumab has been shown to bind speci fically to PD -[ADDRESS_461066] demonstrated that nivolumab binds PD-1 with high 
affinity (EC 50 0.39-2.6 nM) and disrupts its inter action with PD-L1 and PD-L2 with an IC50 of ~1 
nM (44).  This results in  abrogation of the inhibitory signals, enhanced T-cell proliferation and 
IFN-γ release in vitro  (46-48). In mouse tumor models, expression of PD-L1 promotes immune 
resistance and tumor growth, and PD -1/PD-L1 blockade using monoclonal antibodies leads to 
anti-tumor immune  responses  (48-50). Repeat -dose toxicology studies of nivolumab in 
cynomolgus monkeys suggested tha t the drug was well tolerated at tested doses , with no clinical 
effects on body weight, food consumption, or vital sign parameters (44 ). 
 
2.2.2 Nivolumab Clinical Data  
 The dose escalation study of nivolumab provid ed preliminary evidence for  its clinical anti- tumor 
efficacy . In a phase I study of nivolumab in refractory solid tumors (including metastatic 
melanoma  (n = 104), NSCLC (n = 122), castration- resistant prostate cancer (n = 17), renal cell 
carcinoma (n = 34), and colorectal cancer (n = 19) ), a total of 296 patients were treated with 
nivolumab at doses of 0.1-10 mg/kg every 2 weeks  (51). Nivolumab was generally well 
tolerated, and a maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was not defined. Most frequent adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, n ausea, cough, dyspnea, constipation, and 
nausea. Common treatment- related AEs included fatigue, rash, diarrhea, pruritus, decreased 
appetite, and nausea. Treatment -related AEs of special interest, including pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, hypophysitis, vitiligo, uveitis, and thyroiditis, occurred in 44% of patients. Grade ≥3  
AEs were noted in  a total of  14% of patients, and drug- related serious AEs occurred in 11% of 
patients. The spectrum, frequency, and severity of AEs did not differ across doses (51 ). In this 
study, anti-tumor activity of nivolumab was observed at all doses in NSCLC, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In 76 patients with lung cancer, ORRs of 6%, 32%, and 18% were observed 
at doses of 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg, respectively. Responses were seen in 6 of 18 patients (33%) with squamous NSCLC, and 7 of 56 patients (12%) with non- squamous NSCLC (51 ).  
 In the phase I dose escalation cohort expansion trial, 129 patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC (at least one line of platinum- or taxane- based regimen) were treated with nivolumab at 
doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (52 ). The ORR  was 17% across all doses, 24% at the 3 
mg/kg and 20% at the 10 mg/kg dose levels. The median duration of response was 17 months, and median PFS among the responders was 20.6 months. Median OS for all patients was 9.9 months, but in the patients receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 37), median OS was 14.[ADDRESS_461067] common treatment- related AEs were fatigue (24%), decreased appetite (12%), and 
diarrhea (10%). Among the 14% of patients who experienced graded ≥[ADDRESS_461068] common was fatigue, which occurred in 3%. In 41% of 129 patients, trea tment- related

pulmonary events. Four patients (3%) experienced treatment-related grade ≥3 pneumonitis, and 
three treatment -related deaths occurred, associated with pneum onitis  (52).  
 Subsequently, two randomized phase III trials demonstrated the superior activity of nivolumab versus docetaxel in advanced non-squamous (CheckMate 057) and squamous (CheckMate 017)  
NSCLC (18, 19). In CheckMate 057, 582 patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC who progressed on or after one prior chemotherapy  regimen (platinum-based doublet) were 
randomized to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) versus docetaxel. ORR was significant higher 
for nivolumab compared to docetaxel (19% versus 12%), and median duration of response was 17.2 months versus 5.6 months, respectively (19 ). OS  was also improved with nivolumab 
(median, 12.2 months versus 9.4 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.73). Notably, the benefit from 
nivolumab correlated with PD-L1 expression in the tumor. In 53% of patients with PD- L1-
expressing tumor (at the cut- off of PD -L1 ≥1%), ORR to nivolumab was 31%, and in 41% of 
patients with PD -L1 ≥5%, ORR was 36%. Ther e was similarly a significant correlation between 
OS and PD- L1 expression (19 ). Because the study met its primary endpoint of superior OS, it 
was stopped at a pre-planned interim analysis by [CONTACT_941] I ndependent Data Monitoring Committee.  
 In the CheckMate [ADDRESS_461070]-line platinum- based chemotherapy were randomized to niv olumab versus docetaxel (18).  
Again, nivolumab demonstrated a superior clinical efficacy with ORR of 20% (versus 9% for 
docetaxel).  Median OS was 9.2 months with nivolumab compared to 6.0 months with docetaxel 
(HR for risk of death, 0.59). Although the PD-L1 expression did not significantly correlate with clinical benefit, there was a trend for longer survival in  the PD -L1-express ing subgroups (18 ). 
Based on the data from these two phase III trials, nivolumab was granted approval by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA for use in  both squamous and non-squamous metastatic NSCLC after progression on or 
after platinum- based chemotherapy.  
 Most recently, act ivity of nivolumab monotherapy as first- line therapy for advanced NSCLC was 
investigated . In the phase I CheckMate 012 study, 52 treatment- naïve patients received 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity (53 ). The primary 
endpoint was safety. The most common treatment- related AEs of any grade included fatigue 
(29%), rash (19%), nausea (14%), diarrhea and pruritus (12% each), and arthralgia (10%). Grade 
≥3 treatment -related AEs occurred in 19% of patients, including rash (4% ), increased amylase 
and lipase, increased liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, cardiac failure, dehydration and diarrhea, hyponatremia, lung infection, and pneumonitis (1 patient each). Six patients (12%) discontinued treatment due to drug- related toxicity. The confirmed ORR was 23% with 4 ongoing responses. 
ORR was 28% in patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors (versus 14% in PD-L1 non- expressors). 
Responses were durable (median DOR, not reached, range 4.2-25.8+ months). The median OS was 19.4 months, with 1- year OS rate of 73% and 18-month OS rate of 57% (53 ). Based on these 
findings, nivolumab monotherapy as first- line therapy is being evaluated in phase III  trials 
(CheckMate 227, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; CheckMate 026, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
2.2.3 Nivolumab Pharmac okinetics (PK)  
 The single -dose PK of nivolumab was investigated in 39 patients with cancer, and found to be 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
13 linear and dose-proportional at doses ranging 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg (44, 54). The median Tmax 
ranged from 1.6 to 3 hours. Across the tested doses, the g eometric mean total clearance ranged 
from 0.13 mL/h/kg to 0.19 mL/h/kg, and the mean volume of distribution during the terminal 
phase (V z) varied from 83 mL/kg to 113 mL/kg, demonstrating approximate dose 
proportionality. The mean terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) was 17 to 25 days, consistent with 
the half -life of IgG4.  
 Single - and multiple -dose PK of nivolumab was studied in patients with various tumor types 
including melanoma and NSCLC, at doses ranging 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (single dose, or multiple doses given every 2 or 3 weeks) (44). After the first dose, geometric mean of C
max ranged 1.9 to 
191.2 µg/mL, and AUC ranged 279 to [ZIP_CODE] µg.h/mL. At the steady -state PK on cycle 3 day 1, 
geometric mean of C max ranged 3.7 to 475 µg/mL, and AUC ranged 1104 to [ZIP_CODE] µg.h/mL. T he 
exposure to nivolumab increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dose levels of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The geometric mean AUC was 2.9 to 3.3 µg.h/mL. The 
geometric mean clearance (CL)  was 9.5 mL/h. Geometric mean volume of distribution at steady 
state (V ss) was 8.0L, and the geometric mean t 1/2 was 26.7 days.  
 
Based on the population PK analysis, t he clearance of nivolumab increased with increasing body 
weight.  It was not dependent on age , gender, race, PD-L1 expression, tumor type, or baseline 
tumor size. It also did not appear to be affected by [CONTACT_368459] (as measured using baseline 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR)) or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 1.0 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or AST > ULN as defined using the National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction)  (44).

pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, and adverse event profile of nivolumab.   
2.3 Overview of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed  Combination  
 
2.3.1 Carboplatin 
 
Carboplatin is a platinum coordination compound (chemical name: [CONTACT_70101], diammine[1,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylato(2-)-0,0’]- ,(SP-4-2)). Like cisplatin, carboplatin predominantly 
introduces inter -strand DNA cross-links to interfere with DNA repair.  Carboplatin is used for the 
treatment of several cancer s including ovarian, endometrial, lung, head and neck, esophageal, 
bladder, breast, and c ervical cancers ; it is currently approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA for use in ovarian 
and lung cancers. The most commonly observed side effects include anemia, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea and vomiting, hypomagnesemia,  hyponatremia , 
hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and liver enzyme abnormalities . Peripheral neuropathies and 
nephrotoxicity are significantly less frequent and l ess severe than with cisplatin ( 55). 
 PK studies have revealed that carboplatin plasma levels decline in a biphasic manner after  a 30-
minute intravenous infusion of 300 to 500 mg/m
2 doses (55) . The initial plasma half -life (alpha) 
was 1.1-[ADDRESS_461071]- distribution plasma half -life (beta) was 2.6 -5.9 hours. The total 
body clearance of carboplatin was 4.4 L/hour, and apparent v olume of distribution was 16 L. PK 
of carboplatin was linear over the tested dose ranges  of 300 to 500 mg/m2. While carboplatin is 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
14 not bound to plasma proteins, platinum from carboplatin is irreversibly bound to plasma proteins 
and eliminated with a minimum half -life of 5 days. The major route of elimination is renal 
excretion. Therefore, carboplatin doses should be reduced in patients with renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <60 mL/min). In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min), 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, and 71% within 24 hours. Only 3 -5% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine between 24-96 hours.  
 
2.3.2 Pemetrexed  
 Pemetrexed is an anti -folate antineoplastic agent. It disrupts several folate -requiring enzymes 
essential for cell replication, including thy midylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase 
(DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT)  (56) . Pemetrexed has been 
investigated in a number of tumor types. The most common AEs include fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. When used in combination with cisplatin, additional common AEs include vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, oral mucositis , thrombocytopenia, and constipation. 
Supplementation with  folate and vitamin B
12 reduces the frequency and severity of drug -related 
toxicities.  
 The PK of pemetrexed has been evaluated in 426 cancer p atients with solid tumors, at doses 
ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m
2 infused over 10 minutes (56) . The total systemic exposure (AUC) 
and C max were found to increase in a dose-proportional manner. PK parameters did not change 
over multiple treatment cycles. The V ss of pemetrexed is 16.1 L, and approximately 81% of 
pemetrexed is bound to plasma proteins. Pemetrexed is pr imarily excreted in the urine 
unchanged , with 70% to 90% of the dose excreted within the first 24 hours. The clearance 
decreases  with decreasing renal function, with resultant increase in systemic exposure. The total 
systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91. 8 mL/min, and t 1/2 is 3.5 hours in patients with normal 
renal function  (56).  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_461072]- line treatment for patients with 
advanced NSCLC without targetable driver mutations. In the phase III study by [CONTACT_317237] (ECOG), E1594, four platinum-based doublet regimens were compared in 1,207 patients wi th treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC (23 ). No significant clinical 
advantage was identified for one specific regimen among cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, or cisplatin plus paclitaxel. The ORR was 19% for all patients, with a median OS of 7.9 months.   Subsequently in a multi- centered  randomized phase III study, cisplatin (75 mg/m
2) plus 
pemetrexed  (500 mg/m2) given on day 1 of a 21- day cycle  was demonstrated to be non- inferior 
to cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1) plus gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) of a 21- day 
cycle , in chemotherapy -naïve patients with advanced NSCLC  (25). Notably, in patients with 
non-squamous histology, cisplatin plus pemetrexed produced statistically superior median OS (11.8 months, versus 10.4 months for cisplatin plus gemcitabine in adenocarcinoma histology ; 
adjusted HR,  0.81).  In the squamous patient population, median OS was 9.4 months and 10.8 
months for the cisplatin/pemetrexed and cisplatin/gemcitabine arms, respectively (adjusted HR, 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
15 1.23). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic drug- related AEs was significantly lower for 
cisplatin /pemetrexed compared to cisplatin/gemcitabine. With  cisplatin/pemetrexed, neutropenia 
occurred in 15.1%, anemia in 5.6%, thrombocytopenia in 4.1%, and leukopenia in 4.8%. Drug-
related grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia occurred in 1.3%, alopecia of all grades in 11.9%, grade ≥3 nausea in 7.2%, grade ≥3 vomiting in 6.1%, grade ≥3 fatigue in 6.7% (25).  
 The combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed was found to confer efficacy comparable to cisplatin and pemetrexed in phase II studies  (57, 58). In one phase II study, 50 patients with 
chemotherapy -naïve, advanced NSCLC were treated with carboplatin (AUC = 6) and 
pemetrexed (500 mg/m
2) given every 3 weeks for  6 cycles  (57) . Partial responses were seen in 
24% of patients, with median OS of 13.5 months and 1- year OS rate of 56 %. Grade 3/4 
neutropenia occurred in 26%, and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2% of patients. Three patients (6%) experienced grade 3 non-hematologic AEs including diarrhea, neutropenia pneumonia, and fatigue. In another phase II study, 83 chemotherapy- naïve patients with 
advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m
2) plus either oxaliplatin 
(120 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC = 6) given every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles (58). In the 39 
patients receiving pemetrexed and carboplatin, the ORR was 31.6%, and median OS was 10.5 months with a 1-year OS rate of 43.9%. Common grade ≥3 AEs included neutropenia (25.6%), thrombocytopenia (17.9%), anemia (7.7%), fatigue (7.7%), stomatitis (2.6%), and febrile neutropenia (2.6%). Based on these studies demonstrating its efficacy and tolerability, the carboplatin/ pemetrexed  doublet has become a commonly used regimen in clinical practice.   
 
 
2.3.4 Pemetrexed Maintena nce Therapy  
 The survival benefit of maintenance therapy using single -agent pemetrexed has been 
demonstrated in two large trials. In one phase III study, 663 patients with advanced NSCLC who 
had not progressed on 4 cycles of platinum- based chemotherapy were randomized to receive 
pemetrexed (500 mg/m
2) or placebo in 21- day cycles  (59). Maintenance pemetrexed led to 
increased median  PFS (4.3 months versus 2.6 months; HR, 0.50) and median OS (13.4 months 
versus 10.6 months; HR, 0.79) compared to placebo. Treatment -related grade ≥3 AEs occurred 
in 16% of patients treated with pemetrexed, the most common of which included fatigue (24%), anorexia (19%), nausea (19%), anemia (15%), ALT elevation (10%), vomiting (9%), sensory neuropathy (9%), and AST elevation (8%). Treatment discontinuation due to drug- related 
toxicities was noted in 5% of patients.   In the PARAMOUNT trial, 539 patients with advanced NSCLC who achieved disease control after 4 cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed were randomized to maintenance pemetrexed  (500 mg/m
2 
every 21 days) versus placebo (60). The mean number of pemetrexed cycles was 7.9 (range, 1 to 44). Median PFS was significantly increased with pemetrexed compared to placebo (4.1 versus 
2.8 months; HR, 0.62). OS was also significantly increased (13.9 versus 11.0 months; 1- year OS 
rate, 58 versus 45%; HR, 0.78).  The most common drug- related grade ≥3 AEs included anemia 
(6.4%), neutropenia (5.8%), fatigue (4.7%), leukopenia (2.2%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), and febrile neutropenia (1.9%). Based on these studies, patients who achieve an objective response or stable disease with 4 -6 cycles of platinum/pemetrexed typi[INVESTIGATOR_368430],  until they develop disease progression or inability to tolerate chemotherapy.

2.4 Overview of Bevacizumab and Combination with Chemotherapy  
 
2.4.1 Bevacizumab  
 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial grow th factor (VEGF), an important pro- angiogenic factor (61). EGF has been implicated in 
angiogenesis associated with tumor growth, and increased levels of VEGF have been detected in multiple tumor types including lung cancer. Bevacizumab may exert a direct a nti-angiogenic 
effect by [CONTACT_368460], and additionally impact tumor vasculature and blood vessel permeability to enhance chemotherapy delivery to tumor cells (62).   Bevacizumab -associated safety signals identifi ed in the initial phase I/II trials include 
hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage. Additional safety signals include congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications, and arterial thromboembolic events. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome and fistula have also been reported infrequently. Further details on the safety profile of bevacizumab are available in the bevacizumab investigator’s brochure.  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_461073] -line therapy in advanced no n-squamous NSCLC. In the 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group phase III study (E4599), bevacizumab combined with first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with non -squamous advanced NSCLC demonstrated 
an improvement in OS and PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (OS 12.3 months versus 10.3 months, respectively, HR 0.79, p = 0.003) (63). In the AVAIL study (BO17704), two doses of bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine were evaluated in comparison to chemotherapy alone, and again demonstrated a PFS benefit (64).    
2.5 Study Rationale 
 
2.5.1 Rationale for Doses and Schedules of Nivolumab in Combination with 
Carboplatin/Pemetrexed  
 
Cancer  immunity is regulated by [CONTACT_368461]. Soluble and membrane-bound molecules on tumors and the tumor microenvironment (such as PD-1/PD- L1, transforming growth factor- ß (TGF -ß), and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) ) can i nduce tumor tolerance, limit tumor antigen presentation, inhibit the 
cytolytic activity of effector T  cells, and increase the immunosuppressive CD4
+CD25+FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) (65).  Together, these mechanisms lead to the evasion of immune-
mediated tumor killing. Modulation of these interactions may help shift the equilibrium towards 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461074] anti -tumor immunity.  
 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy can facilitate an anti-tumor immune response through multiple 
immunomodulatory effects  (65). It has been shown that certain chemotherapy drugs —including 
platinum compounds—can induce immunogenic cell death, mediated by [CONTACT_368462]- like receptor -4 
(TLR -4) or purinergic receptor P2RX7 (66-68). This process triggers  the release of chemotactic 
signals that recruit dendritic cells ( DCs) and macrophages to the tumor site, enhanced expression 
of co -stimulatory molecules, and increased secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines. 
Furthermore,  chemotherapy agents can enhance the intrinsic tumor cell immunogenicity (e.g., 
increase the expression  of MHC class I and antigen-processing machinery components, regulate 
PD-L1 expression), decrease Treg number or function, increase peripheral myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells, and impact DC phenotype and function (67) Platinum compounds, in particular, have been found to strongly enhance T cell activation by [CONTACT_368463] , through the loss of 
STAT6 phosphorylation and downregulation of PD- L2 (66, 69). STAT3 expression and 
phosphorylation may also be modulated by  [CONTACT_368464] (66, 70, 71).  
 Based on the immunogenic properties of standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_368431], various regimens combining platinum- based d oublet chemotherapy 
(PT-DC) with immune checkpoint inhibitors are now being tested. In the CheckMate 012 phase I 
study, 56 treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC patients received one of 4 regimens: nivolumab 10 
mg/kg plus cisplatin/gemcitabine (squamous ; n = 12) or cisplatin/pemetrexed (nonsquamous ; n = 
15), or nivolumab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (all histologies ; n = 15 and n 
= 14, respectively ). Nivolumab and PT-DC were given intravenously on day 1 of each 21- day 
cycle (and also on day 8 for the cisplatin/gemcitabine cohort) for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_368465] 3 weeks at the same dose (20 ). 
 No DLTs were reported during the first 6 weeks of treatment. The overall safety profile reflected the additive side effects of the PT -DC and nivolumab (20 ). Forty -five percent (45%) of the 
overall population experienced grade ≥[ADDRESS_461075] common of which were pneumonitis, fatigue, and acute renal failure (Table 2.5.1-1).   Table 2.5.1-1: Treatment -Related AEs Reported in ≥10% of All Patients with Advanced

The immune-related AEs affecting the skin, GI, renal, and pulmonary occurred in 36%, 23%, 14%, and 7% of patients, respectively  (Table 2.5.1-2). Among the patients receiving nivolumab 
with cisplatin/pemetrexed, the immune -related AEs affecting the skin, GI, renal, and pulmonary 
occurred in 40%, 20%, 20%, and 20% of the patients. Treatment-related AEs led to drug discontinuation in 21% of the patients, including 33% of patients (5 of 15 patients) in the nivolumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed arm. Most discontinuations were observed during the nivolumab maintenance therapy. The treatment -related AEs including pneumonitis were 
effectively managed w ith steroids or infliximab. N o treatment -related deaths were reported (20 ).

The ORRs for all nivolumab and chemotherapy arms ranged 33% to 47%, with DCRs  ranging 
73% to 93% (20). In the nivolumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed arm, ORR was 47% (7 of 15 patients), and DCR was 93% (14 of 15 patients). The 24- week PFS rate for all arms ranged 38% 
to 71% (in the nivolumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed cohort, 71%). The median OS for patients that received nivolumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed was 19.2 months, with 1- year OS rate of 87% 
and 2- year OS rate of 33%.  
 These data suggest that the regimen combining nivolumab with platinum plus pemetrexed is overall tolerable , and effective in  patients  with advanced NSCLC. Moreover, they provide the 
rationale for investigating the efficacy of nivolumab plus PT- DC in TKI -pre-treated but 
chemotherapy -naïve patients with advanced EGFR -mutant or ALK -rearranged NSCLCs. The 
majority of patients in the CheckMa te 012 study (89%) did not have EGFR  mutations in the 
tumor, and were not evaluated  for the presence of ALK rearrangements  (20). The efficacy of 
combining nivolumab and PT- DC in TKI -pre-treated patient populations is also unknown. 
 The present  study will e valuate the PT-DC regimen of carboplatin (AUC = 5) and pemetrexed 
(500 mg/m
2) in combination with nivolumab. Carboplatin plus pemetrexed is a standard of care 
chemotherapeutic regimen for treatment -naïve patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC 
without mo lecular alterations, and also for patients with EGFR-mutant or ALK-rearranged 
NSCLC after progression on available TKIs.   Patients will receive [ADDRESS_461076].  The 
duration of the initial platinum-based induction is based on multiple trials and a meta- analysis of 
5 trials that compared 6 cycles versus 3- 4 cycles  (72). There was no statistically significant 
improvement in OS with 6 cycles versus 3-4 cycles (9.5 versus 8.7 months), although there was a modest improvement in the PFS (6.09 versus 5.33 months). Notably, severe anemia occurred more frequently with 6 cycles compared to 3-4 cycles (7.8% versus 2.9%) (72). 
 Flat dosing of nivolumab will be used at 360 mg every 3 weeks. Based on the nivolumab PK analysis, the simulated steady state concentration at trough (C
minss), peak (C maxss), and average 
(Cavgss) with 360 mg are less than those of 10 mg/kg given every 2 weeks. Prior PK data and AE 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461077] demonstrated nivolumab to be safe and well tolerated at doses 
up to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (18-20, 44, 51-53).  Therefore, the 360 mg dosing on an every 3-
week schedule is expected to be safe and tolerable.  
 
2.5.2 Rationale for the Dosing of Bevacizumab in Combination with Nivolumab 
and Carboplatin/Pemetrexed  
 Emerging evidence suggests that VEGF may play a role in cancer immune evasion through several mechanisms. For example, VEGF may reduce lymphocyte adhesion to vessel walls and contribute to de creased immune cell recruitment (73).  In a mouse melanoma model, VEGF 
blockade was shown to synergize with adoptive immunotherapy, resulting in improved anti-tumor activity, prolonged survival, and increased T cell trafficking into tumors (74) . Synergistic 
effects have also been observed in patients with melanoma treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_368432]  (75).  
 In NSCLC, bevacizumab has been tested in combination with atezolizumab (a PD-L1 antibody) and carboplatin/paclitaxel in metastatic non -squamous NSCLC (IMpower150) (76). In this phase 
III study, patients were randomized to receive atezolizumab plus chemotherapy, beva cizumab 
plus chemotherapy, or atezolizumab plus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. PFS and OS were longer in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group versus the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group. Notably, this study allowed patients with EGFR and ALK alterations who had failed prior TKI therapy. Clinical benefit of the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was observed in this subgroup (76).  The dosing of bevacizumab used in the IMpower150 study was 15 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_461078] dosing schedule used in metastatic NSCLC (76). With this dosing of bevacizumab, the combination with atezolizumab and chemotherapy was generally well-tolerated. This dosing of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was also tested in combination with nivolumab in previously treated metastatic NSCLC  (77). No treatment- related grade 4 AEs were reported; 
grade 3 AEs included pneumonitis (n = 2) and cough and Tubulointerstitial nephritis (n = 1 each). This study will evaluate the safety and ef ficacy of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
combined with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks plus carboplatin/pemetrexed.  
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_461079] suggested a correlation between the lev el of P D-L1 expression in tumor 
and clinical benefit from nivolumab (and other PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors) (18-21, 51-53). As an 
example, in the CheckMate 057 phase III study of nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC progressing on platinum-based chemotherapy, ORR to nivolumab was 9% in patients with PD -
L1 non-expressing tumors (47% of the study cohort), 31% in those with  PD-L1 ≥1% (53% of the 
study cohort), and 36% in those with PD -L1 ≥5% (41% of the study cohort) (19). Median OS 
was 10.5 months in PD-L1 non- expres sors, 17.7 months in patients with PD-L1 ≥1%, and 19.4 
months in patients with PD -L1 ≥5% (19).  
 Similarly, in the CheckMate 012 study, efficacy of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_368433] -L1 expression (78). The ORR of the N3 Q2W + I1 Q6W regimen was 0%

21 (0/7) in PD-L1 non-expressing tumors, 57% (13/23) in tumors with ≥1% PD-L1, and 86% (6/7) 
with ≥50% PD- L1. Efficacy of first -line nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_368434]-L1 expression is shown in Table 2.5.3-1.   Table 2.5.3-1: Efficacy of First -Line Nivolumab Plus Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_368435]-L1 Expression

 However, not all studies have shown a correlation between PD-L1 expression and nivolumab activity. In the CheckMate [ADDRESS_461080] -line nivolumab plus PT- DC chemotherapy, 
for example, a clear association between PD -L1 and ORR, PFS, and OS endpoints could not be 
detected (20).  
 Therefore, the current study will require a baseline tumor tissue for examination of the PD -L1 
expression status. Exploratory analysis will be performed to look for any association betw een 
clinical benefit from the nivolumab combination regimens and tumor PD-L1 positivity (defined as PD -L1 ≥1%). 
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_461081] shown that up to ~10% of patients treated with immunotherapeutic agents may manifest an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], immune -related pattern of response , whereby [CONTACT_368466] (progressive disease based on the conventional RECIST criteria) before disease control is achieved  (79- 81). This phenomenon has been termed tumor pseudoprogression. Tumor 
lesions may initially increase in size —or new lesions may appear—because of inflammatory cell 
infiltrates or necrosis within the tumor.  Furthermore, in some cases, patients may have subtle 
radiographic progression of disease but continue to benefit clinically.   Therefore, patients in this study will be allowed to continue study therapy after a RECIST v1.1-
defined progression if they are tole rating the study drug (s) and  are deemed to be deriving clinical

22 benefit  based on the investigator assessment.  
 
2.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 
Although immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_368436]- PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are demonstrating efficacy across 
a spectrum of malignancies, the response rates have been variable. Therefore, intensive effort s 
are underway to identify blood- and tumor-based biomarkers that may predict response to these agents.   One of the first potential tumor -based biomarkers explored was  PD-L1 status in the tumor cells. 
A number of clinical studies have suggested a correlation between the level of PD -L1 expression 
in tumors and responses to nivolumab (18-20, 51-53, 78), as detailed  in Section 2.5.3. However, 
this correlation is imperfect. Patients who have PD -L1 non- expressing tumors may still respond 
to anti- PD-1/PD-L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_368437]; conversely, patients with tumors expressing a 
high level of PD-L1 may fail to respond. At least partially, this discrepancy may be due to the 
dynamic nature of PD -L1 expression, influenced by [CONTACT_368467]/or prior treatments and 
timing of the biopsy (82-85) . There is also  spatial  heterogen eity in the expression of PD- L1. 
Therefore, alternative biomarker approaches are being investigated.  
 Other  potential bi omarkers aside from PD -L1 have been proposed, derived from tumor cells or 
immune cells in the  tumor microenvironment. These biomarkers, detectable  by [CONTACT_4658],  include 
immunoregulatory molecules PD -L2, FOXP3, PD-1, CTLA- 4, LAG -3, co- stimulatory molecules 
and tumor- associated antigens (85, 86). Furthermore, s everal studies  have found that the 
mutational load and/or the number of predicted neoantigens are relevant in predicting response to checkpoint inhibition. The total burden of nonsynonymous mutations as determined by [CONTACT_368468]-PD-1 therapy in various cancers including NSCLC. Similarly, the number of candidate 
tumor neoantigens, predicted using  in silico algorithms that account for MHC binding, is 
associ ated with response to anti- PD-1/PD- L1 and anti -CTLA -4 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (87-89). Other tumor-
associated biomarkers  that have been proposed include tumor- based multi gene signatures and the 
presence of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) measured using multiplex IHC or 
immunofluorescence (IF) for molecules such as  CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD- L1 (86, 90).  
 Biomarkers derived from the blood are also being  explored, given the relative ease of collection 
and potential for serial monitoring. Soluble mediator detection methods such as enzyme-linked 
immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) can be used to 
detect the relative abundance of cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IFN- ϒ, IL-2, IL -5, IL -10, IL -17, 
granzyme B, TNF, GM-CSF) and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in the peripheral blood (86).  
 
As part of this study, we will collect pre -treatment archival (within 6 months  of starting the 
study) or fresh FFPE tumor biopsy specimens. These biopsies will be evaluated for potential biomarkers of response to the study drugs in the study population. Specifically, the level of PD -
L1 expression in the tumor cells will be determine d using IHC. Additional IHC on FFPE tissue 
may be performed to detect the expression of immunoregulatory proteins such as, but not limited 
to, PD-L2, PD-1, and other markers associated with tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (e.g., 
CD4, CD8, FOXP3). FFPE tissue and/or peripheral blood sample may be further evaluated by

23 molecular techniques including but not limited to: IF, QPCR, and/or genetic sequencing. 
Because of the evolving nature of the field, not all of the potential biomarkers of interest can be pre-specified in this document.

carboplatin (AUC 5) IV over 30 minutes, on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle. For subjects enrolled in 
Cohorts G and H, nivolumab 360 mg will be administered IV over 30 minutes (with a window of ±5 minutes), followed by [CONTACT_13438] (500 mg/m
2) IV over 10 minutes and carboplatin (AUC 5) 
IV over 30 minutes, on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle. A ±3-day window period will be authorized 
throughout the study period.   This combination will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of [ADDRESS_461103] stable disease or response after 4 cycles will discontinue carboplatin, and continue nivolumab 360 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m
2 with 
(Cohorts E and F) or without (Cohorts G and H ) bevacizumab as maintenance therapy on Day 1 
every 3 weeks. Again, a ±3-day window period will be authorized throughout the study period. 
Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.   In subjects who require pemetrexed dose reduction, the dose of pemetrexed may be escalated to 500 mg/m
2 after the discontinuation of carboplatin at the investigator’s discretion, if the prior 
toxicity was felt to be related mainly to carboplatin.  
 If a subject receiving nivolumab and pemetrexed (with or without bevacizumab) maintenance 
experiences an adverse event, and the investigator can attribute it to either nivolumab or pemetrexed  or bevacizumab , then that agent can be discontinued and the remain ing agent(s)  can 
be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
 On the day of the infusion, nivolumab is to be administered first. Infusion of the bevacizumab and/or platinum- doublet chemotherapy will start at least 30 minutes after the  completion of 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461104]’s weight on the day of the dosing differs by >10% from the weight used to calculate the prior dose, the pemetrexed dose must be re-calculated. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram or per institutional standard for bevacizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed . It is permissible to re -
calculate the doses more frequently for weight changes greater than 5%.  
 The carboplatin dose is calculated using the Calvert formula as follows: 
• Carboplatin dose (mg) = Target AUC x [(CrCl (mL/min) + 25] 
• Creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculation i s based on the Cockroft- Gault formula (see 
Inclusion Criteria in Section 3.1) and should include the most recent serum creatinine and most recent weight. If calculation of the CrCl by [CONTACT_94486]- Gault formula yields a 
result of > 125 mL/min, then a CrCl should be calculated by [CONTACT_368470] 125 mL/min.  
• The dose of carboplatin may be capped per local standards. 
 
Pre-medication for use with pemetrexed : Oral corticosteroid should be given according to local 
standard s at a dose equivalent to dexamethasone 4 mg BID on the day prior to, day of, and day 
after the administration of pemetrexed  during the carboplatin, pemetrexed, and nivolumab 
induction cycles . Once participants are receiving maintenance therapy of pemetrexed plus 
nivolumab, steroid dose ≤ dexamethasone [ADDRESS_461105] dose of pemetrexed. Intramuscular (IM) inject ion of vitamin B12 [ADDRESS_461106] dose of pemetrexed, and repeated every 3 cycles (every 9 weeks) thereafter during pemetrexed treatment. Subsequent injections of vitamin B12 may be given on the same day as pemetrexed.  
 Pre-medications are allowed to be administered during the wait time after the nivolumab 
infusion.  
 
Pre-medications for use with carboplatin/pemetrexed: Anti- emetic premedication(s) will be 
administered according to local standards. Recommended anti- emetic treatments are 
dexamethasone (dosing according to local standards, and an equivalent dose of another 
corticosteroid may be substituted) and a 5- HT [ADDRESS_461107] (type per investigator 
discretion and local standards of care). Additional use of anti- emetic medications is allowed at 
the investigator’s discretion.  
 Pre-medications are allowed to be administered during the wait time after the nivolumab 
infusion.

33 Guidelines for appropriate dose modifications and treatment interruptions or discontinuation due 
to specific adverse events are provided  in Section 6.. 
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.3.1 Permitted Therapy  
 
Subjects are permitted to use topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra- articular, intranasal, and i nhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (< 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed- type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.  
 Regular concomitant use of bisphophosphonates and RANK-L inhibitors for prevention or reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases is allowed if initiated prior to first dose of study therapy.   Caution should be exercised when the following are administered with bevacizumab: 
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_368441]: Since the most serious toxicities observed with bevacizumab to 
date are hemorrh ages, thrombosis, and gastrointestinal perforations, the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_368442].  
o Participants who require long-term administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (>325 mg/day) or 
non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs that inhibit platelet function at doses  used 
to treat chronic inflammatory diseases will not be included in the study (see inclusion and exclusion criteria).  
o Administration of low doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤325 mg/day), occasional administration of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or non-steroida l anti- inflammatory drugs 
inhibiting platelet function is authorized. Patients presenting with a venous thromboembolic accident during the trial will be withdrawn from bevacizumab treatment.  
 
5.3.2 Prohibited and/or Restricted Therapy  
 The following medications are prohibited during the study, unless utilized to treat a drug- related 
adverse event:  
 
• Immunosuppressive agents; 
 
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids, except as stated in Section 5.3 .1; 
 
• Any concurrent anti- neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, extensive or non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or 
investigational agents for the treatment of NSCLC).  
 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461108] 14 days prior to initiation of the study treatment unless otherwise specified below.   
• Anticoagulants (e.g., LMWH, warfarin) are prohibited within [ADDRESS_461109] 
administration of bevacizumab and for the entire duration of treatment with bevacizumab.  
 
• Anti-platelet agents (e.g., ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]).  
 
Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal medications, as there may be as of yet 
unknown interactions with nivolumab. Discontinuation of the use of herbal medications prior to study enrollment is encouraged.   Investigators should refer to the product labeling for carboplatin and pemetrexed for additional prohibited and restricted concomitant medications. Non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) can be administered w ith pemetrexed in patients with normal renal function, but 
caution should be used when administering NSAIDs concurrently with pemetrexed in patients 
with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Further information is available in the Pemetrexed 
Package Inser t.  
 
5.3.3 Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Participants should receive full supportive care including transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, analgesia, etc., according to local practice/institutional guidelines where appropriate. Anti -emetic medicati ons should be prescribed according to local practice. 
 Treatments received prior to the study entry and that are not prohibited by [CONTACT_368471], depending on their physician’s recommendations. All concomitant medication(s) must be reported in the Case Report Form.   Palliative local radiation therapy will be permitted for participants with symptomatic bone 
metastases, skin lesions, or CNS lesions, provided that the participant continues to derive clinical 
benefit from the study drugs in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Palliative radiation to lesions causing hemoptysis may also be permitted in subjects who do not have evidence of overall clinical or radiographic progression, provided that the lesions undergoing local therapy are not the only sites of measurable disease, upon discussion with the Principal Investigator.    The potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_368443], 
although anecdotal data suggests that it is  tolerable. In the absence of formal evaluation, in cases 
where palliative radiation is required for a tumor lesion, nivolumab  should be withheld for at 
least 1 week before, during, and 1 week after radiation. Subjects should be closely monitored for any p otential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs should resolve to grade ≤ 
1 prior to resuming study drugs. For patients undergoing cerebral radiotherapy, bevacizumab should be held for 14 days following completion of radiation.

6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as specified  below. For all cohorts , a ±3-day visit 
and treatment window is allowed. Per DF/HCC guidelines, delays for state/federal holidays, 
inclement weather, or circumstances b eyond the control of the research team and/or participant 
are not considered protocol deviations.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
6.1 Dose  Delay Criteria  
 
6.1.1 Dose  Delays for Nivolumab Plus Carboplatin and Pemetrexed 
 
Nivolumab and carboplatin/pemetrexed administration should be delayed for the following:  
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500/µl 
• Platelets < 100,000/mm
3 
• Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, non-hematologic, drug -related AE, except for fatigue and 
laboratory abnormalities  
• Any Grade ≥ 3 skin drug- related AE  
• Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions: 
o Grade [ADDRESS_461112], ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay dosing for drug -related Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_461113], ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay dosing f or drug -related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants dose delays of the study medications. Investigator should consult 
local labeling for carboplatin and pemetrexed for additional guidance on dose delays.  
 Of note, in subjects receiving carboplatin and pemetrexed with nivolumab, i f any non -
hematologic AE meeting the dose delay criteria above is felt to be related to only one particular agent  in the platinum-double chemotherapy , then that agent alone may be omitted for that cycle 
while the other agent(s) are  given. In order to maintain synchronized dosing of the regimen, the 
omitted agent should be resumed with the next scheduled cycle once the AE has improved and re-treatment criteria are met.   
 Subjects who require dosing delay should be re- evaluated weekly or more frequently if clinically 
indicated, and resume study treatment when re -treatment criteria are met , as specified in Section 
6.3.1.  . 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461114] occur if a patient experiences a serious adverse event or a grade 3 or 4 non- serious adverse event assessed by [CONTACT_368472]. If the event resolves to grade ≤1, bevacizumab ma y be restarted at the same dose 
level. If bevacizumab is delayed due to toxicity for >[ADDRESS_461115] dose o f bevacizumab and major surgery is unknown. 
Because bevacizumab has a half -life of approximately 21 days, elective surgery should be 
delayed whenever possible, but if necessary, bevacizumab should be held for ≥28 days prior to the procedure. Re- initiation of bevacizumab following surgery should not occur for ≥[ADDRESS_461116] fully healed. Re-initiation of bevacizumab after surgery requires documented approval from the sponsor.   Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted in patients who develop dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension. Patients who experience an NCI CTCAE grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will be discontinued from bevacizumab treatment.   Bevacizumab infusion should be slowed to ≤50% or interrupted for patients who experience any infusion-associated symptoms not specified above. If the infusion is interrupted, it may be resumed at ≤50% of the rate prior to the reaction after the patient’s symptoms have adequately resolved and increased in 50% increments up to the full rate if well tolerated. Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next cycle.

• All other drug- related toxicities re turned to baseline or Grade ≤ 1, with exceptions as 
noted below. 
• Grade ≤ 2 alopecia and fatigue. 
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed . Subjects with persistent Grade [ADDRESS_461120] 1 month may be eli gible for re -treatment if 
discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_079].  
• Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug- related 
toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of 
prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day. 
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the Principal Investigator.  
• If a subject fails to meet criteria for re -treatment, then re -treatme nt should be delayed, 
and the subject should be re- evaluated weekly or more frequently as clinically indicated. 
Dose delay of nivolumab and/or carboplatin and pemetrexed which results in treatment 
interruption of > 6 weeks requires treatment discontinuatio n, with exceptions as noted in 
  
Protocol #17-011

42 Section 6.4.  
 
6.3.2 Criteria to Resume Bevacizumab  
 Please refer to Section 6.1.2.  
 
6.4 Criteria to Discontinue Treatment  
 
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment 
for discontinuation of carboplatin/pemetrexed or from the assessment for discontinuation of bevacizumab . If the investigator can attribute an adverse event to a specific agent and the criteria 
for discontinuation of that drug are met, then that agent can be discontinued and the other agent(s) continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If the investigator is unable to determine whether an adverse event is related to one drug only, then the subject should 
discontinue all drugs in the combination regimen and be taken off the treatment phase of the 
study.   
6.4.1 Criteria for Nivolumab Discontinuation

previous dose requires discontinuation of that drug(s) with the following exception:  
o Dosing delays lasting > [ADDRESS_461126] with a dosing delay lasting > [ADDRESS_461127] be consulted.  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued carboplatin and pemetrexed dosing. Investigators should consult local labeling for the chemotherapy agents for additional guidance on dose discontinuation.  
 
6.4.3 Criteria for Bevacizumab Discontinuation 
 Please refer to Section 6.1.2.  
 
6.5 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents 
 
Immu no-oncology (I -O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is considered  an immune-oncology 
agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated wi th I-O agents may 
mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:  
• Gastrointestinal 
• Renal  
• Pulmonary 
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathy 
• Skin 
• Neurological  
 The above algorithms are found in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure, as well as in Appendix 
B.  
 6.[ADDRESS_461128] with fevers, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_45781]. 
Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) guidelines. 
 Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
45 standards and guidelines, as appropriate: 
 
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):  
• Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic pre-medications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 
mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_461129] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administratio ns. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction; requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, intravenous fl uids); prophylactic medications 
indicated for ≤ 24 hours): 
• Stop the nivolumab infusion. Begin an intravenous infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_461130] until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% 
of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve. If no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered at that 
visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_461131] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic pre- medications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_461132] 30 minutes before nivolumab infusions. If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction; Grade 3: prolonged (i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_86025]/or brief interruption of infusion), recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_368447] l sequelae (e.g., renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates); Grade 4: life -threatening, pressor or ventilator support 
indicated):  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline 
and treat the subject as follows: Recommen d bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of 
a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent ), as needed. Subject should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remai n at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms.  
 In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
46 generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., 
oral anti -histamine or corticosteroids).  
  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the chara cteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in 
addition  to routine reporting. 
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.

immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
• AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management  
• AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity  
• AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby [CONTACT_368473].

Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461144] to wound healing risk in patients receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half life of bevacizumab is 21 days. Bevacizumab should be 
discontinued in patients with severe wound healing complications. 
 If patients receiving treatment with bevacizumab require elective major 
surgery, it is recommended that bevacizumab be held for 4–8 weeks prior to the 
surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure should not begin or restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure (in the case of high-risk procedures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, 
it is recommended that chemotherapy be restarted no earlier than 6 weeks and 
bevacizumab no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery).  
Hemorrhage: Overall, Grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% of 
1132 patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database from eight Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in multiple tumor types (bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure). The hemorrhagic events that have been observed in bevacizumab 
clinical studies were predominantly tumor-associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage. 
 
Tumor -Associated Hemorrhage: Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or 
hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patients with NSCLC. Life-
threatening and fatal hemoptysis was identified as a bevacizumab-related 
adverse event in NSCLC trials. These events occurred suddenly and presented as major or massive hemoptysis. Among the possible risk factors evaluated (include squamous cell histology, treatment with anti-rheumatic/anti-
inflammatory drugs, treatment with anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, 
bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumor location, and cavitation of tumors during therapy), the only variables 
that showed statistically significant correlations with bleeding were 
bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell histology.   
Of patients experiencing pulmonary hemorrhages requiring medical intervention, 
many had cavitation and/or necrosis of the tumor, either preexisting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_368448]. Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_368449]-benefit. In

Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
57 observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus 
bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone. 
 
Additional Adverse Events: See the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for 
additional details regarding the safety experience with bevacizumab. 
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_461146] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are listed above should be reported only if the adverse event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected  toxicity  information which 
is provided. 
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section  (Expedited Adverse Event  Reporting) under the sub- heading of Protocol-
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions.  
 
• Serious adverse event (SAE):  
- A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that , at any dose:  
- results in death  
- is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE  below) 
- results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, ma y jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
- Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
- Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
59 • If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug 
or if new information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report 
should be sent within 24 hours to BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
7.3.4 DF/HCC Expedited Reporting Guidelines 
 
Investig ative sites within DF/HCC will report AEs directly to the DFCI Office 
for Human Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB  reporting policy.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_461147] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e .g,, dose tapering if 
necessary for participant).  
 The investigator must immediately notify  of this event via the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.   Protocol- required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
participant . 
 Follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form [provided upon request from BMS].  Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a mal e study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.  
 
7.5 Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
 
The Overall PI , as study sponsor, will be responsible for all communications with the FDA. The 
Overall PI  [INVESTIGATOR_57895], regardless of the site of occurrence, any serious adverse event 
that meets the FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and timelines set by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
7.6 Expedited Reporting to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_368450] #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461148]  be reported in routine study data submissions to the Overall PI  [INVESTIGATOR_252379] f orms .  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g.,  reported to the 
IRB, FDA, etc.)  must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
Investigators should report to the responsible regulatory authority as appropriate.

10.1 Study Assessments  
 
• Informed consent : Informed consent, documented by a signed consent form, must be 
obtained prior to any screening activities not otherwise part of the participant’s care. A 
note documenting the informed consent procedure should be included in the participant’s medical record.  
 
• Demographics : Demographic information consists of the participant’s age, gender, race, 
and ethnicity (as allowed by [CONTACT_54468]). 
 
• Relevant medical history and current medical conditions : Medical and surgical 
history includes diagnoses, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and medical/surgical treatments.  
 
• Diagnosis and extent of cancer : The initial cancer diagnosis and the current cancer 
diagnosis at the time of screening (if different), along with dates of diagnosis need to be recorded.  
 
• Prior antineoplastic therapy : Prior cancer therapy history consists of the specific 
oncologic regimens  a patient has received, the dates of the regimen and the best response 
to the regimen, and the reason for failure or intolerance to each regimen. Stem cell transplant or experimental or investigational therapy history must also be recorded.  
 
o Documentatio n of an EGFR  mutation or ALK  rearrangement : Documentation of an 
EGFR activating gene  mutation  (e.g., L858R, exon 19 deletion) is required per local 
testing. ALK status is to be determined using ALK FISH, IHC, or next generation 
sequencing (NGS). For ALK FISH, positivity will be defined as > 15% positive tumor 
cells. Local ALK testing is acceptable, provided that archival tissue is available for 
patients deemed ALK positive on the basis of NGS. 
 
• Concomitant medications:  Concomitant medications for all ongoing medical conditions 
or AEs must be reported from the date the informed consent is signed until at least [ADDRESS_461165] discontinues.   
• Vital signs : Vital signs include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure 
(when patient is seated). In addition, screening assessment includes height and weight. 
 
• ECOG performance status : The participant’s performance status must be assessed 
using the ECO G performance scale (Appendix A ).  
 
• Physical exam : A physical examination will be performed, the extent of which should be 
consistent with the medical history and the participant’s underlying disease.  
 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
73 • Hematology: Hematology assessments of the parameters listed in Table  10.1-1 will be 
tested as per the schedule of assessments (Table 10 -1).

be tested as per the schedule of assessments (Table 10 -1). 
 
• Thyroid function testing:  Thyroid function assessment listed in Table 10.1- 1 will be 
tested as per the schedule of assessments (Table 10 -1). 
 
• Urinalysis: Urine measurements will be performed as per Table 10.1 -1 and according to 
the schedule of assessments (Table 10 -1).  
 
• Electrocardiogram : 12-lead ECGs will be performed at baseline during the screening 
visit, and again at the end of treatment. Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated throughout the study. 
 
• Pregnancy test:  A serum  pregnancy test will be  completed at baseline during the 
screening.  
 
• Disease assessments: Tumor assessments will take place in accordance with the schedule 
outlined in Table 10-1. A ±7-day window is permitted. At screening, disease assessment 
must include imaging of the chest and abdomen. Imaging of the pelvis should also be performed if clinically indicated. Contrast-enhanced CT with PO/IV contrast or contrast-
enhanced MRI are the preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject has a known allergy to contrast material, local prophylaxis standard should be used to obtain the assessment with contrast if at all possible. In cases where contrast is strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Should a subject have a contraindication for CT IV contrast, a non- contrast CT of the chest and a contrast -

Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461166] version 1.1 guidelines (See Section 11). Imaging assessment is also required to be performed at the End of Treatment.  
 
• Tumor biopsy : Tumor tissue sample is within 6 months prior to enrollment. Tissue 
sample may be fresh, or archival if obtained within 6 months prior to enrollment.   
• Adverse events : Participants must be followed for all adverse events (AEs) from the start 
of study treatment until the safety follow -up phase (day 30 and day 100 since end of 
treatment) , and for all serious or study drug- related toxicities until the AEs are resolved 
and are considered chronic or stable or until patient contact [CONTACT_368477]. Serious adverse events (SAEs) should be monitored and reported. Type, incidence, severity (graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0), timing, seriousness and relatedness, outcome, action taken with the study drug, and treatment will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_23528]. Malignancy- related signs and 
symptoms noted at study entry will be recorded as AEs during the trial if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
  
11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 11.[ADDRESS_461167] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, participants  should be re- evaluated for response every [ADDRESS_461168] 6 months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_461169] had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461170] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_461171] one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_461172] 
scan or MRI (excluding lymph nodes – see below) .  All tumor measurements  must be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note : Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not eligible for 
measurable disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must be clearly identified as such.   
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathol ogically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_461173] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions pe r organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
76 as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph  nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesio ns.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3 Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is  also 
acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction  in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the ap pearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461174] sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper  normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Princ ipal 
Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of New Lesions 
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of s mall size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best respo nse assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note :  Participants  with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment  without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
11.1.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive dis ease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation ). 
 
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of st able disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression-Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the t ime from 
the day treatment starts  to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. 
Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease 
evaluation. 
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the day 
treatment starts  to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those 
without progression reported.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of nivolumab admi nistered in 
combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, in TKI -pre-
treated,  chemotherapy -naïve, EGFR-mutant or ALK -positive patients. The patients must have 
advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC which progressed on a third-generation EGFR TKI, or advanced ALK -rearranged NSCLC which progressed on at least one next -generation ALK TKI. 
 
• Eligible patients who are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab –eligible will receive 
nivolumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed  plus bevacizumab for 4 cycles, followed by 
[CONTACT_368478]- specified 
doses (Cohort s E and F ).  
 
• Eligible patients who are chemotherapy -naïve and bevacizumab –ineligible will receive 
nivolumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_368479]-specified doses (Cohorts G and H ).  
 
Our primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of these combinations using an objective response rate (ORR) . ORR will be determined using efficacy assessments (CT chest/abdomen)  
performed every [ADDRESS_461176] overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial r esponse (PR) divided by [CONTACT_368480]. 
The BOR is assessed per RECIST 1.1. For subjects who continue study medication beyond progression, the BOR should be determined based on response designations recorded at the time of the initial RECIST 1.1 -defined progression.  
 Secondary endpoints that will be investigated include the disease control rate (DCR), duration of 
response (DOR), duration on treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) (including PFS rates at 6 months and at 12 months), and overall survival (OS) (including OS rates at 1 year and at 2 years) . Safety and tolerability of the combination regimen will also be assessed . Exploratory 
analysis will include evaluation of the efficacy endpoints in subjects with PD- L1-expressing or 
non-expressin g tumors. Baseline tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples will be  evaluated for 
biomarkers of response or resistance to the combination therapy (e.g., PD-L1, PD -L2, CD4, 
CD8, FOXP3, cytokines, T- cell subsets, genetic sequencing ).   
 
13.2 Sample Size, Accrual  Rate  and Study Duration  
 
This study will be comprised of four cohort s as specified above. Each cohort will be considered 
as independent for efficacy and will be analyzed independently. The study will be conducted using a two- stage design.   
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, [ADDRESS_461177] 
CR or PR. Should the study proceed to the second stage, 16 more pat ients will be enrolled for a 
total of 25 in each cohort . If 1 2 (or more) of [ADDRESS_461178] a promising anti- tumor activity. T his design is associated with 80% power if 55% of the 
patients truly were to have a response to nivolumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed. The overall type 1 error rate is 4.2% if the unde rlying rate of responses were 30 % or less. The probability of 
early termination is 0.463. The null hypothesis is based on the data from prior studies suggesting 
that platinum-based doublet chemotherapy following progression on a prior TKI in oncogene-driven NSCLC generally leads to responses in 20-30% of patients (2, 15, 16).   
Accrual Rate and Study Duration : 
EGFR mutations and ALK  rearrangements are identified in approximately 10 -15% and 3- 7% of 
patients with NSCLC, respectively. At MGH alone, approximately 500 patients with NSCLC undergo genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_368455]. Additionally, DF/HCC is a referral center for patients with EGFR-mutant and ALK -positive NSCLC. Therefore, across the participating institutions, we expect to 
enroll 3-[ADDRESS_461179] to complete enrollment in approximately 25-
33 months.   All subjects will be followed for survival every 3 months (± 7 days) for up to [ADDRESS_461180] participant is enrolled.  
 
13.3 Interim Monitoring Plan    
 
Please refer to Section 13.2 for the two -stage study design with an early termination rule based 
on efficacy.   
13.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
 
See Section 13.1. Analysis of the primary endpoint will follow the trial design. Response rates will be calculated at each stage, and the decision to continue will be based on the criteria specified in Section 13.1. In addition, 95% exact binomial CI will be reported. Response rates will be reported by [CONTACT_368481] E+F and G+H to obtain a tighter CI for the ORR estimate.  
 
13.5 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed for exploratory purposes only. These analyses are applicable to the entire cohort as well as  PD-L1 expressing  (staining positive for PD-L1 in ≥1% 
of tumor cells)  and PD-L1 non- expressing subset cohorts .  
 Disease control rate (DCR)  – DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects who have either a 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1.  
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
82  
Duration of response (DOR)  – DOR is measured from the first time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is recorded first), based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_461181] date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented. The duration of CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that PD is objectively documented. Subjects who are non-responders (i.e., do not achieve at least a PR) will be excluded from the analysis of the endpoint of interest for DOR. Subjects who have achieved at least a PR and do not have disease progression as of the data cutoff date for statistical analysis will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment prior to the data cutoff date.  
 Duration on therapy (DOT)  – DOT is measured from the date of initiation on study therapy 
until study drug discontinuation, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.   Progression -free survival (PFS)  – PFS is defined as the time from the start date of the study 
drug treatment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. Subjects who do not have disease progression and are alive as of the data cutoff date for the statistical analysis will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment prior to the data cutoff date. PFS will be summarized in each treatment cohort using the Kaplan- Meier method with 
median PFS time (including two -sided 95% CI). The PFS rates at 6 months and at 12 months 
will be estimated with two -sided 95% CIs.  
 Overall survival (OS)  – OS is defined as the time from the start date of the study drug treatment 
to death due to any cause. All subjects who are lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study or who have withdrawn from the study will be censored at the time of last contact. Subjects who are still receiving treatment as of the data cutoff date will be censored at the cutoff date. OS will be summarized for each tr eatment cohort using the Kaplan- Meier method with median OS time 
(including two- sided 95% CI). The OS rates at 1 year and at 2 years will be estimated with two -
sided 95% CIs.   Safety  – All participants who receive any study drug will be evaluable for toxicity. Toxicities 
(including laboratory parameter abnormalities) will be assessed using CTCAE v4.0. Summary tables of adverse events and serious adverse events will be created. The number  and percentage 
of participants who experience any AE, SAE, treatment -related AE, and treatment -related SAE 
will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The incidence and reasons for dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuations will be re corded.   
 Frequency, management, and resolution of select (immunologic)  AEs will be analyzed (e.g., 
pneumonitis IMAEs, diarrhea/colitis IMAEs, hepatitis IMAEs, nephritis and renal dysfunction IMAEs, rash IMAEs, endocrine IMAEs). A tabular summary of overall immunologic AEs and serious immunologic AEs will be provided. Time- to-onset, severity, duration of IMAEs, action 
taken with the study drug, dosing delays, corticosteroid details and re- challenge information will 
be described.  
 Exploratory biomarker analyses  – Exploratory analyses will be performed to correlate any 
findings from the various potential biomarker studies listed in Section 9 with the study endpoints above.   The goal of the biomarker/correlative studies is to establish the relationship between PD -L1 
  
Protocol #17-011  
Version Date:  July 20, 2018  
 
83 expression level (and potentially other biomarkers, such as the presence of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes or tumor mutational burden) and response to the study dr ugs. The rationale for 
these studies is outlined in Section 2.6. In the recent large randomized trials of checkpoint inhibitors including KEYNOTE-024 (103), patients with EGFR-mutant or ALK-rearranged 
metastatic NSCLC were excluded. Thus, it will be important to investigate the potential biomarkers of response to immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_368456]-mutant or ALK -rearranged 
NSCLC patients in a systematic manner.  
 PD-L1 expression level will be estimated and binned into a binary variable of positive 
(expressed in  ≥ 1% of tumor cells) or negative (expressed in <1% of tumor cells). A Fisher’s 
Exact Test will be used to test the relationship between response and PD-L1 status, and p- values 
will be calculated to test for statistical significance. All analyses will be d one by [CONTACT_368482] (cohort s E+F and cohort s G+H). A sample of [ADDRESS_461182] a 95% 
one-sided lower limit of 7 4.3% for a desired sensitivity rate of 90%; for a sample of 50 subjects, 
the lower limit is 80%.  
  
14. PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
It is anticipated that the results of this study will first be reported in abstract form, followed by [CONTACT_368483] a peer-reviewed manuscript.

Masked, Parallel -Group, 3 –Month Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of 
NCX  [ADDRESS_698328] 0.005% in Subjects with Open- Angle Glaucoma or Ocular 
Hypertension  (Mont Blanc)  
Study No.  NCX -470-02 
Sponsor  Nicox Ophthalmics, Inc.  
Background 
and Rationale   Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide (Jonas, 2017).  Intraocular 
pressure (IOP) is the primary risk factor for glaucoma, and lowering IOP to prevent 
optic nerve injury is currently the only proven effective treatment (Jonas, 2017).  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_536216] (PGAs), such as latanoprost, bimatoprost, and 
travoprost, are the most common first -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_536217] (Daka, 2014).  
Nicox is developi[INVESTIGATOR_536218] 470, a nitric oxide (NO) -donating bimatoprost 
prostaglandin analog, as a new therapy for lowering of IOP in patients with open-
angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). When exposed to esterases 
in the eye, NCX [ADDRESS_698329], and into 6 -
(nitrooxy) -hexanoic acid, a NO -donating moiety.   
Nitric oxide relaxes the trabecular meshwork (TM) and increases outflow of the 
aqueous humor through the primary outflow mechanism from the anterior chamber 
(Gabelt, 2011; Heyne, 2013; Cavet, 2014).  In an additive manner, bimatoprost acts 
by [CONTACT_536250] (Krauss, 2004).   
The additive effect of a NO -donor and a prostaglandin F2α receptor agonist has 
been established in clinical trials with latanoprostene bunod, a dual -acting single 
molecular entity with NO -donating moiety linked to latanoprost. Latanoprostene 
bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024% (VYZULTA ®) was developed for the reduction 
of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT (Medeiros, 2016; Weinreb, 2016). In addition 
to the clinical validation of this approach, extensive nonclinical studies for both 
NCX  470 and latanoprostene bunod support this dual mechanism of action of NO -
donating PGAs for increased outflow via TM and uveoscleral pathways.  
The results of the Phase 2 trial  “Dolomites” , NCX -470-[ZIP_CODE] demonstrated that all 
tested concentrations of NCX 470 (0.021%, 0.042%, and 0.065%) once daily ( QD) 
met the primary efficacy endpoint of non- inferiority to latanoprost 0.005% QD for 
reduction from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at Day 28. In pre- specified secondary 
efficacy analyses, NCX 470 0.065% was superior to latanoprost for mean IOP 
reduction from baseline at all 3 time points (8AM, 10AM and 4PM) on Day 28, with 
the difference reaching up to 1.4 mmHg. Mean IOP reduction from baseline at the 
3 time points across Days 7, 14 and 28 ranged from 7.6 to 9.8 mmHg for 
NCX  470 0.065% compared with 6.[ADDRESS_698330] frequent adverse 
event was conjunctival hyperemia. There were no treatment -related serious 
adverse events, and no evidence of treatment -related systemic side effects. 
NCX  470 showed increased IOP -lowering efficacy with each incremental 
concentration of NCX 470, with a conjunctival hyperemia dos e-response which 
plateaued at the middle dose (0.042%). The separation of the dose -response 
NCX-470-02 version 2.0; 08-July-2020   Page 14  of 78  curves in IOP lowering vs. conjunctival hyperemia showed a favorable therapeutic 
index thereby [CONTACT_122995] a higher concentration of NCX 470 (i.e., 0.1%) to be 
evaluated in this  trial alongside the highest dose tested (0.065% NCX 470) in the

Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analysis of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with mean 
IOP at the given visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 ) and time point (8AM and 4PM) 
as the response, baseline IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect, using

1.1 Background and Rationale  
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide ( Jonas , 2017 ).  Globally it has been 
estimated that 57.5 million people were affected by [CONTACT_536252]- angle glaucoma ( POAG ) 
in 2015, with this number projected to rise to 65.5 million by 2020 ( Kapetanakis, 2016 ).  
Intraocular pressure (I OP) is the pr imary risk factor for glaucoma , and lowering IOP to 
prevent optic nerve injury is currently the only proven effective treatment ( Jonas , 2017 ).  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_492693] , such as bimatoprost, are considered as the mainstay of treatment due to their 
efficacy and safety in lowering IOP ( Daka, 2014 ).  Clinical trials reported greater reduction in 
IOP in subjects with OAG or OHT  with bimatoprost 0.03%  compared with either travoprost  
0.004%  or latanoprost 0.005% in some instances , and equivalence among the three 
treatments in others ( Parrish, 2003 ; Gandolfi, 2001 ).  All treatments presented an acceptable 
safety profile although lower  incidences of conjunctival hyperemia have been reported with 
latanoprost  0.005% than with the other PGAs  (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies 
in Health, 2015 ; Daka, 2014 ). 
Nicox is developi[INVESTIGATOR_536218] 470, a nitric oxide ( NO)-donating bimatoprost prostaglandin analog, 
as a new therapy for lowering IOP in patients with OAG  or OHT . When exposed to esterases 
in the eye, NCX [ADDRESS_698340], and into 6-
(nitrooxy) -hexanoic acid, a NO -donating moiety.  The active metabolites of NCX [ADDRESS_698341] , the active ingredient in LUMIGAN ®, (NDAs 02 1275 and 022184) , and 6-
(nitrooxy) -hexanoic acid which  leads to the release of NO. Another NO -donating PGA 
(VYZULTA ®, latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0. 024%), also discovered and 
invented by [CONTACT_536253], received US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval in November 2017 for the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT  (NDA  207795).  
Bimatoprost and NO provide robust IOP -lowering activity by [CONTACT_536254]: uveoscleral outflow and trabecular/Schlemm’s canal conventional 
outflow facilities (Woodward, 2010; Cavet, 2014
). Nitric oxide  donors relax the TM and 
increase aqueous humor outflow ( Gabelt, 2011; Heyne, 2013; Cavet, 2014 ).  As a result, NO 
modulates IOP through the conventional pathway.  In contrast, bimatoprost acts by [CONTACT_536255] ( Krauss, 
2004 ). 
The additive effect of a NO donor and a prostaglandin F2α receptor agonist has been confirmed with latanoprostene bunod, a dual -acting NO -donating latanoprost developed for 
the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG  or OHT  (Medeiros, 2016 ; Weinreb, 2016
).  This 
approach is supported by [CONTACT_536256][INVESTIGATOR_536219]  470, as well as the 
publicly available data for bimatoprost . 
NCX 470 exhibited potent and effective IOP-lowering activity in three ocular hypertensive  
animal models ( Impagnatiello, 2015 ). Nonclinical pharmacology studies in well- established 
animal models of glaucoma and OHT have demonstrated that the IOP -lowering efficacy of 
NCX [ADDRESS_698342] .  In particular, in transient 
ocular hypertensive rabbits , known to respond poorly to PGF2α analogs and prostamides, 
NCX 470 lowers IOP likely via NO release.  Additionally, an equimolar dose of NCX 470  at 
0.042% lowers IOP more effectively than  bimatoprost at 0.0 3% in ocular normotensive dogs 
at [ADDRESS_698343]-in-man Phase 2 trial “Dolomites”, NCX -470-[ZIP_CODE] demonstrated that 
all tested concentrations of NCX 470 (0.021%, 0.042%, and 0.065%) QD met the primary

NCX-470-02 version 2.0; 08-July-[ADDRESS_698344] 0.005% QD for reduction from baseline in 
mean diurnal IOP at Day 28. In pre- specified secondary efficacy analyses, NCX 470 0.065% 
was superior to latanoprost for mean IOP reduction from baseline at all 3 time points (8AM, 
10AM and 4PM) on Day 28, with the difference reaching up to 1.4 mmHg. Mean IOP 
reduction from baseline at the 3 time points across Days 7, 14 and 28 ranged from 7.6 to 9.8 
mmHg for NCX  470 0.065% compared with 6.[ADDRESS_698345] frequent adverse event was 
conjunctival hyperemia. There were no treatment -related serious adverse events, and no 
evidence of treatment -related systemic side effects. The linearly increasing, dose- dependent 
IOP-lowering efficacy of NCX 470 without reaching a plateau, and the plateauing of ocular 
adverse events at the mid- dose of NCX 470 (0.042%) in the Phase 2 Dolomites trial (NCX -
470-[ZIP_CODE]) indicated that a higher dose (0.1%) has the potential for greater IOP lowering 
without apparent significant additional risks.  Therefore, an adaptive design will be utilized in 
the current trial whereby  [CONTACT_536257] 470 doses  (0.065% or 0.1%) will be discontinued 
during the adaptive evaluation, which will occur after at least 30 subjects  randomized  in each 
arm complete their Week 2 Visit.

Justification of the Route of Delivery  
The topi[INVESTIGATOR_536220] [ADDRESS_698348] of NCX 470 was initially established in normotensive beagle dogs 
and ocular hypertensive non- human primates. In these nonclinical models , topi[INVESTIGATOR_536221] 470 0.042%, formulated to be equimolar to topi[INVESTIGATOR_536222] 0.03% bimatoprost, demonstrated 2.[ADDRESS_698349] compared to 0.03% topi[INVESTIGATOR_536223].  
Therefore,  clinical dose ranging in the Phase 2 trial  was centered on the mid dose of 0.042% 
NCX 470 (equimolar with 0.03% bimatoprost ); a low dose of 0.021% NCX 470 ( equimolar to 
0.015% bimatoprost ); and a high dose of 0.065% NCX 470 (equimolar to 0.05% 
bimatoprost ).  
The once- daily (in the evening) dosing regimen for NCX 470 is consistent with that of other 
PGAs.  
The results of the P hase 2 trial “Dolomites”, NCX -470-[ZIP_CODE] demonstrated that all tested 
concentrations of NCX 470 (0.021%, 0.042%, and 0.065%) QD met the primary efficacy endpoint of non- inferiority to latanoprost 0.005% QD for reduction from baseline in mean 
diurnal IOP at Day 28. In pre- specified secondary efficacy analyses, NCX 470 0.065% was 
superior to latanoprost for mean IOP reduction from baseline at all 3 time points (8AM, 10AM

NCX  470 0.065% compared with 6.[ADDRESS_698350] frequent adverse event was 
conjunctival hyperemia. There were no treatment -related serious adverse events, and no 
evidence of treatment -related systemic side effects. NCX 470 showed linearly increas ing 
IOP-lowering efficacy with each incremental concentration of NCX 470 without reaching a 
plateau, with a conjunctival hyperemia dose- response which plateaued at the middle dose 
(0.042%). The separation of the dose- response curves in IOP lowering vs. conjunctival 
hyperemia showed a favorable therapeutic index thereby [CONTACT_122995] a higher concentration 
of NCX 470 (i.e., 0.1%) to be evaluated in this trial alongside the highest dose tested (0.065% NCX 470) in the Phase [ADDRESS_698351] , are considered the mainstay 
of treatment for patients with OAG or OHT due to their efficacy and safety in lowering IOP 
(Li, 2016; Daka, 2014 ). L
atanoprost accounted for 71% of all PGA prescriptions in the US in 
2017, and more than one third of all prescribed IOP -lowering medications (IMS Data). As 
latanoprost was the first approved and remains the most widely prescribed PGA, latanoprost 
has a well -established safety and efficacy profile. Latanoprost has been used as comparator 
in the P hase 2 dose -ranging study NCX -470-[ZIP_CODE] and NCX 470 0.065% demonstrated its  
superior ity to this standard- of-care treatment for mean IOP reduction from baseline at all 
3 time points (8AM, 10AM and 4PM) at the Week [ADDRESS_698352] 0.005% is  a reasonable choice for an active comparator 
for the NCX [ADDRESS_698353] , and latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic

All non-ophthalmic medications used in the [ADDRESS_698361] be recorded. Additionally, all medications  used 
between the Screening Visit  and the Month 3/Exit  Visit must be recorded.  
Eligible subjects  will discontinue all previous IOP -lowering medication(s), if applicable, on the 
day of the Screening Visit. However, the initiation of treatment with an IOP -lowering 
medication with a shorter washout period than the subject’s IOP -lowering medication at 
screening is permitted between the Screening Visit and Eligibility 1 Visit  (see Table 1). 
Additionally, an IOP-lowering medication  with a short washout period  (e.g., a topi[INVESTIGATOR_536225]) is permitted in non -randomized subjects  during the 
Adaptive Dose Selection Period. 
The use of o ver-the-counter artificial tears or antihistamine eye drops  is allowed provided 
they are administered a minimum of 5  minutes before or after the instillation of the study 
medication.

Per Protocol (PP) analysis.  The list of major protocol deviations, as well as minor protocol 
deviations,  will be finalized prior to database lock.  
In order to correctly identify and document protocol deviations, protocol deviations will be

• Minor Deviation : Deviation considered to not impact  the primary efficacy outcome 
of the study ( i.e., does not affect the study results).  
• M ajor Deviation:  Deviation considered to impact the primary efficacy  outcome of 
the study ( i.e., affects the study results).

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  Lack of efficacy will be reported as a treatment failure, not as an AE. 
10.2 Severity of Adverse Event  
The severity of an AE should be categorized as mild, moderate or severe per Investigator’s  
judgment with the following scale in consideration:  
• Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s usual 
activities or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae.  
• Moderate : interferes with the subject’s usual activities, and or requires symptomatic 
treatment.  
• Severe: symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of the subject’s usual activities and requires treatment.  
10.[ADDRESS_698380] be made 
by [CONTACT_536265] . The following terms to evaluate the causali ty of the AE with 
the study drug  should be used:  
• Unrelated : a simultaneous disease, a simultaneous treatment or any other known 
cause is clearly responsible for the safety event and the AE is not related to the study 
medication.  
• Unlikely:  on the basis of the available knowledge regarding the subject’s history, 
the disease process, the timing of the safety event in relation to the administration 
of the study medication  and the mode of action of study medication, a relation 
between the study medication and the safety event is unlikely, but cannot be totally 
excluded.  
• Possible:  this relation exists when the safety event follows the reasonable 
chronological sequence from the moment of the study medication administration, but 
when the safety event could also have been caused by [CONTACT_536266] .  
• Probable:  this relation exists when the safety event follows a reasonable 
chronological sequence from the moment of the study medication  administration, 
corresponds to a known effect of the study medication, is confirmed by [CONTACT_536267], and therefore the study medication is the most probable of all the 
causes.  
• Definite:  this relation exists when the safety event follows a reasonable 
chronological sequence from the moment of the study medication administration , 
corresponds to a known effect of the category of the studied medication, is confirmed

Early exit for lack of efficacy/worsening of the disease will not be considered as an adverse 
event but as a treatment failure.

• Results in death, or  
• Results  in-subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect ( Section 12.2  - Procedure in Case of 
Pregnancy), or  
• Results in  life-threatening illness or injury (Note: The term “life- threatening” in the 
definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it was more severe, or had continued untreated). 
• Results in a significant and persistent loss or impairment of vision.  
Additionally , medical events that may not meet these criteria,  may be considered an SAE if , 
based on the medical judgment of the I nvestigator , such medical events may require an 
intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.  
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" 
and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided: the 
term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event.   This is not the same 
as "serious," which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning.  
Elective or planned procedures requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536229]’s; 
however, other events may occur during this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536230] -serious adverse events and will need to be captured according to the protocol. 
Subjects must not undergo any elective , or plan any non- urgent procedures for the study 
duration and [ADDRESS_698382] treatment administration. 
10.5 Adverse Event Reporting 
In this study, subjects  should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to 
general, non- directed questioning ( e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?”).  If 
it is determined that an AE has occurred, the I nvestigator should obtain all the information 
required to complete the AE Form (s).  
Additionally , subjects  will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737], and/or study coordinator 
if any significant AEs occur between study visits.  
All AEs that occur from the signing of the ICF on the day of the Screening Visit through the 
Month 3/Exit Visit must be recorded on the appropriate AE  form.  All AEs must be reported 
whether or not considered causally related to study medication.  For every AE, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_536231], document all actions taken with regard to study medication, and any other 
treatment measures for the AE.

Mean reduction from baseline (average of Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2 Visits) in time -matched 
IOP at the 8AM and 4PM time points at the Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3  Visits.  
The primary analysis of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with mean IOP at 
the given visit (Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3) and time point (8AM and 4PM) as the 
response, baseline IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect, using the ITT  
population with multiple imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  
The primary analysis for superiority will be completed similarly.

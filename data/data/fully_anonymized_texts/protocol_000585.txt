Patient population:  
Patients with COVID -19 associated acute hypox emia  
Rationale : 
GM-CSF is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function. Detailed studies have shown that 
GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from fetal monocytes and the 
maintenance of these cells in adulthood (Dranoff, 2017; Gui lliams, 2013). GM -CSF has a wide 
array of effects on myeloid cells. GM -CSF has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor 
that has pleiotropic effects not only in promoting the  differentiation of immature precursors 
into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells, but also in 
controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells (Zhan, 2019). GM -CSF is also known to 
reverse immunoparalysis seen in  sepsis by [CONTACT_302188], resulting in beneficial outcomes 
(Mathias, 2015; Meisel, 2009). Additionally, researchers have shown that in response to lung 
infection, GM -CSF signals B1a B cells to secrete polyreactive emergency immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) and e nsures effective early frontline defense against bacteria invading the lungs (Weber, 
2014).  
There is evidence that inhaled GM -CSF prevents bacteremia in post influenza bacterial 
pneumonia primarily through locally -mediated improved lung antibacterial resis tance to 
systemic bacteremia during influenza A viral infection (Umstead, 2020; Steinwede, 2011) and 
through increased production of reactive oxygen species by [CONTACT_302189] 
(Subramanian, 2014).  Pulmonary delivery of this cytokine has the potent ial to reduce morbidity 
and mortality due to viral pneumonia, potentially to include COVID -19. 
The safety and efficacy of sargramostim 125 mcg has been evaluated in several clinical studies. 
In one clinical study of six patients with moderate to severe com munity -acquired pneumonia or 
ventilator -associated pneumonia acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), 125 mcg of 
sargramostim was administered  by [CONTACT_302190] (Covidien, Neustadt, 
[LOCATION_013]) at an interval of 48 hours for 2 doses (Hero ld, 2014). At this dose, a significant 
improvement of oxygenation in response to sargramostim inhalation (p=0.0035) , with no drug -
related toxicity , was observed.  Inhaled sargramostim has been evaluated at doses higher than 
125 mcg in patients with autoimm une pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) (Wylam, 2006; 
Tazawa, 2019; Campo, 2016).  Patients with aPAP have extremely high titers of anti -GM-CSF 
antibodies, which sequesters native GM -CSF leading to accumulation of surfactant in alveolar 
sacs with resulta nt hypoxia.  To overcome the high anti -GM-CSF antibody levels in aPAP 
patients, sargramostim has been administered at doses of up to [ADDRESS_369273] been used and associated with an 
improvement in clinical outcome (Wylam, 2006; Tazawa, 2019; Campo, 2016).  Given the 
demonstrated efficacy of 125 and 250 mcg doses, 125 mcg is considered a minimally effective 
dose when treating viral -related diseases.

Number of Patients:  
Approximately 120: of which 80 patients will receive  sargramo stim + SOC, and 40 patients who 
will receive SOC alone . 
Duration of Therapy  
All p atients randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will receive sargramostim for the 
duration of treatment and remain on study for the duration of study period, unless  the p atient 
has unacceptable toxicity to sargramostim or patient/ legally authorized decision 
maker /investigator deci des to discontinue  the patient , or patient has r apid deterioration 
requiring other advanced treatments or m edical care not conducive to continued treatment with 
sargramostim .  Patients will receive sargramostim treatment for up to [ADDRESS_369274] dose of sargramostim  
and/or SOC . 
Following the sargramostim treatment period (Day 1 -5), patients will continue to receive SOC as 
appropriate following institutional guidelines.  The study period (Days 6 -28) will continue until 
completion of all safety and efficacy asses sments on Day 28 (e nd of study).    
Patients on the control arm will receive institutional standard of care alone.  
All patients, including those who discontinue treatment  early, will be followed for the duration 
of the study period.  
Duration of Follow -Up 
All patients should  be followed for safety evaluations for  up to Day 90.  Data from a  final follow -
up visit at day 90  (+/-30 days)  should  also be collected . 
Duration of Study  
Study completion  will be defined as the date when the last patient completes the follow -up 
period , or has withdrawn from the study .  Alternatively, the study may be stopped earlier for 
reasons such as feasibility, poor enrollment, ethical or safety reasons.  
Test Product/Device, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
All patients randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will be treated with 125 mcg 
inhaled sargramostim twice daily (with the interval between doses per institu tional practice  for 
twice a day dosing ) for 5 days delivered via a mesh  nebulizer.  
Patients cannot start the study using intravenous (IV) administration of sargramostim.  If  a 
patient cannot continue to receiv e inhaled  sargramostim  upon progression to an invasive 
mechanical  ventilator, administ ration of sargramostim may be delivered by [CONTACT_302191] a total of 5 days (including days delivered via inhalation).  
Patients on the control arm will receive institutional standard of care alone.  
Study Design:

 17 of 46 3 BACKGROUND  
3.1 Sargramostim  
Sargramostim (Leukine) is a recombinant human granulocyte -macrophage colony stimulating factor 
(rhu -GM-CSF), and has been approved since 1991. GM -CSF, a pleiotropic cytokine, is an important 
leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis, effecting the growth and maturation 
of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional activ ities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell 
mediated immunity.  Since the initial FDA approval in 1991,  patients have been estimated 
to have received Leukine, providing extensive clinical and post -marketing data in a broad range of 
treated individuals across several disease states.  This includes preterm neonates as well as the elderly, 
including males  and females, representing a well -characterized safety profile for Leukine.  
3.[ADDRESS_369280] shown that GM -CSF 
is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from fetal monocytes and the maintenance of 
these cells in adulthood (Dranoff, 2017; Guil liams, 2013). GM -CSF has a wid e array of effects on myeloid 
cells. It has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects not only in 
promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes/ 
macrophages and dendritic  cells, but also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells (Zhan, 
2019). GM -CSF is also known to reverse immunoparalysis seen in sepsis by [CONTACT_302188], resulting 
in beneficial outcomes (Mathias, 2015; Meisel, 2009). Additionally, rese archers have shown that in 
response to lung infection, GM -CSF signals B1a B cells to secrete polyreactive emergency 
immunoglobulin M (IgM) and ensures effective early frontline defense against bacteria invading the 
lungs (Weber, 2014).   In the lung, the al veolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (AEC) -released GM -CSF is known to 
improve the innate immune responses of myeloid cells, in particular the alveolar macrophage ( AM).  It 
has been shown to enhance viral clearance and modulate surfactant lipid metabolism, preventing i ts 
accumulation in the alveoli and maintaining the optimal physiologic gas exchange.  In addition, the AEC -
expressed GM -CSF also has direct beneficial effects on the injured epi[INVESTIGATOR_302161]  (Subramaniam , 2014; Subramaniam , 2015) . 
There is a large body of evidence generated with GM -CSF in animal studies suggesting the potential use 
in ARDS and infections. For the purpose of brevity, we will point to the data that reflects the potential 
value in viral lung infections and preventing secondary bacterial infections.  
Halstead and colleagues demonstrated that in vivo  high airway levels of GM -CSF profoundly rescue mice 
from lethal influenza pneumonia. While in vitro GM-CSF is canonically described as an M1 -polarizing 
cytokine, their data demonstrated that in vivo , during influenza A virus infection, GM -CSF instead 
temporizes the type II interferon -induced M1 polarization of airway macrophages and reduces 
inflammation induced damage (Halstead, 2018).  Unkel and colleagues demonstrated GM -CSF– 
dependent cross -talk between influenza virus infected alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_302162]103+ dendritic cells 
is crucial for effective viral clearance and recovery from injury and thu s pointing to the potential use of 
GM-CSF treatment in severe influenza virus pneumonia (Unkel, 2012). Investigations have shown that 
GM-CSF conferred resistance to influenza in mice via alveolar phagocytes and through alveolar 
macrophages which became mor e resistant to influenza - induced apoptosis. Delivery of intranasal GM -
CSF to wild -type mice also conferred resistance to influenza (Huang, 2011).  
There is evidence that inhaled GM -CSF prevents  systemic  bacteremia in post influenza bacterial 
pneumonia pri marily through locally -mediated improved lung resistance during infection (Umstead,

 18 of 46 2020; Steinwede, 2011) and through increased production of reactive oxygen species by [CONTACT_302192] (Subramanian, 2014).  
In conclusion, GM -CSF confers resistanc e to influenza by [CONTACT_302193], for their health and normal functioning. Pulmonary delivery of this 
cytokine has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality due to viral pneumonia  (Figure 1) . 
 
Figure 1 GM-CSF-modulated immune response to influenza virus infection  (Rosler, 2016) . GM-CSF-modulated immune 
response to influenza virus  infection. After pulmonary influenza virus  infection GM -CSF is released from alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_302163], 
mediated through HGF/c -Met and TGF -α/EGFR signaling. In an autocrine manner, it stimulates epi[INVESTIGATOR_302164], including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_302165]. Innate and adaptive immunity are activated, resulting in accelerated vir al 
clearance. Via PU.1, GM -CSF improves alveolar  macrophage  resistance, maturation, ROS production, and phagocytosis capacity, 
e.g., by [CONTACT_271277] γR-mediated opsonophagocytosis. GM -CSF also stimulates activation and proliferation of dendritic cell s, especially  
CD103+ dendritic cell s, and T cells and enhances antigen  priming and influenza virus -specific CD8+ T cell recruitment. Altogether

3.3 Use of sargramostim  in conditions that are similar to COVID -19 ARDS  
A small (18 patient) double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of low -dose (3 mcg/kg daily 
for 5 day s) intravenous GM -CSF treatment in adult patients with severe sepsis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_302166], led to the conclusion that GM -CSF treatment was associated with improved gas exchange 
and might play a homeostatic role (Rosler, 2016). In a phase II study, 1 30 patients with severe sepsis 
with respi[INVESTIGATOR_302167] -CSF (250 mcg/m2 intravenously daily for 14 days) 
or placebo. The results showed an improvement in 28 day mortality on GM -CSF; this did not reach 
statistical significance (Paine, 2012).  
Herold and colleagues used  sargramostim by [CONTACT_302194] a compassionate basis i n six patients 
with moderate to severe community -acquired pneumonia or ventilator -associated pneumonia -
associated acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS ) who were not improving despi[INVESTIGATOR_302168] 6 days of mechanical ventilation (Herold, 2014). Sargramostim 125 mcg was applied by 
[CONTACT_302195] (Covidien, Neustadt, [LOCATION_013]) at an interval of 48 hours for 2 doses. Compared to 
historical controls, the authors observed significant improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance

 [ADDRESS_369281] scoring systems and 4 of the 
six patients recovered and were discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Six clinical  studies evaluated sargramostim administered via intravenous, subcutaneous, or inhaled 
rout es in critically ill patients and monitored systemic cytokines, markers of inflammation, and safety 
(Meisel, 2009; Hall, 2011; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_78005], 2018; Paine, 2012; Herold, 2014; Rosenbloom, 2005 ).  In these studies, 
there was no increase in systemic cytokines, inclu ding IL -6, IL-8, IL-1β, IL -10, TNFα, GMCSF, and IL -12-
p70, nor an indication of treatment -related organ toxicity or increased rates of treatment -related 
serious adverse events.  Indeed, in the clinical studies where IL -6, a key driver of cytokine storm, wa s 
monitored, no change in the systemic levels were observed.   Importantly, there was no adverse effects 
of sargramostim observed in any of these studies that increased or exacerbated organ toxicity or 
mortality .  In totality, these data suggest that sargramostim does not increase the risk of cytokine storm 
in critically ill patients.  While these studies were of various sizes, improvements in clinical outcomes 
were observed.  
3.4 Recent translational data in COVID -19 
A recent study has shown that the repli cation of SARS -CoV-2 in alveolar cells can result in a limited 
antiviral response, void of IFN -I and IFN -III response in both a human lung alveolar carcinoma cell line 
and in vivo in ferrets  (Blanco -Melo , 2020) .  In addition, by [CONTACT_302196] -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV, it was found that SARS -
CoV-2 was capable of infecting and producing significantly higher amount of virus in human lung tissues 
while triggering suboptimal levels of IFNs  and pro -inflammatory cytokines/chemokines during that same 
time period.  These findings could possibly implicate an escape from innate immune detection  (Chu, 
2020).   An efficient immune suppression in the early phase may allow the SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_369282], achieving high viral load and eventually contributing to its efficient 
person -to-person transmission before onset of severe clinical symptoms  (Wei, 2020).   Evidence of 
additional immune dysfunction comes from the autopsy  reports of COVID -19 patients demonstrating a 
low number of CD8 positive T lymphocytes infiltrating lung tissue  (Yao, 2020).   As described in 
laboratory reports, along with the increased levels of cytokines in systemic circulation, a decrease of 
immune cell populations such as CD4, CD8 and NK cells in peripheral blood were identified as risk factor 
of cytokine storm in COVID -19-infected pneumonia patients  (Chen, 2020 ; Wenjun , 2020; Ruan , 2020) .  
Additionally, the NK cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes appear ed to be exhausted with a reduced ability to 
produce CD107a, IFN -γ, IL-2, granzyme B, and TNF -α (Zheng, 2020) .  The T cells from COVID -[ADDRESS_369283] significantly higher levels of the exhaustion markers PD -1 as compared to the healthy controls  
(Zheng, 2020).   These increases in PD -[ADDRESS_369284] a 
decreased GM -CSF mRNA and protein expression suggesting that the SARS -CoV may play a role in the 
mechanism of lung fibrosis of SARS through the suppression of GM -CSF (Liao, 2011). 
If there is viral immune evasion, the host may be predisposed towards a more belligerent wave of 
cytokine and chemokine activity with marked inflammatory responses as the viral load increases.  
Profound lung damage due to unchecked viral replication can ca use a complete breakdown of epi[INVESTIGATOR_302169].  There is 
leakage of hallmark inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6 and IL -1 into systemic circulation and a 
concurrent recr uitment of neutrophils and pro -inflammatory monocytes into the lung.  This ensuing 
‘cytokine storm’, with incessant proinflammatory cytokine production and accumulation of pro -
inflammatory cells can eventually overwhelm the homeostatic tissue repair functi ons in the lung leading 
to irreversible tissue damage and depletion of AMs  (Herold, 2011 ; Wong , 2019) .  During this process the

 20 of 46 activated fibroblasts can deposit excess collagen to impair gas exchange in the lung  (Meduri, 1993 ).  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_302170]  (Plotkowski , 1986).  AMs are the sentinels of innate 
immune system against the respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531].  They do so via secretion of oxygen me tabolites, anti -
microbial proteases and by [CONTACT_302197]. They can also aid in resolving inflammation after the infectious challenge gets 
resolved , by [CONTACT_302198].  This can reduce the pro -inflammatory cytokine 
secretion by [CONTACT_302199] -inflammatory cytokines such as TGF - and IL -10 
(Haslett , 1999; Knapp , 2003).   Therefore, the loss of AMs could be one of the likely contributors of failed 
lung functions in COVID -[ADDRESS_369285] in the severely infected lungs in these patients  (Liao, 2020).  
Viral, bacterial, and fungal pulmonary infections can all cause the cytokine storm syndrome that may be 
challenging to differentiate on clinical grounds. A complex cyt okine response that builds in infection is 
characterized by [CONTACT_302200][INVESTIGATOR_302171], such that it is important to highlight them. A more 
aggressive for m, labeled cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome 
characterized by [CONTACT_302201] 
(CAR) -T cell therapy, therapeutic antibodies, and haploidentical a llogeneic transplantation. Levels of 
inflammatory markers and cytokines may differ dramatically between this and other manifestations of 
cytokine storms  (Vardhana , 2020) . The hyperinflammatory response in COVID -19 has been likened to 
conditions including classical ARDS, macrophage activation syndrome or hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, or simply “cytokine storm.” It is likely that none of these syndromes can precisely 
fit all COVID -19 patients due to the complexity and heterogeneity in inflammatory effe cts and diverse 
pathophysiology of the disease seen across different patients , however , several biomarkers (ferritin, C -
reactive protein  (CRP)  and d -dimers) have shown a strong correlation of worsening disease or mortality  
(Chen 2020a; Chen,  2020 b; Richardson , 2020 ). 
3.5 Clinical experience of inhaled sargramostim  
There is a large body of evidence of inhaled sargramostim in autoimmune pulmonary alveolar 
proteinosis (aPAP), which results in accumulation of surfactant in alveolar sacs with resultant hypox ia. 
Tazawa and colleagues conducted a phase II study of inhaled sargramostim at 9 pulmonary centers 
throughout Japan in patients with unremitting or progressive aPAP with hypoxia and symptoms 
(Tazawa, 2010). Patients received 250 mcg daily by [CONTACT_12699], u sing an LC -PLUS nebulizer with a manual 
interrupter valve connected to a PARI Turbo BOY compressor, for 7 days and this cycle was repeated 
every other week for six cycles (total 12 weeks). The treatment was well tolerated with no serious 
adverse events. Ad verse events were reported in 7 of the 39 patients receiving GM -CSF, and these were 
all transient. The treatment led to an improvement in oxygenation, radiological changes as well as 
symptoms.  Thirty five of these patients were followed for a 30 -month obs ervation period and  
sargramostim was shown to sustain remission in over half of the patients  (Tazawa, 2014).  A study using 
the I -neb nebulizer, conducted in 6 aPAP patients evaluated inhaled sargramostim 250 mcg once daily in 
a 4 days on, 4 days off sched ule as long as needed (Papi[INVESTIGATOR_56989], 2014).  Upon remission, the dose of 
sargramostim  was reduced.  All patients achieve d remission and 3 patients maintained remission when 
the dose was reduced; no significant adverse events were noted (Papi[INVESTIGATOR_56989], 2014).  
Followin g these results , a larger randomized phase 3 study (also referred to as the PAGE study) was 
conducted by [CONTACT_302202] 12 centers. Sixty -four  patients with mild to moderate aPAP 
with hypoxia were randomized to receive placebo or  sargramosti m (33 patients) at a dose of 125 mcg 
PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 21 of 46 twice a day for 7 days  followed by a week of no treatment and this two week cycle was repeated 12 
times over a period of 24 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with no significant differences in 
adverse events betwe en the two groups. The GM -CSF treated patients had a significantly improved 
hypoxia parameter as were the radiological changes (Tazawa, 2019).  
This clinical experience of use of sargramostim in viral pneumonia and aPAP suggests salutary effects. In 
additio n, these studies establish the safety of inhaled sargramostim and also provide evidence for 
activity of inhaled sargramostim.  
3.6 Use of sargramostim inhalation in COVID -19  
An investigator -sponsor ed study  in Belgium [ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], “ Prospective, Randomized, Op en-label, 
Interventional Study to Investigate the Efficacy of  Sargramostim  (Leukine®) in Improving Oxygenation 
and Short - and Long -term Outcome of  COVID -19 (Corona Virus Disease) Patients With Acute Hypoxic 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064] ”, was initiated on March 26, 2020 . Patients were randomized  to receive either 
inhaled  sargramostim  125 mcg twice daily via a  Philips© InnoSpi[INVESTIGATOR_302172] 5 days 
(active group)  together  with institutional standard of care  (SOC), or SOC alone (control group).  SOC 
included:  administration  of antibiotics, anti -viral therapy,  and use of  supplemental oxygen  and 
noninvasive  or invasive ventilation  (as necessary).  A data  safety monitoring board (DSMB) is overseeing 
the study.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Based on the scientific rationale that GM -CSF is critical to maintain and restore lung function as well as 
the totali ty of clinical data in critically ill patients as well as patients with COVID -19, this study will 
evaluate whether inhaled sargramostim can improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute 
hypoxemia due to COVID -19.  As discussed above in Section 3.4, the biomarkers ferritin, CRP and d -
dimers are correlated with worsening of disease and high mortality  in patients with COVID -19.  To 
enable constant safety monitoring du ring the study , daily monitoring of these biomarkers during the 
sargramostim treatment period  is required and will be  evaluated (alongside adverse events and other 
routine laboratory  tests)  by [CONTACT_16627]  (see Section 12.2  for more details) .  After 
the first 9 and 22  patients were enrolled and treated with up to 5 days of sargramostim, the DMSB 
reviewed safety data . Following its second review, the  DSMB supported a) expanding the study to 120 
patients and b) excluding patients with serious baseline pulmonary comorbid  conditions.

9 RISKS AND TOXICITIES  
9.1 Overdose  
There is no clinical experience with overdose of sargramostim, and no specific antidote or detoxification 
measures can be recommended to date. If accidental overdose is suspected, the patient should be 
treated symptomatically.  
9.2 Preg nancy  or Lactation  
There are limited data in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  There is p otential for increased risk of 
spontaneous abortion based on rabbit studies.  Investigators should counsel patients of the risk to the 
fetus. Do NOT use diluents with pres ervatives.  
Note  - this information is based on systemic administration  of sargramostim .  There are no data 
available for inh aled sargramostim .

Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 33 of 46 - Occurrence of a treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 adverse event  (see Section 8.2.2 for treatment 
attribution)  
- Rapid deterioration requiring other advanced treatments or medical care not conducive to 
continued treatment wit h sargramostim  
- Death  
Patients who discontinue treatment earl y, should remain on study and continue follow -up per the 
schedule of events  (unless consent is withdrawn  from study participation ). 
11.[ADDRESS_369304] patient complete s study treatment (including 
SOC), completes the follow -up period , or has withdrawn from the study .  Alternatively, the study may be 
stopped earlier  for reasons such as feasibility, poor enrollment , ethical or safety reasons.  
Refer to Table 1, for a complete list of assessments required through the clinical trial.  
11.3 Duration of Treatment  (Days 1 -5) 
All p atients  randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will receive sargramostim treatment for up 
to [ADDRESS_369305] dose of 
sargramostim  and/or SOC .  All patients will receive SOC per their institutional standards ; SOC may vary 
in duration . 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment 
should be discontinued. This includes any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality  or intercurrent 
illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued treatment with study therapy is 
not in the best interest of the patient . 
11.4 Duration of Study  Period  (Days 6 -28) 
Following the sargramostim treatment period  (Day s 1-5), patients should  continue to receive SOC as 
appropriate following institutional guidelines . The study period (Days 6 -28) will continue until 
completion of all safety and e fficacy asses sments on Day 28  (end of study) . 
All patients, including those who discontinue treatment  early, should  be followed  for the duration of the 
study period . 
11.5 Duration of Follow -up (up to Day 9 0) 
All p atients , including those that have withdrawn from the study or discontinued sargramostim,  shoul d 
be followed  for safety  evaluations for up to Day 90. Data from a  final follow -up visit at day 90  (+/-30 
days)  should  also be collected . 
Only patients that have withdrawn their consent to partic ipate in the trial  are excluded from further 
follow -up after their consent has been withdrawn.  Any available  data up to the date of withdrawal of 
consent will be used  for the purpose of this study.  
12 STATISTICAL PLAN  
12.1 Sample size consideration  
Approximately 120 patients will be randomized: of which 80 will recei ve sargramostim + SOC, and 40 
patients who will receive SOC alone to evaluat e the clinical efficacy  and safety  of sargramostim in 
patients  with COVID -19 associated acute hypoxemi a.   
PTX-001-002 P ROTOCOL  | Partner Therapeutics, Inc.

 [ADDRESS_369306]  
The DSMB  will compris e of independent  external experts  to review  the safety and benefit/risk data  
using the following  guidelines : 
• after the first approximately 10 patients are treated for 5 days with sargramostim ; enrollment 
will be paused after t he 10th patient is enrolled until the safety review is completed   
• after the first approximately 20 patients are treated for 5 days with sargramostim ; enrollment 
will be paused after the 20th patient is enrolled until  the safety review  is completed  
• after approximately 60 patients (total of both treatment arms) are enrolled to the study . Upon 
completion of this safety review , the DSMB may request an additional review after 
approximately [ADDRESS_369307] been randomized. Enrollment will not be paused d uring these 
reviews.   
• any reported significant SAE can also trigger a safety review , including , but not limited to  ≥2 
patients experiencing a similar SAE or grade ≥3 AE, ≥2 patients discontinue for similar safety 
reasons ; an unplanned safety review  may require an enrollment pause  
The safety review will occur as a real -time review  of patient  data , using the data available  as well as a 
cumulative safety review  as the data accrues . That is, the available data will be accepted as is, and may  
not have gone through any data cleaning processes.   The DSMB will review  adverse events and serious 
adverse events, key laboratory parameters such as ferritin , d-dimers,  and CRP , and other routine 
laboratory value s (hematology, chemistry, coagulation)  as well as oxygenation parameter P(A -a)O 2 
gradient .  
The DSMB will make recommendations on pausing enrollment, modifying and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] , 
including assessing whether randomization should continue, or whether additional changes to the 
treatment arms is warranted .   
The DSMB  can also modify the planned schedule of safety revie ws based on the observed data, taking 
into account the study enrollment patterns, observed safety profile of the ongoing study, and/or any 
other external data that may emerge.   
Refer to the Data Safety Monitoring Board  Charter  for addi tional  details . 
12.[ADDRESS_369308] one dose of sargramostim and/or SOC  will be included in the efficacy 
and safety analyses.  An additional analyses will b e performed on the intent -to-treat population defined 
as all randomized patients.  
A per protocol population will be defined as all patients who receive  sargramostim and/ or standard of 
care and  meet the eligibility criteria of this study.  Violations of the  eligibility criteria have the potential 
to influence the efficacy or safety results of the study  (see Section 6 for eligibility criteria) . 
All analyses will be cons idered as descriptive analyses.  Derivation of two -sided 95% confidence intervals 
and p -values will be generated where applicable.  
Time to event endpoints will be defined as the start date/time to the end date/time; censoring dates will 
be the last date/ti me the patient was determined to be event -free.  Kaplan Meier methods  will be used 
for time to event endpoint analyses ; a logrank test will be performed to compare the two survival

Property of Partner Therapeutics - strictly confidential  
 [ADDRESS_369309] ratio.  
Categorical endpoints will be calculated as the percentage of  patients with the event, relative to the 
number of patients treated.   Logistic regression approaches and/or repeated measures statistical 
approaches may be used to compare patients on the sargramostim  and control arms , in addition to 
Fisher’s Exact or Chi2 tests (as appropriate) . 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized by n, means, medians, minimum, maximum, and 25th and 75th 
percentiles.   Analysis of variance , analysis of covariance , and/or repeated measures  statistical  
approaches may be used to compare patients on the sargramostim and control arms . 
In the event  that the underlying assumptions and/or distribution s for a given statistical method are not 
satis fied, alternative statistical methods will be employed.    
Missing data may be imputed using last-observation -carried forward, or other advanced statistical 
imputation methods.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be performed to evaluate the robustness  and sensitivity  of the 
study results, including but not limited to the analysis  population s, subgroup analyses, treatment 
interactions, adjusted or stratified analyses,  and/or alternative statistical methods.  
A statistical analys is plan will contain further details of the planned statistical analyses.  Any important 
changes to the planned statistical analyses will be document ed as amendments to the statistical analys is 
plan  and/or documented in the study report .  
12.3.1  Primary Endpoint(s): Oxygenation at Day 6, and Intubation  by [CONTACT_2006] 14  
The primary endpoint of change in oxygenation parameter of P(A-a)O [ADDRESS_369310] include Day 6 (primary 
measure) and Day 14 (secondary measure) .   
Another key primary endpoint will be the  rate of intubation by [CONTACT_2006] 14.  That is, an y occurrence of 
intubation  at any point time in time between Days 1 and 14, will be considered to be an event.   The 
treatment arms will be compared using a  Fisher’s Exact or Chi2 tests (as appropriate) , and/or by [CONTACT_302208].   
Handling of missing data is specified above in Section 12.[ADDRESS_369311] for 
endpoints include Day 6 , Day 14 , and Day 28 , where data are available .  Assessments of ventilator usa ge 
will consider alternative devices, in light of possible ventilator shortages.  Refer to FDA Guidance for

Methodology:  This is a Phase 2, open label study (Study number VP -102-105; referred to as COVE -
1 [Cantharidin and Occlusion in Verruca Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] ]) to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability 
of VP -[ADDRESS_66206] C ohort ( Cohort 1) utilize s a treatment interv al of at least 14 days between treatments  with 
longer treatment intervals being allowed depending on a specific patient ’s clinical response.   No 
paring of lesions is allowed. Twenty  Subjects (2 years and older) are  targeted completing EOS visit 
in Cohort 1.    
The second C ohort ( Cohort 2) utiliz es a treatment interval of 21 days between treatments.   Paring of 
lesions is allowed. Approximately 35 subjects (12 years and older) will be enrolled in Cohort 2.  Up 
to 4 sites  will participate in the study.  
All subjects will receive S tudy drug containing 0.7% cantharidin topi[INVESTIGATOR_61340].  To 
assess eligibility, a d ermatologic exam, wart counts (Cohort 1 only) , and measurement of diameter 
and height of each wart will be conducted by a qualified member of the research t eam prior to the 
first treatment.   For Cohort 2, wart counts will be carried out programmatically and research team 
does not need to count manually . Additional Treatment visits will include measurement of diameter 
and an evaluation of response to treatment  (ERT) , prior to treatment application when applicable. 
For those visits where subjects have received treatment, additional ERT assessments will be 
conducted over the phone at 24 hours and 7 days after treatment.  ( Specific instructions on how to 
conduct the wart count  (Cohort 1)  and measure wa rt diameter and height are provided in the study 
specific Manual of Operations (MOP).  Instructions for application of the Study drug are outlined in 
the Instructions for Use (IFU) included in the drug shipment as well as in the Investigator’s 
Brochure) . 
Treatment will be applied up to four times during a 63- day treatment period  for C ohort  [ADDRESS_66207]’s 
clinical response and will be at least 14 days. The treatmen t interval in C ohort 2 is 21 days. It can 
sometimes be challenging to determine if a wart is completely clear after treatment due to ongoing 
local skin reactions.  At any visit where the investigator is unable to evaluate or treat some warts due

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  6 to ongoing  local skin reactions, an “Unscheduled” visit should be documented  for both Cohort [ADDRESS_66208] with the patient until L SRs are reso lved and T reatment  Visit 
can be  scheduled within  14 days for Coh ort 1 and 21 da ys (+/- 4) for Cohort [ADDRESS_66209] at a visit  when all warts are evaluable (i.e., not obscured by [CONTACT_61399]) and all 
warts that are not completely clear , should undergo treatment with Study drug. No partial treatment 
of warts is permitted.  
 
For Cohort 2, Study drug is to be applied to the wart site on any  Treatment Visit wh ere a new clinical 
assessment of  complete  clear ance is made for that wart (e.g., if a  patient returns for Treatment V isit [ADDRESS_66210] no visible evidence of remaining wart , then S tudy drug is to be 
applied to this wart site  at Treatment Visit 2 . However, if the patient remains completely clear at that 
wart site when returning for Treatment V isit 3, then no Study drug would be applied at Treatment 
Visit 3.)  
In instances where the clinician can adequately  assess the treatment sites but is uncertain if residual 
wart is remaining, treatment should be applied, and the subject should return for evaluation per 
protocol.  Treatment visits are to take place in order (e.g., Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3 and 
Treatment 4).  S ubjects  that receive fewer than 4 treatments within the 63 -day ( Cohort 1) or 75- day 
(Cohort 2) treatment period, due to the duration of post -treatment local skin reactions , will not be 
considered a protocol deviation. No treatment should be administered after the 63- day treatment 
period in C ohort 1 or the 75- day treatment period in C ohort 2 without Sponsor ’s approval.   S ubjects  
in Cohort [ADDRESS_66211] will be scheduled for a Treatment V isit per protocol. 
(Consider calling the subject a few days prior to the 2- week interval (e.g.,11 or 12 days) to ensure 
adequate time for scheduling assessment and t reatment if needed) . 
Subjects participating in Cohort 2, will be required to attend all visits regardless of whether they 
have achieved complete clearance of all warts at a previous visit.  At these visits, S tudy drug 
application is not required if the  warts have been clear for at least one follow up visit  and the 
investigator determines that additional treatment is not needed . Subjects participating in C ohort 2, 
that have completed their Day 84 EOT V isit (- 0/+ 8 da ys), will be assessed at 3 additional fol low-up 
visits conducted at Day 105, Day  126 and Day 147.  
All subjects will receive application of the Study drug (VP -102) to common warts including a 1- [ADDRESS_66212] 14 days  in C ohort 1, and every 
21 days  in C ohort 2, until complete clearance of all treatable warts, or a maximum of 4 applications. 
Warts are to be treated and then occluded with transparent surgical tape ( e.g.; 3M™ Blenderm™ 
brand) that will remain on overnight and removed just prior to the 24 -hour ERT phone call.  Subjects  
in Cohort 2 will undergo wart  paring with a sharp surgical instrument (e.g., scalpel or flexible 
medical blade)  to remove any adherent thick scale from a wart prior to application of S tudy drug.  
Wart paring is to be performed  at any Treatment V isit when adherent thick  scale is present,  and the 
investigator considers that  it can be safely applied .  Paring should be conducted by a trained 
practitioner and in compliance with any  local regulations  and should be discontinu ed when it results 
in puncta te bleeding or significant pain . Not all warts may require paring and if adherent scale is not 
present, then  Study drug can be applied without paring. Subjects should be re -treated only after 14 -

after any LSR has resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site.  .  Subjects t hat 
achieve complete clearance of all treatable warts prior to the EOS visit, return to the clinic for a  
EOS /EOT  visit at Day [ADDRESS_66214] achieved complete cl earance prior to  the Day 84 ( - 0/+ 8 days)  assessment .  Phone 
calls will be conducted at an interval of 24 hours and 7 days after each Treatment Visit (not 
“Unscheduled” visits) to assess if there have been any adverse events or if new warts have occurred.  
Phone calls conducted outside of the required 24- hour and 7- day study ERT assessments should be 
documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be entered into the electronic data 
capture ( EDC ). All required study activities, including ERT  evaluations, will be conducted per 
protocol.  If new warts are identified during the course of the treatment period, they should be 
documented, evaluated and treated per protocol.  
Subjects will be given take home instructions describing what they might ex pect throughout the 
course of the study, as well as recommendations for wound care, when it is important to call their 
doctor, and instructions for who to contact [CONTACT_61400].  In addition, a local skin reaction guide 
will be provided and reviewed in d etail at the clinic with the subject/guardian and used for reference 
by [CONTACT_423]/guardian during assessments conducted via phone call.  An in- person ERT will also be 
conducted at every visit prior to Study drug application.  The ERT includes questions r elated to 
removal of the occlusive tape and Study drug, if applicable, and records the intensity of any local 
skin reactions, including adverse events, and concomitant medications (ConMeds).  The subject 
and/or guardian will have time to ask questions and  review any concerns.  In the event any adverse 
events present a safety concern, an “Unscheduled” clinic visit will be made, and the subject assessed 
accordingly.  All subjects  in Cohort 1, will participate in an in -person EOS evaluation that will take 
place at Day 84.  A Provider End of Study Treatment Questionnaire will be completed at the EOS.  
Subjects  in Cohort 2 will participate in an in -person EOT evaluation at Day 84 ( - 0/+ 8 days) .  A 
provider End of Study Treatment Questionnaire will be completed at the EOT Visit.  Cohort 2 
subjects will continue in the study for 3 additional follow -up assessments at Day 105, Day 126 and 
Day 147.  The follow -up visit window is +/ - [ADDRESS_66215] ( HIPAA)  compliant manner.  Effort will be made to ensure that no  photos with 
identifiable features are obtained.

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  13 After each treatment:   Process for removal: At 24 hours (+/ -8 hr) after drug application, subjects 
are instructed to wet the treated area with warm water and then carefully and slowly rem ove the 
occlusive tape from each wart, pulling the tape back over itself in a low and slow manner, trying not 
to unroof any intact blisters. Treated warts should be gently washed with soap and warm water after 
the tape is removed.  
Note: The occlusive tape and Study drug may be gently removed from individual warts prior to [ADDRESS_66229] passed from study drug applicat ion. 
The occlusive tape and Study drug should not be removed from any remaining unproblematic warts 
until the 24- hour (+/- 8hrs) time point is reached. Washing of intact blisters should be gentle and 
without use of a washcloth.  Washing and removal of occl usive tape in a bath or shower is 
encouraged.  Photos should be taken by [CONTACT_61408].  
Criteria for evaluation  
Efficacy:  All enrolled subjects (Intent -To-Treat) who receive at  least one treatment application will 
be evaluated for efficacy.  Clinical response to treatment of warts will be evaluated at each scheduled 
in-person visit until EOS by [CONTACT_61409].  The Day 84 EOS Visit will require a final 
assessment o f ERT (for Cohort 1) and confirmation of the presence or absence of treated and 
untreated warts as well as the final size and diameter for any that are remaining.  Subjects in Cohort 2 
will participate in an in -person EOT evaluation at Day 84 ( - 0/+ 8 days ).  A provider EOT 
Questionnaire will be completed at the EOT Visit.  Cohort 2 subjects will continue in the study for 3 
additional follow -up assessments on Day 105, Day 126 and Day 147.

Safety: All subjects who meet the screening eligibility criteria for the study and receive at least one 
application of Study drug will be evaluated for safety.  The following safety parameters will be 
assessed:  
 
• Incidence of adverse events (AEs) throughout the study:  
  
   VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol –  VP-102-105                                                                                                          Version No:  3  
 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  15 − A subject -by-subject AEs data listing, including verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, 
severity, location and causal relationship to the Study drug, will be provided.  
− The number of subjects experienci ng treatment emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and 
number of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_61410].  
− AEs will include all local skin reactions whether or not they are expected or related to Study 
drug mechanism of action.  
 
• Local Skin Re actions (LSRs) of all previously treated areas will be assessed at each Treatment 
visit using the protocol specific ERT form.  
− Subjects will have reviewed and be given take home instructions on removal of the occlusive 
tape and also descriptions of the pot ential local skin reactions they might expect throughout 
the course of the study. Recommendations for wound care, when it is important to call their 
doctor, and instructions for whom to contact [CONTACT_61411].  
− ERT assessments will be con ducted at each Treatment Visit [ADDRESS_66230] reports recurrence or new warts that require an in -person 
assessment and treatment. Cohort 2 subjects will be required to return for e ach Treatment 
Visit until EOT as well as Follow -up V isits on Day 105, 126 and 147.  
 
− A Local Skin Reaction Guide for subjects with specific photos identifying the various skin 
reactions and examples of intensity will be reviewed at the clinic with the subje ct/guardian 
by [CONTACT_5051].  This guide will be utilized for discussion during the ERT phone 
assessments with the research team member.  Should a subject report experiencing excessive 
blistering , ulceration, edema, pain or another adverse event needi ng physician assessment, 
they will be scheduled for an “Unscheduled” study visit and safety evaluation as soon as 
possible.  
 
• Medical history, vital signs, and physical examinations:  
− Medical history, wart history, Fitzpatrick Skin Type and limited physical exams will be 
collected for each subject. A limited physical examination will be completed before the first 
treatment and at the EOS visit.  Vital signs (temperature and heart rate) will be obtained 
before the treatment is applied at each visit and at the start of the Day 84 (EOS) visit.  
Additional physical examinations will be performed when clinically warranted (e.g., subject 
reports symptoms classified as an AE requiring further evaluation).  
Safety considerations:  Investigators should confirm the Study drug is completely dry (2 -5 minutes) 
prior to applying the occlusive tape or the subject coming into contact [CONTACT_61412], clothing or 
other surface areas.  When warts on the fingers are treated, the occlusive tape may be wrapped 
loosely around the finger.  In addition, an adhesive bandage may be applied over the occlusive tape 
to keep it in place on areas that experience significant flexing such as finger joints or fingertips. VP -
102 is considered highly flammable, even after drying.  Subjects should a void fire, flame or smoking 
during treatment.  
  
   VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol –  VP-102-105                                                                                                          Version No:  3  
 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  16  Cantharidin has been shown to be safe for topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785], but it is highly toxic if ingested.  To deter 
potential oral ingestion, a bitter compound has been added to the Study drug.  Subjects should refrain 
from t ouching, licking, or biting treated skin or putting treated skin in or near any mucosal surface 
including the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and anogenital area for 24 hours after treatment or until the Study 
drug is removed.  
 
Subjects are encouraged to wash thei r hands regularly with soap and water (being mindful to keep 
treated areas on the hands dry) and discouraged from scratching or pi[INVESTIGATOR_61344], which can 
spread disease.  
Statistical methods: The main objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of VP -102 treatment in subjects with common warts. The primary efficacy endpoint of 
this study is the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance of all treatable warts on the 
Day 84 EOS/EOT visit. Safety endpoints incl ude incidence of adverse events, local skin reactions, 
physical examinations and concomitant medications.  
 
This is an open- label study where all subjects are to receive the Study drug. The study will enroll to  
treat a minimum of 20 subjects, 2 years of age  and older, presenting with 1- 6 common warts with the 
goal of approximately 20 subjects completing all study activities in Cohort 1 per protocol.  Cohort 2 
will utilize up to 4 sites to enroll approximately 35 subjects (12 years and older). Although no for mal 
power calculations have been performed, it is expected that a sample size of 20 subjects (Cohort 1) 
and 35 subjects ( Cohort 2) evaluable at the EOS /EOT  visit (Day 84 for both C ohorts) will be 
informative regarding wart  clearance rates that can support assumptions in subsequent placebo-
controlled trials.  A sample size of [ADDRESS_66231] patient has completed the v isit on  Day 147.  
 
Subjects who receive all planned tr eatments of VP -102 (e.g., up to four treatments within the 63 day 
treatment window, or cleared of all treatable warts prior to Day 63 in Cohort 1; and in Cohort 2 
complete up to four treatments within the Day 75 treatment window or clear prior to Day 75) a nd 
have no major protocol violations are assessed for clearance at the EOS visit and included in the Per 
Protocol population.   
 
Subject demographics, efficacy tables and subject dropout rates will be tabulated at the end of the 
study. Data will be summari zed using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for 
discrete variables.  Corresponding by -subject data listings will be tabulated.  
 
Adverse events,  including local skin reactions, will be coded with the MedDRA® dictionary.  The 
number and percentage of subjects having treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_61413] a breakdown by [CONTACT_1570].

a. Screening can occur up to 14 days prior to Study drug application on Day 1. Screening can occur on the same day as Treatment Visit 1/Study drug application. If treatment is not applied on the 
 same day as Screening, wart count  wart count,  measurement, location of all warts and dermatologic exam must be repeated prior to Study drug application. An IRB -approved ICF/Assent must be 
 signed before any study specific procedures are performed.  
b.  Subjects are to be scheduled in [ADDRESS_66232] treatment or study visit , but only after any LSR has resolved 
 sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site . Treatment should be administered within 4 days o f becoming eligible due to resolution of LSRs.  The EOS (Day 84) visit is targeted [ADDRESS_66233] may be conducted at +/ - [ADDRESS_66234] may be 
 conducted +/ - [ADDRESS_66235] reports recurrence or new warts that require assessment and treatment per protocol.  
c.    A final in person safety assessment, ERT, wart count, photos and study completion form will be completed at the Day 84 (EOS) visit for all subjects. EOS conducted outside the Day 84 EOS visit 
 window will be considered a protocol deviation. Treatments may be administered up to Day 63. Subjects that clear or complete treatment prior to EOS will be followed per protocol until the 
 sched uled  EOS visit but do not need to complete any remaining Treatment Visits and can receive follow up via telephone until the requir ed in -person EOS visit.  
d. Demographics: date of birth, sex, race/ethnicity will be collected.  
e. Vital signs (e.g., temperat ure & heart rate) will be obtained at each treatment prior to application of Study drug. Height and weight will be collected at Screening/Day 1 and EOS.  
f. Limited physical examination.  Symptom or AE -directed physical examination may be performed if warr anted. (See Source/eCRF for a more detailed description)   
g. Dermatologic exam including Fitzpatrick Skin Type, wart count, wart counts (head/neck, chest/abdomen, back/buttocks, groin, upper/lower extremities, including fingers, hands and arms) shou ld 
 be performed identifying the location of each wart and documented on the body map and source as outlined in the MOP. Measurement s of warts  should be recorded on Day 1 prior to treatment to 
 confirm they meet inclusion criteria of < 10 mm in diameter and ≤3 m m in height. Wart counts and Wart counts, and assessments are to be completed prior to each  treatment application  and/or 
 each in -person visit. New warts should be recorded in the corresponding Source/eCRF. Instructions for measuring wart counts and docu menting the wart count and measurements are provided in 
 the Manual of Operations (MOP) . 
h. “Unscheduled” visits may be completed when clinically warranted. (e.g. if a subject reports signs or symptoms classified as a treatment emergent AE and requires fur ther evaluation) 
 “Unscheduled” visits should also be used for visits where treatment is unable to be applied to all warts due to ongoing LSRs.  
i. To be performed prior to Study drug application and at EOS in any females of childbearing potential (females that are capable of menstruating). 
j.     Subjects that agree to participate in the photographic portion of the study will have photos of warts taken prior to each tre atment by [CONTACT_3476]. If there are no warts remaining, the same areas 
 will be photog raphed and repeated at the EOS regardless of whether warts are present.  Subjects will also be asked to take photos after eac h treatment at home every 24 hours for 5 days with their 
 phone and either send photos via text or email to the research team or br ing them for upload and storage at the next in -person study visit. These images may be used on handouts in future trials, for 
 training purposes or future marketing materials.   (Photographs will be de -identified to those outside the research team and stor ed in a HIPAA compliant manner. Effort will be made to ensure that 
 no photos with identifiable features are obtained).  
k.  Occlusive tape and Study drug may be gently removed from individual warts prior to 24 hours of application in the event of si gnifica nt blistering, significant pain or treatment emergent AEs. The 
 occlusive tape and Study drug should not be removed from the remaining unproblematic warts until the 24 -hour time point is reached. Removal of the occlusive tape should be aided by [CONTACT_61414]. This will also help to prevent unroofing the blisters.  Subjects that remove Study drug prior to 24 hours will be considered a protocol deviation if it does not meet the requirement s for 
 early removal as outlined in Section 9.2.2  of the protocol. Early removal is defined by [CONTACT_61415] < 16 hours after treatment is applied.

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  28 2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Verru ca Vulgaris (common warts)  
Cutaneous viral warts (Verruca vulgaris) are caused by [CONTACT_61421][INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) 
and are a common problem with an estimated lifetime incidence of 79% ( 1). There are over 
100 known serotypes of HPV in humans alone, with a growing number discovered each year. 
The majority of cutaneous warts are caused by [CONTACT_61422] 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 ( 2). HPV is 
a DNA virus, which infects epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Viral replication only takes place in fully 
differentiated epi[INVESTIGATOR_61348] a clini cally evident 
hyper keratotic  papule or plaque.  
The clinical appearance of warts is variable and depends to some extent on the serotype of 
HPV involved and the anatomical site. HPV has a histone -coiled, double -stranded DNA 
genome of approximately 8,000 base pairs. This genetic material is surrounded by a 60 -
nanometer capsid composed of two interlocking proteins (L1 & L2), but no envelope ( 3).  
This lack of an envelope gives the virus significant stability in the environment, allowing it to 
remain a viable infectious agent for weeks, or even months before coming in contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
suitable host ( 4). Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_61349], and differ ent types of HPV tend to 
favor particular anatomical sites, but the most common infections are with HPV type [ADDRESS_66248] immunity, HPV type, 
and site o f infection. Although usually benign, w arts are an infectious disease of the skin  that 
should be treated to prevent transmission of the virus from person to person or 
autoinoculation to multiple sites on the same individual. In addition, verrucae can cause pain 
or discomfort, interfering with work or daily activities ( 5). Warts are frequently considered 
cosmetically unsightl y, and unacceptable to the subject, particularly if they occur on visually 
prominent areas like the face, neck, arms or hands. Importantly, the possibility of squamous 
cell carcinoma of the skin is believed to be enhanced by [CONTACT_61423], especially  on 
skin damaged by [CONTACT_61424]. This effect has been well documented in 
individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_61350], immunosuppressed individuals, and 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; however, it is also suspected to play a role in some cases of squa mous 
cell carcinoma in immunocompetent individuals ( 6-8).   
There are a wide variety of different treatments for warts, but most are of limited 
effectiveness. Ablative and surgical treatments are among the most commonly used, with 
their mode of action being the destruction of the wart through physical means (e.g., 
cryotherapy, electrodessication with or without curettage, lasers, infrared photocoagulation); 
surgical modalities (e.g., blunt dissection, excision); and organic acids/keratolytics (e.g., 
salicylic acid, bi-  or trichloroacetic acid, urea).  
Other published modalities attempt to modify the way the skin and immune system interact 
with the infection, such as immunomodulators (e.g., imiquimod, intralesional interferon,

diphenylcyclopropanone, Candida extract, squaric acid dibutylester). Some therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61351], like cytotoxins (e.g., bleomycin, 5-
fluorouracil, podophyllotoxin, aminolevulenic acid) and vesicants (e.g., cantharidin). Some 
studies have suggested the   use of simple occlu sion with impermeable tape, although the 
efficacy of this has  recently been shown to be lacking ( 9). The large number of treatment 
options reflects the lack of consensus among experts on what the best treatment for common 
warts is, despi[INVESTIGATOR_61352]. Expert reviews fail to find that any one treatment is considerably better than the 
others ( 2, 10) , and most authors agree that adequate clinical  studies are lacking for many of 
the treatments, including those considered first line ( 9, 11)  and newer modalities that are 
being used in an “off -labeled” approach to treatment ( 12).  
The two most commonly used treatments for cutaneous warts are salicylic acid and 
aggressive cryotherapy. A Cochrane meta- analysis of [ADDRESS_66249] a cure rate of 
57% vs 37% with placebo (p<0.001).  For cryotherapy, a meta -analysis of 3 randomized 
clinical trials involving a total of 227 patients showed a cure rate of 38% vs 22% with 
placebo (p=NS) ( 9). Salicylic acid therapy, while effective, requires daily compliance and 
can cause a painful burning sensation. Cryotherapy has limited efficacy and is very painful, 
so much so that most physicians do not treat children with cryotherapy if they have other 
options. Both of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61353] -term scars. Unfortunately, in 
many cases patients are dissatisfied with their outcomes, with some studies show ing this to 
be the case up to 91% of the time ( 13). This is cause for concern, as the common wart is 
ranked among the most frequent reasons that individuals seek evaluation in a dermatology 
practice (14) and can represent a significant cost to the patient and insurer (1). 
2.2 Cantharidin  
Cantharidin (1,2- dimethyl- 3,6-epoxyperhydrophthalic anhydride) is a lipophilic natural 
compound that can be isolated from the body fluids of the blister beetle, primarily of the 
family Meloidae.  Blister beetles are found in many parts of the world, including the southern 
[LOCATION_002] and Asia ( Mylabris Cichorii L  and Mylabris phalerata).  Ly tta vesicatoria , a 
metallic green beetle, was primarily used as a source of cantharidin in the early 1900s, as it is 
endemic to the [LOCATION_002].  Regardless of species of blister beetle, the structure of the 
cantharidin molecule is maintained with only v ariations in the quantity of compound that can 
be readily isolated.  The Mylabris  species of beetle contains a much greater concentration of 
cantharidin and is the primary type of beetle used in modern cantharidin preparations.  
Cantharidin functions as a vesicant, weakening desmosomes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_61354] a liquid film- forming formulation.  Application to the skin causes the release of 
neutral serine proteases resulting in the destruction of intercellular desmosomes responsible 
for ho lding the layers of the skin together ( 15). Intracellular tonofilaments are also weakened, 
the result being a fluid -filled, thin -walled epi[INVESTIGATOR_61355].  The superficial nature of the 
blisters is attributed to cantharidin’s lesser effect on hemidesmosomes in the basal layer 
compared to the more superficial desmosomes.  In almost all subjects, this process does not

Although cantharidin has been used extensively for decades in the treatment of several 
dermatologic conditions including molluscum contagiosum (molluscum) and verruca vulgaris, specifications for the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredient or a standardized formulation have never been established.  Furthermore, a lack of reliable and regulated vendors of the compounded drug increases the chance of the drug product being inappropriately prepared, tested, stored or applied, which in turn increases the potential for unintended or even dangerous consequences in the future.  Most currently used cantharidin preparations are prepared as 0.7% w/v (weight/volume) solutions in an acetone solvent with a flexible -collodion base in a screw-top glass bottle at volumes intended for repeated use 
across multiple subjects by [CONTACT_61425].  This type of container closure system paired with highly volatile formulations presents multiple challenges.  Current clinical practice, which reuses the same bottle on multiple patients, increases the risk of cross -
contamination and viral transmission.  Furthermore, due to the presence of volatile solvents in the preparation, evaporation from multiple uses heightens the risk of increased concentration and viscosity of the cantharidin in solution and creates a scenario where highly- concentrated material may be applied to the patient’s skin.  Many formulations also 
lack formal stabi lity studies and medical professionals often will just use the material until it 
is “too thick” to apply.  As a consequence,  patients may receive an u ncertain amount of 
cantharidin which may be more or less than what is anticipated by [CONTACT_61426]. . 
While this does provide evidence of the safety profile for the drug, it also introduces unnecessary risk to the patient.  Further, the nature of the liquid product coupled with the traditional application strategy of using the wooden end of a cotton-tipped swab makes it difficult to apply the minimum amount of drug necessary to achieve the desired effect.  Complete treatment of all warts or lesions is further confounded by [CONTACT_61427], patients and caregivers where the drug has already been applied during the treatment session.  
To address these current shortfalls, Verrica Pharmaceuticals  Inc. has developed VP-102, a 
0.7% w/v cantharidin formulation, consistent with the predominant concentration of cantharidin used by [CONTACT_13922].  Study drug (VP- 102) will be administered with a single -use 
applicator to minimize cross -contamination and concentration changes during use.  Each VP-

safety and deter potential oral ingestion of the drug by [CONTACT_61428], the oral deterrent denatonium benzoate has been included.  
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  [ADDRESS_66252] common warts has been demonstrated clinically (Section 6.1-Inve stigator’s Brochure  (IB)). Cantharidin permeates into the lipid layers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_61356]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_61357] ( 15). This process leads to acantholysis and 
intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_61358]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_61359] a localized inflammatory response and stimulation of the immune system is also believed to play a role in clearing common warts.  
Cantharidin is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases types I and II that are found in all tissues ( 16). The inhibition of these phosphatases may be involved in cantharidin’s systemic 
manifestations when delivered orally or via injection (Section 6.1.1 of the ( IB).  T he 
available nonclinical studies to assess the potential for untoward pharmacodynamic effects of cantharidin with systemic exposure have largely focused on the cardiovascular system. With acute systemic exposure of rats to oral dosing with 6.9 mg/kg (41.4 mg/m2) of cantharidin, cardiac waveform and function were adversely affected, likely related to its inhibitory effect on protein phosphatases ( 17). Cantharidin is a vasoconstrictor and may also be responsible 
for decreases in urine volume with single oral dose administration ( 17, 18). However, it is 
possible that cantharidin may have a direct effect on the renal vascular and tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_61360]. Cantharidin may also have an effect on central nervous system function ( 17), although it is unclear whether noted decreases in 
locomotion and reduced body temperature were secondary to the cardiovascular manifestations noted with the high doses. 
Information  available on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of cantharidin showed that 
oral absorption of cantharidin in rats and dogs is rapid but incomplete with peak systemic 
exposures occurring by 2 hours in rats (Section 6.2 of the IB) ( 19). The apparent plasma 
elimination half -life of cantharidin was about 20 minutes in dogs (20). Tissue distribution of 
cantharidin was ubiquitous, consistent with the widespread distribution of protein phosphatases. 
Nonclinical toxicity information available on cantharidin is predominantly from single dose 
(acute) studies by [CONTACT_61429], oral, intraperitoneal (i.p.), and intravenous (i.v.) routes of administration (Section 6.3 of the I B). The only adverse findings associated with acute 
dermal exposure to cantharidin in animals were local irritation and skin blistering.  No systemic toxicity was noted by [CONTACT_61430].

102, a single -use proprietary applicator containing a novel 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution, 
every 21 days for up to 4 treatments or until complete lesion clearance. Subjects were 
instructed to wash VP -102 off at 24 hrs, or earlier if significant pain or blistering. Lesion 
counts and adverse events (AEs), including local skin reactions, were documented at each 
visit. Quality of life ( QoL) was measured usin g the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (CDLQI). A subset of 17 subjects with ≥ 21 MC lesions at Baseline were evaluated for 
systemic exposure with 4 blood samples (pre -VP-102 and 2, 6, & [ADDRESS_66253]). Key efficacy 
endpoints were % subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treated MC lesions (baseline 
and new) on or before Week 12 and % reduction of treated MC lesions from Baseline at 
Week 12. 
The mean age was 7.3 (range=3 -15) yrs for the 33 subjects enrolled, with 32 completing the 
study.  A total of 29 subjects (88%) reported at least one AE including expected local skin 
reactions such as blistering or erythema with no serious adverse events ( SAEs ).   Sixteen 
subjects (50%) achieved complete clearance of all MC lesions on or before Week 12.  The 
median lesion count was reduced from 23 (range 3 -113) at Baseline to 1 (0 -95) at Week 12 
(p<0.0001). Plasma drug levels were below the limit of quantitation in [ADDRESS_66254], the level was slightly above the lower limit of quantitation 2 hrs after VP -102 
application, but not detectable at 6 & 24 hrs. The  mean±SD CDLQI score was notably 
improved from 2.6±3.4 at Baseline to 0.4±0.9 at Week 12. 
Treatment with VP -102 was well -tolerated and associated with significantly reduced lesion 
count, improved QoL and complete clearance of MC lesions in 50% of subjects. 
A bridging study, conducted under IND #114032, was implemented to confirm VP -102’s 
similarity in safety and efficacy to a 0.7% compounded cantharidin formulation used 
previously under the same IND. For this study, VP -[ADDRESS_66255] cohort investigated a 6- hour treatment duration. In the 6- hour cohort, 14 subjects 
were enrolled, and 13 subjects completed all  study  visits .  A second cohort investigated a 24-
hour treatment duration.  In this cohort, 16 subjects were enrolled, and 12 subjects completed 
all study visits. .  Overall, eleven subjects showed complete clearance out of 25 subjects in the  
per p rotocol  population (PPP)  (44 % clearance).     
In this bridging study, there were no unexpected treatment related adverse events reported 
during application to  1,0 molluscum lesions in 14 subjects in the 6- hour cohort.  Moreover, 
there were no treatment related adverse events reported with application to  712 lesions in 16

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  33 subjects in the 24- hour exposure to VP -102. Thus, this bridging study demonstrated that VP -
102 appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of pediatric molluscu m, consistent 
with historically used cantharidin formulations.   
The following summarizes significant prospective studies using compounded cantharidin as a 
treatment modality and documenting safety in molluscum contagiosum and both efficacy and 
safety in common warts.  
Additional clinical information on the safety of cantharidin comes from over 50 years of 
experience with cantharidin (0.7% w/v) as a treatment for molluscum and warts.  In all of 
these studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were blistering and pain at the site 
of application consiste nt with the pharmacologic activity of cantharidin.  More infrequently 
rash, pruritus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_61361], ring warts and secondary infections were reported.  
(Studies utilizing cantharidin for treatment of warts have been limited however all have 
shown either reduction or clearance over the course of one or several treatments. Treatment 
with 0.7% cantharidin has been safe and well tolerated in the treatment of common warts 
when used under the guidance of a trained medical professional. Below are several studies 
outlining the efficacy and safety profile using compounded cantharidin and in some 
instances, occlusive tape.

Rosenberg, et al. ( 22) conducted a study utilizing 0.7%  cantharidin without occlusion in [ADDRESS_66257] with a wart on 
the palm developed ring wart that was later removed with liquid nitrogen.  
Epstein and Epstein ( 23) conducted a study utilizing 0.7% cantharidin with occlusion under 
adhesive tape in 40 subjects with digital and periungual  warts.  No pretreatment was 
conducted.   Single treatment cleared 36 out of 73 warts.  In some subjects, multiple 
treatments were administered.  By 3 -4 weeks, 69 of 76 warts were clinically cleared.  Thirty

warts had recurred 21 -18 months later.  About half of the subjects experienced some pain 
from treatment which was relieved by  [CONTACT_61431].  Ring warts occurred in 2 
instances.  
Previous s tudies  provide evidence of  the safety, efficacy, and widespread use of 0.7% w/v 
cantharidin topi[INVESTIGATOR_61362], with no serious adverse events reported.  However, there is a wide 
variation in the quality of t he research conducted, timing between applications, duration of 
exposure of lesions to cantharidin and the exact formulations of cantharidin used.   
2.3 Study Rationale  
For many dermatologists, 0.7% w/v cantharidin has been the treatment of choice for warts for 
decades ( 24). However, cantharidin remains an unapproved drug, and there is no reliable or 
controlled source on the market.  This study will evaluate VP -102, a controlled, highly -pure, 
standardized form of topi[INVESTIGATOR_61363]. 
The primary objectives of  Cohort 1 are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of dermal application of 
VP-102 when applied once every 14 days for up to 4 applications to common warts on 
subjects 2 years and older by [CONTACT_61432] (Day  4) and (2) to assess the safety and 
tolerability of VP -102 applied to common warts by [CONTACT_61433] s including 
expected local skin reactions, physical examinations, and concomitant medications .  
The primary objectives for Cohort 2 are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of dermal application of 
VP-102 when a pplied once every 21 days for up to 4 applications to common warts on 
subjects 12 years and older by [CONTACT_61434] T Visit ( Day 84) , and (2) to assess the safety and 
tolerab ility of VP -102 applied to common warts by [CONTACT_61435], physical examinations, and concomitant medications at EOS . 
2.4 Dose and Schedule Rationale  
A 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution is the recognized therapeutic dose of cantharidin for both 
molluscum and wart treatment in dermatological clinical practice (24-28). The 0.7% w/v 
dose was determined to be safe in a recent double -blind Phase 2 study of 94 subjects for the 
treatment of childhood molluscum (29), and in a recently completed study of VP -102 (NCT# 
03017846) with [ADDRESS_66258] demonstrated 
safety and efficacy with a 0.7% cantharidin solution in common warts both with and without 
the use of an occlusive tape.  
There have been no randomized controlled trials to test the frequency of cantharidin 
application of the specific treatment protocol in common warts. However, multiple 
publications and current clinical practice suggest that paring, occlusion and a 1 -3-week 
treatment interval are often utilized. In Cohort 1, a 2- week (14 Day) interval with occlusion

Clinical Protocol –  VP-102-105                                                                                              Version No:  3  
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential  35 was implemented.  In an effort to refine the approach for using VP -102 in common warts and  
to maximize safety and efficacy, a 3 -week (21 Day) interval, using both occlusion and paring 
will be used  in Cohort 2. Additionally, i t can sometimes be challenging to determine if a wart 
is completely clear ed in [ADDRESS_66259] treatment due to ongoing LSRs . Hence treatment 
interval in Cohort 2 is increased to 21 days to allow adequate time for LSRs to resolv e to 
enable evaluation of the treatment site .  This study will enable us to determine if 21 -day 
treatment interval is optimal for Study drug administratio n.     
In this study, lesions will be covered with occlusive tape, a technique often used in the 
treatment of warts with cantharidin.  It is believed that this technique helps the drug penetrate 
into the hyperkeratotic tissue and may result in improved ef ficacy. In Cohort 2, paring of 
lesions will be conducted prior to measurement and treatment to remove any excess 
hyperkeratotic tissue  and improve drug penetration into the wart . Once pared, lesions should 
be measured to confirm they meet the  entry criteri a of ≤10 mm in diameter and ≤3 mm in 
height.  
We are also instructing investigators to treat a 1 -2mm margin of healthy skin surrounding 
each wart in an attempt to reduce the occurrence of “ring warts” which have been reported 
with compounded cantharidin tre atment of common warts.  Ring warts may occur when 
subclinical infected tissue surrounding the visible wart is disturbed but not removed or 
destroyed. In the event a subject develops ring wart during the course of treatment, it is up to 
the investigators d iscretion to either continue treatment of that wart with VP -102, continue 
treatment of any other warts with VP -[ADDRESS_66260] from the study.  
The anticipated VP -102 prescribing label will focus on trea tment of subjects with one or 
more treatable common warts.  Each wart is typi[INVESTIGATOR_24671] 3 mm to 7 mm (7 -38 mm2) in 
diameter, and Verrica estimates that approximately [ADDRESS_66261].

4.1 Basic Design Characteristics  
This is a Phase 2, open label multi -center study [Study number VP -102-105; referred to as 
COVE -1 (Cantharidin and Occlusion in Verruca Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130])] that will be conducted in the 
[LOCATION_002] to determine the safety , efficacy and tolerability of VP -[ADDRESS_66262] Cohort (Cohort  1) utilizes a treatment interval of at 
least 14 days between treatments with longer treatment intervals being allowed depending on 
a specific patient’s clinical response. No paring of lesions is allowed. Twenty s ubjects (2 
years and older) are targeted fo r completing EOS Visit in Cohort . 1. The second Cohort 
(Cohort 2) utilizes a treatment interval of 21 days between treatments. Paring of lesions is 
allowed in Cohort 2 only .  Approximately 35 subjects (12 years and older) will be enrolled in 
Cohort 2. Up t o 4 sites will participate in the study.  
All subjects will receive the Study drug VP -102 (0.7% cantharidin topi[INVESTIGATOR_61364]).  Duration of warts prior to Treatment Visit [ADDRESS_66263] 4 weeks.          
Study drug (VP -102) will be supplied in single -use applicators, with one applicator sufficient 
to treat [ADDRESS_66264]/guardian removes the occlusive tape and 
washes the warts with soap and warm water.  Occlusive tape and Study drug may be 
removed prior to the 24 -hour time point in the event significant blistering, significant pain or 
treatme nt-emergent AEs are experienced.  
To assess eligibility, a d ermatologic exam, wart counts  (Cohort 1) , and measurement of 
diameter and height of each wart will be conducted by a qualified member of the research 
team prior to the first treatment.  Additional Treatment V isits will include wart count  (Cohort 
1), measurement of diameter and an evaluation of response to treatment , prior to treatment 
application when applicable. For those visits where subjects have received treatment, 
additional ERT assessments will be conducted over the phone at 24- hours and 7 days after 
treatment.  ( Specific instructions on how to conduct the wart count (Cohort 1) and measure 
wart diameter and height are provided in the study specific Manual of Operations (MOP).  
Instructions for application of the Study drug are outlined in the Instructions for Use (IFU) 
included in the drug shipment as  well as in the Investigator’s Brochure) . Subjects presenting 
with [ADDRESS_66265] diameter of each wart should be accurately documented 
on the source form and in the eCRF.  
Warts will be treated in all anatomic areas excluding the eye area (including eyelids), lips, 
oral cavity, nasal cavity, inside of the ears, palms of hands, volar surface of the fingers or

For study enrollment, the physician must be willing to treat all lesions initially present.   
Treatment will be applied up to four times during a 63- day treatment period for Cohort [ADDRESS_66266]’s clinical response and will be at least 14 days. The treatment interval in Cohort 2 is 
21 days.  
It can sometimes be challenging to determin e if a wart is completely clear after treatment due 
to ongoing local skin reactions.  At any visit where the investigator is unable to evaluate or 
treat some warts due to ongoing local skin reactions, an “Unscheduled” V isit should be 
documented. The timing  of the next visit will be determined by [CONTACT_61443]. A Treatment V isit should be documented at every visit where Study drug is 
applied. Treatment should only take place at a visit when all warts are evaluable (i.e., not 
obscured by [CONTACT_61399]) and all warts that are not completely clear, should undergo 
treatment with Study drug. No partial treatment of warts is permitted.  
For Cohort 2, Study drug is to be applied to the wart site on any Treatment V isit where a new 
clinica l assessment of complete clearance is made for that wart (e.g., if a patient returns for 
Treatment V isit [ADDRESS_66267] no visible evidence of remaining wart, 
then Study drug is to be applied to this wart site at Treatment V isit 2. Ho wever, if the patient 
remains completely clear at that wart site when returning for Treatment V isit 3, then no 
Study drug would be applied at Treatment V isit 3.)  Should it become clear that the subject 
will be unable to complete the EOS visit within the allowed window of Day 84 ( - 0/+ 8)  
days, the subject should be brought in for their EOS visit as soon as they are able. This  will 
be documented as a protocol deviation.  
In instances where the clinician can adequately assess the treatment sites but is uncertain if 
residual wart is remaining, treatment should be applied, and the subject should return for 
evaluation per protocol.  Treatment visits  and assessments are to take place in order (e.g., 
Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3 and Treatment 4).  Subjects that  receive fewer than 4 
treatments within the 63 -day (Cohort 1) or 75- day (Cohort 2) treatment period, due to the 
durati on of post -treatment local skin reactions,  will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
No treatment should be administered after the 63- day treatment period in Cohort 1 or the 75-
day treatment period in Cohort 2 without Sponsor’s approval.  
Subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_66268] will be 
scheduled for a Treatment V isit per protocol. ( Consider calling the subject a few days prior 
to the 2- week interval (e.g.,11 or 12 days) to ensure adequate t ime for scheduling assessment 
and treatment if needed) . 
Subjects participating in Cohort 2, will be required to attend all visits regardless of whether 
they have achieved complete clearance of all warts at a previous visit.  At these visits, Study 
drug application is not required if the warts have been clear for at least one follow up visit

 Subjects in Cohort 1who are not assessed as 100% cleared of all treatable lesions at the Day 
84, (EOS ) visit will have completed the study and will be further treated per standard of care 
at their physician’s discretion but may not be re -enrolled in this study. Subjects in Cohort 2 
who are not assessed as 100% cleared of all treatable lesions at the Day 147; (EOS) visit will 
have completed the study and will be further treated per standard of care at their physician’s 
discretion but may not be re -enrolled in this study

a 1-[ADDRESS_66270] 14 days  in C ohort 1, 
and every 21 days  in C ohort 2, until complete clearance of all treatable warts, or a maximum 
of 4 applications. Warts are to be treated and then occluded with transparent surgical tape 
(e.g.; 3M™ Blenderm™ brand) that will remain on overnight and removed just prior to the 
24-hour ERT phone call.   
Subjects  in Cohort 2 will undergo wart  paring with a sharp surgical instrument (e.g., scalpel 
or flexible medical blade)  to remove any adherent thick scale from a wart prior to application 
of Study drug.  Wart paring is to be performed  at any  Treatment V isit when adherent thick 
scale is present,  and the investigator considers that it can be safely applied .  Paring should be 
conducted by a trained practitioner and in compliance with any  local regulations  and should 
be discontinue d when it resul ts in puncta te bleeding or significant pain . Not all warts may 
require paring and if adherent scale is not present, then  Study drug can be applied without 
paring. Subjects should be re -treated only after [ADDRESS_66271] elapsed  in C ohort 1 and 17 days 
(i.e., 21 +/ - 4 day s) have elapsed in C ohort 2, but only after any LSR has resolved 
sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site. Treatment should be administered 
within [ADDRESS_66272] achieved 
complete clearance prior to  and a t the Day 84, ( - 0/+ 8 days ) EOT assessment .   
Phone calls will be conducted at an interval of 24 hours and 7 days after each Treatment V isit 
(not “Unscheduled” Visits) to assess if there have been any adverse events or if new warts 
have occurred. Phone ca lls conducted outside of the required 24- hour and 7- day study ERT 
assessments should be documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be 
entered into the electronic data capture ( EDC ). All required study activities, including ERT 
evaluati ons, will be conducted per protocol.  If new warts are identified during the course of 
the treatment period, they should be documented, evaluated and treated per manual of 
opera tions .

•Medical history, vital signs, and physical examinations:
-Medical history, wart history, Fitzpatrick Skin Type and limited physical exams will
be collected for each subject. A limited physical examination will be completedbefore the first treatment and at the EOS visit.  Vital signs (temperature and heartrate) will be obtained before the treatment is applied at each visit and at the start ofthe Day 84 (EOS) V isit.  Additional physical examinations will be performed when
clinically warranted (e.g., subject reports symptoms classified as an AE requiringfurther evaluation).
•Limited physical examinations will be performed by a qualified medical practitioner atscreening and at E OS visits.  Height and weight will be recorded at the screening visit

will be evaluated at each scheduled visit until EOS by [CONTACT_61450]. 
Untreatable warts, if they arise, will be tracked and recorded.  
4.4 Enrollment & Dropouts  
Pre-study screening for eligibility (informed consent and assent [when applicable]), 
demographics, physical exam, prior and current concomitant medications, dermatologic 
exam with Fitzpatrick skin type, wart and medical history can occur up to [ADDRESS_66286] Study drug application.  The wart count  (Cohort 1) , 
measurements, location of all warts, ERT and photos must be repeated if not conducted on 
the same day as treatment.  Subjects that do not continue to meet criteria at Treatmen t Visit [ADDRESS_66287] treatment interval will be determined 
by [CONTACT_61451]. For subjects that 
achieve complete clearance or all tr eatable warts prior to Treatment Visit 4, ERT phone calls 
will be conducted at the required 2- week treatment intervals to assess the status of any AE’s 
or skin reactions since the last visit and confirm there has been no recurrence in treated warts 
or new warts have developed. Subjects that report recurrence of, or presence of new warts, 
will be scheduled for a Treatment Visit per protocol. (Sites should consider calling the 
subject a few days prior to the 2- week interval (e.g.,11 or 12 days) to ensure adequate time 
for scheduling assessment and treatment if needed.)  
The Day 84 EOS V isit will require a final assessment of ERT (for Cohort 1) and 
confirmation of the presence or absence of treated and untreated warts as well as the final 
size and diameter for any that are remaining.  Subjects in Cohort 2 will participate in an in -
person EOT evaluation at Day 84 (- 0/+ 8 days ).  A provider EOT  Questionnaire will be 
completed at the EOT Visit.  Cohort [ADDRESS_66288] be a study qualified member of the research team.  
REPLACEMENT OF DROPOUTS

The subject or legally authorized representative can withdraw consent at any time during the 
study and for any reason without any penalty or changes to care.  Data collected to the point 
that consent is withdrawn are still assessable by [CONTACT_61452].  If subjects do not 
want their data that has already been submitted or collected specimens utilized, they will 
need to submit a request in writing to the Investigator for removal of their information.

VP-102 is a 0.7% w/v solution of cantharidin in a film -forming excipi[INVESTIGATOR_61368].  The 
product is applied to the skin as a viscous solution at which point the solvents evaporate 
leaving behind a thin, flexible and resilient film.   
VP-102 is packaged in a single -use applicator delivering up to 0.45 mL of a 0.7% w/v 
cantharidin formulation. Each unit contains up to 3.15 mg of cantharidin.  Although the VP -
102 will be labeled exclusively for topic al application, the formulation also contains an oral 
deterrent (denatonium benzoate) to further help mitigate the risk of accidental ingestion.  The 
Study drug is light violet to dark purple in color and has been manufactured under good 
manufacturing practices (GMP).  
Unlike previous studies with cantharidin, VP -[ADDRESS_66291]  completes all required testing they 
will be released for use in the clinical study.  
Similar packaging systems containing crushable glass ampules in plastic housings with 
attached filters and/or tips are used in FDA approved medical products for the appli cation of 
medical adhesives like Dermabond® (PMA number P960052) and antiseptics like

Please see the Instructions for Use (IFU), located in the accompanied Investigational 
Brochure for step -by-step instructions. 
Additional points to Consider:  
Given the length of time or complexity it may take to treat all warts, investigators will assess 
in advance if subjects will be cooperative and able to sit still during the entire application of 
Study drug.  Application may not be conducted over more than [ADDRESS_66294] is completely dry (approx. 2- 5 min).  Occlusive tape 
should be gently rubbed in order to maximize adherence to the treated area.  The size of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_61369], and the tape size is deemed sufficient to maintain adherence for 24h. An 
adhesive bandage may be applied over the occlusive tape if needed for flexible areas such as 
fingers and joints to help keep it in place.  
Observe subjects for 2- 5 minutes after Study drug application or until the film is formed and 
totally dry. Subjects should refrain from touching, licking or biting treated skin or putting 
treated skin in or near any mucosal surface including the mouth, nostrils, eyes and anogenital 
area for up to 24 hours after treatment or until the Study drug is removed.  Strongly urge 
subjects/guardians not to touch or wash the treated area for up to 24 hours.   
The occlus ive tape and Study drug should be removed 24 hours (+/ - 8 hours) after treatment.  
The occlusive tape and Study drug may be removed from individual lesions prior to 24 hours 
if there is significant blistering, pain or adverse reactions. To remove, wet the occlusive tape 
in a bath or shower with warm water and then slowly peel back an edge of the tape pulling 
the tape over itself in a “low and slow” manner to prevent the unroofing of any blisters that 
may have developed. Gently remove any remaining Study dru g with soap and warm water.  
Subjects/guardians will be cautioned not to use washcloths, abrasive material or vigorous 
rubbing to remove the Study drug as this may cause temporary pain and damage to the 
external layer of the skin and slow the healing proce ss.   
Provide subjects/guardians with both verbal and the written take -home instructions on 
potential side effects and complications, contact [CONTACT_61454]/study 
coordinator for questions or concerns, and a copy of their signed informed consent 
(Screening Day and/or Day 1 only).  Subjects will be provided a n LSR guide to assist the Site 
in collecting the required ERT information related to the treated areas.  
Subjects are encouraged to wash their hands regularly with soap and water a nd discouraged 
from scratching lesions, which can spread disease.

log as they are used. Applicators do not need to be used in sequential order.  
All used and unused study medication is to be discarded at the site in a sharps container, or 
per the site’s SOP for disposal, after the study monitor has reviewed and confirmed accurate 
accountability. Those sites that are not  allowed to dispose of the Study drug at their site will 
make arrangements with the Sponsor for return and destruction. 
Study drug must be stored at controlled room temperature (68°- 77°F; excursions of 59°- 86°F 
are acceptable for periods not exceeding eigh t hours) in a secure, dry location with limited 
and controlled access, and out of direct light. Extended exposure to extreme temperature 
conditions or to direct light should be avoided (e.g. Study drug left in an unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_61371] a hot or cold environment).  Contact [CONTACT_61455]. Study drug may be

P
re-study screening for eligibility (informed consent and assent [when applicable]), 
demographics, physical exam, prior and current concomitant medications and medical history 
can occur up to [ADDRESS_66300] Study drug application. The dermatologic exam, wart count  (Cohort 1), measurements, location of all warts, ERT and 
photos must be repeated if not conducted on the same day as treatment.
 An IRB -approved 
Informed Consent and Assent (assent when applicable) will be signed before any study specific procedures are performed.  The dermatologic exam, wart count (C ohort 1), 
measurements, location of all warts, ERT and photos must be repeated if not conducted on the same day as treatment.  Warts must measure at ≤10 mm in diameter and ≤3 mm in height for both Cohorts (paring can be performed, if necessary, in Cohort 2 prior to assessing height for inclusion).  
 
Subjects in Cohort 2 will undergo wart paring with a sharp surgical instrument (e.g., scalpel or flexible medical blade) to remove any adherent thick scale from a wart prior to application of St udy drug.  Wart paring is to be performed at any Treatment Visit when adherent thick 
scale is present, and the investigator considers that it can be safely applied.  Paring should be conducted by a trained practitioner and in compliance with any local regulations and should be discontinued when it results in punctate bleeding or significant pain. Not all warts may require paring and if adherent scale is not present, then Study drug can be applied without paring.  
Subjects that do not continue to meet criteria at Treatment Visit [ADDRESS_66301] elapsed  in Cohort 1 or 21 (+/- 4 days) in Cohort 2, but 
only after any LSR has resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site.

where the investigator is unable to evaluate or treat some warts due to ongoing local skin 
reactions, an “Unscheduled” visit should be documented. The timing of the next visit will be 
timed to correspond with the resolution of the local skin reaction. A Treatment Visit should 
be documented at every visit where any study drug is applied. Treatment should only take 
place at a visit when all warts are evaluable (i.e., not obscured by [CONTACT_61399]) and all 
warts that are not completely clear should undergo treatment with study drug. No partial 
treatment of warts is permitted. In instances where the clinician can adequately assess the 
treatment sites but is uncertain if residual war t is remaining, treatment should be applied, and 
the subject should return for evaluation per protocol.  Treatment Visits are to take place in 
order (e.g., Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3 and Treatment 4), although it is possible 
that some subjects w ill not receive less than 4 treatments within the 63 -day (Cohort 1) or 75 
day (Cohort 2)  treatment period , due to the duration of post -treatment local skin reactions 
and this will not be considered a protocol deviation. No treatments should be administered 
after Day 63 (Cohort 1) or Day  75 (Cohort 2) without prior approval from the Sponsor.  
ERT in -person safety assessments will be conducted during the initial treatment visit and at 
each subsequent Treatment Visits [ADDRESS_66303] developed. Subjects that report recurrence of, or presence of new warts, will 
be scheduled for a  treatment visit per protocol.  
6.2 Measurements and Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Period (Up to 14 days prior to Treatment Visit 1)  
Before the initiation of screening assessments, the subject/guardian must be given a complete 
explanation of the purpose and evaluations  of the study.  Subsequently and depending on the 
age of the subject, the subject/guardian must sign and receive a copy of an informed consent 
form (ICF) (Section 9.3), an IRB -required assent form (subjects 10 years or older), and an 
authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information ( Section 9.3) that was 
approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Once consent and assent are obtained, the Screening Period 
assessments will be performed. Subjects will be  screened within 14 days prior to or on 
Treatment Visit 1 of the study.  Following consent and assent, review and recording of any

be conducted by [CONTACT_61458] 24 hours and 7 days after every 
treatment application (ERT). The phone call will review questions related to removal  
of occlusive tape, Study drug, and review and documentation of local skin reactions, 
adverse events and con- meds since the prior visit or call. If participating, a reminder 
to take photos of the treated areas and save or send the photos via text or e -mail to 
the research team will also be reviewed. The subject and/or guardian will have time 
to ask questions and review any concerns.  In the event any adverse events present a

ERT phone calls will be conducted at the required 2- week treatment intervals to 
assess the status of any AE’s or skin reactions since the last visit and co nfirm there 
has been no recurrence in treated warts or new warts have developed. Subjects that 
report recurrence of, or presence of new warts, will be scheduled for a Treatment 
Visit per protocol. Sites should consider calling the subject a few days prior to the 2-
week interval (e.g., 11 or 12 days) to ensure adequate time for scheduling assessment 
and treatment if needed.  
14. In Cohort 2, subjects that achieve complete clearance prior to Treatment  Visit 4 will

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 63 7 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
The following definition of adverse event  (AE) will be used for this study: 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related .  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the investigational product.   
The following are examples of AEs:  
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including an increase in
frequency or intensity of the condition
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration, evenif they were present before the start of the study
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with another medicalproduct
•Local skin reactions (erythema, scaling/flaking/dryness, edema/swelling, small blisters,hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scabbing/crusting, erosion/ulcerations, scarring, ring
warts)
•Development of individual blisters that are greater than 25mm in diameter (the diameterof a quarter). (An aggregated blister composed of a number of smal ler blisters is not
considered a severe blister)
•Blistering distal to the treatment site
•Scarring -independent of any pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491]; include depressed (atrophic) and
elevated (hypertrophic)
•Secondary infection
T
he following are not examples of AEs: 
•Medical procedures (The medical condition that led to the procedure as the AE should bereported.)
•Situations that are unwanted by [CONTACT_61459], for example social inconvenience after admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]
•Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of a preexisting disease or condition (present or
detected before enrollment) that does not worsen overall
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  3 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 64 •Expected progression of the disease being studied, including signs or symptoms of the
disease, unless progression is more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
A
Es may include pre-treatment or post- treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -
mandated procedures (e.g., invasive procedures, modification of the subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).   AEs should be captured even if they occur during periods without drug 
treatment or post-treatment periods.  AE collection begins once the subject has signed informed consent and will continue until the EOS visit has been completed.  
The investigator is responsible for performing periodic and special assessments for AEs.  The investigator and study personnel will note all AEs mentioned by [CONTACT_61460] (EOS; Day 84).  All clinical complaints volunteered by [CONTACT_61461]/guardian during the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the source and eCRF for the study period indicated.  The subject will receive appropriate treatment and medi cal supervision for any AE 
that occurs.   
All unresolved AEs will be followed until the condition resolves and/or stabilize, the subject 
is lost to follow -up or 30-days after the end of study (EOS visit or up to [ADDRESS_66308].)  All AEs will be summarized in the annual report or more 
frequently if requested by [CONTACT_61462].  SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the eCRF as described in Section 7.3.   
7.2 Definit ion of a Serious Adverse Event  
In this study, a serious adverse event is defined as an AE that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
•Results in death
•Is life -threatening
•The term life -threatening  in the definition of an SAE refers to an event in which the
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  The term life -threatening does not
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
•Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61374]’s office or out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospit alization
are AEs, but not necessarily SAEs.  An occurrence or complication that prolongshospi[INVESTIGATOR_61375].  When there is doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61376], the AE should be considered an SAE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61377] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from its original baseline level isnot considered an SAE.
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  3 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 65 •A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life functions
•This definition is not intended to include AEs of relatively minor medical significancesuch as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza and accidentaltrauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but donot constitute a substantial disruption.
•Another important medical event
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised when deciding whether reporting isappropriate for other important medical events that may not result in death, belife-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61378].These events should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensivetreatment in an emerge ncy room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias,
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
An SAE requires additional detailed reports and follow-up.  The content of these detailed reports must address the investigator’s estimate of causality.  The medical monitor will review the SAE to determine if it is an expected SAE (i.e., whether or not the SAE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the VP- 102 Investigator’s Brochure).  
7.3 Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adve rse Events  
When an AE or SAE occurs, the investigator is responsible for reviewing all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostic reports, etc.) relative to the event(s).  The investigator will record all relevant information about any AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the eCRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records in lieu of the properly completed AE or SAE pages of the eCRF.  These documents should not be sent unl ess they are specifically requested by [CONTACT_61463].  If this request occurs, all subject identifiers and protected health information should be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_61379].  
The investigator will also attempt to report a diagnosis, instead of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information, for the AE.  The diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF as the AE or SAE.  In addition, SAEs need to be reported in the SAE report.  AEs being processed as SAEs will also require additional documentation. 
7.4 Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study.  
The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.   
The classifications in Table 3 should be used in assigning intensity of each AE recorded in the eCRF.  
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  [ADDRESS_66309] from performing normal everyday 
activities  
AE: adverse event.  
Any AE that changes in intensity during its course will be recorded in the eCRF at the 
highest lev el experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction).  However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache.  Both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An AE is considered serious (an SAE) when it meets one of the predefined outcomes described in Section 7.2. 
Local Skin Reactions should be rated based on the severity ratings in the Local Skin Reaction 
Guide that is provided. 
7.[ADDRESS_66310].  The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure or product label for marketed products in estimating the relationship.  
Because of reporting timelines, the investigator might have minimal information to include in the initial SAE report.  However, the investigator must always make an assessment of causality for every SAE before the transmission of the SAE report.  The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_61380]-up information, with subsequent amen dment of the SAE report.  Causality assessment is one of the criteria used to determine 
regulatory reporting requirements and should not be left blank in the SAE report.  The same applies to AEs that are to be processed as SAEs.  Some definitions to use in the assessment are provided in Table 4.

Sponsor or designee by [CONTACT_648], or e- mail within 24  hours of the time the investigator becomes 
aware of the SAE ( Table 5) . Urgent reporting of SAEs is required for the following reasons: 
To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority. 
To facilitate discussion between the Sponsor and the investigator about appropriate follow-up 
measures (if necessary).  
To facilitate the Sponsor’s rapid dissemination of information about AEs to other investigators or sites in a multicenter study.  
To facilitate reporting unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects to the IRB. Term  Definition  
Definitely related  The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) or research 
intervention: the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of 
the investigational agent(s) or research intervention and follows a known 
pattern of response, and no alternative cause is present.  
Possibly related  The AE may be related to the investigational a gent(s) or intervention: the 
AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention and follows a suspected pattern of 
response, but an alternative cause is present.  
Probably related The AE is likely  related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: the 
AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention and follows a known or suspected 
pattern of response, but an alternative cause may b e present.  
Unrelated  
(or not related)  The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention: the AE has no temporal relationship to the administration of 
the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, and follows no

Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  [ADDRESS_66316] Discontinuation 
Subjects are encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily withdraw at 
any time.  The investigator will provide a written explanation of the reason for discontinuation in a source document and this information will also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  If a subject withdraws before completion, every effort should be made to complete the Day [ADDRESS_66317], justifies withdrawal from the study.  
8.1.3 Noncompliance  
After the investigator, the medical monitor and/or study monitor consult (and the sponsor if appropriate), a subject may be discontinued from the study for the following administrative reasons:  
Failure to receive study medication or treatment as mandated by [CONTACT_61467] [ADDRESS_66318] refusing clinical trial material for any reason will be discontinued from the 
study, and the reason(s) for their discontinuation will be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF page.  Reasonable efforts should be made to monitor the subject for AEs and to complete follow -up assessments after treatment discontinuation.  These efforts should be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF page.

Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  [ADDRESS_66319] who withdraws consent for any reason at any time during the study will be 
discontinued from the study, and the reason(s) will be documented on the appropriate source and eCRF page.  If subjects do not want their data that has already been submitted or specimens utilized, they will need to submit a request in writing to the Investigator for removal  of their information.  
8.2 Premature Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor, investigator, medical monitor, study monitor, or appropriate regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation among the Sponsor, investigator, medical monitor, and study monitor.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the followin g: 
•The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled inthe study
•A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, ordevelopment of the product
•A study conducted at a single site in a multicenter study may also warrant terminationunder the following conditions:
•Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate
•Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of appropriate regulatoryauthorities
•Submission of knowingly false information from the site to the sponsor, study monitor, orappropriate regulatory authority
•Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements
Study termination and follow-up will comply with the conditions set forth in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6, Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Data from all sites, including those that have been terminated for non- compliance or unsatisfactory 
enrollment will be evaluated and included in the interpretation of study findings.  Subjects from sites that terminate early will be considered for analysis.  If a subject does not complete the study, they will still be counted as a failure for the primary endpoint. 
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  [ADDRESS_66320].  Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used to capture study assessments and data. The study coordinator or other delegated study personnel will enter data from source documents into the eCRFs.  All eCRFs will be reviewed and source- verified by [CONTACT_61468], and the study monitor will ensure that all data in the eCRF are correct and complete.  All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the source documentation (i.e., medical r ecords).  Before or between visits, the medical monitor or study monitor may 
conduct a preliminary medical review of the eCRFs.  Once the eCRFs are completed and source- verified, the investigator must electronically sign all required pages in the eCRF, 
verifying the accuracy of all data contained in the eCRF.  
Training will be provided for the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  All study personnel using the EDC system must have the necessary education, training, and experience or any combination of these.  The investigator will be responsible for documenting employee education, training, and previous experience that pertain to the EDC system for all site personnel using the EDC system.  
The investigator must maintain adequate security of the EDC system, including 
documentation that all users have been trained on the appropriate standard operating procedure (SOP) and a list of authorized users.  To ensure all data entries can be tracked, all personnel responsible for data entry must obtain a unique user identification (user ID) and password before any data can be entered in the eCRFs.  Authorized study personnel will be assigned a unique user ID only after receiving SOP training.  
If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by [CONTACT_61469], the investigator must ensure that the systems are validated and that data are backed  up as described in Section 9.4. 
9.[ADDRESS_66321] disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics and study drug exposure will be summarized .  The data will be summarized in tables, as appropriate, showing the number of 
subjects with non-missing data (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous data and showing counts and percentage for categorical data.  Data will also be listed as deemed appropriate.   
9.2.[ADDRESS_66322] 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects enrolled in  the study. 
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  3 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 73 Subjects who receive all planned treatments of VP -102 (e.g., up to four treatments within the 
63 day treatment window, or cleared of all treatable warts prior to Day 63  in Cohort 1; and in 
Cohort 2 complete up to four treatments within the  Day 75 treatme nt window or clear prior to 
Day 7 5) are assessed for clearance at the EOS visit and have no ne of the following major 
protocol violations will be included in the Per Protocol population.  The following pre-
determined reasons will exclude subjects from being included in the Per Protocol population: 
•Subjects who do not come in for required Treatment Visits.
•Subjects who do not return for the EOS study visit.
•Subjects who refuse to have all of their treatable warts treated or investigators whorefuse to treat all treatable warts.
•Early removal of the study drug not associated with pain, blistering or other medicallyappropriate reason for early removal.
•Subjects who begin alternative treatments for their warts after starting the study.
•Subjects enrolled who did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
T
he safety population will include subjects who receive at least one treatment of VP-102. 
9.2.3 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy analysis using the ITT population will be considered the primary analysis.  Analysis carried out on the per-protocol population will be considered secondary in nature.   
The primary endpoint of proportion of subjects exhibiting clearance of all treatable warts 
(baseline and new) at the EOS /EOT  Visit (Day 84  for Coh ort 1 and Cohort 2) will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  The analysis will be separate for Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2. Other binary endpoints will be analyzed with this method.  Continuous endpoints 
will be summarized using summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviations,  median, 
minimum, maximum).  Further details of analysis of other endpoints will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.2.4 Safety Analysis 
Safety analysis will be based on the safety population.  Subjects will be assigned to the treatment received for  any analysis of safety.  
Adverse event data for the safety population will be listed individually, and the incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], System Organ Class, and Preferred Term using frequency counts.  LSRs  will also be tracked by [CONTACT_61470].  These will be tabulated by [CONTACT_61471].  When calculating the incidence of adverse events, only Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be considered.  In addition, 
VP-102 ( Cantharidin)  
Clinical Protocol – VP- 102-105               Version No:  3 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 74 any adverse event with an onset date after the EOS visit will be considered off study and will 
not be included in tables summaries (though they will appear in adverse event listings) .  Each 
adverse event will be counted only once for a given subject.  If the same adverse event occurs on multiple occasions for a subject, the occurrence with the highest severity and relationship to Study drug will be reported.  If two or more adverse ev ents are reported as a unit, the 
individual terms will be reported as separate events.  Changes in vital signs, from baseline to the end of the study will be examined.  Treatment-emergent changes from normal values to abnormal values will be identified as described in Section 4.3.1.   
9.2.5 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 9.2.6 Sample Size  
The study will enroll subjects with common warts for the main purpose of obtaining 
information on clearance rates of the warts in response to VP -102 therapy.   Subjects in 
Cohort 1will continue to be enrolled in the study to a target of  approximately 20 subjects 
complet ing the EOS visit.  In Cohort 2, approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled. 
9.2.7 Handling of Missing data 
Clearance of all treatable warts is to be assessed at each Treatment Visit as well as unscheduled visits over the duration of the study.  The assessment done at the EOS Visit (Day 84) will be considered to be the primary efficacy endpoint.   
Subjects who do not have an assessment of complete clearance of all treatable warts at the 
EOS Visit (Day 84) will be considered to have missing data for the primary endpoint.  The 
primary method to handle missing data will be to assign all subjects with missing complete clearance data as not having achieved complete clearance.  
The procedures for handling missing data for other study endpoints will be described in the statistical analysis plan.   
9.3 Informed Consent/Assent and Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information 
Written assent and informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information must be obtained from each subject (or the subject’s legally acceptable representative) before performing any st udy-specific screening/baseline period evaluations.  
One copy of the signed informed consent form (and IRB-required assent form) and authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information form will be given to the subject, and the investigator will retain the original.  The informed consent/assent form and authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information, which is prepared by [CONTACT_61472], must have been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], the study monito r, and the investigator’s IRB and privacy board (if separate from the IRB) before the 
initiation of the study.  The informed consent form must contain the 20 elements of informed

Cohort 2 will utilize up to 4 sites to enroll 
approximately 35 subjects (12 years and older). Although no formal power calculations have been performed, it is expected that a sample size of 20 subjects (Cohort 1) and 35 subjects (Cohort 2) evaluable at the EOS/EOT visit (Day 84 for both Cohorts) will be informative regarding wart clearance rates that can support assumptions in subsequent placebo -controlled trials.  A sample size of 20 
completed subjects for Cohort 1 and approximately 35 subjects for Cohort 2, pooled with subjects who drop 
out prior to the EOS/EOT visit, will provide 
information to build an adequate safety profile of VP-[ADDRESS_66337] patient has completed the visit on Day 147.

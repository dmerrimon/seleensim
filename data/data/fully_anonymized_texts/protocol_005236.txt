BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
 
This document is a protocol for a clinical research study. This study will be conducted in full accordance 
with all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal 
and state laws and regulations including U S and international standards of Good Clinical Practice.    
Introduction  
  Aphasia is an acquired disorder of language that occurs in approximately 30% of 
individuals with stroke and impacts approximately 1 million Americans (see NINDS.NIH.gov). 
Persons with aphasia (PWA) suffer greater disability and utilize more health care r esources than 
individuals with stroke without aphasia (33); Boehme et al (16), for example, estimated that 
aphasia adds $2.[ADDRESS_823513] 
wages and productivity. Furthermore, the social isolation felt by [CONTACT_349703]. Current treatments for aphasia are only modestly beneficial 
(17, 59). Many individuals with mode rate or severe aphasia after stroke continue to suffer 
significant impairment despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175]. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to 
demonstrate that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) paired with language stimulation will 
improve chronic a phasia. More specifically, we seek to demonstrate that TMS combined with 
speech -language therapy (SLT) will improve language performance more than SLT alone. 
Additionally, we will employ modern techniques for network analyses of neuroimaging data 
collected  before and after TMS and SLT to determine the mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_349704]. Finally, we seek to identify the predictors of response to TMS ,, making use of genetic 
testing . To achieve these goals, we propose the first double -blind, placebo -contro lled 
investigation of TMS combined with SLT that is sufficiently powered to assess the efficacy of the 
therapy. If the treatment proves successful, our work will set the stage for a Phase 3 trial of the 
efficacy of TMS with SLT in the treatment of chronic aphasia.   
 
AD Sub-study Introduction  
 Alzheimer Disease (AD) afflicts more than 5 million people in the [LOCATION_003] at present; this number is 
expected to rise to 13.5 million by 2050 because of the aging of the population and increases in life 
expectancy. Impaired verbal communication is a hallmark of AD and represents a major cause of distress 
and disability ( 162, 165 ).  This impairment reflects, at least in part, deficits in core language faculties (e.g. 
phonology, lexical representations and semantic memory ( 154, 175 ). There is a paucity of treatments for 
these impairments. In light of the emerging literature demonstrating that TMS improves general cognition 
in subjects with AD, we propose to extend our ongoing study of the effectiveness of TMS and speech 
therapy for treatment of post -stroke aphasia to the issue of impaired verbal communication in subjects with 
AD. This sub -study will be a double blind, randomized study of subjects with mild -moderate AD to explore 
the effectiveness of TMS as a therapy for impaired verb al communication. Except when indicated below, 
the intervention for subjects with AD is identical to the main study,  
 
1.[ADDRESS_823514] right hemisphere (70, 86; see also 51, 133, Figure 1A). 
Predicated on the same assumption, many investigators have attempted to treat chronic 
aphasia with inhibitory (1 Hz) TMS to the right I FG.   
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823515] to a number of parameters  (e.g., stimulation site, 
duration of therapy, presence or absence of concurrent speech therapy)  so the benefit of TMS 
for chronic aphasia has not been established. We propose a well -powered randomized, 
controlled, treatment experiment that will test for the first time whether inhibitory TMS of the right 
pars triangularis, when coupled with CILT, yie lds greater language improvement 3 and 6 months 
later, relative to sham TMS and CILT.  
 TMS is a technique by [CONTACT_9444] a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a 
brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique , which was introduced 
in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world,  has been shown to transiently 
improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against 
the subject’s head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a 
capacitor into a circular or f igure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic 
field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 
ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapi [INVESTIGATOR_375]. Because the magnetic field  pass es 
freely through  the scalp, skull, and meninges,  the flux in the  magnetic field induces a small 
electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.   
 TMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. In this study we propose to use 1 Hz TMS; that 
is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1/second. This style of TMS is assumed to be 
inhibitory in that it transiently suppresses the function of the cortex under the coil. Using the 
figure -of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to reduce activity in approximately [ADDRESS_823516] emplo yed TMS with a frequency of 1 Hz for 
periods of 20 minutes and longer; mild behavioral deficits are often present for several minutes 
in these studies.  
  
1.1.1  Clinical Data to Date  
 TMS has also been used to treat a variety of conditions such as hemiparesis and depression. 
More relevant to the current applic ation, more than 20 studies (see [ADDRESS_823517]) involving approximately [ADDRESS_823518] investigated whether TMS can improve 
language performance in P ersons with Aphasia (P WA). Positive results have been reported in 
most of these studies and confirmed in several published meta -analyses (66, 91, 103, 118). Our 
group has also reported positive results from a randomized cross -over study of 10 subjects 
treated with 1 Hz TMS to the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). We found a significant improvement 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_349678] 6 months after the completion 
of therapy (76;  see also 47, 49). The Standard Difference of Means (SMD; a measure of effect 
size) between the real and sham treated groups in our study, to which the current proposal is 
similar, was approximately 1.1 (119).  As will be discussed at length below, there ha ve been no 
adverse effects from TMS in any of the previous 20+ studies of TMS to treat aphasia.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Time course of TMS Benefits  
Evidence suggests that the benefit from TMS to the right IFG increases  over time in the absence 
of ongoing therapy (10, 84, 86). We reported a similar finding in a subject followed for 10 months 
after TMS (47). As most studies assess treatment efficacy 2 months or less after treatment, there 
is reason to think that many stud ies reported to date (e.g., 1, 116, 127) have underestimated  the 
benefit from TMS. Our proposed study will measure treatment -related outcomes at 3 and 6 
months, with the expectation that  the advantage for the TMS -treated group will be maximal at 6 
months.         
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Coupling of TMS with SLT  
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
There is strong evidence from studies of motor rehabilitation that TMS and behavioral treatments 
produce synergistic effects in subjects with brain lesions, presumably by [CONTACT_349705] -
dependent plasticity (122). For example, Avenanti et al. (6) demonstrat ed that subjects with 
chronic hemiparesis exhibited significantly greater benefit from occupational or physical therapy 
paired with real as compared to sham [ADDRESS_823519] hemisphere. In a number of 
studies, the improvement with TMS was greater w hen TMS was delivered before,  as compared 
to after, physical or occupational therapy (see 7, 56, 65 for similar results).  In light of these data, 
the proposed study will couple TMS with SLT in a manner designed to maximize use -dependent 
plasticity.  
 
1.2 AD Sub -Study Background  
  
 TMS has been used to enhance cognition, including language, in normal subjects () as 
well as subjects with focal brain injury ( 46, 76 ). In recent years, TMS has also been demonstrated 
to enhance cognition in subjects with AD ( 27, 148, 149, 150, 160, 163, 170, 171 ) and Mild 
Cognitive Impairment ( 155). The majority of studies have assessed the impact of TMS on “general 
cognition,” usually as assessed by [CONTACT_349706] – Cognitive subscale (ADAS -Cog; 106); Koch et al. (163), however, 
demonstrated significant benefit on memory from repetitive TMS to the precuneus and Wu et al. 
(179) demonstrated that TMS improved psychiatric symptomatology in AD. Only one study 
reported data regarding the impact of TMS on language; in a study that explored the effects of 
TMS on general cognition and memory, Cotelli et al. ( 27) reported limited data from language 
tasks. They found that TMS improved performance on a sentence comprehension task.  
 Two recent reviews and meta -analyses also point to the utility of TMS as a treatment in 
AD. Cheng et al. ( 52) reported a meta -analysis of 8 randomized, controlled trials including 194 
participants (107 with active treatment and 87 with sham) demonstrating a moderate effect of 
TMS (SMD -0.48, 95% CI, 0.12 -0.84). Vacas et al. ( 176) reported a meta -analysis of the effects 
of TMS on behavioral and psychological symptoms from 4 randomized, controlled trials involving 
non-invasive brain stimulation; they found a significant benefit in studies involving TMS but not 
tDCS.  
 It is important to note that TMS was well tolerated in all studies. Several investigators 
reported minor headache and “non -specific minor discomfort” ( see 152 for a review). We are 
unaware of major adverse events in any study and there is no report of a subject withdrawing 
from a study because of adverse events.  
1.3  Dose Rationale (if applicable)  
 We propose to administer 1200 pulses of TMS at 90% motor threshold on 10 occasions (Monday -
Friday on consecutive weeks). This schedule was selected because it was employed in most of the  studies, 
including our work (47), that demonstrated a beneficial effect from TMS on language function.  
 
1.3.1  AD Sub -Study Dose Rationale  
  
 We propose to administer 1200 pulses of TMS at 100% motor threshold on 10 occasions (Monday -
Friday on consecutive weeks). Th is schedule was selected because it was employed in most of the studies, 
including our work (47), that demonstrated a beneficial effect from TMS on language function.  We propose 
to employ “rapid”  rTMS because Ahmed et al ( 148) demonstrated that rapid rTMS produced benefit in the 
ADAS -Cog in patients with AD whereas [ADDRESS_823520] that several studies demonstrating benefit on the ADAS -Cog in subjects with AD employed this 
frequency ( 149, 150, 164, 170, 171 ). Most studies to date have delivered 1200 pulses per session. We note 
that the stimulation parameters that we propose are within guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_349707] ( 106).  
 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
1.3.2  Clinical Studies in Children  
 We propose to include subjects >[ADDRESS_823521] access to children with stroke and 
there is relatively little experience with TMS in children. Furthermore, as studies to date demonstrating 
benefit from TMS for aphasia were performed in adul ts, there is no evidence of efficacy of the treatment in 
aphasic children.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
● To demonstrate that TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (SLT) will 
improve language performance more than sham TMS and CILT.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
● To determine the mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_349708].  
● To identify the predictors of response to TMS , including using genetic analysis.  
[ADDRESS_823522]’s participation is indicated in Figure 1. Briefly, after 
randomization to treatment with TMS+CILT or sham TMS+CILT, all subjects will undergo baseline 
behavioral testing ,  neuroimaging , and genetic testing  before receiving [ADDRESS_823523] anatomic and fMRI scans at T 5 and T 22. Subjects who are not 
able or willing to undergo MRI will undergo CAT scan of the head.

function . To that end, a number of  standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be 

 
V11  10/17/23    
 
administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery (121), Pyramids and Palm Trees test 
(52), Figural Fluency Test (108), word and non -word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and  
Brookshire Narratives (88), CILT stimulus naming, and Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and 
Sentences  (see below for details) , as well a s a measure of grip strength and finger flexibility.   
Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a 
contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. N o contrast will be used. If they consent to 
DNA sampling, p articipants will also have a saliva sample taken for the purpose of genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
All assessments listed are not mandatory. If the participant wishes to discontinue testing or 
refuses to perform a certain test due to frustration or fatigue, their request will be granted and 
not considered a deviation. Instead we will make note of any re fused tests in our case report 
form (i.e. visit checklist).  
3.1.2  Study Intervention Phase  
In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 20 
minutes (1200 pulses) of 1 Hz TMS at 90% MT will be delivered to the inferior pars triangularis. 
Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a [ADDRESS_823525] will be granted and 
not considered a deviation. Instead we will make note of any re fused tests in our case report 
form (i.e. visit checklist).  
 
 
3.1.4  Allocation to Interventional Group  
 
Participants will be randomized to either TMS or sham TMS in a 2:1 allocation ratio using 
permuted blocks of  variable size. Further, as it has been suggested that aphasia severity 
influences response to TMS treatment for aphasia, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_349709] <50 
and WAB AQ => 50 (see 60). The unblinded study coordinator will be responsible for generating 
the random numbers used to conduct the randomization.  
  
 
3.2 General Design AD Sub -Study  
 
Briefly, after randomization to treatment with TMS+CILT or sham TMS+CILT, all subjects will 
undergo baseline behavioral testing , neuroimaging , and genetic testing  before receiving [ADDRESS_823526] -treatment effects will be assessed within 
4 days of the completion of therapy by [CONTACT_349710]. At 6 and 12 weeks  after the completion of TMS, subjects will return 
for follow -up assessments during which the same tasks administered in Visits 1 and 2 will be 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823527]’s language 
function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychol ogical tasks will be 
administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery (121), Pyramids and Palm Trees test 
(52), Figural Fluency Test (108), word and non -word repetition tasks, the Nicholas and  
Brookshire Narratives (88), CILT stimulus naming, and No rthwestern Assessment of Verbs and 
Sentences  (see below for details) , and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neuropsychological Status  (147).  Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo  an MRI 
of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will 
be used. If they consent to DNA sampling, p articipants will also have a saliva sample taken for 
the purpose of genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
All assessments listed are not mandatory. If the participant wishes to discontinue testing or 
refuses to perform a certain test due to frustration or fatigue, their request will be granted and 
not considered a deviation. Instead we will make note of any re fused tests in our case report 
form (i.e. visit checklist).  
 
3.2.2  Study Intervention Phase  
In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks. We will employ 
repetitive TMS (rTMS) in which 30 two second trains of 10 Hz TMS will be delivered every 30 
seconds to the left inferior pars triangularis and to the left poster ior superior temporal gyrus, both 
at 100% MT. There will be a total of 600 pulses (30 trains x 2 seconds at 10 Hz) to each site in 
each session for a total of 1200 pulses/session. Each rTMS treatment session will be immediately 
followed by a [ADDRESS_823528] will be granted and

Participants will be randomized to either TMS or sham TMS in a 2:[ADDRESS_823529] recent . Reports of adverse effects from TMS and other aspects of the study (brain 
imaging, behavioral tasks and CILT) will serve as the primary safety endpoint.  
[ADDRESS_823530] meet all of the following inclusion criteria:  
● Clinical evidence and MRI or CT verification of a single left hemisphere  cerebral infarct , 
either ischemic and hemorrhagic, with moderate to severe aphasia as operationally 
defined by [CONTACT_349711] -AQ scores between 85 and 20, inclusive. Patients will not be excluded 
on the basis of small (less than 1.5cm) lacunar strokes as these are extremely common 
in the population under study and for which the therapy is ultimately intended.  
● Suffered their infarction at least 6 months prior to their testing.

● Multiple infarcts as defined by [CONTACT_14548]  
● History of serious and/or ongoing issues with substance abuse .  
● Previous head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 5 minutes  
● Psychiatric illness (We note that subjects will be assessed with the 15 -item Geriatric 
Depression scale. Because depression is very difficult to evaluate in aphasic subjects, 
potential subjects will not be excluded on the basis of the depression score, but  this 
measure will serve as a covariate in subsequent analyses.)

Children, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this protocol.  
 
Although there is no known risk of TMS to the fetus, the issue has not been fully addressed; 
consequently, pregnant women will be excluded. All women of childbearing age (that is, not 
postmenopausal) will be asked to undergo a pregnancy test at the beginni ng of study visits. 
Prisoners will not be recruited. As the technique has not been studied in children, only subjects 
18 and older will be permitted to participate.  
 
5 Study Intervention (Study drug, device, biologic, vaccine, food etc.)  
5.1 Description  
We will use a MagVenture MagPro X100 with a C -B60 Butterfly Coil  or Cool -B65 A/P Butterfly 
Coil. A sham MagVenture TMS coil  (Cool -B65 A/P Butterfly Coil)  that looks and sounds like the 
active coil but does not generate a magnetic field will be used for the sham TMS.  Current 
stimulation surface electrodes are placed on the skin at the site of the coil which provide a small 
amount of current stimulation to simulate TMS.  
 
We will use the MagVenture MagPro X100 with subjects in the AD sub -study. We will also make 
use of the Magstim Standard Rapid Package with an air -cooled figure -of-eight coil.  
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
Pertinent param eters for consideration in any TMS study include the location, frequency, intensity, 
and duration of brain stimulation.  
 
5.2.1 Stimulation Location  
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
TMS will be delivered to the right inferior pars triangularis of  the contralesional, right hemisphere 
(part of the inferior frontal gyrus). The stimulation site will be targeted using the Localite  Frameless 
stereotactic system for image -guided TMS research ( Localite GmbH , Bonn , [LOCATION_013] ). This 
system uses infrared reflectors attached to the patient’s head and brain. The stimulating coil is 
similarly co -registered via infrared reflectors to the patient’s head and to the imaging data allowing 
precise control of the stimulation site.  
 
5.2.2 AD Sub -Study Stimulation Location  
TMS will be delivered to the left inferior pars triangularis and to the left posterior superior temporal 
gyrus. The stimulation site will be targeted using the Brainsight frameless stereotactic system for 
image -guided TMS research (Rogue Research, Montreal , Canada). This system uses infrared 
reflectors attached to the patient’s head and brain. The stimulating coil is similarly co -registered 
via infrared reflectors to the patient’s head and to the imaging data allowing precise control of the 
stimulation site .  
 
5.2.3 Stimulation Parameters  
 Our protocol involves repetitive TMS at a frequency of 1 Hz. According to established 
guidelines, the maximum safe duration of single trains of rTMS at 1 Hz using an intensity of 110% 
of MT is “>1800” (that is >30 minutes) (Wassermann, 1998). Working well within these guidelines, 
we will administer 1200 pulses in one session at 1 Hz (20 minutes) at 90% of MT. We note that 
recent evidence suggests that stimulation intensities as high as 120% of MT are safe in stroke 
patients, even when applied directly to t he lesioned hemisphere (61) for a period of 10 days. Our 
protocol calls for stimulation at a relatively lower intensity (90% MT), applied to the undamaged 
hemisphere of the brain, which we feel increases the safety of the study. We also note that the 
stimu lation parameters we propose were employed in our previous clinical trial employing rTMS 
(protocol #805362) in which we had no adverse events.  
 Prior to administering experimental TMS, we will determine the motor threshold (MT) of each 
patient by [CONTACT_349717]. MT will be defined as the 
minimum percentage of machine output required to produce MEPs of at  least [ADDRESS_823537] 5 of 10 consecutive trials at the same location. MT will be determined by [CONTACT_25505] -pulse 
stimulation of the motor cortex subserving the contralesional hand at a suprathreshold level and 
subsequently reducing the percentage of  the machine output until MEPs are not identified. The 
coil will be placed with the handle pointing to the patient’s back at about 45° from the vertical 
position. Following determination of MT, patients will undergo 1 Hz rTMS.  
 The sham TMS group will be treated in the same manner as the experimental group except 
that MT will not be determined for the sham group. Thus, subjects in this group will never receive 
TMS. Sham treatment will employ a sham coil that produces the same so und as the real coil. 
Additionally, surface electrodes will be placed on the scalp, which will simulate the sensation of 
TMS. The sham and real coils will be numbered and the coil used and the MT will be recorded for 
each session.  
 
5.2.4 AD Sub -Study stimulation parameters  
 This protocol involves repetitive TMS at a frequency of 10 Hz.  According to establish 
guidelines , the maximum safe duration of single trains of rTMS at 10 Hz using an intensity of 
110% of MT is >5 seconds ( 106). Working well within these guidelines, we will be administering 
2 second trains at 100% of MT. There will be 30 trains delivered to each of the two stimulation 
locations, with a 30s inter -train interval.  
 Prior to administering experimental TMS, we will determine the motor threshold (MT) of 
each patient by [CONTACT_349717]. MT will be defined as 
the minimum percentage of machine output required to produce MEPs of at least [ADDRESS_823538] 5 of 10 consecutive trials at the same location. MT will be determined by [CONTACT_25505] -pulse 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
stimulation of the motor cortex subserving the contralesional hand at a suprathreshold level and 
subsequently reducing the percentage of the machine output until MEPs are not identified. The 
coil will be placed with the handle pointing to the patient’s bac k at about 45° from the vertical 
position.  Following determination of MT, patients will undergo 10 Hz rTMS.  
The sham TMS group will be treated in the same manner as the experimental group except 
that MT will not be determined for the sham group. Thus, subjects in this group will never receive 
TMS. Sham treatment will employ a sham coil that produces the same sou nd as the real coil. 
Additionally, surface electrodes will be placed on the scalp, which will simulate the sensation of 
TMS. The sham and real coils will be numbered and the coil used and the MT will be recorded for 
each session.  
 
5.2.5 Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT)  
  CILT is a commonly used form of speech therapy. CILT will be delivered immediately after 
TMS to take advantage of the “state -dependent” effects of TMS. In our version of CILT, a 
Speech Pathologist  (or research personnel trained under the supervision of our Speech 
Pathologist) will function as both conversational partner and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -coach. In each session, 
the patient and SLP will start with identical decks of treatment card. Seated across a [ADDRESS_823539] from his/her array, the participant 
will call for its match using a verbal description (e.g., at the HFA level: “throw the ball”).  If the 
description is incorrect or insufficiently precise to specify the target, the SLP will view the 
participant ’s card and supply cues to its description, using the [LOCATION_011] Naming Test cueing 
hierarchy: semantic,  followed by [CONTACT_349718], followed, after ~[ADDRESS_823540]. Once all 6 cards are gone, the next 6 cards will be set up and the protocol 
repeated.  On each trial, the SLP will score ac curacy and type/amount of cuing needed to 
generate the response.    
 Each session will last 60 -90 minutes, depending on the pace of participants’ responses. If a 
person finishes a particular stimulus set in less than [ADDRESS_823541] category.  
 Stimuli for the CILT protocol will include 2 different sets of 48 cards. Each set will contain 12 
exemplars of 4 categories: High Frequency nouns (HFO); Action/Function verbs associated with 
the HFO (HFA); Low Frequency nouns (LFO); Action/Function verbs associated with the LFO 
(LFA).  To avoid biasing performance on the primary outcome measure (WAB), there will be n o 
overlap between the CILT stimuli and the stimuli of the WAB. We will also minimize overlap with 
items on the PNT.  
 The two [ADDRESS_823542] treated and untreated items, as follows. Each set 
will be presented twice in the baseline sessions (see Fig. 1), with participants scored on their 
ability to name [CONTACT_349740] a sentence. Phonem ic, semantic, self -correction, 
and no response errors will be coded from audio transcripts. If accuracy on one or more 
categories varies substantially between the sets (i.e. greater than 20% difference) the sets will 
be redistributed to match accuracy and,  to the degree possible, error type. One set will be used 
for the treatment phase of the study; the other will be untreated and will provide a measure of 
generalization.  
 Scores  on the pre -treatment baselines will be used to set the starting point for CILT  
treatment, using an 80% criterion. For example, if the participant’s baseline performance is > 
80% accurate for HFO production but < 80% for HFA, then treatment will begin at the level of 
HFA and will remain at this level of difficulty until the 80% is me t in two successive sessions.  
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823543] (SLP) and the 
individuals administering and scoring the language measur es will not be present for the 
administration of TMS and will be blinded with respect to subject assignment. In the case of an 
adverse event, the blind may be broken if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_110249].

6.[ADDRESS_823551] Withdrawal  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time if they no longer wish to participate. 
Additionally, patients may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion date for 
a number of reasons:  
1) Any adverse outcome or event which may represent a possible health risk to the patient  
2) Failure of the patient to adhere to protocol requirements  
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
3) Worsening of motor strength, language abilities, or worsening cognition or mood.  
Abrupt discontinuation of TMS is not associated with rebound effects or other adverse outcomes, 
so no alternative treatment or transitional therapy will be required if patient discontinue the 
protocol.

and 6 months after the completion of TMS: (1) The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB: 1 21) 
samples a number of different language functions and generates a summary score between 0 -
100 (Aphasia Quotient, AQ), interpretable as general aphasia severity. The WAB will be 
administered on two occasions prior to treatment to obtain a stable baseline. (2) The 
Philadelphia Naming Test  (PNT) is a [ADDRESS_823555] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]) naming designed 
to measure retrieval of known words. Computational models have been developed that relate an 
individual’s performance on the PNT (accuracy and error breakdown) to the integrity of semanti c 
and phonological stages of naming (3 8, 136), thus producing a psycholinguistic diagnosis of the 
word production impairment. (3) Word and non -word repetition tests from the Moss 
Psycholinguistic Aphasia Database (MA[COMPANY_003]; 77) will be used to further assess lexical and post -
lexical phonological encodi ng (31, 89). Word repetition will also be used to quantify instances of 
consonant distortion, prosodic alteration, and other features of speech apraxia (e.g., 105, 115). 
(4) The Pyramids and Palm Trees test (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_349682]; 5 2) will be used to assess core 
semantic memory. (5)  The Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia  (144) will be 
administered to assess  changes in quality of communication in daily life.   (6) Narrative discourse 
as an indicator of functional communication will be assessed with the Cinderella story ( 145, 
146). (7) Finally, 2 pre -treatment baselines will be obtained on the stimuli used for CILT. We 
note that the baseline sessions (T1 and T2, Figure 2) may require more than one day to 
complete; the entire series of baseline sessions (T1, T2 and T3) will be completed  in [ADDRESS_823556] (108), which has been shown to be sensitive to 
dysfunction of the right prefrontal cortex.  
 
  
 While there has been research on the effects of TMS on motor recovery for patients with 
stroke -induced hemiparesis, we do not expect our stimulation location to have an effect on 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823557], 5th and 
10th day of treatment, and at the 3 -month and 6 -month follow up.  
 
7.5.1 Specific Measurements for the AD Sub -Study  
 
 Subjects in the AD sub -study will undergo the same battery of language and cognitive 
tasks as those in the Aphasia study, with the addition of the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) ( 147), which will be used to assess attention, 
language and visuospatial/constructional abilities, as well as immediate and delayed memory. 
Semantic fluency will be assessed by [CONTACT_349720] [ADDRESS_823558]. Saliva samples will be collected with an OG -100 
Oragene collection kit (DNA Genotek, Ontario, Canada), and DNA will be extracted using 
standard methodology. All subjects that consent to have genetic samples taken will have marked 
on their consent form that they consent to the collection and storage of their genetic sample; they 
will be assigned a separate coded identification number.  Saliva samples will be de -identified and 
transported to the Penn Genom ic Analysis Core for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Storage of DNA will be conducted in the lab. DNA samples will not become part of the clinical 
record and will not be made available for commercial use. Identifiers for the DNA samples will not 
be directly traceable to any name, but rather to another coding  system. The second coding system 
will be used to link behavioral and neurophysiologic outcomes. There are no known risks involved 
in saliva collection.  
 
Once the study is complete, all samples will be destroyed.  
 
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_823559] for each TMS session.  
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823560] experience.  In 
previous treatment studies involving TMS (e.g., 7 6) and tDCS (11 9) we have had very low 
attrition; we attribute this to the fact that PWA are often very motivated by [CONTACT_349721] a study with potential benefit.  
 Subjects (or will be allocated to TMS and CILT  and sham TMS and CILT  in a 2:1 ratio. 
Assuming a type I error rate of α=0.05, we will have 80% power to detect a difference in mean 
change of 0.[ADDRESS_823561] at 6 months. A 2:1 ratio 
was selected to provide more information about outco mes among patients randomized to 
TMS+ CILT  and as an incentive to recruitment since prospective participants are more likely to 
enroll in sham -controlled trials when the probability of receiving active treatment is greater. 
Efficiency loss associated with u nequal allocation is minimal, amounting to an additional 6 
participants required relative to 1:1 randomization for our design. Maher et al. (unpublished) 
report a standard deviation of change in the WAB AQ of 5.7 points in groups treated with 
Constraint In duced Language Therapy (see below). Assuming that our patients are similar, we 
are powered to detect a difference of 4 points in mean change in the WAB A Q between 
TMS+CILT and sham TMS+CI LT arms. Note that our assumed effect size of 0.7 is 
conservative; Re n et al. (103) reported a Standard Difference of Means (a measure of effect 
size) of 1.26 for the general measure of severity of impairment (e.g., BDAE, Aachen Aphasia 
Test) based on a meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_823562] smaller effects . 
 
8.3.1 AD Sub -Study Sample Size and Power Determination  
 Given the time and budget constraints that characterize a supplement, we propose to recruit 
to achieve an ultimate sample size of 30 ; given our historical attrition rate, we expect attrition of 
approximately 15%. The 30 subjects will be allocated to TMS + SLT and sham TMS + SLT in a 
2:1 ratio, as this will provide more information about the effects of TMS and SLT and will serve 
as an i ncentive to recruitment. As noted above, loss of efficiency associated with unequal 
allocation is minimal relative to a 1:[ADDRESS_823563] no preliminary data on the basis of which to calculate power. We note, however, 
that the meta analysis of Chen et al. ( 152) found a “moderate” effect size for TMS treatment for 
cognitive function in subjects with AD. We also note that Lee et al. ( 164) found a significant 
group effect favoring the TMS group in a study of 27 subjects with mild -moderate AD treated for 
impaired cognition with TMS or sham TMS and randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_823564] size that wil l inform sample determination for future trials.  
 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823565] to missing data under the missing at random (MAR) assumption and 
sphericity assumptions. The primary outcome model will include change from baseline on the 
WAB AQ as the response a nd intervention, assessment end -point, and the interaction of 
intervention and end -point as fixed effects. The model will also include the baseline WAB AQ 
score as a predictor to increase efficiency and account for baseline imbalances in aphasia 
severity. A random intercept and end -point slope will be included to reflect between -subject 
heterogeneity in changes in WAB AQ scores. To examine possible bias in estimated intervention 
effects due to data missing not at random, sensitivity analyses, such as shared  parameter and 
pattern mixture models, will be used. Secondary analyses will adjust for covariates that are 
imbalanced between intervention arms as well as demographic and clinical variables such as age, 
history of depression, lesion size, aphasia type, ge nder, and aphasia severity. In an exploratory 
analysis, we will evaluate whether there is a direct treatment effect on the WAB AQ that is not 
mediated by [CONTACT_349722] (67).  
   
 The statistical modeling of the secondary outcome (PNT) will involve similar analyses, but with 
items and participants modeled as random effects. Item -level response types will be analyzed 
separately (e.g., correct vs. incorrect; semantic error versus oth er response, etc.) to allow for 
determination of intervention effects specific to response type.  
 
8.4.2  Identifying Predictors of Treatment Response  
 As in our primary analyses, we will use Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM) to identify the strongest 
clinical/linguistic predictors of response to TMS+CILT as compared to sham TMS+CILT from 
among variables like chronicity, severity, gender, depression severity, n aming accuracy, apraxia 
of speech, core semantics, and sentence processing. Although we will be underpowered for 
formal tests of interaction given our moderate sample size, we will refit our primary endpoint model 
by [CONTACT_349723]. We expect that these analyses will 
illuminate the clinical/linguistic predictors of treatment response, thereby [CONTACT_349724] “target 
population” for a future Phase 3 clinical trial.    
 
Network Neuroscience measures of response to TMS+SLT  
 Subjects who can undergo MRI will have studies obtained prior to treatment and at [ADDRESS_823566] treatment BOLD fMRI data. We will use both the AAL  (132) and Glasser et al. 
(40) parcellations and subject -specific lesion masks to exclude lesioned areas prior to atlas 
registration within each subject. Then, we will extract time series data from each region following 
modern preprocessing practices desi gned to reduce the influence of motion on BOLD time series 
(24). Across all pairs of region time series, we will compute wavelet coherence, which is well -
suited for non -stationary data such as BOLD fMRI (128), to construct an adjacency matrix A that 
repres ents the pairwise coherence across all regions within the frequency band 0.01 to 0.10 Hz, 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823567] to physiological noise and evinces reliable functional network organization (44). 
We will constrain our analysis to the functional connections observed among regions identified to 
be involved in language processing (34) and their homotopic regions. Within each subject, we will 
compute a within -subjects t -test for elements (connections) in A 3 (final timepoint) versus A 1 
(baseline)  in the language and homotopic systems corrected for multiple corrections using a false 
discovery rate correction with a nominal corrected p -value of 0.05. This will allow us to detect the 
connections most modified by [CONTACT_349725] 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_823568] Population(s) for Analysis  
 The subject population that will be subj ect to analysis will be the randomized population. 
Subjects that are non -compliant with treatment will be encouraged to continue with follow -up and 
these measurements will be enter into analysis (see 8.4.1 for details on the analysis of non -
compliant subjects)  
9 Safety and Adverse Events  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Inter -current illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events 
if the abnormality:  
● results in study withdrawal  
● is associated with a serious adverse event  
● is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
● leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
● is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
 
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that is:  
● fatal 
● life-threatening  
● requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
● results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
● an important medical event  
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823569] with the patient, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will 
be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event 
module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the 
study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious  adverse events that are still ongoing at 
the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
study treatment or stud y participation will be re corded and reported immediately to the chair of 
the DSMB.   
9.[ADDRESS_823570]. Based on his expertise with TMS, he will make a determination about the 
relationship of the adverse event to the study procedures.  
 
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
9.4.1  Follow -up report  
 If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new 
or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to 
the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE s are followed until either resolved 
or stable.  
9.4.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
 A serious adverse event will  be reported to the IRB and chair of the DSMB  by [CONTACT_16470] 
24 hours of the event.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator 
and faxed to the IRB  within 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file 
at the study site.   
 
At the time of the initial report, the following information should be provided:  
● Study identifier  
● Study Center  
● Subject number  
● A description of the event  
● Date of onset  
● Current status  ● Whether study treatment was 
discontinued  
● The reason why the event is 
classified as serious  
● Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event and 
study treatment  
 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823571] the understanding of the 
event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events will be provided promptly 
to the IRB and chair of the DSMB . 
9.4.3  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow -up information) will b e submitted to the 
IRB within 10  working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_102182] h report and documentation of DSMB /IRB notification 
and receipt will be kept in the Clinical Investigator’s binder.  
 
9.5 Unblinding Procedures  
 Patients will be told  which treatment (real TMS+CILT vs. sham TMS+CILT) they received at 
the completion of the entire study.  If a serious adverse event should occur, the patient will be 
unblended unbli nded.  
9.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] s 
 The trial may be stopped for safety concerns or poor study performance, including failure to 
recruit and/or retain subjects. Subjects who report significant discomfort from TMS, seizure, or 
worsening of language or cognition during TMS will remain in the study with tre atment 
discontinuation. Two sources of information about short -term adverse effects of TMS on language 
function will be available. First, subjects and family will be asked if they see evidence of 
deterioration in language or other faculties e ach day they return for TMS. Second, the SLP will 
see the subject during each treatment session. S/he will be instructed to inform the PI [CONTACT_39646] s/he 
observes a clinically significant worsening in language function. If the SLP is concerned, the WAB 
will be rep eated. If this supports a decline from baseline (operationally defined as more than 5 
points below baseline), the adverse effect will be reported and the subject will be withdrawn from 
treatment. In order to support the intention -to-treat analysis, all suc h subjects will be strongly 
encouraged to continue follow -up. 
 
9.7 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as 
noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of  a site data and safety -monitoring 
plan.  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.  
 
9.7.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A committee of three investigators with experience with non -invasive brain stimulation will 
serve as the Data and Safet y Monitoring Committee. The DSMB  will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_135] 6 
months to review study progress and discuss any adverse events. The BAC group, under the 
guidance of the faculty statisticians, will provide safety reports every six months to this monitor 
and the PI. These reports will be bl inded as to treatment assignment, unless unblinding for 
individual events is requested by [CONTACT_2037]. Al l SAEs will also be reported to the IRB.  
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823572] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
● What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
● Who will have access to that information and why  
● Who will use or disclose that information  
● The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
PHI (see below) as well as data from the studies to be performed dur ing the study will be kept in an 
institutionally secured server or in a locked cabinet.  
 
The following protected health information (PHI) will be collected : name, age, contact [CONTACT_3031] (including 
telephone number), PMH (including information regarding the participant’s stroke), SSN , as well as 
demographic information and results of neuroimaging.   
  
[CONTACT_349744] and the research team conducting the study will have access to the subject’ s PHI as well as 
data generated during the study. I nformation contained in publications and presentations will be de -
identified. The Institutional Review Board (IRB ) as well as the FDA and NIDCD may access information  
regarding participants should they desire.  Although we will strive to protect the privacy of participants, we 
cannot guarantee absolute privacy.  
 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_68938] [INVESTIGATOR_349683]. Subjects 
will be referred from multiple sources including colleagues at MossRehab Research Institute, Temple 
University, and UPHS physicians. Only subje cts who have indicated their willingness to consider 
participating in the study or learn about the study will be contact[CONTACT_68938]. Most potential subjects will be 
contact[CONTACT_68938] [INVESTIGATOR_349684].  
 
Subjects will interact with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_349685], during the testing before and after the treatment as well as during the administration of TMS and 
CILT.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization t o collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_823573] of the information will take the 
form of computer files; these will be de -identifi ed by [CONTACT_2329] a coding process under which subjects are 
identified by [CONTACT_277767].  These files will be stored on an institutionally secured and 
managed device or server.  Participants will be voice and video recorded  during baseline testing, CIILT 
treatment, and follow -up testing  for the purposes of data analysis. Audio recordings will be transcribed and 
be saved on password -protected computers. Video recordings will be stored in an encrypted drive to be 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
used by [CONTACT_349726]. All audio and video data will be stored on School 
of Medicine managed and secured computer devices.  
 
10.3 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_823574].  These documents should be retained for a longer period 
if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the resp onsibility of the sponsor to 
inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
11 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
11.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
As noted above, a DSMB  consisting of 3 members will be established and will meet with 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_135] 6 months  
 
11.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups 
of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory d ocuments, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_16478].  
12 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the IRB in agreement with local legal 
prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the 
conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator an d a copy of this decision will be 
provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study.  
 
All patients for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for patients to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_271490]. The formal consent of a patient, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before that patient is submitted to any study procedure. This consent form will be signed 
by [CONTACT_349727], and the investigator -designated research 
professional obtaining the consent.  
12.1 Risks  
 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
12.1.1 Potential Risks  
 Potential risks of the behavioral and motor tasks  are minimal and easily addressed (see 
below).  The major risk associated with genetic testing is a loss of confidentiality.  
 There are well -known but rarely encountered risks from brain imaging with MRI and CT , or 
standard X -Ray exams . For the former, the risks include contrast administration (not relevant 
here), dislodging a metal object in the patient, interfering with an implanted device (e.g., 
pacemaker) and moving metallic objects in the scanner room. Protocols to deal with these issues 
are described below. The major risk from CT  or X-rays is exposure to small amounts of ionizing 
radiation.  
 A variety of potential risks from repetitive TMS , including daily TMS administrations,  have 
been identified (see 106 for a recent review); these include the following:  
 1. Seizures : Seizure induction represents the most serious known risk of TMS. The risk of 
seizures is quite low in subjects receiving single pulse TMS. Based on an extensive review of the 
literature, guidelines have been developed that specify the number of stimulati ons that may safely 
be given as a function of stimulus intensity (% of Motor Evoked Potential) and frequency of 
stimulation (138; see also Rossi et al, 2009). Using these guidelines there have been no published 
reports of seizures or evidence o f after -discharge or spread of excitation in normal subjects 
receiving low -frequency repetitive TMS. We will adhere to the published guidelines.  
 It is plausible that a TMS -induced seizure could adversely affect a patient’s ability to obtain 
health insurance, obtain or retain a driver’s license, or obtain or retain employment. For example, 
physicians in the state of Pennsylvania are required to report patients who have experienced 
seizures to the Department of Transportation. Because se izures induced by [CONTACT_349728][INVESTIGATOR_349686], patients 
who have a seizure due to TMS would presumably be considered exempt from the restrictions on 
driving that the Departmen t of Transportation sometimes enforces on other seizure patients. If 
such a problem were to arise, [CONTACT_349744] or Hamilton would contact [CONTACT_349729], 
explain the circumstances under which the patient experienced a provoked seizure, and exp ress 
our professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_160781] a single TMS -induced seizure does not put a patient at significantly 
higher risk for spontaneous future events.  Patients will also be provided with a letter stating that 
their seizure was experimentally induced. We canno t, however, guarantee patients that our 
advocacy on their behalf will convince employers, insurers, or other organizations that they are 
not at risk for future seizures.  
 2. Effects on Cognition : A number of studies have attempted to identify adverse 
neuropsychological consequences of TMS. Several such studies demonstrated a trend for 
performance to be better on cognitive measures after TMS (see 43). Two studies demonstrated 
minor adverse effects  of TMS lasting up to one hour (Greenberg et al [cited in 128]; 36). Both 
studies, however, employed involved rapid repetitive TMS with stimulus parameters that would 
no longer be considered acceptable in light of current guidelines . 
 3. Effects on Mood : Dysphoria with crying has been induced after left prefrontal stimulation 
(92). In contrast, high frequency stimulation of right prefrontal cortex  may transiently improve 
mood. TMS has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment in patients with depression that 
was unresponsive to other types of treatment. There are no reports of lasting changes of mood 
after single pulse  or low frequencyTMS.  
 4. Effects on Hearing and Tinnitus : Animals have shown permanent increases of the auditory 
threshold after single pulse TMS (28) and humans have shown transient increases. Foam 
earplugs were effective in avoiding changes in the auditory threshold in a safety study of TMS 
(94). There has be en one report of a subject who reported permanent hearing loss from TMS 
after a study in which his foam earplug became dislodged (142). In response to this, we altered 
our Informed Consent Form to list this as a possible adverse effect and stress to subjects that 
they should notify the investigators so that the study can be halted if an earplug becomes loose 
of dislodged. We will also stop stimulation at the 10 minute mark to check that the earplugs are 
 
V11  10/17/[ADDRESS_823575] had no 
complaints regarding hearing loss. Pascual -Leone (personal communication) noted that tinnitus 
increased in one subject who received TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that tinnitus 
recurred in a second subject after a three -year absence with stimulation to the same location. 
Because of these concerns, no subject with tinnitus will be inc luded in the investigations.  
 5. Scalp Burns : Rapid rate and high stimulus intensity TMS may cause the coil to heat 
resulting in scalp burns. The MagVenture  stimulator that we use incorporates a temperature 
sensor in the coil and will cease operation should the coil exceed 140°. An air -cooled coil is used 
in our lab for TMS studies.  
 6. Neck Pain and Headache :  Head and neck pain related to stimulation of underlying muscle 
and nerves occurs in approximately 10% of subjects. The incidence and severity is a function of 
stimulus site and intensity but is most common over fronto -temporal regions. The symptoms are 
self-limited and usually treated with minor analgesics.  
 7. Histotoxicity : Studies from animals as well as study of subsequently resected anterior 
temporal lobes of humans subjected to direct cortical stimulation or TMS have failed to 
demonstrate evidence of histotoxicity. For reasons reviewed by [CONTACT_349730] (139), there appears 
to be very little likelihood of this.  
 8. Kindling : Kindling is a process by [CONTACT_349731] a progressive intensification of induced neuroelectrical activity resulting in a 
seizure. This has not been reported with TMS and appears unlikely fo r several reasons. Kindling 
is most readily obtained with high rate repetitive stimulation (e.g., 60 Hz), requires pulse duration 
of 1 ms (longer than that of TMS) and is easiest to produce in the amygdala and hippocampus. 
Kindling of neocortex  in animal models of epi[INVESTIGATOR_349687]. There is no evidence 
that kindling can be produced by [CONTACT_7712].  
 9. Exposure to Magnetic Fields : The maximal field strength generated by [CONTACT_349732] 2 Tesla 
range. The field is induced for a brief period only and the strength of the field falls off rapi[INVESTIGATOR_349688]. There is no evidence of adverse effects from magnetic field exposure 
during TM S.  
 
 As the proposed studies involve TMS to subjects with brain lesions it is important to note 
that TMS has been used extensively in subjects with brain pathology since the 1990s (e.g., 26). 
Significant adverse effects in subjects with stroke are rare. For ex ample, Hoyer and Celnik (53) 
reviewed studies in which TMS was administered to either the lesioned (13 studies) or 
contralesional (12 studies) hemisphere for treatment of hemiparesis. No significant adverse 
effects were reported in these studies; in many o f the studies (e.g., 61), TMS was administered 
with high frequency stimulation over the lesioned hemisphere, a procedure that is generally 
considered to be more likely to be associated with adverse effects than the 1 Hz stimulation we 
propose.  
 Also of relevance is that rTMS has been administered for the treatment of aphasia to over 
250 subjects in more than 20 studies, including studies done at Penn by [CONTACT_27156]; while most 
studies involved 1 Hz stimulation over the contralesional hemisphere (as we will be doing), 
several  studies employed more aggressive procedures such as high frequency repetitive 
stimulation over the lesioned hemisphere (e.g., 62; 126). No significant side -effects were 
reported in any of the studies , including studies where TM S was administered in 10 daily 
sessions ; furthermore, there is no report of an aphasic subject withdrawing from a study 
because of adverse effects. Thus, on the basis of data reported to date, we believe that the 
procedures to be employed in this study are safe in subjects with stroke and aphas ia. 
 Under the AD Sub -Study, the decision to stimulate at [ADDRESS_823576] that 
several studies demonstrating benefit on the ADAS -Cog in subjects with AD employed this 
frequency ( e.g., 149, 150, 164, 170, 171 ). We note that the stimulation parameters that we 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
propose are within the guidelines proposed by [CONTACT_291339]. ( 106). Rapid repetitive TMS of the 
type that we propose to employ has been used in at least 11 studies with subjects with 
Alzheimer Disease; no seizures or other major adverse events have been reported.  
 Finally, we note that TMS with normal subjects and subjects with stroke (e.g., protocol 
#826841) has been considered to be non -significant risk at Penn.  
 
 
 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_823577] Risks  
 Behavioral and Motor Tasks : To protect against fatigue subjects will be permitted to rest or 
discontinue testing at any time. Should subjects appear to be made anxious by [CONTACT_349733], testing 
will be terminated. Subjects will be told that they are free to withdraw from the testing at  any time. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_349689] 30 years of work with brain -lesion subjects.  
 
 Genetic Testing:  See the above “Genetic Testing” section  
 
 Brain Imaging : No contrast agents will be administered. The major risk from MRI is that the 
strong magnetic field will dislodge a metallic object inside the subject’s body (e.g., aneurysm clip) 
or interfere with an implanted device (e.g., cardiac pacemaker). Standard p rotocols have been 
developed at the University of Pennsylvania to ensure that subjects at risk do not undergo an MRI 
scan. This protocol includes an extensive checklist that is completed by [CONTACT_349734]; additionally, the MRI technician interviews subjects prior to entering the MRI suite. A 
second potential concern comes from loose metallic objects in the MRI suite that can serve as 
missiles if they are drawn to a powerful magnet. Metallic objects that are not secured to the fl oor 
or wall are not permitted in the MRI suite. We note that these procedures have been employed in 
the clinical and research settings at the University of Pennsylvania for many years; no adverse 
effects from MRI scanning have been experienced to date. Sub jects who are or think they might 
be pregnant will be excluded because the safety of MRI in pregnancy has not been established. 
The major risk from CAT scan is a small dose of ionizing radiation. This procedure has been 
approved by [CONTACT_349735] s will be asked to sign a consent form in which the potential 
risks are discussed.  
 
 TMS: The following steps will be taken to minimize risks from TMS identified above.  
 1. We will use train durations and stimulus intensities that fall within the guidelines 
recommended by [CONTACT_349736] (see 127).  
 2. Subjects will be monitored during and after TMS stimulation for involuntary movements that 
could represent focal motor seizures. Should suspi[INVESTIGATOR_349690] a change 
in level of responsiveness occur, the session will be terminated a nd the subject withdrawn from 
the study.  
 3. A physician  will be available by [CONTACT_349737] -finding and whenever TMS is being 
delivered.  
 4. All subjects will wear foam earplugs during testing sessions.  
 5. In the unlikely event that a seizure is observed, the subject will be evaluated by a physician  
within minutes.  In the entire experience with TMS throughout the world, we are unaware of any 
reports if seizures that were not self -limited; because of this we do not anticipate giving 
medications . In the event of a seizure, s ubjects will be asked to undergo an EEG and a MRI scan 
and may be asked to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349691].

12.2 Benefits  
 The objective of the study is to determine if TMS paired with CILT improves chronic aphasia;  
subjects randomized to the TMS+ CILT treatment group may benefit from the treatment. We note 
that the study is also potentially of benefit to those who randomize to the sham TMS +CILT  group 
as they will receive two weeks of CILT, an accepted form of speech therapy for which there is 
evidence of efficacy. The study is also of potential benefit to other subjects with chronic aphasia 
as it may identify an effective ther apy for this disabling condition.  
 
12.3 AD Sub -Study Benefits  
 
The objective of the sub-study is to determine if TMS paired with CILT improves verbal communication 
in AD; subjects randomized to the TMS+CILT treatment group may benefit from the treatment. We note 
that the study is also potentially of benefit to those who randomize to the sham TMS+CILT group as they 
will receive two weeks of CILT, an accepted form of speech therapy for which there is evidence of efficacy. 
The study is also of potential benefit to other subjects with AD as it may identify an effective the rapy for 
impaired verbal communication.  
 
12.4 Risk Benefit Assessment  
We believe that the investigations are likely to demonstrate that TMS in conjunction with 
CILT is beneficial for the treatment of chronic aphasia. The studies, therefore, are important as 
they are likely to provide evidence of efficacy for a new approach t o the treatment of chronic 
aphasia.  We believe that the potential scientific and clinical value of the information to be obtained 
justifies the small risk of the investigations.  
 
12.5 AD Sub -Study Risk Benefit Assessment  
We believe that the investigations are likely to demonstrate that TMS in conjunction with 
CILT is beneficial for the treatment of impaired verbal communication in AD. The sub -study, 
therefore, is important as it is likely to provide evidence of efficacy fo r a new approach to the 
treatment of impaired verbal communication in AD.  We believe that the potential scientific and 
clinical value of the information to be obtained justifies the small risk of the investigations.  
 
12.6 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
All subjects will be provided a consent form describing the study providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. The 
nature and goals of the proposed research will be explained to the sub jects and, as appropriate, 
to their families. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be 
obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure. The subject must sign the consent 
form to participate. The Principal Inv estigator or study staff obtaining consent will additionally sign 
the form. Subjects will be consented by [CONTACT_34355], or appropriate designee, 
in a room we have selected in which to perform consent, which is located outside of the cli nic. 
Potential subjects will review the consent form in detail with the person designated to consent and 
have the ability to take the consent home for further review. We note that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_349692] [ADDRESS_823578] informed remote consent via 
 
V11  10/17/23    
 
Bluejeans. The consent form will be provided through RedCAP survey webpage, and may also 
be shared as a pdf. The video call will involve identification of the participants of the call, and then 
will move into a full review of the IRB -approved consent form by [CONTACT_349738] 
[INVESTIGATOR_179167]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_349693]. The participant will then provide an e -signature [CONTACT_349741]; the document will then 
also be e -signed b y the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_265791].

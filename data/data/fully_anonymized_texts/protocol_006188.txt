Statistical Analysis Plan  for Navigator Study : [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 
Sample Size Calculation and Recruitment : In order to expand the generalizability of this 
research,  we have elected to investigate the efficacy of patient navigation in both Appalachian 
and non- Appalachian subjects. Non- adherence is a significant problem throughout Kentucky, 
but more problematic in Appalachia, so we propose to assess the efficacy of a pa tient navigator 
in two strata of the same clinical trial (Appalachian and non-Appalachian populations). We have 
found non -adherence to obtain diagnostic testing after failed infant  hearing screen in 27% and 
15% of Appalachian and non- Appalachian children, respectively. [ADDRESS_1083245] the navigator program to 
decrease nonadherence  to 12% and 6% in the Appalachian and non- Appalachian populations , 
respectively. In order to have 80% power when carrying out a one- tailed Cochran- Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test at the 0.05 significance level,  we need 226 subjects, 90 (40%) of whom 
are from the Appalachian population. We expect that participants  may leave the study if they 
chose to obtain their child’ s diagnostic testing at another facility outside [LOCATION_006];  therefore, we have 
allowed for a 20% dropout rate. The goal total sample size is 284 participants (114 fro m the  
Appalachian population). During 2009 -2011, there were 6,739 live births and 258 failed 
screening tests for a 3.8% failure rate at the University of Kentucky. We will also recruit children 
who fail newborn hearing screens  that are born in other regional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787317]. Our institution has  the highest volume of follow -up infant diagnostic 
tests after a failed screening test for our region. During 2009-  2011 26,296 live births occurred in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122577] a 50- mile radius of Lexington with a total of 626 failed newborn hearing screens 
(2.4% failure rate).

Pediatric hearing loss is the most common neonatal sensory disorder in the [LOCATION_002] with an 
incidence of approximately 1 per 1000 births. The sense of hearing is vital during the early years of 
life for the development of speech, langua ge, and cognition. Deafness in early childhood can result 
in lifelong learning delay and disability; however, early identification and intervention can prevent educational and social consequences. Universal newborn hearing screening programs in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787318], including Kentucky, and help in early identification and 
timely intervention for children born with hearing loss; however, newborn hearing screening is a significant undertaking. This screening does not involve simple blood work, but involves the use of 
an objective electrophysiological evaluation of the auditory system through the use of an automated 
auditory brainstem response (AABR) and/or the evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAE) measures . 
Newborns that fail their heari ng screening or high -risk children undergo an audiological diagnostic 
assessment following discharge and depending on the tests results may have serial assessments with subsequent appropriate intervention. Intervention may include fitting with hearing aids  or 
possibly cochlear implantation. Although high -risk children may undergo periodic audiological 
assessment, issues such as compliance, socioeconomic factors, and access to care remain major 
barriers to early identification and subsequent intervention. The consequences of delayed diagnosis 
and/or failure for appropriate intervention for infants with hearing loss can be significant delay in 
language, cognitive, and social development. This may lead to adulthood challenges in education 
and employment. In order to identify newborn hearing loss, hearing screening has become a 
mandatory component of post -natal care for infants. Mandatory newborn hearing has been 
recommended by [CONTACT_7681], Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH), and 
the A merican Academy of Pediatrics. The JCIH has established the gold standard of infant 
screening, follow -up, and intervention and serves as the standard for this study. To summarize the 
current recommendations, infants are to be screened for hearing loss in t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787319]. If one or both ears fail the testing, an audiologist then 
performs a complete diagnostic evaluation. A diagnosis of hearing loss should be made before [ADDRESS_1083246] of a patient navigator to influence patient satisfaction, patient/family behavior and the age 
of diagnosis  of pediatric hearing loss
 
2. Objectives:   
Hypothesis: The assistance of a patient navigator for families with a newborn who failed a 
newborn hearing -screening test will result in improved patient compliance, patient 
satisfaction, and age of diagnosis and intervention of pediatric hearing loss.  
Specific Aim 1: Examine the effect of a patient navigator to influence the age of diagnosis 
and intervention for pediatric hearing loss.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Examine the effect of a patient navigator to influence patient satisfaction, 
knowledge, and compliance with the hearing evaluation and intervention process following 
newborn hearing screening.

For Specific Aim 1, mothers of newborns failing birth hearing screening will be recruited. Participants 
will be placed into Appalachian and non- Appalachian stratum and then ra ndomized into a patient 
navigator group or the standard of care group. The navigator group will receive an intervention 
consisting of educational support from a patient navigator. We will compare the non- adherence rates to 
obtain the recommended testing wi thin [ADDRESS_1083247] data on maternal socioeconomic status, educational level, and distance from testing center and infant  health. 
Findings will be correlated with adherence to follow -up and timing of services.   If the child receives 
follow up before 3 months and it is determined that child has hearing loss he or she will be  approached 
by a research staff member  to participat e in the second part of the study  (Aim 2) to be  randomized and 
either followed for one year  by [CONTACT_787332].  
 
For Specific Aim 2, mothers of newborns will also be recruited and randomized to navigator vs. no 
navigator, but this Aim focuses on the diagnosis of hearing loss after the child has had two failed 
outpatient audiological tests.  At the time of hearing loss diagnosis, these participants will be stratified 
and then randomized similar to Aim [ADDRESS_1083248] the navigator  (STANDARD PRACTICE) .  
 
 
4. Study Population  and Subj ect Recruitment Methods and Privacy :   
 
Specific Aim 1:   This portion of the study will involve infants born at the Univer sity of Kentucky Medical 
Center,  infants born at outside facilities and their  families  (that are referred to [LOCATION_006]MC Audiology Clinic 
for follow -up testing) , and infants and families that are referred to the Commission for Children with 
Special Health Care Needs (CCSHCN) for follow -up testing.  Children that are born at [LOCATION_006] undergo 
newborn hearing screening using a test called ALGO. This test  is performed on infants who are older 
than [ADDRESS_1083249] are listed as “PASS” or “REFER.” When a child has a 
“REFER” result then the postpartum nurses or clerk calls the [LOCATION_006] ENT clinic (the office of the PI) prior to 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787320] a diagnostic hearing t est as standard practice. At that point, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_787321].  
 
The subjects  who have a child born at [LOCATION_006]MC  are approached by a  study representative, who physically 
goes to the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787322] . The parents of the child with a failed 
hearing test will be given a letter ( see attached) regarding the research project at the time the results 
are communicated and will be notified that a member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_787333]. Once this  phone call is made to the PI’s office, a member of the research staff will go to the 
inpatient room in the postpartum ward of [LOCATION_006]MC to discuss the study and go over the informed consent/HIPAA documents.  If they decline to be in the study then they will tell the study representative 
at the time that they present the study in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787323]. They 
will be verbally reassured that their participation or lack t hereof will have no bearing on their or their 
child’s care.  
 
The subjects who are discharged at other facilities  will receive telephone contact [CONTACT_787334][INVESTIGATOR_787324] s the [LOCATION_006] Otolaryngology Clinic for outpatient testing follow up . The 
CCSHCN staff will also contact [CONTACT_787335] a potentially eligible subject has an appointment with them for outpatient follow up testing.  The research team  will contact [CONTACT_787336] , providing customer service to 
patients and providing a secondary understanding of appointment dates and times .  At that point, the 
mothers will be asked if they would like to participate in a research study regarding patient navigation

consented by [CONTACT_648]  (see verbal consent form).  If they decline to be in the study then they will tell the 
study staff member  at the time that they pr esent the study by [CONTACT_787337]. They will be verbally reassured that their participation or lack thereof will have no bearing on 
their or their child’s care.   
  
For either group in Aim 1 t here will be no discrimination on age, gender, or ethnicity; however, the 
parents must be able to speak English or Spanish,  as that will be the primary means of communicating 
with the patient navigator. We expect to enroll approximately 284 subjects in this portion of the study  
(enrollment  should last about 2 years) . 
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Identify parents  of children who are born at [LOCATION_006]MC in the postpartum ward following 
mandatory newborn hearing screening , or parents whose children are receiving follow up 
testing (due to referral after manda tory newborn hearing screening) at [LOCATION_006] Audiology or the 
Commission for Children with Special Health Care Needs  
2. Children must be born after [ADDRESS_1083251] definitive hearing testing performed  
5. Parents are willing to be contact[CONTACT_787338]/or navigator to monitor progress and testing outcomes  
6. Parents must be able to speak English or Spanish as the navigator will be speaking one of 
these languages  and this will be  the primary means of communication over the phone.  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Children who pass their newborn hearing screen  
2. Children who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787325] [ADDRESS_1083252] year of life.  
4. Children in the NICU  for an extended period of time (they often are delayed in getting their 
ALGO and subsequent testing)  
 
Specific Aim 2:  This segment of the study is evaluating all participa nts from Aim [ADDRESS_1083253] to confirm 
hearing loss.  At that point, the research  team  will be notified that child has met criteria for the second 
part of the study and parent(s) will be approached with information about the study or will be contact[CONTACT_787339] n verbal consent  
and sign  consent or provide verbal  if they choose to participate.  
 The parents will be verbally reassured that their participation or lack thereof will have no bearing on 
their or their child’s care.  The children who enroll in Aim [ADDRESS_1083254] to enroll 62 subjects, with 31 children from the Aim 1 enrollment and 31 from identified clinic 
patients who are seen in the Audiology clinic for follow up hearing tests.   For this Aim there again will 
be no discrimination on age, gender, or ethnicity; however, the parent s must be able to speak English  
or Spanish,  as that will be the  primary means of communicat ing with the patient navigator.   
Patients who previously received navigation in Aim 1 will also be approached by a research staff 
member after a hearing loss diagnosis is given. These patients will also be consented again for Aim

time. This group of patients will also be followed in the study for 12 months .    
 
5. Informed Consent Process :   
Aim 1:  At the time of the failed ALGO test, the nurse administering the test will give a n information 
letter to the parents of the child who fails the newborn hearing test. As standard practice, the newborn 
nursery staff calls our clinic to schedule diagnostic hearing testing. That is how a prospective research 
subject is iden tified. At that time our research staff will go to the patient room to talk with the parents 
about the study. A member of the research staff who is authorized to obtain consent will come to 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787326].  
Subjects who have a child who failed the newborn hearing in another facility will be contact[CONTACT_787340] (ABR) scheduled.  They will have an informed 
consent by [CONTACT_740044] a member of the research staff a nd will have opportunity to discuss study 
and ask questions.      
Aim 2:  At the time of the initial clinic visit for follow up hearing testing , parent(s) of a child who is found 
to have hearing loss will be approached by  [CONTACT_787341] t o obtain informed consent 
to discuss the study and obtain consent  or will be contact[CONTACT_787342] . The parent(s) who signed the consent for the 
Aim [ADDRESS_1083255] a child with a final diagnosis of hearing loss through two different 
ABRs by [CONTACT_787343] -consented in the clinic after diagnosis  or verbally 
consented by [CONTACT_787344] s of the study portion that randomizes to navigation 
vs. no navigation .  Children who were also born in an outside of [LOCATION_006] institution, but are followed up with 
additional outpatient testing with a hearing l oss diagnosis are also included.    
    
6. Research Procedures:    
 
Specific Aim 1:  The same outcomes will be measured in both groups. Group [ADDRESS_1083256] but will work directly with their hearing healthcare clinic  and other referral 
centers for diagnostic and intervention services (THIS IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF PRACTICE). Parents in each group  of the children born at [LOCATION_006]MC , children born at outside facilities  (and referred to 
[LOCATION_006]MC Audiology clinic for follow up testing), and children referred to CCSHCN for follow up testing will 
be given a standard brochure that contains basic information about newborn hearing screening and a 
contact [CONTACT_787345]/or treatment. This 
is document produced and circulated by [CONTACT_787346] (SEE APPENDIX 1) . At the time of enrollment, parents of the child with the failed 
heari ng screening will fill out a questionnaire which assess es patient satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, 
and behaviors , along with some demographic information ( see attached) from both groups.  The 
subjects who are discharged from outside facilities will have the questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_2319], email 
(through REDCap),  or phone with the research staff member.  Notes from phone conversations from 
navigator phone calls will be recorded by [CONTACT_787347]. 
The data from the questionnaire and the other time points will also be recorded on an excel spreadsheet.  At the follow up appointment the research team will also collect data on the outcome of 
the diagnostic testing. If subjects do not recei ve their diagnostic follow up within the 3 month time frame

[CONTACT_787349] (through the EHDI 
system) if these patients received follow up care in another clinic outside of the study or if they were lost to f ollow up.   This data will be kept in a password- protected file on a password- protected computer 
and along with the consents will be kept in the locked office of the PI. This data will be kept for a total of 
6 years after the conclusion of the study.  
  
Spec ific Aim 2:  The same outcomes will be measured in both groups, but this Aim will focus on the 
timing of intervention from the hearing screening as an outpatient. The patients randomized to the 
navigator group will be contact[CONTACT_201213] -biweekly  to provide educational and psychosocial support of 
participants with the same four conversation points from Aim 1.  The testing that diagnosed hearing 
loss will be recorded into the EHDI database.  At the time of enrollment, parents of the child with the 
failed hearin g test will also fill out a questionnaire which assesses patient satisfaction, knowledge, 
attitudes, and behaviors, along with some demographic information ( see attached) from both groups 
(navigator and non -navigator). We will have the patients complete the  questionnaire at enrollment and 
[ADDRESS_1083258] at the ir hearing 
healthcare clinic  (depending on where the patient received diagnostic testing) , age of definitive 
diagnosis of hearing los s, age of early intervention consultation, age of hearing aid fitting, and (if patient 
meets criteria for cochlear implantation) age of cochlear implantation.  Parent (s) of children in this Aim 
will also receive another questionnaire, similar to the one they receive at the beginning  of Aim [ADDRESS_1083259]- protected computer and along with the consents will be kept in the locked office of the PI. 
This data also will be kept for a total of 6 years after the conclusion of the study.  
 
7.  Resources:    
The study does not require any special space. A patient navigator is not a care provider but is an advocate for patients to identify concerns or questions and to help patients  navigate through the 
healthcare system.   A phone in a private area of the Audiology clinic will be utilized with an encrypted, 
password protected computer for data collection and entry.  The patient navigat or has specialized skill 
to work with families who have a child with hearing loss and follows Good Clinical Practice when 
speaking with families . Research staff have experience and training in clinical research and utilize the 
principles of Good Clinical P ractice when screening and enrolling.   All have completed appropriate and 
documented Human Subjects Protection training.     
8.  Potential Risks and Safety Precautions:  
The challenges present in this study relate to the Belmont report issues of respect for  persons, 
beneficence, and justice. The respect for persons becomes an issue in that we are studying children 
and they are naturally a vulnerable population. A major concern in diagnosing and managing children 
with hearing loss is that they are lost to fol low-up after they leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In order to gain access to 
these children, we need to recruit them while they are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787327]. There is a risk of coercion in this setting. To prevent this 
coercion, the PI (who could potentially be involved in the patient’s care) will not consent the patient or 
have contact [CONTACT_10970]’s family during study  Aim [ADDRESS_1083260] this as the state of Kentucky monitors  failed newborn hearing screening and

risk of breach of confidentiality, as we will  be contact[CONTACT_787351].  
 
When recruiting these patients we will need to be very careful not to be coercive. Parents when they’ve 
found out that their c hild failed a newborn hearing screen may be very susceptible to coercion. The 
nursery staff will be the first contact, not to discuss the study, but to ask the parents if they’d be willing 
for the research staff to talk with them about the study. If they s ay no then they  will be ensured that they 
be provided the standard care as is routine when a child fails a newborn hearing screen. If they agree 
to participate then the research coordinator will go to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787328]. He or she will also become a part of the care team in contact[CONTACT_787352][INVESTIGATOR_787329] e.  In asking potential subjects if they would 
like to participate in the navigator study, the coordinator will not be coercive in his or her approach, but 
will only give further information if the potential subjects would like more informed knowledge abou t the 
study.  The coordinator  is not a healthcare provider and will not be involved in providing care thus will 
reduce the pressure of coercion in patients. The navigator will be trained carefully to assist patients, 
answer their questions, and guide them through the diagnostic and therapeutic process of childhood 
hearing loss. In order to prevent miscommunication, they will not be allowed to provide medical advice 
but facilitate their contact [CONTACT_787353].  
 
During study Aim 2, child is seen once in the Audiology clinic for outpatient follow up hearing testing.  
Once the child fails the first test, he or she will return for testing with another audiologist to confirm 
hearing loss.  At that point, a member of the research staff, will be notified that child has met criteria for 
the second part of the study and parent(s) will be approached  or called with information about study 
and given a consent  in-person or will be offered to receive a mailed consent form when called.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_787330] [ADDRESS_1083261] protection training.  
  
9.  Benefit vs. Risk:    
The potential benefit of participation in both Aim 1  and Aim 2 of this research is the early detection and 
intervention of hearing loss in children and to improve community and regional awareness of hearing 
loss in children. The risks include potential compromise of patient confidentiality; however, measure s as 
described above will be taken to maintain confidentiality.  
10.  Available Alternative Treatment(s):    
Patients that choose not to participate in this research will be referred according to the standard of care 
to the regional hearing screening location according to state policies.  
11. Research Materials, Records, and Privacy:    
The data, consents, and questionnaires will be kept in the locked office of the PI. These materials will 
be retained during the study and 6 years after the study.

Identification and Intervention 
Hello, my name [CONTACT_832]    . I am calling on behalf of the Commission for Children with Special 
Health Care Needs.  May I speak with the parent/guardian of (child’s name)    ? Your child has a 
follow -up appointment with the CCSHCN Audiology Clinic on (date of appointment)   . This 
appointment is for a follow -up hearing test, because your child had an abnormal hearing screening in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
I am a member of a collaborative research team between the Commission and the University of Kentucky. We 
are working together on a study to learn about the barriers families face in receiving hearing healthcare. W e 
are looking for individuals who might be interested in participating in our study . Would you be interested in 
hearing more about this study? 
I’d first like to determine if you are eligible based on a few questions: 1) was your child in the NICU for an 
extended period of time (more than 10 days), 2) was your child born premature (before 34 weeks gestation), 3) 
did your child fail the newborn hearing screening in one or both ears, 4) are you at least 18 years old, 5) are you planning on living in Kentucky for at least the next 12 months, 6) are you willing to have your child’s hearing tested further, 7) are you will to have further testing performed at a clinic in the state of Kentucky, 8) can you speak and read English or Spanish, and 9) are you willing to be contact[CONTACT_10744]?  
The Commission for Children with Special Health Care Needs in partnership with The University of Kentucky Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery (Ear, Nose and Throat) is inviting you to participate in 
a research study because your child had an abnormal Newborn Hearing Screening while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787331] a  follow up hearing test at the Commission for Children with Special Health Care Needs Audiology 
Clinic .  By [CONTACT_56761], we would like to find if a patient navigator or standard of care is more helpful in 
assisting families in getting access to hearing services.   You may not get any direct benefit from participating in 
this study, but  your participation may help doctors better understand and/or treat others who have your child’s 
condition in the future.  
The person in charge of this study is [CONTACT_787362], the Principal Investigator, or PI.  If you decide to 
participate, you will be one of about [ADDRESS_1083262] of care treatment only (or health services that you would receive if you were not participating in the study) or in a group who works with a patient navigator by [CONTACT_787354].  A patient navigator is a trained person who has experience and interest in child hearing 
health and his or her role is to help families get appropriate services and access to resources for their child.  
We want to see which way is more helpful in understanding your child’s condition and allow for easier access 
to follow up services.

A
IM 1 VERBAL CONSENT (COMMISSION)  Research procedures will take place over the phone and at the CCSHCN Audiology Clinic.  The study will last 
for about [ADDRESS_1083263] information.   
If you are randomized to be in the navigator group, you will receive a weekly /bi-weekly  phone call from the 
navigator to discuss the hearing of your child and his or her progress until your child has his or her hearing 
testing in the CCSHCN Audiology Clinic . If you are in the standard of care only group, you will not have any 
further contact [CONTACT_787355].  Families in both groups will have a follow up survey that will take about 15 minutes when they return to the CCSHCN Audiology Clinic . The second survey may also be 
completed over the phone with one of the members of our research team.  After completion of the follow up 
survey, you will be mailed a $20 check for your time. We will monitor your child’s health through the duration of 
the study.  This i ncludes: demographic information, results of physical exams, hearing tests, and other 
diagnostic and medical procedures as well as medical and social history.  
The potential risk to participating in the study is the chance of your confidential information being seen by [CONTACT_787356].  We will give you and your child a single study number that will be linked to you and 
your child’s identifying information, but we will take every precaution to ensure your and your child’s 
information is protected and kept confidential.  Only personnel working on the study have access to study 
information and it is kept on a password protected computer in a locked office.  The information that you give will be grouped with information from other participants and not identified with you or your child personally.   We 
do use a computer -based tool called REDCap to store information from the surveys entered by [CONTACT_25617].  The surveys entered do not have any identifying information that is entered into the computer.  
If you earn $[ADDRESS_1083264] of care follow up for your child’s condition. 
There is no cost to you for participation other than a small amount of time spent on the phone if you are in the 
navigator group and to complete the surveys .  You will be contact[CONTACT_787357], you will be given a contact [CONTACT_787358].  If you have further questions about the study 
we will give you [CONTACT_787363]’s  contact [CONTACT_108118] (859) 257- [ADDRESS_1083265] at (859)

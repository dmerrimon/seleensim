Study Protocol Version Date 12-05-17 2 Synopsis:   This study is prospective, randomized trial in which the efficacy of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel®) is compared to standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359134]. Exparel® is a 72-hour bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359135]. Having a long acting local anesthetic should provide better pain control than conventional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359136] a 3.5-hour half-life. Currently, standard surgical site infiltration in laparoscopic bariatric surgery includes bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359137]®. In some studies, the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359138]. This has not yet been studied in bariatric patients and the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359139]-operative pain control, decrease narcotic use, decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359140].  Hypothesis:  Surgical site infiltration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359141].   Background:   Although recovery after laparoscopy is brief compared to open laparotomy, pain control from port site incisions can remain challenging. Postoperative pain often involves narcotics and can lead to side effects of nausea, altered gastrointestinal motility such constipation, and potential addiction. Brummett et al found around 6% rate of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_359142]ïve prior to surgery[1]. In bariatric patients, there is a paucity of literature regarding pain control. Budiansky et al. suggest for patients with morbid obesity that pain management cannot adhere to standard protocols which generally includes administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Drugs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_359143] a patient with morbid obesity will change the clearance and effect of common medications. In addition, physiologic changes and other co-morbidities relating to obesity including obstructive sleep apnea can limit typi[INVESTIGATOR_359144] [2]. Minimizing the use of narcotics in bariatric patients is beneficial even in those with chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Bariatric patients with chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_359145][3]. Therefore, prevention of opi[INVESTIGATOR_359146].  Currently, standard local injections of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359147]. New techniques such as intrathecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359148] [4-6]. Recently, the beneficial use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359149], gynecological and orthopedic surgeries. Exparel® is a 72-hour slowly releasing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359150]. The use of 
Study Protocol Version Date 12-05-[ADDRESS_448024]-operative pain control and decreasing length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359151] [7-9]. However, benefits of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359152].   Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359153] a 20 ml single use vial of 13.3 mg/ml of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. The Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359154] [ADDRESS_448025]-operative pain control includes patient controlled analgesia and oral narcotics and oral narcotics for discharge. Inadequate pain control has been shown to prolonged recovery, increased narcotic use, and longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959] [10].   Purpose of study:  The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359155].  With better pain control, we expect a better recovery, with less narcotic requirements, decreasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359156]. Use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359157].  Design of Study:   Prospective, double blind- randomized controlled clinical trial.    Sample Size:   Approximately 200 patients (100 patients in each arm) are expected to participate in the study. These patients are those that have fulfilled NIH criteria and met preoperative requirements for bariatric surgery. Surgeries and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359158] (FHSH). Post-operative visits will be at Advanced Laparoscopic Surgical Associates (ALSA). Methodology used to determine sample size: Utilizing existing data, an estimate was made as to the magnitude of benefit that could be expected for the parameters of interest. Using these estimates, a power analysis was performed to determine the number of patients that would need to be present in each arm for a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level. Next the estimate of the benefit was reduced to come with the actual number of patients for the study.  Patient Population: Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria Gender of subjects: Population breakdown is expected to be similar to that seen in the adult population seeking bariatric surgery.    Age of subjects: 
Study Protocol Version Date 12-05-17 4 Adults >18 years and <65 years.  Racial and ethnic origin: Population breakdown is expected to be similar to that seen in the adult population seeking bariatric surgery.  Patients not able to understand or read English will be excluded.   Inclusion criteria: • All patients undergoing elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_359180].   Exclusion criteria: • Patients deemed not a candidate for laparoscopic bariatric surgery • Patients with previous bariatric or gastric surgeries.  • BMI <35 and > 60 kg/m2 • Preoperative inability to ambulate and confined to wheelchair. • American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score >3 • Not able to understand informed consent, or unwilling to sign consent. • Not able to understand and read English • Currently pregnant or lactating. • Age <18 or >65 • Patients intolerant of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], NSAIDS, acetaminophen or local anesthetics. • Patients requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_359159] 30 days prior to time of surgery. • Patients with reported use of narcotics greater than 2 weeks in preceding year before surgery.  • Patients with history of substance abuse, alcohol addiction • Patients with diagnosis of chronic pain, history of fibromyalgia, chronic regional pain syndrome (dystrophic pain syndrome). • Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359160] 96 hours before operation • Prisoners • Patients with renal failure or hepatic failure.  Intraoperative Exclusion criteria:  • Bariatric surgery operation >3 hours.  • More than 5 laparoscopic incision sites used during surgery, conversion to open operation, placement of a feeding tube or drain. • Concurrent ventral hernia repair, large hiatal hernia repair or intraoperative extensive lysis of adhesions • Concurrent cholecystectomy, subtotal gastrectomy, or fundoplication  Study Methods and Procedures:  Treatment Arm: Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 20mL of injectable saline diluted with 60 ml of 0.25% Marcaine and 20 ml of saline for a total of 100 ml. After induction of anesthesia, the patients will receive a 20 ml mixture locally infiltrated at each trocar incision site (5 sites).    • Other names: Exparel® 
Study Protocol Version Date 12-05-17 5  Control Arm: 60 milliliters (ml) of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359161] 40 ml of saline for a total of 100 ml. After induction of anesthesia, the patients will receive 20 ml mixture locally infiltrated at each trocar incision site (5 sites).  • Other Names: Marcaine   Patients who have been deemed appropriate candidates for elective bariatric surgery specifically laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476] (RYGB) or vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) with [CONTACT_359187], [CONTACT_359188], [CONTACT_359189], [CONTACT_359190], [CONTACT_359191], and [CONTACT_359192] (sub-investigators and principal investigator) will be offered participation in the study. These patients have already met preoperative qualifications and workup for bariatric surgery. There are no advertisements to recruit patients for the study. The patients will be introduced to the study and be offered participation at the preoperative visit which occurs within a week of their planned scheduled elective surgery. No additional laboratory testing or imaging will be required to participate in the study.  In the pre-operative office visit prior to surgery, the clinical investigators or sub investigators will inform the patient of the opportunity to participate in the research study. The clinical investigators or sub investigators will consent the patient at the preoperative visit.  The patients will undergo standard enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol which has a standard preoperative and postoperative pain protocol.   Randomization:  If the patient chooses to participate, they will be randomized to 2 arms of either liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359162]® group, or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359163].  The randomization will be in a 1:1 ratio. The patient and operating surgeon will not be notified which arm the patient is in. The randomization will be done by [CONTACT_359181] a stack that is previously randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_448026] access to decode each patient in the study for medical necessity.    The operating room surgical techs and nurses will then prepare the medications and cover the syringes containing the medications with colored sterile tape. Surgical techs and nurses responsible for preparing the medications will verify the medications and doses with one another before covering the syringe with sterile tape. This will impede the surgeon from guessing medication type as liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359164]. All syringes and containers containing study medications will be labeled appropriately with either 1.3% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183]/or 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359165]. The Surgical techs and nurses will announce the medications as “study medications” when delivered to the surgeon and during “Time-Out” procedures. This is in compliance 
Study Protocol Version Date 12-05-17 6 with CMC Operating Room Policy and Procedure Number [ZIP_CODE].    Once medications are mixed and placed into masked syringes, the surgeon may enter the operating room. At the beginning of the surgery, the patient will be administered local surgical site injections of the assigned medications.  A total of 100 milliliters (mL) mixture of either liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel®) mixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359166]. Each surgical site will receive 20 ml of the medication mixture. If in the treatment arm, they will receive 20mL of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359161] 60 ml of 0.25% Marcaine and 20 ml of saline for a total of 100 ml. If in the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274711] (control) arm, they will receive 60 ml of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359161] 40 ml of saline for a total of 100 ml. Dosing is within safety parameters as confirmed with FHSH pharmacy (See attached letter). Additional intraoperative exclusion criteria is outlined above and study coordinator will track patients based on EMR data.     As part of routine post-operative care, the patient will be taken to the recovery unit (PACU) after the operation. The recovery room staff and nursing floor staff, and remaining clinical team not present during randomization in the operating room will be blinded to the type of local anesthetic given. The clinical team including residents, fellows, and remaining surgeons including sub investigator will primarily manage the patient’s post-operative care including pain and nausea medications under standard routine ERAS protocol. Management of additional pain and nausea medications will be routinely determined by [CONTACT_11339]-operating surgeon (other sub-investigators). All patients in the study will receive a standard CMC patient identification wristband and Exparel wristband with warning printed that they should not receive additional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_291200] [ADDRESS_448027]-operative visit (generally around post-operative day 7), they will be seen by a clinical investigator to review medications, questionnaires, and if any complications relating to surgery or medications administered. Questionnaires and patient journals pertaining to the study will only be limited up until the first post-operative visit.  Patients will be followed as part of standard post-operative bariatric surgery protocol where visits in the office will occur one week post operatively, three weeks post operatively, then routinely every 3-[ADDRESS_448028]-operative nausea, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359167].

Poisson Regression, student’s t-test, and non-parametric testing will be used for the analysis of continuous variables. Chi-square analysis will be used for categorical data. This interventional study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the rate of morphine equivalent units utilized by [CONTACT_359183][INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel®) during a primary bariatric surgery is greater than or equal to the rate of patients who were administered Marcaine, versus the alternative hypothesis that the rate of morphine equivalent units utilized by [CONTACT_359184][INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel®) during patients is lower than that of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_359170]. Testing of this hypothesis will be performed for the time period of the inpatient stay, as well as for the period of 7-[ADDRESS_448032] a rate change of as low as 10% or a 11 unit difference in average daily morphine equivalent units utilized. NCSS/PASS was the statistical software package used for the sample size calculations.   A combination of NCSS and RStudio will be used for the statistical analysis of this study.

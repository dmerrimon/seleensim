Appendix A: Pe rformance Status Criteria  ............................................................................................................ [ADDRESS_341074] on tumor oxygenation. Results from this study will shed 
light o n the vascular normalization hypothesis . This study will evaluate patients  with recurrent 
glioblastoma  with simultaneous FMISO PET and MRI to assess changes in tumor blood flow, 
blood volume, vessel caliber, and vascular permeability with advanced MRI whil e 
simultaneously measuring tumor oxygenation status with FMISO PET.   
 
We plan to study patients with recurrent glioblastoma whose clinical care plan includes treatment with  bevacizumab .  We will perform FMISO -PET at 3 time points in all patients: 
before beginning bevacizumab , prior to the second dose of bevacizumab, and prior to the third 
dose of bevacizumab.  In addition, patients will undergo advanced MRI scans 1 day after start of bevacizumab and monthly for 6 months of treatment.   
 This study protocol is being amended to account for the publication of recent data which has impacted clinical practice. Based on the published results from the 3 -arm BELOB study  
(Nederlands Trial Register, www.trialregister.nl, number NTR 1929) there has been a shift to 
treating patients with combination bevacizumab and lomustine rather than bevacizumab alone  
(Taal et al 2014) . In this randomized, phase 2, multicenter trial the combination of 
bevacizumab and lomustine  was associated with superior overall survival.  Although this study 
was not formally designed for comparisons across the [ADDRESS_341075] comparing bevacizumab + lomustine versus lomustine alone 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 For this protocol, there will now be [ADDRESS_341076] enhancement seen with anti -VEGF therapy . For example,  there was very little change in tumor volume in 
patients treated with lomustine alone in both the REGAL study and BELOB study) (Batchelor 2013, Taal 2014) . If there was a true effect on tumor vasculature, we would see more change 
in the post- contrast imag es similar to the responses seen in the ant- VEGF treated arms.  
 Furthermore, our o wn data comparing a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated 
with standard radiation  and temozolomide to a cohort of patients treated with standard 
 6 radiation , temo zolomide, and cediranib (an anti -VEGF agent) did not show the same vascular 
normalization effects (as measured by [CONTACT_279419], permeability, 
perfusion, and tumor oxygenation) in the temozolomide + RT alone group (Batchelor 2013).  The P ET studies will be performed using our human simultaneous MR -PET imaging camera. 
No diagnostic decisions or therapy decisions will be based on any results obtained from these 
PET scans , and we expect no change in the care of these patients . The success of these studies 
should enable methods that could be used in larger studies to more completely understand the role of anti- angiogenic agents in the treatment of cancer.  
 
1.2 Primary Objectives  
1. To determine if bevacizumab improves tumor blood flow /perfusion . 
2. To determine if bevacizumab reduces tumor hypoxia.  
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
1. To explore the link between flow, permeability, and tumor hypoxia. 
a. Measure tumor blood flow with MRI perfusion and compare with tumor hypoxic volume. 
b. Estimate permeability from K
trans MRI measurements and compare with 
tumor hypoxic volume. 
2. To explore the link between tumor hypoxia and blood biomarkers of angiogenesis 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent(s)  
 
2.[ADDRESS_341077] in radiolabeled nitroimidazoles, and particularly FMISO, as nuclear imaging agents of hypoxia has been growing. Intracellular nitroreductases metabolize nitroimidazoles in the setting of low oxygen levels, thus trappi[INVESTIGATOR_279406]. Importantly, the metabolism of nitroimidazoles 
relies on an active electron transport chain so only live cells can trap FMISO. The binding of FMISO is related to the level of hypoxia, and oxygen levels of 3 to 10 mm Hg lead to FMISO binding  (Rasey et al, 1990; Gross et al, 1995) . Several 
studies have demonstrated that the uptake of FMISO correlates well with invasive polarographic oxygen electrodes, the gold standard to determine tissue oxygenation (Koh et al, 1992; Bernsen et al, 2000; Rasey et al 1987; Rasey et al, 1996).  
Preliminary studies of FMISO uptake in glioma have demonstrated the feasibility 
of this technique both in animal models and in humans  (Valk et al, 1992). In a 
glioma rat model, FMISO uptake was significantly greater in tumor  tissue than in 
surrounding normal brain (Tochon- Danguy et al 2002) . Cher et al showed that all 
high-grade gliomas have increased FMISO uptake while low -grade gliomas did 
not, which is consistent with the underlying biology of gliomas —higher -grade 
 7 tumors are more hypoxic than lower -grade tumors  (Cher et al, 2006). In 22 
participants with newly -diagnosed GBM, the greater the volume and degree of 
hypoxia based on FMISO imaging, the shorter time -to-tumor progression and 
survival (Spence et al, 2008). In additi on, histological studies of tumors have 
correlated tissue pi[INVESTIGATOR_212491], a marker of tissue hypoxia, and CAIX with 
FMISO uptake  (Troost et al, 2006; Dubois et al 2004). In one of these studies, the 
glioma model had the strongest correlation between FMISO uptake and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_212491]  (Troost et al, 2006).  Ex vivo autoradiography has also been 
used to confirm the correlation of FMISO and tumor hypoxia  (Sorensen et al, 2005) .  
  
2.3 Study Disease  
 
An estimated 51,410 primary brain tumors were diagnosed in 2007, and 19% of these tumors were glioblastomas 
1.  GBM is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and is a 
uniformly fatal disease with 5 -year survival rates less than 4% despi[INVESTIGATOR_279407], radiation and chemotherapy.  There is no curative therapy for patients with 
GBM.  Current  standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is concomitant 
involved field radiation and oral temozolomide chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_279420] 6 -12 months ( Stupp et al., 2005).  If patients relapse, there is no standard 
of care tre atment and some patients will be treated with temozolomide again, albeit on a 
different dosing schedule.  Instead of 5 consecutive  days every month, patients may be treated 
with a lower daily dose of temozolomide but for more days every month  (Perry et al. , 2010) .  
The goal of this dose dense regimen is to saturate the enzyme,  MGMT, which is believed to 
counteract the DNA -damaging effects of temozolomide. Bevacizumab was recently 
approved by [CONTACT_279421].  
 
2.4 Rationale 
 
The dependence of tumor growth and metastasis on angiogenesis — which has been 
extensively demonstrated in animal models — has provided a powerful rationale for anti -
angiogenic approaches to cancer therapy  (van de Beek, 2007; Carmeliet & Jain, 2000; 
Kleihues, Burger, & Scheithauer, 1993).  Targeting blood vessels in brain tumors has 
been a particularly attractive strategy, given the characteristic high degree of endothelial proliferation, vascular permeability, and pro-angiogenic growth -factor expression (for 
example, VEGF) (Dvorak, 2002; Sundberg, 2001) .  The approval of bevacizumab, which 
neutralizes VEGF, in May 2009 for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) represented the first new therapy for this disease in many years. A strong ant i-edema effect is clearly seen 
with anti- VEGF therapy in many patients. Whether this conveys a survival benefit is still 
not clear; cediranib did not improve survival over lomustine in rGBM in a recent phase III trial, and while definitive phase III studie s of bevacizumab are underway, recent data 
suggests that bevacizumab does not improve overall survival when given to newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients ( Lai et al ., 2010). 
 
 [ADDRESS_341078] been shown to promote vascular “normalization” 
(Batchelor  et al., 2007;  Jain, 2005;  Willett et al.,  2004) in many p atients, which could 
improve local tumor blood flow and therefore cytotoxic chemotherapy delivery to the 
tumor. We have shown that the ‘normalization window’ of the anti -VEGF agent cediranib 
can be detected using serial, non -invasive MRI techniques in rGBM  (Batchelor  et al., 
2007) , and we have seen increases in blood flow  (Sorensen et al 2012) . The outstanding 
question is whether or not this increased perfusion also translates into improved tumor oxygenation. S ince anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_279408], in theory these agents could potentially also inhibit drug delivery to the tumor  
and make therapi[INVESTIGATOR_279409], which rely on oxygenation less effective (Jain, 
2005; Jain, 2001).  
 
Our novel hybrid MR -PET technology should allow us to assess both hypoxia and 
vascular changes to determine the time course and interplay between vascular physiology and tumor oxygenation.

 5.2   MR -PET Scan Procedure  
                                              MA at the Martinos Center. Two lines will be placed for each sc an: one venous line to    
inject the FMISO  and gadolinium for the MRI scan, and a second  to draw blood to assay 
for radioactivity  and metabolites . If a patient has a port, the port can replace one of the 
IVs. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_341090] or a 
nurse trained in radiation safety . 
 
FMISO will be intravenously injected at a dose of 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) 
(maximum 260 MBq, 7 mCi) in < [ADDRESS_341091] for injection 
of the gadolinium for the MRI scan. 
 
Blood draws will be performed at approximately t= 20, 40, 60, 115, 120, 125 
minutes after the injection. The whole blood will be counted and then centrifuged 
to separate plasma from cells. Aliquots of plasma and blood will be separately counted for radioactivity.  The plasma will be further analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography for radiolabeled metabolites. Blood will be transported to the well counter and HPLC systems in a properly shielded container.  
 
 14 PET volumes will be reconstructed using the ordinary Poisson ordered subsets 
expectation maximization (OP -OSEM) 3D algorithm. Corrections will be applied 
for variable detector dead time and efficiency, random coincidences, photon 
attenuation and scatter, and decay.  
5.2.2 MRI Scan  
MR scans will be performed with the same sequences and in the same order during each visit, including T1 - and T2 -weighted volumetric imag es, fluid attenuated 
inversion recovery (FLAIR), contrast agent enhanced T1 -weighted  permeability, 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) , T2/T2* -weighted perfusion scans, and MR 
Spectroscopy . The “Autoalign ” package available from the manufacturer  will be 
used to achieve the same slice prescription in the same patient at each visit. Each 
MRI will last 60-[ADDRESS_341092] brain MRIs . 
Gadolinium -diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( or gadopentetate dimeglumine , 
Gd-DTPA)  will be used as a cont rast agent and injected intravenous ly twice in each 
scan session. The maximum contrast dose that could be given is 0.3 mmol/kg per 
visit, in line with the FDA -approved dosing for this class of contrast agents.

Complete blood counts should be monitored weekly starting 4 weeks after lomustine dose and repeat courses should not be given before 6 weeks as hematologic toxicity is delayed and cumulative. Growth factor support is permitted.  Lomustine may be dose reduced a maximum of 2 times. 
 If toxicities  (as determined CTCAE version 4.0) of grade >2 are observed (except 
alopecia, nausea and vomiting) and related to lomustine, then the dose of lomustine  should be held until recovery to grade ≤ 1.  
 All grade 3 or 4  nonhematological toxicities related to lomustine (except  alopecia,  
anorexia, nausea and vomiting) should have resolved to grade ≤ 1 and lomustine  
should be re- initiated at a dose of 70mg /m

to 50 mg/m2 is permitted if there are grade 3 or 4 toxicities at the  dose of 70 
mg/m2.  
 If a patient develops u nacceptable toxicity to lomustine, bevacizumab may be 
continued as monotherapy.   Lomustine may be held for a maximum of  12 weeks from the scheduled date of 
cycle initiation  to allow for resolution of toxicity. 
 The m aximum number of cycles of lomustine  is 6. 
6.3.3 Bevacizumab  
  
Prior to each bevacizumab infusion, the following parameters should be met: platelet count >75,000/mcL , proteinuria < grade 3, creatinine <1.5xULN , 
hypertension < grade 4.    
If toxicities  (as determined CTCAE version 4.0) of grade >2 are observed (except 
alopecia, nausea and vomiting)  and related to bevacizumab , then the dose of 
bevacizumab  should held until recovery to grade ≤ 1. All grade 3 or 4 non-
hematological toxicities (except hypertension, alopecia, nausea and vomiting) 
should have resolved to grade ≤ 1 for bevacizumab  to be re- initiated at a dose of 
5mg/kg.  Hypertension should be proactively managed and if cannot be controlled 
with anti-hypertensive medications to <grade 3, bevacizumab should be dose reduced to 5mg/kg.  Bevaciz umab may be held for up to 28 days to allow for resolution of toxicity.

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
 26 10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
10.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse e vent (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more sever e form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pr e-planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
 27 • emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
 
10.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agent(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 Attribution  
 Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned  as follows: 
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
10.[ADDRESS_341109] or other means, 
 28 will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-
specific case report forms.  
 The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_341110] access to a copy of the C TCAE version 4.0. 
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at:  
  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
10.3 Reporting Requirements  
 For multi- site trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the principal 
investigator, each participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_102841]/HCC. The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
 
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events to the study sponsor and/or others as described below.   Investigators must immediately report directly to the RDRC all adverse effects associated with the use of the radioactive drug [21 CFR 361.1 (d) 8] 
10.[ADDRESS_341111] be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.1.2, as well as the 
following:  
• Grade 2 (moderate) and  Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are 
unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related/associated with the 
intervention. 
 
• All Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabli ng) E vents – Unless expected AND 
specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting. 
 
• All Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_341112] stud y intervention.  
 
 29 Note : If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time 
of continuing review.  
 
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_341113] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse event s by [CONTACT_756], email or facsimile to:  
 
  Elizabeth Gerstner , M.D. 
  Phone: [PHONE_4903]   Page #:  [PHONE_4902] #[ZIP_CODE] 
Fax: [PHONE_4517] 
[EMAIL_4109]  Within the following 24-[ADDRESS_341114] provide follow-up information on the serious adverse event. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participation.  
 Non-Serious Adverse  Event Reporting  
 Non-serious adverse events will be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_98873].   
10.[ADDRESS_341115] (IRB)

 34 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Study Design/Endpoints  
The statistical design of the study pertains to Cohort A where the following hypotheses 
will be specifically tested.  The primary statistical analysis will be the comparison of hypoxic volumes measured by [CONTACT_279426] 14 [
18F]FMISO PET scans. We 
expect all patients have some hypoxia at baseline, and will express the change day [ADDRESS_341123] if there is a significant decrease in the percentage of the tumor with a HV (as defined as T/B
max ≥1.2) from prior to bevacizumab infusion to day 14); thus, this is a continuous 
endpoint . The 1.[ADDRESS_341124] was predictive of patient survival  (Spence et al, 2008) . Additional 
exploratory analys es will look at the change in HV between baseline and day 28. The 
ROI de lineating the contrast -enhancing and non- enhancing tumor will be co- registered 
to the FMISO PET scan to determine the area of interest on the PET scan and calculate the number of tumor voxels with a T/B
max ≥1.2. This will allow us to generate a 
percentage of the entire tumor volume that is hypoxic. Based on personal communication 
([CONTACT_279431]), we expect the SD of the within- person change between FMISO 
measurements under the null hypothesis to be approximately 10%. Using this value and N=30, we anticipate 80% power to detect an absolute mean change of approximately 5% 
or greater, based on a Wilcoxon signed rank test  at the 0.[ADDRESS_341125] if there is a significant change in median tumor CBF from prior to bevacizumab infusion to each of the time points (day 1, day 14). We will use a repeated measures mi xed effects model that will jointly model median tumor CBF at 
baseline, days [ADDRESS_341126] that the collection of medians across subjects to be approximately normally distributed. Based on our preliminary data (N=29), we estimate the standard deviation (SD) of a within -subject 
CBF change averaged over tumor to be 0.2. With [ADDRESS_341127] 80% power to detect a difference of 0.11 in CBF. 
Vascular MRI Secondary Endpoints will include CBV, vessel dia meter, and ktrans: 
Secondary analyses will consist, for each biomarker, of tests of  change from baseline 
(we will apply log -transformation and test for a relative change). We will use two -sided, 
paired Wilcoxon tests, adjusting p- values by [CONTACT_279427]’s method to account for multiple 
time-points, but not for multiple biomarkers — as each biomarker will be of separate 
 [ADDRESS_341128] one significant outcome is as for the primary analysis of 
FMISO PET scans given above. 
Similar secondary analyses will be conducted with the blood biomarker data in the same 
manner as w ith the imagin g parameters.  
Cohort B is an exploratory cohort and will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
Statistical graphics such as boxplots will be used to present the summary statistics at 
each time point. The differences  in HV, CBF, CBV, vessel diameter, and ktrans (same 
as for Cohort A)  before and during treatment will be tested using paired st atistics  but HV 
will be the variable of principle interest. Cox regression model or logistic regression 
model will be used to explore associations between changes o f serum biomarker 
levels /imaging parameters  and overall survival or progression- free survival. All 
estimated associations of biomarker changes during the disease process and the probability of death or disease progression will be reported along with 95% confidence intervals.  Using the same assumptions as for Cohort A, for any standard deviation for 
change from baseline, we will be able to detect an effect size of 1.[ADDRESS_341129] deviation 
units or larger for HV which will be the primary Aim for this cohort. V ascular MRI 
Secondary Endpoints will be handled as above for Cohort A. 
 
13.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
30 patients will be enrolled  in Cohort A with an accrual rate of ~1 per month.  A 
maximum of 10 patients will be enrolled in the exploratory cohort B.

                    SPECIAL NURSING CONSIDERATIONS UNIQUE TO THIS PROTOCOL  Study 
Design  
 This study will explore the changes in tumor vasculature resulting from treatment with Bevacizumab and the impact 
these changes have on tumor oxygenation. The success of these studies should enable met hods that could be used in 
larger studies to more completely understand the role of Anti -angiogenic agents in the treatment of cancer.  Dose 
Calc  Bevacizumab dose is calculated in mg/kg per standard of care. (Section 5.0)  
 
A cycle = [ADDRESS_341133] of care. (Section 5.0, 7.2) 
MR-PET  
• Scans will be performed in Charlestown, MA at th e Martinos Center.  
• 2 IV lines will be placed for each scan: one venous line to inject the FMISO and Gadolinium for the MRI scan, and 
a second to draw blood to assay for radioactivity & metabolites.  
• If the Participant has a port, the port can replace on e of the IVs.  
• FMISO PET scans will be approximately 60 -75 minutes  and begin approximately 90 minutes following the FMISO 
injection. (Section 5.2.1)   
• FMISO administration instructions are found in Section 7.1.8.  
• Gadolinium -diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid will be used as a contrast agent and injected intravenou sly twice in 
each scan session. (Section 5.2.2)   Dose Mod  & 
Toxicity  Dose Modifications/Dosing Delay for Toxicity  are outlined in Section  6.3 
• NCI CTCAE vs. 4.0 will be used in grading toxicities.  (Section 6.3.2)  
• No dose reduction of FMISO is permitted. (Section 6.3.1)  
• Bevacizumab : Prior to each Bevacizumab infusion, the following parameters should be met: Platelet count 
>75,000/mcL , proteinuria  < grade 3 , creatinine <1.5xULN, hypertension < grade 4.  
• Dose  Modificatio ns for Bevacizumab are found in Section 6.3.2.

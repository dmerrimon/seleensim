1.1 Study Objectives   
 
1.1.1 Objectives   
Aim 1: To adapt the I -HoME intervention for caregivers of ADRD patients with advanced illness by 
[CONTACT_629062] (n= 30) and caregivers (n= 30) of 
ADRD patients.  
Aim 2: To pi[INVESTIGATOR_629046] I -HoME intervention with family caregivers (n= 30) of ADRD 
patients with advanced illness . 
1.1.2 Hypotheses / Research Questions  
We hypothesize that implementing the adapted I-HoME intervention  will be feasible and acceptable 
to participants.   
 
2. Background and Significance  
Use of palliative care services in the US has risen steadily over the past few decades, with over 80% of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629047] a palliative care team1 and over 50% of Medicare decedents receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].[ADDRESS_838308] palliative care services were delivered to cancer patients.3 However, there has been a marked shift 
in the types of patients receiving these services today. In particular, the number of patients with Alzheimer’s 
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) who need and/or receive End -of-Life (EoL) care has increased steadi ly. 
Dementia is now the fifth leading cause of death4 among older adults, and of all patients receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], 
45% have a primary or secondary dementia diagnosis.[ADDRESS_838309] called for research to improve palliative care in aff ected patients and their 
caregivers.6–[ADDRESS_838310] patients with advanced illness present unique challenges for care provision when compared to 
patients with non- dementing terminal illnesses. One notable challenge is an inability to clearly communicate their 
symptoms or care needs. Patients are also more likely to exhibit behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD).[ADDRESS_838311] to assessing and 
managing symptoms and providing optimal palliative care. Furthermore, caregivers of patients with (vs. without) 
ADRD that are approaching the EoL are more likely to s uffer from depression, anxiety, and poor physical 
health.10–[ADDRESS_838312] patients with advanced illness who need 
palliative/EoL care services is essential for their well -being and for the well -being of affected patients.13 
To date, little research has focused on finding solutions to improve palliative/EoL care outcomes among 
ADRD patients with advanced illness and their caregivers. In a recent systematic review6 examining ADRD 
patients receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], the authors identified only [ADDRESS_838313] patients with advanced illness and their caregivers may receive suboptimal palliative care, leading to unwanted outcomes such as burdensome care transitions16,17, especially among African 
American and Latinx patients.17 
The Improving Home hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] M anagement of E nd-of-life issues through technology (I -HoME)  intervention 
is a caregiver -directed intervention that supplements existing care with video visits and education provided by a 
palliative trained nurse practitioner. Visits with a nurse practitioner focus on assessing and treating distressing

Page # [ADDRESS_838314] phase of Aim 1, the study will recruit (n= 30) geriatricians and palliative care providers at Weill Cornell 
Medicine along with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629048] a national registry. In addition, caregivers (n= 30) of ADRD 
patients with advanced illness will be recruited from Weill Cornell Medicine. Data collected in this phase will be 
used to adapt the current version of the I -HoME intervention.  
For the second phase of Aim 1, as part of the iterative user -centered design process, participants from the first 
phase will be recruited to provide additional feedback (see Follow -up Questionnaires with submitted data 
collection material) on the adapted version of I -HoME to further refine the intervention .  
 
Study population  
Healthcare providers will be recruited from Weill Cornell Medicine and a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629045] 
(hmdcb.org) . Caregivers of ADRD patients will be recruited through referrals from providers at the Center on 
Aging and the House Call program at Weill Cornell Medicine.  
 Recruitment  
For recruitment of healthcare providers, an email will be sent out to clinicians detailing the study. A member 
of the research team will follow up with interested participants and schedule a time to obtain informed consent and conduct an interview (in -person, virtually) .  
For recruitment of caregivers, the research team will obtain a list of potential caregiver participants based on 
the patient’s dementia diagnosis from the electronic medical record. ADRD will be defined by [CONTACT_2329] a modified 
list of the 22 International Classification of Diseases -  Tenth Revision (ICD -10) diagnosis codes endorsed by [CONTACT_629063] & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for ADRD.[ADDRESS_838315] of patients is generated, the research 
team will then collaborate with the patient’s provider at the Center on Aging and the House Call program to 
identify ADRD patients with advanced illness. The research team will use the Functional Assessment Staging 
Tool (FAST) scale for dementia to identify qualified par ticipants. The research team will recruit caregivers of 
patients who are at a stage 7a- f on the FAST scale and have not had a medical complication over the past year.  
Caregivers of patients that meet the study criteria will be contact[CONTACT_629064]. 
Interested caregivers will be scheduled to meet (in- person, virtually) where informed consent will be obtained 
and an interview will be administered. Participant inclusion criteria include, (1) age 18 years or older, (2) providing 
care to an ADRD patient with advanced illness, and (3) English speaking.  
Participants recruited in Aim 1 will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_838316] phase of Aim 1 are (1) to identify and understand the challenges (e.g., symptom management and care 
needs) in caring for ADRD patients and t heir caregivers; (2) to describe the current I -HoME protocol and 
intervention to participants; (3) to understand whether the current I -HoME intervention would be feasible and 
acceptable to caregivers of ADRD patients; and (4) to obtain input on adapting/modifying the current intervention to meet the symptom management and care needs of ADRD patients with advanced illness.  
IRB Protocol #: 23 -01025643 
Version Date:  June 3, 2024  
 
Page # [ADDRESS_838317] patients with advanced illness will be identified  from the medical records and screened 
by [CONTACT_30155] . The caregiver will  then be contact[CONTACT_629064]. Interested 
caregivers will be scheduled a time for an interview ( virtually or in -person) where informed consent will be 
obtained. Participant inclusion criteria include, (1) age 18 years or older, (2) the family caregiver  of the patient, 
(3) providing any sort of caregiving on a regular basis (at least weekly ), (4) English speaking, and (5) have access 
to an electronic device with cellular data or Internet connection to access the telehealth platform . 
After the caregiver is enrolled, a member of the research team will go over how to use their personal device 
to conduct video visits with the nurse practitioner. Software by [CONTACT_629065].me19 will be used to conduct HIPAA 
compliant video visits.  
 
I-HoME intervention  
The current I -HoME protocol involves video visits with a nurse practitioner for up to six visits to address 
symptom management and care needs . Nurse practitioners delivering the intervention go through a training 
session that familiarizes them with the I -HoME protocol. The protocol provides a framework for 
assessing/evaluating common patient symptoms and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment plan dependent upon the symptoms uncovered.  After each visit, a summary of the treatment plan will be relayed to the patient’s care team 
at the Center on Aging and/or the House Call program.  
 
Data collection  
Patient variables will be collected from 
the electronic medical record and are 
detailed in Table 1 . Validated surveys and 
questions will be administered to the 
caregiver via phone by a research 
assistant. Caregivers will be assessed on 
the measures listed in Table 2  at various 
timepoints in the intervention. Participants 
will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_838318] -intervention 
survey phone call.

3.2 Interviews, Focus Groups, Surveys, and/or Observations  
 
A. Administration  
For Aim 1 of the study, participants will be interviewed for up to 60 minutes  to provide feedback on 
the I-HoME intervention. The same participants will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 2 months to provide 
additional feedback on the adapted version intervention; a follow- up questionnaire has been 
submitted to the IRB .  
 
For Aim 2  of the study, questions will be administered to participants ( family caregivers ) at the first 
visit and within a week of completion of each televisit . Data from the subject’s medical record will be 
obtained that are relevant to the study objectives  (Table 2) . 
B. Study Instruments  
For Aim 1, demographic measures will be collected from participants.  A semi -structured interview 
guide will be used to conduct interviews, with open- ended questions . 
 
For Aim 2, baseline demographic measures will be collected from the family caregiver and  from the 
patient’s medical record  (see Table 1). Caregivers will be administered baseline, in- study, and post -
intervention measures as outlined in Table 2.

 7. Data Reporting / Regulatory Considerations  
 
7.1 Data Collection  
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture data (Demographic, medical and 
survey data) for all enrolled subjects.  
 
IRB Protocol #: 23 -01025643 
Version Date:  June 3, 2024  
 
Page # 8 
 7.1.1 REDCap  
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software system that is 
fully supported by [CONTACT_57421] -Cornell Medical Center CTSC. It is a tool for the creation of 
customized, secure data management systems that include Web -based data -entry forms, 
reporting tools, and a full array of security features including user and group- based privileges, 
authentication using institution LDAP system, with a full audit trail of data manipulation and export 
procedures. REDCap is maintained on CTSC -owned servers that are backed up nightly and 
support encrypted (SSL- based) connections. National ly, the software is developed, enhanced, 
and supported through a multi -institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_838333]/Ethics Committee Approval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained before study initiation.  
Before initiation of the study at each study center, the protocol, the ICF, other written material given to the patients, and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the 
appropriate Ethics Committee. Written approval of the study and al l relevant study information 
must be obtained before the study center can be initiated or the IP is released to the Investigator. 
Any necessary extensions or renewals of IEC/IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the 
study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The written 
approval of the IEC/IRB together with the approved ICF must be filed in the study files.  
The Investigator will report promptly to the IEC/IRB any new information that may adversely affect 
the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. The Investigator will submit written 
summaries of the study status to the IEC/IRB as required. On com pletion of the study, the IEC/IRB 
will be notified that the study has ended.  
 
All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly recorded on a protocol amendment form and will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_86317]. All protocol amendments will 
be submitted to the relevant institutional IEC/IRB for approval before implementation, as required 
by [CONTACT_427]. The only exception will be when the amendment is necessary to eliminate 
an immediate hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the necessary action will be taken first, 
with the relevant protocol amendment following shortly thereafter.  
Once protocol amendments or consent form modifications are implemented at the lead site, Weill 
Cornell Medicine, updated documents will be provided to participating sites. Weill Cornell 
Medicine must approve all consent form changes prior to local IRB subm ission.  
Relevant study documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the participating 
countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and approval before the beginning 
of the study. On completion of the study, the regulatory aut horities will be notified that the study 
has ended.

 8. Statistical Considerations  
Aim 1  
Audio recordings from interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Content analysis
29, a method for classifying 
verbal and behavioral data into categories of similar meaning, will be used to analyze data. A deductive approach will be implemented. During open coding, short sections of text representing discrete concepts will 
be identified from transcripts and tagged with a code. This will be followed by [CONTACT_154286], which involves 
comparing codes within and across interviews. Lastly, axial coding, where codes are compared between 
transcripts to develop a set of categories and/or themes, will be the third step of the coding pr ocess. A code 
book will be developed to systematize data analysis and ensure findings are reproducible. Interrater reliability 
and trustworthiness will be evaluated as part of the qualitative analytic process.

 backgrounds will independently review and code the transcripts. Discrepancies will be resolved through 
discussion until consensus is reached.  
 Aim 2  
Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_629067], attrition rates, adherence to the study protocol, 
hardware issues, software issues, and use of the intervention (e.g., frequency and duration of visits). Within study measures will be collected after every video visit to examine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. 
Furthermore, an acceptabil ity questionnaire will be administered at the end of the study to caregivers to obtain 
feedback on the intervention as a whole.  
Quantitative care outcomes being collected fall into three main categories: patient outcomes (e.g., symptom -
related measures), caregiver outcomes (e.g., burden, depression, anxiety, satisfaction , preparedness, 
competence, caregiver health), and healthcare utilization outcomes (e.g., number of visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
Given the scope of this proposal, the number of caregiver participants (n= 30) proposed for this study is aimed 
at establishing feasibility and acceptability and not efficacy. However, we will conduct preliminary efficacy analysis on outcomes at baseline and post intervention. Looking at pain (Doloplus -2 scale) as one of the 
secondary outcomes, with the assumption of a 40% improvement in scores based on a mean of 8.3 and SD of 
6.531, there will be 80% power to detect an effect size of d=0.5, which is considered a moderate effect.

     Intervening in Food Insecurity to Reduce and Mitigate (InFoRM) Childhood Obesity  National Clinical Trial (NCT) Identified Number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_329853], MD, MPH Sponsor: [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 2023-01-23  Description: Study protocol and analysis plan   
   STUDY PROTOCOL BACKGROUND “Food is medicine” focuses on the integration of food and nutrition interventions, also referred to as nutrition security, in the healthcare system. Medically tailored meal (MTM) programs have been shown to reduce food insecurity, improve dietary quality, and decrease healthcare utilization for adults with chronic illnesses.41,[ADDRESS_407605] for Medicaid in some states, including MA, CA, NY, and MI, to reimburse MTMs and similar nutrition support for eligible adults. Meal kits with step-by-step home preparation instructions, which further provide nutrition education alongside healthy food, are an innovative adaptation to MTMs. EatWell, a [LOCATION_011]-based company, provides healthy, culturally tailored meal kits with fresh ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes to food-insecure populations. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_329854], there is a major knowledge gap and a lack of evidence to support nutrition security interventions such as meal kits to treat obesity and nutritional disorders in children and families. But the potential is substantial since childhood is an important period where health behaviors such as diet can set the stage for cardiometabolic health over the lifespan.3,4 SPECIFIC AIM Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a 6-week meal kit delivery program using a randomized, cross-over trial design in 30 families with children (6-11 years old) with food insecurity and obesity.   DESIGN  Study Design & Population: Drawing from children who receive primary care at [LOCATION_011] Children’s at Martha Eliot Health Center (Martha Eliot), we will recruit dyads (child + primary caregiver/parent). Martha Eliot serves families who are predominantly publicly insured (~75%) and self-identify as Hispanic or Latinx (~70%). Prior to the pandemic, ~12% of families at Martha Eliot reported food insecurity. Children with BMI ³95th percentile and a positive screen for food insecurity screened routinely on the 2-item Hunger Vital Sign™[ADDRESS_407606] also chosen this design because it provides a randomized control trial method. Inclusion Criteria: Dyads (also referred to as “participants”) including children who are 1) 6 to 11 years old 2) with a BMI ³95th percentile 3) screened positive on the 2-item Hunger Vital Sign™ 4) in a household of £5 people, 5) living with an English and/or Spanish-speaking caregiver and 6) living within the EatWell delivery map boundaries in the greater [LOCATION_011] area. Exclusion Criteria: Participants (either child or parent) with a history of 1) food allergies or intolerance to dairy, gluten, soy, or any potential component of the meal kit; 2) malabsorptive intestinal disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, celiac disease); 4) type 1 or 2 diabetes; 5) solid tumor or bone marrow transplant; or 6) enteral tube dependence. Intervention: EatWell meal kits will be delivered once weekly to households for 6 weeks. Healthy meal kits are developed by a trained chef and registered dietician. Each household will receive one meal kit per week.  Randomization: Participants will be randomized to one of two intervention sequences: A) Meal kit intervention without delay followed by [CONTACT_329859] + pantry referral (standard of care) B) Newsletter + pantry referral followed by [CONTACT_329860] a delay of 8 weeks The printed newsletter lists additional local food assistance resources.  Sampling/Power: A pi[INVESTIGATOR_329855] “a small-scale test of the methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale.”[ADDRESS_407607] of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. The planned sample of 30 dyads (a total of 30 children + 30 caregivers) is based on practical considerations, including participant flow, budgetary constraints, and the number needed to reasonably evaluate the feasibility of the intervention.  Study Visits: We have outlined the three study visits (Table 1), which will initially collect baseline demographic, medical and dietary history, provide questionnaires, and measure weight and height. Follow-up visits will be 
  conducted between Periods 1 and 2 (6 weeks), and then after Period 2 (14 weeks). Follow-up visits will include dietary assessments and questionnaires and measure the children’s weight and height.   Table 1. Outline of study visits and measures collected Study Visit Measures V1, in-person: Participants will meet with the study physician and research assistant to review eligibility criteria and obtain informed consent (including assent from eligible participants).  • Baseline demographics: age, sex, insurance type, and race and ethnicity. • Medical history: to assess for underlying gastrointestinal, endocrinologic, cardiometabolic, allergic conditions, and current and past medication history.  • Dietary assessment   • Questionnaires  • Anthropometrics: weight, height, and calculated BMI for each child V2, in-person:  Participants will meet with the research assistant. • Dietary assessment • Questionnaires  • Anthropometrics V3, in-person: Participants will meet with the study physician and research assistant.  • Dietary assessment • Questionnaires  • Anthropometrics  Study Outcomes: The primary, intention-to-treat analysis will examine the feasibility of the meal kit delivery intervention. We will assess primary outcomes of feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, adherence, protocol, and assessments.7 Primary outcomes will be assessed throughout the study. We will assess secondary outcomes of the intervention’s short-term impact, which will include questionnaires on food insecurity and anthropometrics. Secondary outcomes will be assessed at Visits 1-3. We will additionally include the assessments we plan to include in a future RCT, including diet quality, mealtime behaviors, and perceived stress.  Analysis Plan: Consistent with the goal of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], our analysis will be mainly descriptive.[ADDRESS_407608] and describe dietary quality and mealtime behaviors, among other assessments, and EHR data. We will present secondary outcomes as means (with standard deviations) or proportions.    
   ADVERSE EVENT CRITERIA AND REPORTING PROCEDURES This proposal seeks to pi[INVESTIGATOR_329856] a nutrition security intervention using weekly meal kit delivery in food-insecure families with children 6 to 11 years old with obesity. This intervention will be tested at [LOCATION_011] Children’s at Martha Eliot Health Center. This proposed study will leverage the existing partnership with EatWell meal kits. EatWell meal kits are prepared at Commonwealth Kitchen in [LOCATION_011], MA, which adheres to a rigorous food safety program and complies with National Restaurant Association ServeSafe requirements and FDA requirements, and other applicable regulations, in addition to being regularly inspected by [CONTACT_329861]. The meal kits occasionally contain gluten and diary, but do not contain tree nuts or peanuts, although they are manufactured in a shared use facility and the product may contain trace amounts of Milk, Eggs, Fish, Shellfish, Tree Nuts, Peanuts, Wheat, and Soy. Any patients with food allergies or intolerance to potential components of EatWell meal kits will be excluded from participation to avoid any risk of allergic reaction to any of the meals. Therefore, this study poses minimal risk to participants.  We will obtain approval from the [LOCATION_011] Children’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each of the aims, and we will participate in their standard annual continuing review process. We will also require that all staff and investigators working on this project complete human subjects research training. We will establish a data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) that will meet every [ADDRESS_407609]-protected computers and identified with study IDs. Analytic data files will contain no identifying information. No study report will allow identification of individual participants. Individual patient data collected as part of the intervention surveys or interviews will be kept confidential. Access to identifiable information will be strictly limited to study personnel who require such information to complete the work (e.g., study physician and research coordinator). Whenever possible, printed materials that contain identifying information (e.g. thank you letters) will contain no information revealing diagnoses, treatment, or other clinical information. All study staff will have CITI certifications and will be trained in IRB protocols.   STATISTICAL POWER AND SAMPLE CONSIDERATIONS STATISTICAL DESIGN             We will use a randomized, cross-over trial study design. We also chose this design because it provided a randomized control trial method. Participants will be individually randomized to one of two intervention sequences: A) Meal kit intervention without delay followed by [CONTACT_329859] + pantry referral (standard of care) B) Newsletter + pantry referral followed by [CONTACT_329860] a delay of [ADDRESS_407610], and implementation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_329857] a meal kit delivery program. Results will be used to refine the intervention for a larger scale trial. The sample of 30 families is based on practical considerations, including participant flow, budgetary constraints, and the number needed to reasonably evaluate feasibility goals.

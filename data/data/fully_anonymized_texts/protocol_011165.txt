The safety endpoints are as follows: 
• Incidence of adverse events throughout the study 
• Vital sign s assessments throughout the study 
• Oropharyngeal examination findings at each visit 
• Physical examination findings at baseline and at week 12 or at the IMP discontinuation visit (IMPDV) 
General Design:  Patients meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none  of the exclusion criteria 
at the screening visit (SV) will begin a 14 - to 30- day run -in period. An albuterol/salbutamol 
hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered -dose inhaler (MDI) (a short- acting β
[ADDRESS_27575] [SABA] 
inhaler) will be provided to replace the patient’s current rescue medication and is to be used as 
needed for relief of asthma symptoms during the run-in and treatment periods, with a maximum 
of [ADDRESS_27576] discontinue all nonstudy asthma -related drugs and instead take a patient -blinded MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28297] (1  inhalation twice daily).  
The study consists of 3 periods as follows: 
• Patient -blinded run-in period: SV to RV, up to 30 days 
• Double-blind, randomized treatment period: RV through the TV6, approximately 12 weeks  
• Follow-up period: TV6 through the follow-up visit (FV), approximately 7 days after TV6 
A prescreening visit may be conducted, if needed, before the SV to discuss study procedures and/or provide patient instructions about any required washout periods for prohibited medications. The SV may take place during several investigational center visits.  
At the prescreening or SV, the patient or parent/legal guardian must provide informed consent, and patients must give assent (as applicable) before any study procedures are performed. At the time of informed consent, the parent/legal guardian will be counseled that, once randomized to 
treatment, patients are to remain in the study and complete all study procedures unless the choice 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
8 is made to withdraw consent. This includes patients who may require alternative asthma therapy, 
experience an adverse event, violate the protocol, or fail to comply with study procedures. 
Continued patient participation is important to contribute to the sc ientific investigation. Patients 
who are being treated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without a long- acting 
β2-agonist (LABA) and/or with a noncorticosteroid (NCS) therapy are eligible to be included in 
the study. Patients must meet washout period requirements at the SV for their asthma and non-asthma disallowed medications according to  Appendix H . The patient’ s asthma medicatio n 
regimen must be stable for 30 days prior to the SV (except as adjusted at an optional prescreening visit to wash out prohibited medications). If the patient has taken asthma maintenance medication the morning of the SV or SABA within 6 hours of lung function 
assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28400], the visit must be rescheduled so that lung 
function assessments and response to bronchodilator testing can be completed as described (other 
assessments not involving lung function may be completed that da y). 
Patients will be provided with a handheld device at the SV, which will be used to measure lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and will serve as an electronic patient diary to collect 
asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and IMP use. Screening lung function 
assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28401] [ADDRESS_27577] failed screening for inability to perform lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) in a technically acceptable manner or due to 
FEV 1 not meeting the in clusion criterion or demonstrated <10% response to a bronchodilator 
may retest once within [ADDRESS_27578], patients (or patient’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver) will report if there have been any adverse events, changes in medications, or changes in medical history since providing consent/assent  (as applicable) . Patients who fail again to demonstrate technically acceptable lung 
function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) or due to FEV 1 not meeting the inclusion criterion or who 
demonstrate <10% response to a bronchodilator will be considered screen failures. The run-in period will not start until patients have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. Patients who fail to meet the requirements to enter the run -in period at this visit will be 
considered screen failures and will not be allowed to be rescreened.  
Patients who qualify for entry into the placebo run-in period must discontinue all currently administered asthma medications (including leukotriene modifiers prescribed for other 
conditions) until completion of the TV6 (week 12) visit or IMPDV if, in the investigator’s judgment, there would be no inherent harm in changing the patient’s treatment and the patient or 
parent/legal guardian provides consent/assent (as applicable). Patients will be provided with 
albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90  mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent as rescue medication. During 
the run-in period (SV to RV), in addition to the above rescue medication, patients will be 
provided with a patient-blinded placebo MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28298] t wice -daily use after appropriate 
training and demonstration of proper technique. 
All patients who enter the placebo run-in period will perform daily morning and evening lung 
function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28402]– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
9 daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores, rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use, and 
morning and evening IMP dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.  
Patients who experience an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_28299] (URI) or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (LRI) 
during the run-in period should be classified as randomization failures and be discontinued from 
the study but may be rescreened 2 weeks after resolution of the infection. Patients who are 
rescreened will need  to repeat all screening procedures and evaluations. Only 1 rescreening for 
each patient will be permitted.  
Patients who entered the run- in period with response to a bronchodilator ≥10% and <14.50% 
must present for repeat lung function assessments and another bronchodilator test within 14±[ADDRESS_27579] a 15% response to a bronchodilator. If 
the criteria are not met, patients may continue in the run -in period for up to 14 additional days to 
meet the lung function assessment and response to bronchodilator criteria (1 final attempt) for 
randomization. Patients may only continue in the run-in period if the investigator determines, by 
[CONTACT_28403]’s asthma status (at each investigational center visit), that it is saf e for the 
patient to continue. Patients who have entered the run-in period but fail to demonstrate 
technically acceptable lung function assessments and response to a bronchodilator (as described) 
will be considered to have failed randomization. All patient s must demonstrate at least a 
15% response to a bronchodilator at the SV or during the run-in period. Patients who 
demonstrate the response to bronchodilator during the run-in period may present for 
randomization the following day at the earliest or at another later time as long as it is within the 
30-day allowance for the run -in period. Responses to a bronchodilator of 14.50% to 14.99% will 
be rounded to 15%.  
At the RV (end of run-in period, TV1), patients will be assessed for randomization. Patients who 
meet all randomization inclusion criteria and continue meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be stratified by [CONTACT_28404] (ICS or NCS) and randomly assigned 
into the double-blind treatment period of the study in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to Fp MDPI 25 mcg, 
Fp MDPI 50 mcg, FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg, or placebo MDPI, twice daily (see Table 1 ). Patients 
will be instructed to take 1  inhalation from the assigned device twice daily approximately 
12 hours apart.

During the treatment period (RV through TV6 [week 12] or IMPDV), daily in the morning and 
evening at approximately the same time each day, patients will use the handheld device at home 
to record asthma symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use, after which 
they will perform lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) and then will take their dose of the 
IMP and record IMP dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.

At the investigational center, after appropriate instruction and training (competent handheld device use and dosing technique using the training devices provided), patients will perform their lung function assessment (FEV
1 and PEF) under the supervision of the investigational center 
staff. They will then take their morning dose of the IMP unless IMP has been withdrawn. IMP administration at the investigational center should be timed so that lun g function assessments 
will be approximately [ADDRESS_27582]

although the patients will not be taking a dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately 
[ADDRESS_27583] FEV 1 value from 
3 acceptable and 2  repeatable maneuvers (maximum of [ADDRESS_27584]) will be obtained 
before and 1-hour after the morning dose.  
At each visit, the investigational center staff will determine if patients have experienced any 
adverse events, changes in medical history, changes in medication, or any difficulty following study procedures. The C- ACT will be completed by [CONTACT_28406]’s parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver ( as applicable) at the investigational center, before any other assessments are 
performed, at specified visits. The same parent/legal guardian/caregiver should complete the assessments at each visit, if possible.
  
A telephone call may be conducted as needed  during the alternate, non- visit weeks (weeks 5, 7, 
etc) to monitor the patients’ safety and to assess their asthma status or for any other relevant reason.  
At the end of the study, a FV (which may be a follow-up investigational center visit or telephone 
call) will be conducted 7±2  days after TV6 (week 12) to monitor safety of the patients.  
Patients who meet the alert criteria for worsening asthma as defined for this study or experience 
worsening of asthma including asthma exacerbation will present to the investigational center for 
an investigator assessment as soon as possible. If possible and when it is judged safe to do so, this visit should be conducted before a change in asthma therapy takes place. Following 
investigator assessment of the patient’s asthma status a decision will be made whether or not it is 
safe for a patient to continue the IMP. In cases where the IMP is to be withdrawn and alternative therapy started, the investigational center staff should contact [CONTACT_28407]. In the event that it is considered in the best interest of a patient to stop the IMP and 
initiate an alternative asthma therapy, the patient will undergo all visit procedures required for the IMPDV. After the IMPDV, IMP dosing will not occur. The investigator should discuss and 
implement alternative asthma treatment that is appropriate for the patient. These patients will

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
11 continue to participate in all study visits as scheduled and continue to complete all morning and 
evening study procedures excep t for the IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1-hour 
postdose lung function assessments at the remaining treatment visits; although the patients will 
not be taking a dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately 1 hour after the predose 
lung function assessments were obtained. If a patient or patient’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver 
elects to completely withdraw from the study  (ie, withdraw consent) prior to the investigator 
assessment or investigational center visit, irrespective of the re ason for the study discontinuation, 
every attempt will be made to conduct the IMPDV subsequent to the patient’s withdrawal from the IMP.  
Asthma exacerbation that requires a change in medication or worsening of asthma that requires 
the patient to be treated  with alternative therapy will be entered into the case report form (CRF), 
including the date at which any medication change was made and whether this medication 
change was implemented prior to or after the IMPDV  lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) 
were completed. Asthma worsening including asthma exacerbations with a change to alternative 
asthma therapy will not be considered an adverse event for this study since it is an expected outcome for this study in an asthmatic patient population. Asthma exacerbations that meet the criteria for a serious adverse event will be recorded as adverse events.  
At TV6 (week 12), or the IMPDV as applicable, the investigator will discuss asthma treatment with the patient after safety assessments have been completed, and  any medication started for the 
purpose of newly recommended asthma treatment will not be considered a protocol violation. This asthma therapy will be recorded in the CRF following IMP discontinuation (planned or unplanned). Additionally, an investigationa l center visit may be conducted at any time at the 
request of the patient or parent/legal guardian/caregiver, as applicable or at the discretion of the investigator.  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_18651], physical examination, oropharyngeal examination, and 
recording of adverse events. In addition, during the study, PEF and FEV
1 will be monitored as 
part of safety monitoring (alert criteria for worsening asthma) . Any visual evidence of oral 
candidiasis during the treatment period will be confirmed by [CONTACT_28408] a swab for culture of the 
suspect area. Patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will be provided with guidelines for 
when to contact [CONTACT_28409]. Patients who meet pred efined alert criteria should be evaluated by [CONTACT_28410]. If a patient discontinues the IMP prematurely but remains in the study, all subsequent visits will include all assessments according to the study procedures and assessme nts table except for IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1 -

limit (see Section  6.1.3) calculated at the SV for the run -in period and at baseline for 
the treatment period on 4 or more days (do not have to be consecutive) out of any 7-day period (7-day period is defined as any consecutive 7 days following the RV and can overlap with scheduled study investigational center visits).  
• Based upon a review of patient data from the patient diary built into the handheld device, the patient has experienced any of the following during a 7-day period (7- day 
period is defined as any consecutive 7 days following a previous TV; 7 days can overlap with scheduled study investigational center visits): 
− 3 or more days in which 8 or more inhalations/day of rescue medication 
(albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI [90 mcg ex -actuator] or equivalent) were used 
(any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
− 3 or more days in which the patient experienced a nighttime asthma symptom score of more than 2 (any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
Patients who meet the alert criteria and/or who experience a clinically meaningful worsening of their asthma will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. If the investigator considers it is not possible to safely manage a patient in a blinded manner as patient’s asthma warrants a change in his/her 
asthma treatment, the IMP will be stopped, and appropriate treatment (based on the 
investigator’s judgment) should be offered. The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_28412]. The patient should continue in the study until the patient has completed all remaining study visits and the FV.  
• For the purpose of this study, an asthma exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than IMP and study rescue 
medication. Significant treatment includes the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or the addition of other ICS-containing asthma medications, LABAs, or other NCS 
asthma medications, for example, inhaled short- acting muscarinic antagonist; 
emergency room (ER)/urgent care clinic visit; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A single dose 
of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol would not meet the criteria for an asthma 
exacerbation. ER/urgent care clinic v isits where the treatment is limited to a single 
dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of an asthma 
exacerbation.  
After the last TV (TV6, week 12), the patient will enter the follow -up period. One week 
(±2 days) after the last T V, the patient will have a FV. This FV may be in person or over the 
telephone. The patient will be deemed to have completed the treatment period if they have 
completed all periods of the study, including screening, run- in, and all TVs. The patient will be 
deemed to have completed the study period if they have completed all periods of the study, 
including FV in addition to screening, run-in, and all TVs. Patients who stop IMP and return for safety evaluation at week [ADDRESS_27586] completed the treatment period.

13 Brief Summary of Study Design for the Trial Registry(s):  This study will evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28301] a documented history of 
persistent asthma.  
Method of Randomization and Blind ing: This is a double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo -controlled, randomized clinical study. Patients who meet all randomization criteria at the 
RV will be stratified by [CONTACT_28404] (ICS or NCS) and randomly assigned into a 
1:1:1:1 ratio to receive Fp MDPI 25 mcg, Fp MDPI 50 mcg, FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg, or placebo 
MDPI, twice daily, for the entire treatment period. Randomization will be assigned via 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Patients being treated with a combination of ICS/NCS will be stratified as an ICS patient. Approximately 206 patients will be randomized into each 
treatment group. After the run- in period, patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will 
remain blinded to randomized treatment assignment during the study. In addition, the 
investigator and the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP 
identity after the run -in period until the database is locked for analysis and the treatment 
assignment is revealed.

Randomization Criteria:  
The following criteria must be fulfilled at the RV: 
a. The patient continues to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.  
n. The average of the [ADDRESS_27591] values for trough morning FEV 1 obtained at home (by 
[CONTACT_28400]) out of the last 7 days prior to RV is within 40% to 85% predi cted 
for age, height, sex, and race ( Quanjer et al 2012).  
o. The patient’s C -ACT score at the RV is ≤19.  
p. The patient has demonstrated at least a 15% response to a bronchodilator from 
baseline FEV 1 within 30 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol HFA 
MDI (90 mcg ex-actuator) or equivalent at SV or during the run-in period as 
measured by [CONTACT_28400]. Note: The RV may not be conducted on the same day 
as the response to bronchodilator testing. 
q. The patient has had  no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, 
excluding the albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90 mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent 
used as rescue medication or run-in placebo MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28305].  
r. The patient has not had a URI or LRI during the run-in period. Patients who develop 
a URI or LRI during the run-in period may be discontinued from the study and 
allowed to rescreen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.  
s. The patient has had no asthma exacerbation during the run-in period, defined as any 
worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than rescue 
albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90 mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent or the patient’s 
run-in MDPI. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids, inhaled 
corticostero ids or other medications used to control asthma or are prohibited 
medications ( Appendix H ), and/or ER/urgent care clinic visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: 
A single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria for an 
asthma exacerbation. Emergency room/urgent car e clinic visits where the treatment is 
limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of 
an asthma exacerbation.  
t. The patient has no clinical visual evidence (on oropharyngeal examination) of oropharyngeal candidiasis.  
u. The patient has not experienced an adverse event that would result in failure to continue to meet selection criteria.

PEF) by [CONTACT_28415] 5 or more of the 7 days immediately preceding the RV 
− recording of morning and evening IMP use on 5 or more of the 7 days immediately preceding RV  
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size Rationale:  Sample size and power calculations are driven by [CONTACT_28416] 50/12.5 mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily in change from baseline in 1-hour postdose percent predicted morning FEV
1 at week 12 and the superiority 
of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily over placebo in change from baseline in percent predicted trough morning FEV
1 at week 12 .  
For the superiority comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily versus Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily, assuming that the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted 
morning FEV
1 at week 12 is analyzed using an ANOVA model with only a single fac tor of 
treatment group , the following assumptions were made: 
• The initial assumed common standard deviation (SD) was 9.3% and the true treatment difference was 4.5% between FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily. This assumption was  based on data collected in previous 
Teva studies  with the same Fp  MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28306] 12-week treatment period and based on office-based spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
• The initial power was 97% at a 2 -sided significance level  of 5%.  
For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo, assuming that 
the change from baseline in percent predicted trough morning FEV
1 at week 12 is analyzed using 
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with only a single fact or of treatment group, the 
following assumptions were made: 
• The initial assumed common standard deviation (SD) was 13.25% and the true 
treatment difference was 5% between Fp MDPI [ADDRESS_27593] in adult asthma patients and based on office- based spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
• The initial power was 85% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5%.  
This study FSS- AS-[ADDRESS_27594] Teva's study in which the handheld spi[INVESTIGATOR_28307] a pediatric asthma patient population , the 
target population of this study. A blinded sample size reassessment was not planned for this 
study. However, routine blinded data monitoring of this study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] revealed that a few 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
19 patietnts showed nonphysiologic (~200% of percent predicted FEV 1) changes from baseline. 
This triggered a blinded sample size reassessment that showed that the overall mean change from 
baseline and SD for  the overall study population is higher than the initial assumptions based on 
the office spi[INVESTIGATOR_28308] . In addition, monitoring of FEV [ADDRESS_27595] efforts in this young patient population, despi[INVESTIGATOR_28309]. Therefore, some of the initial assumptions and the sample size described above were revised to the following: 
• For the superiority comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily versus Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily, the SD was revised to 22% and the overall mean change from baseline was revised to 6.5% (blinded SD observed after 427 patients completed week 12 of this study (excluding IMPD )) and the power down to 80%.  
• With these assumptions, [ADDRESS_27596] of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily. 
• For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo, the SD was revised to 17% and overall mean change from baseline was 5% (blinded SD observed after 434 patients completed week 12 of this study (excluding IMPD)) and the power was revised to 80%.  
• With these assumptions, [ADDRESS_27597] of Fp  MDPI 50  mcg twice daily versus placebo.  
Assuming a dropout rate of 12%, then 206 patients per treatment group in the 4 treatment groups, for a total of 824 patients, will be randomized (initial assumption for dropout rate was 15%).  
Primary Estimands and Efficacy Analysis:  
The specific estimands selected for the [ADDRESS_27598], 
potentially causing the study to fail due to the analysis rather than the effectiveness of the treatment given during the study. These patients no longer represent a true placebo population 
and including them in the population for the primary outcome is not consistent with treatment by 
[CONTACT_14296]. In light of this, retrieved dropout data will be used only for sensitivity analyses . Missing 
data for patients who discontinue IMP will be imputed using reference- based multiple 
imputations r epresenting a missing not a t random (MNAR) mechanism.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27599] day before randomization consists of the entry on the morning of the 
RV in the patient diary built into the handheld device . The weekly average of the percent 
predicted FEV 1 at week 12 will be the average values based on the available data at that week.  
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in weekly average of percent predicted morning FEV
1 at week 12 due to the initially randomized treatment as actually taken  will be 
analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to baseline percent 
predicted trough morning FEV 1, sex, age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS 
or NCS), and IMP treatment group. Contrasts for pairwise t reatment comparisons of interest will 
be constructed. The estimated treatment difference between each IMP treatment group and the 
placebo group will be presented together with the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference and the p -value.  
In this analysis, missing data that are caused by [CONTACT_28417] 
(regardless of availability of retrieved drop out data) will be imputed using reference- based 
multiple imputations. Details on the implementation of the multiple imputations will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
Analysis of the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted morning FEV 1 
at week 12  
For the endpoint of change from baseline in 1-hour postdose percent predicted morning FEV 1 
(measured at the clinic) at week 12, baseline is defined as predose FEV 1 measurements obtained 
at the clinic at the RV with the handheld device immediately prior to the IMP administration.    
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted morning 
FEV 1 at week 12 due to the initially randomized treatment as actually taken will be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline percent predicted trough morning FEV 1, 
sex, age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS or NCS), and IMP treatment group. Contrasts for pairwise treatment comparisons of interest will be constructed. The 
estimated treatment difference between each IMP treatment group and the placebo group will be 
presented together with the 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference and the p-value. Missing data 
caused by [CONTACT_28418] . 
Sensitivity Analysis  
To assess the impact of missing data , several sensitivity analy ses will be conducted for the 
2 endpoints by [CONTACT_28419].  More details will be provided in Section  9 of the 
protocol and the statistical analysis plan . 
• The primary analysis for the 2 endpoints will be repeated using data collected after IMP discontinuation (retrieved dropout data). Reference-based imputation will be used only for patients with no retrieved dropout data. This analysis estimates different estimands, namely the change from baseline as actually taken.  
• The primary analysis for the 2 end points will be repeated on completers with no major 
protocol violations. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
21 • A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_28310] a sensitivity analysis to missing data by 
[CONTACT_28420].  Only data collected 
prior to IMP discontinuation will be utitlized in this analysis. 
• “2-dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” will also be performed to assess shifts to the distribution 
apply to both placebo and active arms. 
• The primary analysis for the [ADDRESS_27600] ( see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of the protocol).  
• For the fi rst primary end point of change from baseline in the weekly average of percent 
predicted trough  morning FEV
1 over the 12- week treatment period, analysis  will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). This analy sis will not 
use retrieved drop out data. This analysis represents a missing at random assumption. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
For all secondary endpoints, analyses will be performed using the ITT analysis set and will not 
include retrieved dropout data in the analysis. 
Analyses of change from b aseline in weekly average of daily trough morning PEF, total daily use 
of albuterol/salbutamol, total daily asthma symptom score , and C-AC T score over the 12- week 
treatment period will be analyzed using an MMRM analysis with effects due to baseline, sex, 
age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS or NCS), treatment, time, and time-
by-treatment interaction. For all of these endpoints, the MMRM will use only observations 
collected until IMP discontinuation. 
The time to first onset of effect, defined as the first decrease from baseline in daily rescue 
medication use, will be analyzed using a log-rank test. Median and mean time to first onset of 
effect and associated 95% CIs will be estimated. Time to first onset of effect will also be displayed graphically with a Kaplan -Meier figure.  
The proportion of patients who discontinued from IMP for asthma exacerbation during the 12-week treatment period will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with effects due to 
previous therapy (ICS or NCS) and treatment. These patients will be considered as nonresponders in this analysis. 
Other Efficacy Analysis: Statistical methods to be used for other efficacy endpoints will be 
described and detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity:  A fixed -sequence testing procedure will be employed 
to control the overall Type I error rate at the 2 -sided 0.05 level for the co-primary endpoints. The 
sequential order of comparisons will be as follows:  
1. 1-hour postdose perc ent predicted FEV
1 comparing FS MDPI 50/12.[ADDRESS_27601] is not 
significant at the 2 -sided 0.05 level, no further tests will be performed.

large Phase 3 study in a pediatric asthma patient population (4 to 11 years of age), an unplanned 
blinded sample size reassement was conducted. Since the adjustment to sample size was based on blinded standard deviation, no adjustment to the multiplicity control is warrented. 
Multiplicity control for the secondary endpoints and the sequential order of the secondary 
endpoints will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for other efficacy analyses.

33 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFO RMATION 
1.1. Introduction  
An estimated 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, with the prevalence of asthma 
increasing in industrialized countries and in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] ( Beasley et al 2000 , Masoli et 
al 2004). The number of persons with asthma is estimated to reach 400 million by [CONTACT_2892] 2025, and the estimated worldwide death rate from asthma is 1 in every 250 deaths ( Masoli et al 2004).  
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), research by [CONTACT_28422], Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that asthma has been diagnosed in more than 
39 million people at some time ( National Health Interview Survey 2011 ), and in 2010, 
25.[ADDRESS_27617] asthma ( Akinbami et al 2012). In “Asthma’s Impact on the Nation,”  
the CDC estimates that in 2010 over 7 million children in the [LOCATION_003] had asthma, equal to 1 in 11 children; there were 10.5  million missed days of school due to asthma in 2008; and nearly 
1 in 5 children went to an emergency department for care in 2009. Estimates in the adult 
population for 2010 were over 18.7 million adults with asthma, equal to 1  in 12 adults, with 
14.2 million missed days of work due to asthma in 2008. Asthma limits daily activity for 
3 in 5 persons with asthma, and about 9 people die from asthma each day ( CDC 2012).  
The characteristic feature of asthma is chronic airway inflammation. This inflammatory process includes mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (National Asthma  Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP] 2007). Symptoms of asthma 
include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, with symptoms often worse at night and in the early morning. The main pathological features of asthma are airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle dysfunction resulting in airway hyperresponsiveness 
with the predominant physiological feature being epi[INVESTIGATOR_28317] ( NAEPP 2007). Chronic inflamm ation in the airways may lead to permanent 
alterations to the airway structure, a process known as airway remodeling ( NAEPP 2007).  
The goal of pharmacologic therapy in asthma is to control chronic and nocturnal symptoms, maintain normal activity levels (including exercise), maintain near -normal pulmonary function, 
prevent acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_28318], minimize emergency room (ER) visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
and avoid adverse effects of asthma medications ( NAEPP 2007). Quick relief medications, such 
as short- acting β
2 agonists (SABAs) and anticholinergics are used to treat acute symptoms by 
[CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_28319]. Long -term control medications 
such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), cromolyn, immunomodulators, leukotriene modifiers, and 
long- acting β 2 agonists (LABAs) are used to achieve daily control of persistent asthma 
symptoms. Because of the complementary mechanisms of action of ICSs and LABAs, many 
asthma patients require treatment with both for optimal control of their asthma. Clinical 
programs conducted with currently marketed combination products have demonstrated that ICS/LABA combination products provide greater improvement in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 
1 second (FEV
1), peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF), and decreased exacerbations than either individual 
component alone in patients older than 12 years with persistent asthma ( Shrewsbury et al 2000 ). 
The rationale for use of such a comb ination therapy for the treatment of asthma is that it is 
scientifically sound (counteracting airway inflammation and smooth muscle dysfunction), 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
34 justifiable on therapeutic grounds (potential for improved compliance and convenience), and 
offers significant  clinical benefits.  
Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc. (Teva) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_28320] (Fp) inhalation powder products and a fixed-dose combination of fluticasone 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/salmeterol (FS) inhalation powder products, using Teva’s proprietary multidose dry 
powder inhaler (MDPI). Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_28321] a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti- inflammatory activity. Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) is a LABA. Inflammation is an 
important component of the pathophysiology of asthma, and corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit multiple inflammatory cells and mediators involved in the pathophysiology of asthma. 
The fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_28322] (Fp MDPI) is supplied in multiple 
dosage strengths of Fp (25, 50, and 100 mcg twice daily) for doses of 50, 100, and 200 mcg daily 
to patients ages 12 years and older requiring ICS therapy for treatment of asthma. The Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28323]
® DISKUS® (GlaxoSmithKline plc1), which is 
marketed at strengths of 50, 100, and 250 mcg for doses of 100 to 1000 mcg twice daily (adolescents and adults) and is the reference drug. The proposed Fp dose for study in patients 4 through 11 years of age is based on the adult dose- ranging study demonstrating efficacy of the 
25 and 50 mcg twice daily doses that are the same or lower than the currently approved doses of FLOVENT DISKUS and ADVAIR
® DISKUS® (GlaxoSmithKline plc2) in pediatric patients. 
Similarly, the proposed dose for salmeterol is based on the adult Phase 2 study, which 
demonstrated that the dose of 12.5 mcg twice daily was the optimal dose and resulted in less 
systemic exposure. Based on the results from the adult and adolescent Phase 3 clinical trials (New  Drug Applications [NDAs] submitted for Food and Drug Administration [FDA] review in 
March 2016), the 25- and 50-mcg twice daily doses (50/12.5 and 100/12.5 mcg, respectively) of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/salmeterol multidose dry powder inhaler ( FS MDPI) were  confirmed as 
appropriate for studies in patients [ADDRESS_27618], FS MDPI, is supplied in multiple dosage strengths of Fp 
with a fixed dosage of salmeterol (50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg) to allow for treatment of 
the entire spectrum of asthma patients ages 12 years and older for whom combination therapy is 
appropriate. The FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28324], which is 
marketed at doses of 100/50, 250/50, and 500/[ADDRESS_27619] ADVAIR DISKUS. The salmeterol in FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28325] 
(the conversion factor from salmeterol xinafoate salt to salmeterol free base is 0.6883). Salmeterol xinafoate will dissolve and dissociate into salmeterol free base (active moiety) in the lung to exert a therapeutic effect.  
The Teva device -formulation combination allows for concentrations of drug in the formulation to 
be significantly lower than ADVAIR DISKUS while achieving similar systemic exposure and clinical benefits.

35 The 100/12.5-cg dose of FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28326] 
100/50-mcg dose of ADVAIR DISKUS. The availability of the lowest FS MDPI [CONTACT_2715], 
50/12.5 mcg (which corresponds to the commonly used 100/50- mcg ADVAIR DISKUS dose), 
allows for lower exposure to Fp, as well as considerably less exposure to salmeterol. In a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the do se response, efficacy, and safety of FS MDPI, the Teva 
formulation of FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28327] (FS MDPI 100/12.[ADDRESS_27620] measurable drug concentration [AUC
0-t]=69.9 pg•hr/mL and maximum observed 
plasma drug concentration [C max]=35.8 pg/mL versus ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 mcg 
AUC 0-t=173.5 pg•hr/mL and C max=42.3 pg/mL; Study  FSS-AS-201).  
Multiple FS doses, with increasing levels of Fp, allow for treatment of patients with varying asthma severities and is consistent with asthma guidelines recommending a stepwise approach to ongoing asthma treatment; treatment is stepped up in patients with persistent symptoms or 
exacerbations and is stepped down once good asthma control is achieved and maintained (eg, the 
optimal step -up from Fp MDPI 50 mcg would be FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg). 
The availability of multiple dose levels is therefore advantageous to allow for adjustment of 
treatment in a stepwise approach  across a spectrum of asthma patients and symptoms, and helps 
to avoid underdosing or overdosing with ICS in the presence of a LABA. The goal of this study 
is to confirm the optimal dose of Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28328] 4 through 11 years old with persistent asthma. 
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies and clinical studies are provided in the following sections. More detailed information is provided in the Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28329]’s Brochures (IBs).

Salmeterol (SEREVENT® DISKUS®3) is a selective LABA that has demonstrated a prolonged 
duration of bronchodilator action. As a class, LABAs have been widely used in combination with 
ICS for the long- term maintenance treatment of asthma. Salmeterol inhalation aerosol was 
approved in [ADDRESS_27622] is currently available in the US.  
In the NDA submitted in March 2016, the proposed indication for Teva’s FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28333] 12  years and older. FS (ADVAIR DISKUS) is indicated for 
the long- term, twice -daily, maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 4 ye ars of age and older. 
For pediatric asthmatic patients ages 4 through 11 years, the recommended starting dosage is 
1 inhalation of the 100/50-mcg strength product twice daily. ADVAIR DISKUS is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 
Teva has co nducted a dose- ranging study in asthmatic patients to determine the optimal dose of 
salmeterol in FS MDPI. This study, FSS -AS-201, was performed in patients with mild asthma. 
Study FSS- AS-201 was performed as a blinded, single-dose, crossover study with 4 different 
strengths of salmeterol (all with 100 mcg of Fp) in the Teva MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28334] 
100 mcg in the Teva MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28335] 100/50 mcg. Results showed that the 12.5- and 25- mcg strengths of salmeterol in Teva’s FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28336] (as determined by [CONTACT_28424][INVESTIGATOR_038]) with 50  mcg of salmeterol in ADVAIR DISKUS 
100/50 mcg. The peak salmeterol concentration and exposure for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was lower than ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 mcg (data on file). 
Additional information about clinical studies with ADVAIR DISKUS in asthma patients is 
provided in the prescribing information, which is included as an appendix in the Teva FS MDPI

37 persistent asthma provides greater improvement in pulmonary function and overall asthma 
control than either component alone. The use of such a combination is recommended for the 
maintenance treatment of asthma in children, adolescents, and adults who remain symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_16866]- to-medium doses of an ICS in accordance with current guidelines for the 
management of asthma.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Risks of Test Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment  
The class effects of systemic and local corticosteroids include Candida albicans  infection, 
immunosuppression, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, paradoxical bronchospasm, growth effects, and glaucoma and cataracts.   
The class of LABAs, such as salmeterol, increases the risk of asthma- related death. Data from a 
large placebo -controlled study that compared the safety of salmeterol (SEREVENT Inhalation 
Aerosol [GlaxoSmithKline plc]) or placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma -related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol.  Currently available data are inadequate to 
determine whether concurrent use of ICSs with other long- term asthma control drugs mitigates 
the increased risk of asthma- related death from LABAs. Available data from controlled clinical 
trials suggest that LABA s increase the risk of asthma- related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28339]. Excessive beta- adrenergic stimulation has been associated with 
cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as seizures, angina, hypertension or hy potension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], nausea, 
dizziness, fatigue, malaise and insomnia. 
Based on extensive clinical experience with Fp alone and in combination with salmeterol, 
Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28340] h ave safety profiles (incidence, severity, and 
seriousness) that are comparable to those of FLOVENT DISKUS and ADVAIR DISKUS, 
respectively. However, Teva is developi[INVESTIGATOR_28341], but with comparable efficacy, relative to these currently marketed products.  
In studies in which all patients were ≥[ADDRESS_27623] common treatment -emergent 
adverse events in ≥3% of patients in the Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28342] (Teva Studies 
FpS-AS-101, FpS- AS-102, FpS- AS-201, FpS- AS-202, and FSS- AS-201) included 
nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI), headache, and nasal congestion.  
The most common adverse reactions (≥3%) in Phase 3, placebo- controlled clinical trials with 
Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28294] p roducts in adults included nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, back pain, 
headache, and cough.  In Studies FSS- AS-301 and FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE], asthma exacerbations were reported at a similar 
frequency among patients treated with Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28343] (<1% to 4%), 
while the incidence of asthma exacerbation was 11% in patients treated with placebo.  
For Study FSS -AS-305 in the ICS cohort, the incidence of asthma exacerbations was balanced 
between the mid -strength groups, while the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations was 6% for 
Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 0 for FLOVENT hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). For Study FSS-AS-305 in the 
ICS/LABA cohort, the incidence of asthma exacerbations was 15% in the FS MDPI  200/12.5 mcg group and 7% in the ADVAIR DISKUS group, while the incidence of 
severe asthma exacerbations was 6% and 5%, respectively. Four patients had treatment 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
38 discontinued, 3 patients were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28344] a severe asthma exacerbation, and 
5 patients had an ER/urgent care clinic visit (but were not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) because of an asthma 
exacerbation.  There was no apparent relationship with treatment group for these events. This 
open- label safety study was not designed to evaluate treatment differences in asthma 
exacerbation incidence. Prior history of asthma exacerbations was not collected and was not used to ensure proper balance in randomization across the treatment groups. Ad hoc statistical 
analyses were performed and confirmed the incidences were not different among all groups. The 
most likely explanation for the apparent differences are the rarity of the events and the smaller 
numbers of patients in the active comparator groups relative to the study drug groups (3:1 randomization ratio).  
The most common adverse events noted in adult and adolescent ast hmatic patients receiving 
ADVAIR DISKUS in repeat -dose, controlled clinical trials included URI, pharyngitis, 
headaches, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_28345], bronchitis, cough, and nausea and vomiting.  
In a study of pediatric patients randomly assigned to either ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50  mcg or Fp  
inhalation powder 100 mcg twice daily, aged 4 through 11 years who were receiving ICS at 
study entry, common adverse reactions (≥3% and greater than placebo) seen in the pediatric 
patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS  but not r eported in the adult and adolescent clinical trials 
included throat irritation and ear, nose, and throat infections.  
Complete safety information is available in the Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28346]. 
1.3.2. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study  
Based on extensive clinical experience with Fp and FS, Fp  MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28347] (incidence, severity, and seriousness) that are comparable to those of 
ADVAIR DISKUS. However, Teva is developi[INVESTIGATOR_28341], but with comparable efficacy, relative to these currently 
marketed products. 
The most common adverse events noted in adult and adolescent asthmatic patients receiving 
ADVAIR DISKUS in repeat -dose, controlled clinical trials included URI, pharyngitis, 
headaches, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_28345], bronchitis, cough, and nausea and vomiting. The 
most common adverse reactions noted in pediatric patients aged 4 through 11 years receiving 
ADVAIR DISKUS 100/[ADDRESS_27624] common adverse reactions (≥3%) in Phase 3, placebo-control led clinical trials with 
Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28348], oral 
candidiasis, back pain, headache, and cough. The safety profile is consistent with the known 
class of drugs and underlying diseases.  
The potential benefits will likely outweigh the risks for this study. Efficacy results of the well-controlled Phase 3 and Phase 2 studies demonstrated that Fp MDPI (50, 100, and 
200 mcg  bid) and FS MDPI (50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg bid) significantly improved

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
39 lung function, reduced rescue bronchodilator use, and improved asthma symptoms and quality of 
life in patients with asthma 12 years of age and older. Thus, Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28349], easily administered treatment options for these patients.  
Use of placebo -controlled study design in evaluating ICSs and other molecules is commonly 
used in developi[INVESTIGATOR_28350] ( eg, Kerwin et al 2 008, Woodcock et al 2013).  The design of this study is very 
similar to other pediatric placebo -controlled trials where adverse events in the placebo arm were 
similar to those in the treatment arms. The study has been designed to minimize the risks of placebo use to the intended population of patients 4 through 11 years of age . The patient 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to ensure that patients with severe asthma or 
history of life -threatening exacerbations would not be eligible. In this study, the patients ’ lung 
function, symptom scores, and rescue medication use will be monitored daily with use of a 
handheld device/electronic diary. The handheld device/electronic diary will provide alerts to the 
study center and medical monitor for the trial so that patients whose asthma status may be 
deteriorating will be captured early (Section  4.3.2). This will minimize the risk and asthma 
exacerbation as well as any discomfort that might come from an exacerbation. Additionally, use 
of the handheld device/electronic diary minimizes the burden of requiring patients to travel to the 
study center for monitoring. Patients assigned to placebo therapy often demonstrate improvement in lung function, suggesting that frequent contact [CONTACT_28425]. 
Additionally, all patients are provided with rescue albuterol/salbutamol for use as needed. 
Rescue albuterol /salbutamol usage will be followed closely for signs of deterioration.

42 3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. General Design and Study Schematic Diagram  
This is a Phase 3, 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the sa fety and efficacy of Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28351] 25 mcg, Fp MDPI 50 mcg, and FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg in pediatric patients with asthma. The total duration of patient participation in this study is approximately 15 to 17 weeks depending on the duration of the placebo run-in period.  
Patients meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the screening 
visit (SV) will begin a 14 - to 30-day run-in period. An albuterol/salbutamol 
hydrofluoroalkane (H FA) metered -dose inhaler (MDI) (a SABA inhaler) will be provided to 
replace the patient’s current rescue medication and is to be used as needed for relief of asthma symptoms during the run- in and treatment periods, with a maximum of [ADDRESS_27626] discontinue all nonstudy 
asthma -related drugs and instead take a patient -blinded MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28352] (1 inhalation 
twice  daily).  
The study consists of 3 periods as follows: 
• Patient -blinded run-in period: SV to RV, up to 30 days 
• Double-blind, randomized treatment period: RV through the TV6, approximately 
12 weeks  
• Follow-up period: TV6 through the follow-up visit (FV), approximately 7 days after TV6 
A prescreening visit may be conducted, if needed, before the SV to discuss study procedures and/or provide patient instructions about any required washout periods for prohibited medications. SV may take place during several investigational center visits.  
At the prescreening or SV, the patient or parent/legal guardian must provide informed consent, 
and patients must give assent (as applicable) before any study procedures are performed. At the 
time of informed consent, the parent/legal guardian will be counseled that, once randomized to 
treatment, patien ts are to remain in the study and complete all study procedures unless the choice 
is made to withdraw consent. This includes patients who may require alternative asthma therapy, 
experience an adverse event, violate the protocol, or fail to comply with study procedures. 
Continued patient participation is important to contribute to the scientific investigation. Patients who are being treated with an ICS with or without a LABA and/or with a noncorticosteroid 
(NCS) therapy are eligible to be included in the study. Patients must meet washout period 
requirements at the SV for their asthma and non- asthma disallowed medications according to 
Appendix H . The patient’s asthma medication regimen must be stable for 30 days prior to the SV 
(except as adjusted at an optional prescreening visit to wash out prohibited medications). If the patient h as taken asthma maintenance medication the morning of the SV or SABA within 
6 hours of lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28400], the visit must be 
rescheduled so that lung function assessments and response to bronchodilator testing can be 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
43 completed as described (other assessments not involving lung function may be completed that 
day).  
Patients will be provided with a handheld device at the SV, which will be used to measure lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and will serve as an electronic patient diary to collect 
asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and IMP use. Screening lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28401] [ADDRESS_27627] failed screening for inability to 
perform lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) in a technically acceptable manner or due to 
FEV 1 not meeting the inclusion criterion  or demonstrated <10% response to a bronchodilator 
may retest once within [ADDRESS_27628], patients (or patient’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver)  will report if there have been any 
adverse events, changes in medications, or changes in medical history since providing 
consent/assent. Patients who fail again to demonstrate technically acceptable lung function 
assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) or due to FEV 1 not meeting the inclusion criterion or  who 
demonstrate <10% response to a bronchodilator will be considered screen failures. The run-in 
period will not start until patients have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. Patients who fail to meet the requirements to enter the run -in period at this visit will be 
considered screen failures and will not be allowed to be rescreened.  
Patients who qualify for entry into the placebo run-in period must discontinue all currently administered asth ma medications (including leukotriene modifiers prescribed for other 
conditions) until completion of the TV6 (week 12) visit or IMPDV if, in the investigator’s 
judgment, there would be no inherent harm in changing the patient’s treatment and the patient or 
parent/legal guardian provides consent/assent (as applicable). Patients will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90  mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent as rescue medication. During 
the run-in period (SV to RV), in addition to the above rescue medica tion, patients will be 
provided with a patient-blinded placebo MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28353]- daily use after appropriate 
training and demonstration of proper technique. 
All patients who enter the placebo run-in period will perform daily morning and evening lung 
function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28426], rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use, and morning and evening IMP dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.  
Patients who experience an URI or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (LRI) during the run-in period 
should be classified as randomization failures and be discontinued from the study but may be 
rescreened 2 weeks after resolution of the infection. Patients who are rescreened will need to 
repeat all screening procedures and evaluations. Only 1 rescreening for each patient will be permitted.  
Patients who entered the run- in period with response to a bronchodilator ≥10% and <14.50% 
must present for repe at lung function assessments and another bronchodilator test within 
14±[ADDRESS_27629] a 15% response to a bronchodilator. If 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
44 the criteria are not met, patients may continue in the run -in period for up to 14 additional days to 
meet the lung function assessment and response to bronchodilator criteria (1 final attempt) for 
randomization. Patients may only continue in the run-in period if the investigator determines, by [CONTACT_28403]’s asthma status (at each investigational center visit), that it is safe for the 
patient to continue. Patients who have entered the run-in period but fail to demonstrate 
technically acceptable lung function assessments and response to a bronchodilator (as described) will be considered to have failed randomization. All patients must demonstrate at least a 
15% response to a bronchodilator at the SV or during the run-in period. Patients who 
demonstrate the response to bronchodilator during the run-in period may present for randomization the following day at the earliest or at another later time as long as it is within the 
30-day allowance for the run -in period. Responses to a bronchodilator of 14.50% to 14.99% will 
be rounded to 15%. 
At the RV (end of run-in period, TV1), patients will be assessed for randomization. Patients who 
meet all randomization inclusion criteria and continue meeting all inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria will be stratified by [CONTACT_28404] (ICS or NCS) and randomly assigned into the double-blind treatment period of the study in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to Fp MDPI 25 mcg, Fp 
MDPI 50 mcg, FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg, or placebo MDPI, twice daily (see Table 2). Patients will 
be instructed to take 1 inhalation from the assigned device twice daily approximately 12 hours apart.

During the treatment period (RV through TV6 [week 12] or IMPDV ), daily in the morning and 
evening at approximately the same time each day, patients will use the handheld device at home to record asthma symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamo l HFA MDI use, after which 
they will perform lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and then will take their dose of the 
IMP and record IMP dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.  
On the morning of each TV, patients will be instructed to record their asthma symptom score and 
rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use and complete their morning lung function 
assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28405], but to delay IMP dosing until they get 
to the investigational center. Patients are also to withhold their  rescue SABA for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_27630] been withdrawn from 
IMP but remain in the study should withhold their alternative asthma therapy dosing until after 
treatment visit assessments and avoid rescue medication for a minimum of 6 hours prior to clinic lung function assessments. The treatment visit should be rescheduled if either or both occur. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
45 At the investigational center, after appropriate instruction and training (competent handheld 
device use and dosing technique using the training devices provided), patients will perform their 
lung function assessment (FEV 1 and PEF) under the supervision of the investigational center 
staff. They will then take their morning dose of the IMP unless IMP has been withdrawn. IMP 
administration at the investigatio nal center should be timed so that lung function assessments 
will be approximately [ADDRESS_27631] 
been withdrawn from IMP will be asked to perform 1-hour postdose lung function assessments; although the patients will not be taking a dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately [ADDRESS_27632] F EV
1 value from 
3 acceptable and 2  repeatable maneuvers (maximum of [ADDRESS_27633]) will be obtained 
before and 1-hour after the morning dose.  
At each visit, the investigational center  staff will determine if patients have experienced any 
adverse even ts, changes in medical history, changes in medication, or any difficulty following 
study procedures. The C- ACT will be completed by [CONTACT_28406]’s parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver (as applicable) at the investigational center, before any other assessments are 
performed, at specified visits. The same parent/legal guardian/caregiver should complete the 
assessments at each visit, if possible.   
A telephone call may be conducted as needed during the alternate, non- visit weeks (weeks 5, 7, 
etc) to monitor the patients’ safety and to assess their asthma status or for any other relevant reason.  
At the end of the study, a FV (which may be a follow-up investigational center visit or telephone 
call) will be conducted 7±2  days after TV6 (week 12) to monitor safety of the patients.  
Patients who meet the alert criteria for worsening asthma as defined for this study or experience worsening of asthma including asthma exacerbation will present to the investigational center for 
an investigator assessment as  soon as possible. If possible and when it is judged safe to do so, 
this visit should be conducted before a change in asthma therapy takes place. Following 
investigator assessment of the patient ’s asthma status, a decision will be made whether or not it 
is safe for a patient to continue the IMP. In cases where the IMP is to be withdrawn and 
alternative therapy started, the investigational center staff should contact [CONTACT_28427]. In the event that it is considered in the best interest of a patient to stop the 
IMP and initiate an alternative asthma therapy, the patient will undergo all visit procedures 
required for the IMPDV. After the IMPDV, IMP dosing will not occur. The investigator should discuss and implement alternative asthma treatment that is appropriate for the patient. These 
patients will continue to participate in all study visits as scheduled and continue to complete all 
morning and evening study procedures except for IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1-hour postdose lung function assessments at the remaining treatment visits; although the 
patients will not be taking a dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately 1 hour after 
the predose lung function assessments were obtained. If a patient or patien t’s parent/legal 
guardian elects to completely withdraw from the study (ie, withdraw consent) prior to the 
investigator assessment or investigational center visit, irrespective of the reason for the study 
discontinuation, every attempt will be made to cond uct the IMPDV subsequent to the patient’s 
withdrawal from the IMP.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
46 Asthma exacerbation that requires a change in medication or worsening of asthma that requires 
the patient to be treated with alternative therapy will be entered into the case report form ( CRF), 
including the date at which any medication change was made and whether this medication 
change was implemented prior to or after the IMPDV  lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) 
were completed. Asthma worsening including asthma exacerbations with a change to alternative asthma therapy will not be considered an adverse event for this study since it is an expected outcome for this study in an asthmatic patient population. Asthma exacerbations that meet the criteria for a serious adverse event will be recorded as adverse events.  
At TV6 (week 12), or the IMPDV as applicable, the investigator will discuss asthma treatment with the patient after safety assessments have been completed, and any medication started for the 
purpose of newly recommended asthma treatment will not be considered a protocol violation. 
This asthma therapy will be recorded in the CRF following IMP discontinuation (planned or unplanned). Additionally, an investigational center visit may be conducted at any time at the 
request of the pat ient or parent/legal guardian/caregiver, as applicable or at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_18651], physical examination, oropharyngeal examination, and recording of adverse events. In addition, during the study, PEF and FEV
1 will be monitored as 
part of safety monitoring (alert criteria for worsening asthma). Any visual evidence of oral 
candidiasis during the treatment period will be confirmed by [CONTACT_19201] a swab for culture of the 
suspect area. Patients and parents/le gal guardians/caregivers will be provided with guidelines for 
when to contact [CONTACT_28428]. Patients who meet predefined alert criteria should be evaluated by [CONTACT_28410]. If a patient discontinues the IMP prematurely but 
remains in the study, all subsequent visits will include all assessments according to Table 3 except for IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1 -hour postdose lung function 
assessments at the remaining treatment visits; although the patients will not be taking a dose of IMP, t he assessment should be approximately [ADDRESS_27634] been designed to ensure patient safety. If any of the criteria listed below are met, during a scheduled or u nplanned study visit, the investigator (after 
discussion with the sponsor) will determine whether the patient’s overall clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_28300] (but not the 
study) to be placed on alternative asthma therapy in the interest of patient safety. Meeting 1 of 
these alert criteria does not automatically require a patient to be withdrawn from IMP, rather it 
requires a clinical evaluation to determine if the patient’s asthma can continue to be managed in 
a blinded manner per the study or necessitates a change in asthma therapy. All attempts will be made to safely continue to manage a patient in a blinded manner.

the treatment period on 4 or more days (do not have to be consecutive) out of any 7-day period (7-day period is defined as any consecutive 7 days following the RV and can overlap with scheduled study investigational center visits). 
• Based upon a review of patient data from the patient diary built into the handheld 
device, the patient has experienced any of the following during a 7-day period (7- day

(any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
− 3 or more days in which the patient experienced a nighttime asthma symptom score of more th an 2 (any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
Patients who meet the alert criteria and/or who experience a clinically meaningful worsening of their asthma will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. If the investigator considers it is not possible to 
safely manage a patient in a blinded manner as patient’s asthma warrants a change in his/her 
asthma treatment, the IMP will be stopped, and appropriate treatment (based on the 
investigator’s judgment) should be offered. The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_28412]. The patient should continue in the study until the patient has completed all remaining study visits and the FV.  
• For the purpose of this study, an asthma exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than IMP and study rescue medication. Significant treatment includes the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or the addition of other ICS-containing asthma medications, LABAs, or other NCS 
asthma medications, for example, inhaled short- acting muscarinic antagonist; 
ER/urgent care clinic visit(s) ; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A single dose of nebulized 
albuterol/salbutamol would not meet the criteria for an asthma exacerbation. ER/urgent care clinic visits  where the treatment is limited to a single dose of 
nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.  
After the last TV (TV6, week 12), the patient will enter the follow -up period. One week 
(±2 days ) after the last TV , the patient will have a FV. This FV may be in person or over the 
telephone. The patient will be deemed to have completed the treatment period if they have 
completed all periods of the study, including screening, run- in, and all TVs. The patient will be 
deemed to have completed the study period if they have completed all periods of the study, including FV in addition to screening, run-in, and all TVs. Patients who stop IMP and return for safety evaluation at week [ADDRESS_27635] completed the treatment period . 
The assessments and procedures performed during each study visit are detailed in Table 3 and Appendix B .

3.2. Planned Number of Patients and Countries  
The population planned to be enrolled in this study comprises male and female patients 
[ADDRESS_27636] a documented history of persistent asthma. Approximately 824 male and female patients, 206 patients in each of 4 treatmen t group, will be enrolled. 
Assuming a dropout rate of 12%, approximately 18 1 evaluable patients in each treatment group 
(724 total patients) will complete the [ADDRESS_27637] art in the fourth quarter of 2016 (first patient in) and last until 
approximately the second  quarter of 2019 (last patient last visit).  
3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population  
This is a standard study design used to determine the safety and efficacy of 3  investigational 
treatments in pediatric patients aged 4  through 11 years old with persistent asthma.  

 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27638] be in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition.  
3.4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23438]. During the conduct of the study, 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section 7.1.5) as they are reported from the 
investigational centers  to identify safety concerns.  
The study may be terminated by [CONTACT_23496].  
A patient may discontinue participation in the study at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_28429]; every effort should be undertaken to find out the reason for discontinuation. The investigator or sponsor can withdraw a patient from the study IMP at any time for any reason 
(eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined in Appendix C , noncompliance, or adverse event). 
However, patients that do not withdraw consent should remain in the study (as counseled during 
the informed consent process) and complete the remaining study procedures and visits, with the 
exception of IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1 -hour postdose lung function 
assessments at the remaining treatment visits; although the patients will not be taking a dose of 
IMP, the assessment should be approximately 1 hour after the predose lung function asse ssments 
were obtained.  
3.5. Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments  
Study procedures and assessments with their time points are summarized in Table 3. Detailed by-visit information is provided starting with  Appendix B , Part  11. Detailed descriptions of each 
assessment are provided in Section  6 (efficacy assessments) and Section  7 (safety assessments).

a Patients may attend a prescreening visit up to [ADDRESS_27639] within 7 days of their initial SV . Patients who demonstrate a response to a bronchodilator 
≥10% and <14.50% may enter the run -in period but must undergo repeat lung function assessments and another bronchodilator test in 14±2 days and may 
attempt lung function assessments and response to a  bronchodilator within 14 more days if needed (as applicable). Patient -blinded drug should be dispensed at 
each visit until the patient qualifies for or fails randomization. Informed consent/assent should be done at the SV unless already completed at a prescreening

52 e An oropharyngeal examination is to be conducted by a qualified medical provider (as required by [CONTACT_1295]) at each vis it. Clinical visual evidence of 
oropharyngeal candidiasis at the RV will exclude the patient from participating in the treatment period. Evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis at any study TV 
or end of study TV should be evaluated by [CONTACT_19201] a swab for culture. Patients who agree to treatment may continue to receive IMP. Treatment should not be 
delayed for results of the culture. 
f Lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28433]. Patients unable to perform lung 
function assessments  will be allowed to retest once within 7 days. Patients who meet lung function assessment  and response to a bronchodilator requirements 
may ent er the run -in period. Patients who entered the run -in period with response to a bronchodilator ≥10% and <14.50% must present for repeat lung function 
assessments  and another bronchodilator test within 14±[ADDRESS_27644] a 15% response to a bronchodilator. Responses to 
bronchodilator of 14.50% to 14.99% will be rounded to 15%.  If the criteria are not met, patients may continue in the run -in period for up to 14 additional days 
to meet the lung function assessment  and respon se to a bronchodilator criteria (1  final attempt) for randomization. Patients who have failed screening for 
inability to perform lung function assessments  in a technically acceptable manner or due to FEV 1 not meeting the inclusion criterion  or demonstrated  <10% 
response to a bronchodilator may retest once within [ADDRESS_27645] met all other inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria at the SV. Patients who enter the run -in period with response to a bronchodilat or ≥15% do not need to retest at the RV. For patients who need to 
demonstrate the response to bronchodilator during the run- in, the RV must be on another day.  
g Daily morning and evening lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28400]  (after the patient is trained on its use and has demonstrated proper 
technique using the provided training device) will be performed, except as indicated. The patient will be instructed to perfo rm 3 trough morning FEV 1 
maneuvers and 3 evening FEV 1 maneuvers at home each day during participation in the run -in period and the treatment period (morning only on the final TV 
[TV6 (week 12 )]). The highest FEV 1 obtained at the SV will be used to calculate the home  FEV 1 stability limit, which will be used for review of alert criteria 
during the run -in period. The average FEV 1 over 5 days prior to RV will be used to calculate the alert criteria for the treatment period.  
h 60-minute ( ±10 minutes) postdose lung function assessments will be performed at the investigational center at all visits (excluding patients placed on 
alternative therapy where the patient will  not dose but a 1- hour assessment will still be collected) . 
i  Except patients who have been placed on alternative therapy.  
j Rescue m edication will be dispensed for all patients entering the run -in period. At each visit, the study personnel should determine if the patient has adequate 
rescue medication remaining (based on current use) or dispense a new albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI. A second inhaler may be provided for use at school or camp, as applicable. Rescue medication dispensed at SV will be used for response to a bronchodilator test.  
k The investigational center staff mus t verify that the information from the patient diary built into the handheld device is up to date and identify any potential 
missing data or deviations upon review of the patient diary built into the handheld device at that visit. The device will be collec ted and inspected to make sure it 
is not damaged and the data will be downloaded at each clinic visit. Once inspected, the same handheld device will be redispensed to the patient unless it needs to be replaced.  
l The investigator will discuss ongoing asthma treatment with the patient after lung function assessments have been completed, and any medication started for the purpose of ongoing asthma treatment will not be considered a protocol violation. This treatment, if instituted, should be entered in the CRF as ongoing therapy.  
m End of study participation in the IRT system will take place at the last visit during the treatment period (ie , at TV6 for patients who complete the treatment 
period, or at the IMPDV for patients who discontinue the study prematurely [patients who withdraw consent]).

r. Vulnerable patients (ie, people kept in detention) are excluded from participation. 
4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country’s acceptance), each patient (parent/legal guardian) is free to withdraw from the study at any time. 
The investigator also has the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of serious intercurrent illness, pregnancy (see Section 7.2), or other reasons concerning the health or well-being of the patient, or in the event of repeated and documented lack of cooperation. 
Patients who are withdrawn from IMP may choose not to withdraw consent and to continue their participation in the study. These patients should complete the remaining study procedures and visits, with the exception of IMP dosing. Patients will be asked to perform 1-hour postdose lung 
function assessments at the remaining treatment visits; although the patients will not be taking a 
dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately 1 hour after the predose lung function assessments were obtained.  
In addition, a patient may be withdrawn from the study as described in Section 3.4. 
Should a patient (parent/legal guardian) decide to withdraw after administration of IMP, all 
efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up to the time of withdrawal. A 
complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made and an 
explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing from the study.  
The reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed to the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be 
made to determine the reason. If consent is withdrawn because of an adverse event, monitoring will be continued at th e discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or 
stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
57 determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event or 
test result must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF. 
All assessments should be performed according to the protocol on the last day the patient takes 
IMP, or as soon as possible thereafter. 
If the final visit is conducted more than 7 ±[ADDRESS_27652] dose of IMP, all safety 
assessments will be performed, but efficacy assessments will not be made (see Appendix B , 
Part 16). 
4.3.1. Withdrawal for Worsening Asthma 
Patients who meet the alert criteria and/or who experience a clinically  meaningful worsening of 
their asthma will be assessed by [CONTACT_093]. If the investigator  considers it is not possible to 
safely manage a patient in a blinded manner as patient’s asthma warrants a change in his/her 
asthma treatment, the IMP will be s topped, and appropriate treatment (based on the 
investigator’s judgment) should be offered. The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_28434]. The patient should continue in the study until the pat ient has completed all remaining study visits and the FV.  
• For the purpose of this study, an asthma exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than IMP and study rescue medication. Significant treatment include s the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or 
the addition of other ICS-containing asthma medications, LABAs, or other NCS asthma medications, for example, inhaled short- acting muscarinic antagonist; 
ER/urgent care clinic  visit; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A single dose of nebulized 
albuterol/salbutamol would not meet the criteria for an asthma exacerbation. ER/urgent care clinic  visits where the treatment is limited to a single dose of 
nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of an asthma exa cerbation. 
4.3.2. Alert Criteria for Worsening Asthma  
Alert criteria for individual patients with worsening asthma have been designed to ensure patient safety. If any of the criteria listed below are met, during scheduled or unplanned study visit, the investigator will determine whether the patient’s overall clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_28355] (but not the study) to be 
placed on alternative asthma therapy in the interest of patient safety. In cases where the IMP is to be withdrawn and alternative therapy started, the investigational center staff should contact [CONTACT_28435]. Meeting 1 of these alert criteria does not automatically 
require a patient to be withdrawn from IMP, rather it requires a clinical evaluation to determine if the patient’s asthma can continue to be managed in a blinded manner per the study or 
necessitates a change in asthma therapy. All attempts will be made to safely continue to manage 
a patient in a blinded manner. 
• Morning FEV

limit (see Section  6.1.3) calculated at the SV for the run -in period and at baseline for 
the treat ment period on 4 or more days (do not have to be consecutive) out of any 
7-day period (7-day period is defined as any consecutive 7 days following the RV and can overlap with scheduled study investigational center visits). 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
58 • Based upon a review of patient da ta from the patient diary built into the handheld 
device, the patient has experienced any of the following during a 7-day period (7- day 
period is defined as any consecutive 7 days following a previous TV; 7 days can 
overlap with scheduled study investigati onal center visits): 
− 3 or more days in which 8 or more inhalations/day of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI [90 mcg ex -actuator] or equivalent) were used 
(any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
− 3 or more days in which the patient experienced a nighttime asthma symptom score of more than 2 (any 3 days in the consecutive 7-day period) 
4.4. Replacement of Patients  
A patient who is randomized but does not complete the treatment period will not be replaced. 
4.5. Rescreening  
Patients who have not met inclusion criteria for response to a bronchodilator and cannot return within [ADDRESS_27653] or rescreen patients will be based on the investigator’s judgment and the study protocol. In cases of rescreening, the sponsor or designee should be notified of the pending 
rescreening. Patients may retest/rescr een for lung function assessments and response to a 
bronchodilator only if they meet all other nonspi[INVESTIGATOR_28356]/exclusion criteria. At the 
retest, patients will be asked if they have had any adverse events, changes in medications, or 
changes in med ical history. Patients will not be eligible to enter the run -in period until all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.  
4.6. Screening Failure  
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
do not subsequently enter the placebo run-in period. Minimal information includes but is not 
limited to demography, screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse 
events.  
Randomization failures are defined as participants who enter the placebo run-in period but are not subsequently randomized (ie, do not meet the randomization criteria).

rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA) will be stored according to the manufacturer’s drug product stipulation, in a dry place, and in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or enclosure. Maintenance of a daily temperature log (manual or automated) is required.  
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment and a device for monitoring and recording temperatures. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMP and other study materials from the sponsor are treated as follows: 
• correctly received and recorded  
• handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the 
Code of Federal 
Regulations ( CFR) or local regulations 
• used in accordance with  this protocol 
The investigational center personnel are responsible for the acknowledgement of the receipt using the interactive response technology (IRT). 
Detailed instructions regarding labeling (eg, investigational centers indicating the use by [CONTACT_568]) of  
the IMP are provided in the study operations manual. 
5.2.2. Labeling  
Supplies of IMPs will be labeled according to the current International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing 
Practice and will inclu de any locally required statements. If necessary, labels will be translated 
into the local language.  
5.2.3. Accountability  
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug return instructions, and any applicable forms. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMP and other study materials from 
the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and stored safely and properly in 
accordance with the CFR or national and local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol. 
The IMP for this study must be used in accordance with the protocol and may be dispensed to 
patients only by [CONTACT_28436]. The investigator is responsible for drug accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance. In accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements, the investigator or designated study investigational center personnel 
must maintain IMP accountability records.

5.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Products  
5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product 
The Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28360] (25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg twice daily) were selected for study in patients  4 through 11 years of age based on the adult dose- ranging 
study. Based on the results from the adult and adolescent Phase 3 clinical trials (submitted for 
FDA review in March 2016), the 25- and 50- mcg twice -daily doses were confirmed as 
reasonable for studies in patients 4 through 11 years of age. 
The FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28361] (50/12.5 mcg twice daily) was selected for study 
in patients  4 through 11 years of age based on the adult and adolescent dose- ranging study, 
which showed that FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] a total daily dose of 100/[ADDRESS_27658]

5.4. Other Medicinal Products/Non -Investigational Medicinal Products  
Not applicable.  
5.5. Treatment After the End of the Study  
No IMP will be provided beyond completion of the study. Patients should return to their primary 
care physician for treatment after study completion.  
5.6. Restrictions 
Medication restrictions are described in Section  5.7 and Appendix H . Patients will be r equired to 
comply with the following activity restrictions: 
• Patients are not to engage in strenuous exercise on the mornings of any scheduled investigational center visits.  
• If possible, patients should avoid cold air exposure on the mornings of any schedul ed 
investigational center visits. Patients who experience bronchial symptoms related to exposure to cold air should be adequately stabilized at room temperature before performance of any study -related lung function assessments. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
62 5.7. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
All patients will be required to be on a stable dose of asthma therapy for a minimum of 30 days 
before the SV. At the SV, all nonstudy asthma-related medications will be discontinued and 
replaced with placebo run -in medica tion and rescue medication for use during the run-in period. 
At the RV (TV1), these medications will be replaced with double-blind IMP and rescue medication for randomized patients for use during the double-blind period.  
Allowed Medications: In addition to rescue medication use (albuterol/salbutamol inhalation 
aerosol), the following medications will be permitted, but with restrictions, during the study: 
• Chronic and as-needed doses of low potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] 
(eg, 1% hydrocortisone cream, desonide, fluocinolone cream 0.01%) are permitted for 
dermatologic diseases, not to exceed 20% of the body surface area; no occlusive dressing is permitted.  
• Short-acting or long-acting antihistamine use (with a washout period of 24 hours before any visit) is per mitted for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, as needed.  
• Chronic stable doses of intranasal corticosteroids of at least 7 days’ duration before the SV and stable throughout the study duration for the treatment of allergic rhinitis are allowed throughout the study. 
• Chronic stable doses of ocular steroids of at least 7 days duration, with doses expected to remain stable throughout the study, are allowed. 
• Immunotherapy for the treatment of allergies by [CONTACT_28437] [ADDRESS_27659] remain stable throughout the study. 
Prohibited/Disallowed Medications:  
The medications in Appendix H  are not allowed during the study. The washout period is also 
defined. Initiation of immunotherapy (administered by [CONTACT_28414]) during this study is prohibited, as is the escalation  of the dose of maintenance immunotherapy (administered by [CONTACT_28414]). 
Patients who require continuous treatment with β -blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, 
tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics, and/or systemic corticosteroids are excluded.  
5.8. Proce dures for Monitoring Patient Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of IMP compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of IMP; and IMP 
accountability records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the 
patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Re view Board (IEC/IRB) should be notified. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
63 5.9. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical study. Patients 
who meet all randomization criteria at the RV will be stratified by [CONTACT_28404] (ICS or 
NCS) and randomly assigned into a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive Fp MDPI 25 mcg, Fp MDPI 50 mcg, FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg, or placebo MDPI, twice daily, for the entire treatment period. 
Randomization will be assigned via IRT. Patients being treated with a combination of ICS/NCS 
will be stratified as an ICS patient. Approximately 206 patients will be randomized into each treatment  group. After the run- in period, patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will 
remain blinded to randomized treatment assignment during the study. In addition, the investigator and the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP 
identity after the run -in period until the database is locked for analysis and the treatment 
assignment is revealed.  
No effort will be made to maintain a balance among treatment groups within an investigational center.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups by [CONTACT_3553] a computer- generated 
randomization list. The specifications for randomization will be under the responsibility and oversight of Teva Global Statistics. The output of the randomization process will be a patient randomization list.  
The sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment until the database is locked for analysis and t he treatment assignment revealed.  
The following criteria must be fulfilled at the RV: 
a. The patient continues to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.  
n. The average of the [ADDRESS_27660] values for trough morning FEV
1 obtained at home (by 
[CONTACT_28400]) out of the last 7 days prior to RV is within 40% to 85% predicted for age, height, sex, and race ( Quanjer et al 2012).  
o. The patient’s C -ACT score at the RV is ≤19.  
p. The patient has demonstr ated at least a 15% response to a bronchodilator from

MDI (90 mcg ex-actuator) or equivalent at SV or during the run-in period as 
measured by [CONTACT_28400]. Note: The RV may not be conducted on the same day 
as the response to bronchodilator testing. 
q. The patient has had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, 
excluding the albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90 mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent 
used as rescue medication or run-in placebo MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28305].  
r. The patient has not had a URI or LRI during the run-in period. Patients who develop a URI or LRI during the run-in period may be discontinued from the study and 
allowed to rescreen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.  
s. The patient has had no asthma exacerbation during the run-in period, defined as any 
worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than rescue

64 run-in MDPI. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids, inhaled 
corticosteroids or other medications used to control asthma or are prohibited 
medications ( Appendix H ), and/or ER/urgent care clinic visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: 
A single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria for an 
asthma exacerbation. Emergency room/urgent care clinic visits where the treatment is 
limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.  
t. The patient has no clinical visual evidence (on oropharyngeal examination) of oropharyngeal candidiasis.  
u. The patient has not experienced an adverse event that would result in failure to continue to meet selection criteria.  
v. The patient has not used any of the prohibited concomitant medications during the run-in period (see Section  5.7 and  Appendix H ).  
w. The patient has complied with home lung function assessments and patient diary (built into the handheld device) entry on at least [ADDRESS_27661] 7 days prior to RV, including the following:

HFA MDI) use (whether used or not) 
− completion of the morning and evening lung function assessments (FEV
1 and 
PEF) by [CONTACT_28415] 5 or more of the 7 days immediately preceding the RV 
− recording of morning and evening IMP use on 5 or more of the 7 days immediately preceding RV  
5.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding  
5.10.1. Maintenance of Randomization  
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location at the service provider. At 
the time of analysis (after the end of study), after receiving unblinding request from the Teva 
statistician, the service provider will provide the unblinded treatment assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  
5.10.2. Blinding and Unblinding  
For informati on about personnel who may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 5.9. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study proce dures or assessment of any 
adverse events . 
In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy, or in cases when knowledge of the treatment assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s treatment assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations, through specialized 
access in the IRT system. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event before breaking 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
65 of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the 
patient’s treatment code should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can always be 
performed by [CONTACT_28438]. 
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and t he event will be 
recorded on the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully 
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. 
In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4), Global Patient Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) may independently request that the treatment code be broken (on a 
case- by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct of the study, and analysis and reporting of the data. 
5.10.3. Data Monitoring Committee 
There will be no Data Monit oring Committee in this study.  
5.11. Total Blood Volume  
No laboratory tests or serum pregnancy tests will be performed in this study unless clinically 
indicated, and no blood is planned to be collected.

66 6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification  
The primary efficacy measures are as follows:  
• For Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28295]: the change from baseline in weekly average of the 
percent predicted trough morning FEV 1 at week 12  
• For FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28296]: the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdo se percent 
predicted morning FEV 1 at week 12  
6.1.1. Lung Function Assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28439], all lung function assessment (FEV 1 and PEF) are to be conducted consistently, using 
standardized equipment, time of day (±1 hour), and posture. Patients will be provided with a handheld device at the SV, which will be used to measure lung function assessments and will 
serve as an electronic patient diary to collect asthma symptom scores, rescue medication, and 
IMP use. The same handheld device should be used for a patient throughout the study, whenever possible. The device will be collected and inspected to make sure it is not damaged and the data 
will be downloaded at each clinic visit. Once inspected, the same handheld device will be 
redispensed to the patient unless it needs to be replaced. 
During the treatment period (RV through TV6 [week 12] or IMPDV ), daily in the morning and 
evening at approximately the same time each day, patients will use the handheld device at home 
to record asthma symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use, after which they will perform lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and then will take their dose of the 
IMP and record IMP dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.  
On the morning of each TV, patients will be instructed to record their asthma symptom score and 
rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use and complete their morning lung function 
assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28405], but to delay IMP dosing until the y get 
to the investigational center. Patients are also to withhold their  rescue SABA for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_27662] been withdrawn from IMP but remain in the study should withhold their alternative asthma therapy dosing until after 
treatment visit assessments and avoid rescue m edication for a minimum of 6 hours prior to clinic 
lung function assessments. The treatment visit should be rescheduled if either or both occur. 
At the investigational center, after appropriate instructions and training (competent handheld 
device use and d osing technique using the training devices provided), patients will repeat their 
lung function assessment (FEV
1 and PEF) under the supervision of the investigational center 
staff. They will then take their morning dose of the IMP. IMP administration at the investigational center should be timed so that lung function assessments will be approximately 
12 hours following the doses taken the previous evening. Patients will then perform a 1-hour postdose FEV
1 measurement using the handheld device. The 1 -hour postdose assessment should 
be conducted 60 ±10 minutes after IMP dosing (or as described for patient s on alternative asthma 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
67 treatment; see Section  3.1). The highest FEV 1 value from 3 acceptable and 2  repeatable 
maneuvers (maximum of [ADDRESS_27663]) will be obtained before and 1- hour after the 
morning dose. The acceptability and repeatability of each maneuver will be automatically 
determined as programmed by [CONTACT_28440]. Patients will be allowed [ADDRESS_27664] for 
screening lung function assessments. Predic ted FEV 1 will be computed and adjusted for age, 
height, race, and sex using the criteria of Quanjer ( Quanjer et al 2012). A standard method for 
calculating FEV 1 will be provided to all investigational centers.  
In cases of lung function assessment -induced bronchospasm (ie, successively lower values with 
good technique), the largest valid FEV 1 may be used.  
The baseline lung function assessments are defined as the weekly average of the morning FEV 1 
prior to the RV. 
6.1.2. Response t o a Bronchodilator 
At SV, FEV 1 will be measured immediately before and within 30 minutes after administration of 
2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90 mcg ex -actuator) or equivalent. 
Nebulized albuterol/salbutamol at a total dose of 2.5 mg may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion. Spacers are also allowed during this time, but their use is only allowed for the test of response to bronchodilator. Patients who meet the criteria to enter the run -in but who have not 
demonstrated the required response to bronchodilator my repeat this testing 14 ± [ADDRESS_27665] 1 final att empt if needed within 14 days. The run -in period should not exceed 
30 days. Responses to a bronchodilator of 14.50% to 14.99% will be rounded to 15%. The percent response to a bronchodilator is calculated using the following equations, as applicable: 
(Post -bronchodilator FEV 1 –Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1) × 100%  
Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 
6.1.3. FEV 1 Stability Limit  
At SV, the FEV 1 stability limit will be calculated for patients who qualify to enter the run -in 
period as 80% of the highest acceptable pre- albuterol/salbutamol FEV 1. This value will be used 
during the run-in period. 
The FEV 1 stability limit for the treatment period will be calculated for each patient at the RV, as 
applicable, using the following equation: 
Mean best pre -albuterol/salbutamol FEV 1 available from 5 of 7 days (the baseline value) 
preceding RV × 80%  
This value will be used for the remainder of the study and will be used to determine alert criteria 
for worsening asthma, as applicable. The FEV 1 stability limit is automatically calculated and 
stored in the handheld device software. If a patient falls below the FEV 1 stability limit, an alert 
will appear on the handheld device screen.

68 6.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures  
The secondary efficacy measures and time points for this study are as follows: 
• PEF will be measured by [CONTACT_102] (with assistance from the parents/legal 
guardians/caregivers, as needed) with a handheld de vice in the morning and evening 
before administration of IMP  or rescue medications. The time points for assessment 
of PEF as a secondary efficacy endpoint are specifically the morning (predose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) evaluation over the 12- week treatment period.  
• The total daily (24-hour) use of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol will be 
calculated based on information recorded in the daily patient diary built into the 
handheld device by [CONTACT_102] (with assistance from the parents/legal guardians/caregivers, as needed) over weeks 1 through 12. 
• Daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores will be recorded in the daily patient diary built into the handheld device by [CONTACT_102] (with assistance from the parents/legal guardians/caregivers, as needed) over weeks 1 through 12. 
• The C -ACT will be completed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and at the IMPDV. 
• The time to first onset of effect, defined as the first decrease from baseline in daily rescue medication use, will be calculated based on information recorded in the daily patient diary built into the handheld device by [CONTACT_102] (with assistance from the parents/legal guardians/caregivers, as needed). 
• The proportion of patients who discontinued from IMP for asthma exacerbation 
during the 12- week treatment per iod will be evaluated over the 12- week treatment 
period. 
6.2.1. Weekly Average of Daily Trough Morning Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_28363], in the morning before administration of IMP or rescue medications and in the evening. A handheld device will be provided to patients at 
the SV and used to determine the morning and evening PEF throughout the course of the study. 
The patient will record the highest value of 3 measurements obtained in the morning in the patient diary built in to the handheld device. 
On mornings for which a TV is scheduled (RV through TV6/IMPDV), patients will perform their morning PEF measurement as usual using the handheld device at home and will then repeat 
their PEF measurement (using the handheld device) at the investigational center. Symptom 
scores should always be assessed before any PEF measurements are obtained. The morning administration of IMP will take place and be recorded at the visit.  
6.2.2. Weekly Average of Total Daily Rescue Medication Use 
The patients will record the number of inhalations of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol 
HFA MDI [90 mcg ex -actuator] or equivalent) each morning and evening in the patient diary 
built into the handheld device. If there is no rescue medication usage, patients should enter 0 in 
the patient diary  built into the handheld device. The average number of daily inhalations over the 
7 days before the RV will be the baseline value and will be compared to the rescue aerosol over 
weeks 1 through 12.

and enter a single score that is inclusive of all symptoms.  
On mornings for which a TV is scheduled (SV through TV6), the symptom scores and recording 
of the morning administration of IMP will be completed at the investigational center visit. 
Symptom scores should always be assessed before lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by 
[CONTACT_28441]. 
Daytime Symptom Score (determined in the evening)  0=No symptoms during the day 
 1=Symptoms for 1 short period during the day 
 2=Symptoms for 2 or more short periods during the day  3=Symptoms for most of the day, which did not affect my normal daily activities 
 4=Symptoms for most of the day, which did affect my normal daily activities 
 5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to school or perform normal daily activities  
Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the morning)  
 0=No symptoms during the night  1=Symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early)  2=Symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early)  
 3=Symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night  4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all 
6.2.4. Change from Baseline in Asthma Control (measured by C -ACT) Score  
The C -ACT is a simple, patient-completed tool us ed for the assessment of overall asthma 
control. The first [ADDRESS_27667] 3  items are 
completed by [CONTACT_102]’s parents/legal guardians/caregivers. The first 4 questions are scored on 
a 3-point scale (0 to 3) and the last 3 questions are scored on a 5-point scale (0 to 5), with 
summation of all items providing scores ranging from 0 to 27. These scores span the continuum 
of poor control of asthma (score ≤5) to complete control of asthma (score ≥25), with a c utoff 
score of [ADDRESS_27668] will be completed by [CONTACT_28406]’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver  (as 
applicable)  at the investigational center, before any other assessments are performed, at the 
specified visits.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27669] (in the study reference manual) in order to achieve maximum compliance in a clinical 
study environment and maximum data quality. After completion of the C- ACT, investigational 
center personnel will check the questionnaires for completeness and legibility. 
The C -ACT should be completed during a study visit and should precede any discussion of 
asthma status between the patient/parent/c aregiver and investigational center personnel. 
6.2.5. Time to First Onset of Effect  
The time to first onset of effect, defined as the first decrease from baseline in daily rescue 
medication use, will be calculated based on the number of inhalations of rescue medication 
(albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI [90 mcg ex -actuator] or equivalent) recorded by [CONTACT_28442]. 
6.2.6. Proportion of Patients who Discontinued from IMP for Asthma Exacerbation 
During the 12 -week Treatment Period

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
73 7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
In this study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_28445] , vital signs measurements, physical examination findings (including body weight 
measurements), and oropharyngeal examination findings. In ad dition, during the study, PEF and 
FEV 1 will be monitored as part of safety monitoring (alert criteria for worsening asthma). Any 
visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the treatment period will be confirmed by [CONTACT_19201] a 
swab for culture of the suspec t area. Patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will be 
provided with guidelines for when to contact [CONTACT_28446]. Patients who meet predefined alert criteria should be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator will determine whether the patient’s overall clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_28365] (but not the study) to be placed on alternative asthma therapy in the interest of patient 
safety . 
7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed consent form/assent form (as applicable) should be recorded and reported as an adverse event. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this  study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the IMP. (Note: Asthma exacerbations in this study will not be considered 
adverse events unless they meet the criteria for serious adverse events.) A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be consider ed an adverse event. Stable chronic 
conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this  
study will not be considered adverse events (but should be recorded as medical history). 
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions  
• drug interactions  
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of this  
study 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
74 • laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or  a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered by 
[CONTACT_11150] (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at 
the SV that preclude a patient from entering the study or recei ving IMP are not 
considered adverse events.) 
For the purpose of this study, an asthma exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than IMP and study rescue medication. Significant treatment includes the use of s ystemic corticosteroids and/or the addition of other ICS-containing 
asthma medications, LABAs, or other NCS asthma medications, for example, inhaled short- acting muscarinic antagonist, ER/urgent care clinic visit(s) , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A 
single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol would not meet the criteria for an asthma 
exacerbation. ER/urgent care clinic visits where the treatment is limited to a single dose of 
nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not meet the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.  
Asthma exacerbation that requires a change in medication or worsening of asthma that requires 
the patient to be treated with alternative therapy will be entered into the case report form (CRF), 
including the date at which any medication change was made and  whether this medication 
change was implemented prior to or after the IMPDV lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) 
were completed. Asthma worsening, including asthma exacerbations with a change to alternative asthma therapy will not be considered an adverse event for this study since it is an expected outcome for this study in an asthmatic patient population. Asthma exacerbations that meet the criteria for a serious adverse event will be recorded as adverse events.  
Any occurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis that is confirmed by [CONTACT_28447]. A patient who agrees to be treated may continue in the study at the discretion of the investigator. 
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be pr ovided, and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report (CSR).  
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period 
from signature [CONTACT_28513]/assent form (as applicable)  to the end of the follow-up 
period. The follow-up period is defined as 7±[ADDRESS_27674] be reported immediately.  The investigator does not 
need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient (after the treatment of that patient has ended) should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investig ator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by [CONTACT_23501] -ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe”. All reported or observed signs 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27675] findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the 
serious adverse event form.  
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health 
care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is 
made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF. 
The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study procedures, and the severity and 
seriousness of each adverse event as judged by [CONTACT_093], must be recorded as described 
below. 
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following: 
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate : Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Test Investigational Medicinal Product  
The relationship of an adverse event to the test IMP is characterized in Table 5.

• It do es not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the IMP.  
• It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.

• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or red uction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet 
an IMP relationship 
clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.  
IMP=investigational medicinal product.  
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events  
For recording of serious adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time 
period from signature [CONTACT_28514]-up period. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow-up period should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
77 • is life -threatening ad verse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which 
means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28366], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28367], unless there was worsening of the 
pre-existing condition during the patient’s participation in this study.  
• persistent or significant disability/incapacity (refers to a substantial disruptio n of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected 
transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important 
medical event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information (RSI) by [CONTACT_16972], severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study are the Teva Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28346].  
The sponsor’s GPSP will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events.  
For the purpose of S[LOCATION_003]R reporting, the version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R applies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study, 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the test IMP, must be reported to the 
sponsor by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported within [ADDRESS_27676] administration of IMP of that patient 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
78 The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer (LSO) or designee (a 
contract research o rganization [CRO] in a country without a sponsor LSO) (contact [CONTACT_28448]); the LSO will forward the report 
to the sponsor’s GPSP. 
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely:  
• study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the test IMP (no 
reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information includes: 
• age and sex of patient  
• date of first dose of IMP  
• date and amount of last administered dose of IMP 
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data 
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known 
• for an adverse event res ulting in death  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to IMP)  
− autopsy findings (if available) 
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_28449], study procedures, and to underlying disease. 
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/Extensible Markup Language (XML) file to the LSO/CRO 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
79 for submission to the competent authorities, IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to 
regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the 
event, in accordance with national and local regulations. 
For double-blind studies, blinding will be maintained for all study personnel. Therefore, in case 
of a S[LOCATION_003]R, only the LSO/CRO will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the 
others will receive a blinded report.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a S[LOCATION_003]R is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, the sponsor will take 
appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of 
Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28368] (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate). 
In ad dition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other measures may be required, including: 
• altering existing research by [CONTACT_23504] 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• altering the process of informed consent by [CONTACT_28450]  
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28294] 
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events  not for Expedited Reporting  
No protocol-defined adverse events not for expedited reporting were identified for this study. 
7.1.7. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest  
No protocol- defined adverse events of special interest were identified for this study. 
7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case- by-case basis. To ensure patient safety, after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has  been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_23505]. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to receive study IMP, continue in 
the study on alternative treatment, or be withdrawn from the study in the interest of patient safety.  
7.2. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies of females participating in the study that occur during the study, or within [ADDRESS_27677] provide the LSO/CRO with the pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
80 the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).  
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue treatment . All patients 
who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health 
of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newbo rn complications, will be reported to the 
sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adver se event, as appropriate.  
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. 
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adve rse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event. 
7.3. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Products  
Any administration of IMP tha t is not in accordance with the study protocol  should be reported 
either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol ( Appendix C ), or as 
a deviation, in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event 
occurs as a result. When meeting protocol violation criteria, all instances of incorrect IMP administration should be categorized as “Non- Compliance to investigational medicinal product 
(IMP).”   
The following are types of medication errors and special situations , as reported by [CONTACT_1275]: 
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal prod uct while in the control of the healthcare professional, 
patient, or consumer. 
4. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP, reference IMP, or placebo IMP), whether taken intentionally 
or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 
5. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
6. Off-label use: Situations where an IMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
81 7. Occupational exposure: Exposure to an IMP as a result of one’s professional or 
nonprofessional occupation. 
8. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk. 
When the identification of the IMP is required, the investigator must follow the procedures for unblinding outlined in Section 5.10.2. 
7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Since the IMPs in this trial are well-established molecules and are not known to influence 
clinical laboratory tests at doses to be studied in this trial, optional clinical laboratory evaluation, 
if needed at the discretion of the investigator, may be performed during the study at a local laboratory. These clinical laboratory tests may be performed to ensure the health and wellbeing of the patients but will not be used to assess the safety of the IMP. 
All clinical laboratory test results ou tside of the reference range will be judged by [CONTACT_11356]: 
• abnormal but not clinically significant  
• abnormal and clinically significant  
A laboratory test result that is judged by [CONTACT_28451], transcribed to the CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as 
described in Section  7.1.2. An event may include a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality 
(once confirmed by [CONTACT_28452]) that results in patient continuing study participation, the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study, the temporary or permanent cessation of trea tment with 
IMP or medical treatment, or further diagnostic work-up. 
7.4.1. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests 
Human chorionic gonadotropin tests in urine will be performed for all female patients who have 
reached puberty and achieved menarche at the SV and, if cl inically indicated, thereafter. Any 
female patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. Procedures for 
reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section 7.2. 
7.5. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations, including weight and height, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 3. Any physical examination finding that is judged by [CONTACT_28453], recorded on the CRF, and monitored as 
described in Section  7.1.2. 
7.6. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP] and pulse) will be measured at the time points detailed in Table 3. All vital signs results outside of the reference ranges will be judged by [CONTACT_28454] 1 of the following categories: 
• abnormal but not a clinically significant worsening from baseline  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
82 • abnormal and a clinically significant worsening from baseline  
Before BP and pulse are measured, the patient must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]- erect/seated position 
and resting for at least 5  minutes (the same position and arm should be used each time vital signs 
are measured for a given patient). For any abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should 
be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by [CONTACT_28455] r ecorded on the source documentation, transcribed to the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 
In addition, potentially clinically significant values may be predefined by [CONTACT_28456] (see Section  9.7) and, if so, will be documented in the statistical analysis
 plan 
or other relevant documents (eg, medical monitoring plan). 
7.7. Oropharyngeal Examinations  
Oropharyngeal examinations will be performed at every visit (SV through TV6). The examination must be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Whenever possible, the 
same qualified healthcare professional should complete the assessment for the same patient 
throughout that patient’s participation in the study.  
Patients with clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at SV who agree to receive treatment 
and comply with appropriate medical monitoring may participate in the run -in period and may 
return for randomization. However, if the oral candidiasis is not controlled at that time, the 
patient will not be allowed to enter the study treatment period.  
Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the treatment period of the study (after RV 
through TV6, inclusive) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_28457] a swab of the suspect area. Appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately at the discretion of the investigator and should not be delayed for culture confirmation.  
Patients with a culture -positive infection may continue participation in the study on appropriate 
anti-infective therapy, provided this therapy is not prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. If a patient requires 
a protocol-prohibited medication for therapy, the patient will be discontinued from the study and 
provided appropriate therapy.

84 9. STATISTICS  
This section describes the statistical analysis planned for this study. Changes, additions, and 
further details about the analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . After 
finalization of the statistical analysis plan, any additional analyses or changes to analyses that 
may be required will be fully disclos ed in the CSR. 
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
Sample size and power calculations are driven by [CONTACT_28458] 50/12.5 
mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily in change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose 
percent predicted m orning FEV 1 at week 12 and the superiority of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily 
over placebo in change from baseline in percent predicted trough morning FEV 1 at week 12.  
For the superiority comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily versus Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
twice daily, assuming that the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted 
morning FEV 1 at week 12 is analyzed using an ANOVA model with only a single factor of 
treatment group , the following assumptions were made: 
• The initial assumed common standard deviation (SD) was 9.3% and the true treatment difference was 4.5% between FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily. This assumption was based on data collected in previous 
Teva studies with the sam e Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28306] 12-week treatment period and based on office-based spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
• The initial power was 97% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% .  
For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo, assuming that 
the change from baseline in percent predicted trough morning FEV
1 at week 12 is analyzed using 
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with only a single factor of treatment group, the following assumptions were made: 
• The initial assumed common standard deviation (SD) was 13.25% and the true treatment difference was 5% between Fp MDPI [ADDRESS_27678] in adult asthma patients and based on office- based spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
• The initial power was 85% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5%.  
This study FSS- AS-[ADDRESS_27679] Teva's study in which the handheld spi[INVESTIGATOR_28307] a pediatric asthma patient population, the 
target population of this study. A blinded sample size reassessment was not planned for this 
study. However, routine blinded data monitoring of this study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] revealed that a few 
patietnts  showed nonphysiologic (~200% of percent predicted FEV
1) changes from baseline. 
This triggered a blinded sample size reassessment that showed that the overall mean change from baseline and SD for the overall study population is higher than the initial assumptions based on the office spi[INVESTIGATOR_28308]. In addition, monitoring of FEV
[ADDRESS_27680] efforts in this young patient population, despi[INVESTIGATOR_28369]– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
85 provided by [CONTACT_473]. Therefore, some of the init ial assumptions and the sample size 
described above were revised to the following: 
• For the superiority comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily versus Fp MDPI 
50 mcg twice daily, the SD was revised to 22% and the overall mean change from baseline was revised to 6.5% (blinded SD observed after 427 patients completed week 12 of this study (excluding IMPD)) and the power down to 80%.  
• With these assumptions, [ADDRESS_27681] of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily. 
• For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo, the SD was revised to 17% and overall mean change from baseline was 5% (blinded SD observed after 434 patients completed week 12 of this study (excluding IMPD)) and the power was revised to 80%.  
• With these assumptions, [ADDRESS_27682] of Fp  MDPI 50  mcg twice daily versus placebo.  
Assuming a dropout rate of 12%, then 206 patients per treatment group in the 4 treatment groups, for a total of 824 patients, will be randomized (initial assumption for dropout rate was 15%). 
9.2. Analysis Sets 
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients.  
In the ITT  analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received.  
The ITT analysis set will serve as the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
9.2.2. Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP.  
In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actually 
received, regardless of the treatment to which they were rand omized, unless otherwise specified. 
The safety analysis set will be used for all analyses of safety data.  
9.2.3. Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set including only patients 
without major protocol violations and who have >80% compliance to the IMP over the entire treatment period. Treatment compliance during the study will be assessed based on both data collected in the IMP dose counter and diary. Details will be provided in the SAP. Major protocol 
violations will be determined before unblinding. Note that since the use of incorrect IMP will be 
considered a major protocol violation, for treatment assignment in the PP analysis set, “as randomized” will coincide with “as treated.”  
The PP analysis set will se rve as the supportive population for the primary efficacy analysis only. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma

86 9.3. Data Handling Conventions  
Data imputation rules will be described in the statistical analysis plan, as appropriate for each 
endpoint. 
9.4. Study Population  
The ITT analysis set (Section  9.2.1) will be used for all study population summaries unless 
otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_28459] a ll patients.  
9.4.1. Patient Disposition  
The following data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: patients screened; patients 
screened but not enrolled (and reason); patients enrolled in the run-in period; patients enrolled in 
the run-in period but not randomized (and reason); patients randomized; patients randomized but not treated; patients in the ITT, safety , and PP analysis sets; patients who complete the study; and 
patients who withdraw from the treatment period of the study and the reason for withdrawal.  
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history, and prior medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28370]. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics (number [n], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary.  
Patient demographics will be presented for all 3 analysis sets defined in Section  9.2. 
9.5. Efficacy Analysis  
9.5.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• For Fp MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28295]: the change from baseline in weekly average of the percent predicted trough morning FEV

• For FS MDPI [INVESTIGATOR_28296]: the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent 
predicted morning FEV 1 at week 12  
9.5.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• Change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough morning (predose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) PEF over the 12- week treatment period  
• Change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily (24 -hour) use of

albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (number of inhalations) at weeks 4, 8, and 12  
• Change from baseline in  the percentage of rescue- free days (defined as 24 -hour 
periods with no rescue medication usage) during the 12- week treatment period  
• Change from baseline in the percentage of symptom- free days (defined as 24 -hour 
periods with asthma symptom score of 0) during the 12- week treatment period

and 12 
• Time to  consistent onset of effect defined as the decrease from baseline in daily 
rescue medication use on 3 consecutive days 
9.5.4. Planned Method of Analysis  
The ITT analysis set ( Section  9.2.1)  will be the primary analysis set to be used for all efficacy 
analyses. The PP analysis set will serve as the sensitivity analysis set for primary efficacy analyses only. Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan . Subgroup (sex, age group, 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
88 previous therapy [ICS or NCS], and race) analyses will be provided for the primary efficacy 
endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Estimands and Efficacy Analysis 
The specific estimands selected for the [ADDRESS_27683] data after IMP discontinuation.  
The question of whether to use data collected after IMP discontinuation is an ongoing debate in 
statistical literature, in particular for studies with symptomatic end points and when it is common 
for patients who dropout to switch therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Little and Kang 2015, Mallinckrodt et al 2016, 
Mallinckrodt 2013, O’Neill and Temple 2012). This study  is designed as a placebo -controlled 
study and it is expected that patients randomized to placebo would discontinue IMP due to 
worsening asthma at a higher rate than those randomized to active treatment , which is known to 
be an efficacious drug as establis hed by  [CONTACT_28460]. After a patient discontinues IMP due to 
worsening asthma, the patient will be p laced on alternative asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as systemic 
corticosteroids, additional medications containing ICS, or both, which would alter the spi[INVESTIGATOR_23943] y 
collected after that point and therefore not be appropriate for assessment of IMP effectiveness. 
Improvement of asthma would be expected as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_28371] 1 week for FEV
1 for placebo 
patients placed on ICS ( Szefler et al 1999). It has also been shown that patients placed on ICS 
with long acting beta -agonists can have significant improvement in serial FEV 1 measurements on 
the same day ( Corren et al 2007, Pearlman et al 1999). Therefore, any patient who discontinued 
IMP and was placed on alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28372].  
The inclusion of patients who failed therapy and who were then treated with alternative medication would blunt the treatment effect, potentially causing the study to fail due to the 
analysis rather than the effectiveness of the treatment given during the study. These pati ents no 
longer represent a true placebo population and including them in the population for the primary 
outcome is not consistent with treatment by [CONTACT_14296]. In light of this, retrieved dropout data will 
be used only for sensitivity analyses . Missing data f or patients who discontinue IMP will be 
imputed using reference- based multiple imputations representing a missing not at random 
(MNAR) mechanism. This approach is discussed in  Mallinckrodt et al 2016  (Sections 3.2 and 
3.4 for estimand 2 in the paper). 
Analysis of the c hange from baseline in weekly average of the percent predicted trough 
morning FEV [ADDRESS_27684] day before randomization consists of the entry on the morning of the 
RV in the patient diary built into the handheld device . The weekly average of the percent 
predicted FEV 1 at week 12 will be the average values based on the available data at that week.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
89 The primary analysis of the change from baseline in weekly average of percent predicted 
morning FEV 1 at week 12 due to the initially randomized treatment as actually taken will be 
analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to baseline percent 
predicted trough morning FEV 1, sex, age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS 
or NCS), and IMP treatment group. Contrasts for pairwise treatment comparisons of interest will 
be constructed. The estimated treatment difference between each IMP treatment group and the 
placebo group will be presented together with the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference and the p -value.  
In this analysis, missing data that are caused by [CONTACT_28417] 
(regardless of availability of retriev ed dropout data) will be imputed using reference- based 
multiple imputations. Details on the implementation of the multiple imputations will be provided in the statistical analysis plan . 
Analysis of the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted morning FEV 1 
at week 12  
For the endpoint of change from baseline in 1-hour postdose percent predicted morning FEV 1 
(measured at the clinic) at week 12, baseline is defined as predose FEV 1 measuremen ts obtained 
at the clinic at the RV with the handheld device immediately prior to the IMP administration.  
The primary analysis of the change from baseline in 1 -hour postdose percent predicted morning 
FEV 1 at week 12 due to the initially randomized treatmen t as actually taken  will be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline percent predicted trough morning FEV 1, 
sex, age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS or NCS), and IMP treatment group. Contrasts for pairwise treatment comparisons of interest will be constructed. The 
estimated treatment difference between each IMP treatment group and the placebo group will be 
presented together with the 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference and the p-value. Missing data 
caused by [CONTACT_28461] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity Analysis to Missing Data 
To assess the impact of missing data , several sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the 
2 endpoints by [CONTACT_28419].  More details will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
• The primary analysis for the 2 endpoints will be repeated when using data collected after 
IMP discontinuation (retrieved dropout data). Reference-based imputation will be used 
only for patien ts with no retrieved dropout data. This analysis estimates different 
estimands, namely the change from baseline as actually taken  (see estimand 1 in 
Mallinckrodt et al 2016).  
• The primary analysis for the 2 end points will be r epeated on completers with no major 
protocol violations (see estimand 3 in Mallinckrodt et al 2016).  
• A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_28310] a sensitivity analysis to missing data by [CONTACT_28462]. For placebo patients, in all applications of multiple imputations , missing at random ( MAR ) will be assumed. 
For the active arms, in the first application, MAR will be assumed and the imputations will be drawn from data in the corresponding active arms. In subsequent applications, 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27685] los s, ie, MNAR will be assumed.  This analysis will utilize only data collected 
prior to IMP discontinuation. Additional details will be provided in th e SAP .  
• “2-dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” multiple imputation will be performed similar to above, the 
shifts to the distribution will apply to both placebo and active arms, to represent different 
degrees of effect loss.  This analysis will utilize only data collected prior to IMP 
discontinuation. Additional details will be provided in th e SAP.  
• The primary analysis for the [ADDRESS_27686] ( LOCF ) and baseline 
observation carried forward ( BOCF ) as follows: BOCF will be used for patients who had 
a positive change from baseli ne at the time of study or IMP discontinuation (ie, a change 
of 0), while LOCF will be used for patients that have negative change from baseline. In this imputation method, the imputed value is the lower between LOCF and BOCF for each patient. No adjustmen ts will be made to other patients.  
• For the first primary end point of change from baseline in the weekly average of percent 
predicted trough  morning FEV
1 over the 12- week treatment period, analysis  will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). This analysis will  not 
use retrieved drop out data. This analysis represents a MAR assumption. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
For all secondary endpoints, analyses will be performed using the ITT analysis set and will not include retrieved dropout da ta in the analysis.  
Analysis of change from baseline in weekly average of daily trough morning PEF, total daily use of albuterol/salbutamol, total daily asthma symptom score , and C-AC T score over the 12- week 
treatment period will be analyzed using an MMRM analysis with effects due to baseline, sex, 
age, (pooled) investigational center, previous therapy (ICS or NCS), treatment, time, and time-
by-treatment interaction. For all of these endpoints, the MMRM will use only observations 
collected until IMP discontinuation. 
The time to first onset of effect, defined as the first decrease from baseline in daily rescue 
medication use, will be analyzed using a log-rank test. Median and mean time to first onset of effect and associated 95% C is will be estimated. Time to first onset of effect will also be 
displayed graphically with a Kaplan- Meier figure.  
The proportion of patients who discontinued from IMP for asthma exacerbation during the 12-week treatmen t period will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with effects due to 
previous therapy (ICS or NCS) and treatment. These patients will be considered as nonresponders in this analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Efficacy Analysis  
Statistical methods to be used for oth er efficacy endpoints will be described and detailed in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
91 9.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
A fixed -sequence testing procedure will be employed to control the overall Type I error rate at 
the 2 -sided 0.05 level for the co-primary endpoints. The sequential order of comparisons will be 
as follows:  
1. 1-hour postdose percent predicted FEV 1 comparing FS MDPI 50/12.[ADDRESS_27687] study that utilizes the handheld device in a 
large Phase 3 study in a pediatric asthma patient population (4 to 11 years of age), an unplanned 
blinded sample size reassement was conducted. Since the adjustment to sample size was based on blinded standard deviation, no adjustment to the multiplicity control is warrented. 
Multiplicity control for the secondary endpoints and the sequential order of the secondary 
endpoints will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan . 
No multiplicity adjustments will be made for other efficacy analyses.   
9.7. Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set (Section  9.2.2).  
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table 3. 
Safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570].  
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient  will be counted only once in each preferred term (PT) or system organ 
class (SOC) category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all treatment -
emergent adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_926]), treatment -emergent adverse events 
deter mined by [CONTACT_28463] (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4) 
(defined as related or with missing relationship, overall and by [CONTACT_926]), serious treatment -
emergent adverse events, and treatment -emergent adverse events causing withdrawal from the 
study.  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364]. Incidence and event counts 
will be summarized for the SOC and PT summary table. Patient listings of serious adverse events and treatment -emergent adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.  
Shifts from baseline to the final TV (TV6/IMPDV) in physical examination findings will be summarized descriptively.  
Changes in vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be compared with predefined criteria to identify potentially clinically significant values or changes, and such values will be summarized and listed in separate tables and listings. Although such 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
92 values will be summarized and listed, clinical significance will be determined independently by 
[CONTACT_093].  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_23507]. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is being treated with IMP.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual values and c hanges from baseline to each time point. For categorical 
variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significant abnormal values (vital signs) based on predefined criteria will be provided as well.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the CSR. 
9.8. Tolerabilit y Analysis 
Tolerability will be assessed via other endpoints. 
9.9. Planned Interim Analysis  
There will be no interim analysis.  
9.10. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan  
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described in protocol amendments, the
 statistical analysis plan , the CSR, or any combination of these, as 
appropriate, and in accordance with applicable national, local, and regional requirements and regulations.

SECTION 1.3.2 OVERALL BENEFIT AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR THIS STUDY  
Use of placebo -controlled study design in evaluating ICSs and 
other molecules is commonly used in developi[INVESTIGATOR_28389] ( eg, Kerwin et al 2008, Woodcock et 
al 2013). The design of this study is very similar to other 
pediatric placebo -controlled trials where adverse events i n the 
placebo arm were similar to those in the treatment arms. The 
study has been designed to minimize the risks of placebo use to 
the intended population of patients 4 through 11 years of age. 
The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to 
ensure that patients with severe asthma or history of life -
threatening exacerbations would not be eligible. In this study, 
the patients ’ lung function, symptom scores, and rescue 
medication use will be monitored daily with use of a handheld 
device/electron ic diary. The handheld device/electronic diary 
will provide alerts to the study center and medical monitor for 
the trial so that patients whose asthma status may be 
deteriorating will be captured early (Section  4.3.2 ). This will 
minimize the risk and asthm a exacerbation as well as any 
discomfort that might come from an exacerbation. 
Additionally, use of the handheld device/electronic diary 
minimizes the burden of requiring patients to travel to the study 
center for monitoring. Patients assigned to placebo t herapy 
often demonstrate improvement in lung function, suggesting 
that frequent contact [CONTACT_28425].

Asthma For the purpose of this study, an asthma exacerbation is 
defined as any  worsening of asthma requiring any significant  
treatment other than IMP and study  rescue albuterol 
(salbutamol) or the patient’s regular ICS 
maintenance medication. Significant treatment . As includes the 
use of systemic corticosteroids and/or the addition of other 
ICS-containing asthma medications, LABAs, or other NCS 
asthma medications, for example, inhaled short -acting 
muscarinic antagonist, ER/urgent care clinic visit(s) , or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A single dose of nebulized 
albuterol/salbutamol would not meet the criteria for an asthma 
exacerbation. ER/urgent care clinic visits where the treatment is 
limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will 
not meet the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.  
Asthma exacerbation that requires a change in medication or 
worsening of asthma that requires the patient to be treated with 
alternative therapy will be entered into the case report form 
(CRF), inc luding the date at which any medication change was 
made and whether this medication change was implemented 
prior to or after the IMPDV lung function assessments (FEV 1 
and PEF) were completed. Asthma worsening, including  
asthma exacerbations are with a change to alternative asthma 
therapy, will be recorded separately in the CRFs,as  an asthma 
exacerbation is efficacy endpoint and will not be considered an 
adverse event unless for this study since  it meets the definition

SECTION 9.5.4 PLANNED METHOD OF ANALYSIS (Other section affected by [CONTACT_18942]: Section 9.2.1)  
The mITT ITT analysis set (Section  9.2.1) will be the primary 
analysis set to be used for all efficacy analyses. The ITT 
analysis set will serve as the supportive analysis set for all 
efficacy analyses.  The PP analysis set will serve as the 
supporti vesensitivity  analysis set for primary efficacy analyses 
only. Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. 
Subgroup (sex, age group, previous therapy [ICS or NCS], and race) analyses will be provided for the primary efficacy endpoints.  The I TT analysis set (Section  9.2.1) will be the primary 
analysis set to be used for all efficacy analyses. The PP 
analysis set will serve as the sensitivity analysis set for 
primary efficacy analyses only. Details will be provided in the statistical analysis p lan. Subgroup (sex, age group, 
previous therapy [ICS or NCS], and race) analyses will be provided for the primary efficacy endpoints.  This text was revised to reflect that the ITT analysis set will 
be the primary analysis set for 
efficacy analyses, since t he 
mITT analysis set will no longer be used in this study.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS] PRIMARY ESTIMANDS AND EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
The specific estimands selected for the [ADDRESS_27738] data after IMP 
discontinuation.  
The question of whether to use data collected after IMP 
discontin uation is an ongoing debate in statistical literature, in 
particular for studies with symptomatic endpoints and when it 
is common for patients who dropout to switch therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Little 
and Kang 2015, Mallinckrodt et al 2016, Mallinckrodt 2013, 
O’Neill and Te mple  2012).  This study is designed as a placebo -
controlled study and it is expected that patients randomized to 
placebo would discontinue IMP due to worsening asthma at a 
higher rate than those randomized to active treatment, which is 
known to be an efficacious drug as established by [CONTACT_28478]. After a patient discontinues IMP due to worsening 
asthma, the patient will be placed on alternative asthma The specific estimands selected for the [ADDRESS_27739] data after IMP discontinuation.

therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as systemic corticosteroids, additional 
medications containing ICS, or both, which would alter th e 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_28391]. Improvement 
of asthma would be expected as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_28371] 1 week for 
FEV 1 for placebo patients placed on ICS (Szefler et al 1999). It 
has al so been shown that patients placed on ICS with long 
acting beta -agonists can have significant improvement in serial 
FEV 1 measurements on the same day (Corren et al 2007,  
Pearlman et al 1999). Therefore, any patient who discontinued 
IMP and was placed on alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28392].  
The inclusion of patients who failed therapy and who were then 
treated with alternative medicat ion would blunt the treatment 
effect, potentially causing the study to fail due to the analysis 
rather than the effectiveness of the treatment given during the 
study. These patients no longer represent a true placebo 
population and including them in the po pulation for the primary 
outcome is not consistent with treatment by [CONTACT_14296]. In light of 
this, retrieved dropout data will be used only for sensitivity 
analyses. Missing data for patients who discontinue IMP will 
be imputed using reference -based multiple imputations 
representing a missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism.

140 APPENDIX B.  STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS BY [CONTACT_16990]  
1. Procedures for Optional Prescreening Visit  
An optional prescreening visit may be scheduled up to 15 days prior to the screening visit (SV). 
During this visit and after informed consent/assent (as applicable) is obtained, the investigator will discuss with the patient and parents/legal guardians/car egivers study procedures and 
potential study -specific changes to the patient’s current asthma therapy if a patient decides to 
participate in the study and qualifies for study entry; the investigator will also discuss any required washout periods for prohibited medications before the SV.  
At the time of informed consent (at the prescreening visit or SV), the parent/legal guardian will be counseled that, once randomized to treatment, patients are to remain in the study and complete all study procedures unless the choice is made to withdraw consent. This includes 
patients who may require alternative asthma therapy, experience an adverse event, violate the 
protocol, or fail to comply with study procedures. Continued patient participation is important to contribute to the scientific investigation.  
An SV will be scheduled, which should occur in the morning (0530 to 1100) and instruct patients to refrain from taking their morning inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long- acting β2 agonist (LABA) 
and to avoid taking rescue medication for at least 6 hours before the appointment time on the day of the SV. 
11. Procedures for Screening and Enrollment (Visit  1) 
A signed and dated informed consent form (unless already obtained at a prescreening visit) will 
be obtained from the parent/legal guardian, and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained 
from each patient (as applicable) before any screening procedures commence, according to national laws and local Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) 
requiremen ts. Each parent/legal guardian will acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this 
information for the study by [CONTACT_28499]. 
After informed consent is obtained, interactive response technology (IRT) will be used to assign 
screened patients an 8- digit permanent identification.  
Note that if the patient has a prescreening visit, a permanent identification number would have been assigned at that time.  
Lung function assessments by [CONTACT_28500] a minimum of [ADDRESS_27753] forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1  second (FEV

from [ADDRESS_27754] been any adverse events, changes in medications, or 
changes in medical history since providing consent/assent (as applicable) . The run- in period will 
not start until patients have passed all screening procedures (including a retest, if needed).  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27755] should be classified as screen failures but may be rescreened. Patients 
who experience an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI) or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (LRI) during the run-in period should be classified as randomization failures and be discontinued from the 
study, but may be rescreened [ADDRESS_27756] up to  30 days before the RV. The following procedures will be performed 
at SV:  
• obtain written informed consent/assent (as applicable) before any study- related 
procedures are performed (unless already obtained at a prescr eening visit)  
• review medical history  
• collect prior medication history  
• review inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• collect demographic data  
• inquire and record adverse events and concomitant medications 
• perform vital signs measurements  
• perform full physical examination (including weight and height) 
• perform oropharyngeal examination 
• perform urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential, as applicable)  
• perform predose lung function assessments (FEV
1 and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF]) 
by [CONTACT_28400], followed by [CONTACT_28501] a bronchodilator test within 30 minutes 
after 2 to 4  inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol HFA. Patients who fail to meet lung 
function assessments or response to a bronchodilator requirements may retest once within 7  days. 
• dispense run-in drug kit 
• dispense rescue medication  
• provide training on handheld device 
• provide patient handheld device 
• provide training on investigational medicinal product (IMP) and have patient demonstrate proper technique using the provided training device. The training inhaler is to be kept at the clinic and not provided to the patient to keep at home. 
Patients will be provided with a handheld device at the SV, which will be used to measure lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and will serve as an electronic patient diary to collect 
asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and IMP use throughout the course of the study. A single training inhaler will be assigned to each patient at the SV and will be kept at the investigational center for use  at each investigational center visit.  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27757] or rescreen patients will be based on the investigator’s judgement and the study protocol. In cases of rescreening, the sponsor or designee should be notified of the pending rescreening. Patients may retest/rescreen for lung function assessments and response to a 
bronchodilator only if they meet all other nonspi[INVESTIGATOR_28356]/exclusion criteria. At the retest, patients will be asked if they have had any adverse events, changes in medicat ions, or 
changes in medical history. Patients will not be eligible to enter the run -in period until all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.  
13. Run-in Period (Between Screening Visit and Treatment Visit [TV] 1)  
Patients meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the SV will 
begin a 14- to 30- day run -in period. Albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 
metered -dose inhaler (MDI; a SABA inhaler) will be provided to replace the patient’s current 
rescue medication, and is to be used as needed for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms 
during the run-in and treatment periods , with a maximum of [ADDRESS_27758] discontinue their current ICS or ICS/LABA therapy and all other nonstudy asthma- related drugs and instead take a patient -blinded MDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_28352] (1  inhalation twice daily).  
The intent of the run- in period is to complete baseline safety evaluations, establish patient 
compliance, and obtain baseline measures of asthma symptoms, rescue use, and lung function 
assessment values. Patients (with assistance from parents/legal guardians/caregivers, as needed) 
will record symptoms, rescue use, and lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) in the patient 
diary  built into the handheld device throughout the 14- to 30-day run-in period to establish their 
baseline profiles. Patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_28502].  
14. Procedures Before Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment (Baseline 
[Randomization Visit (RV)/TV1])  
Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria at visit SV will continue to RV/TV1. At the RV/TV1, patient will be assessed for randomization. Pat ients who meet all of the 
randomization criteria will be randomized into the double-blind treatment period of the study. Note: response to bronchodilator testing may not be conducted on the same day as the randomization visit.  
The following procedures will be performed at the RV/TV1: 
• review randomization criteria  
• inquire about adverse events and concomitant medications 
• perform vital signs measurements  
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
143 • perform directed cardiopulmonary examination 
• perform oropharyngeal examination 
• perform urine  pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential, as applicable)  
• perform predose lung function assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28400] 
• provide training on IMP and have patient demonstrate proper technique using the 
provided training device before dosing with IMP. The training inhaler is to be kept at the clinic and not provided to the patient to keep at home. 
• dispense IMP  
• observe patient dosing with IMP 
• perform 1 -hour postdose lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28467]  
• collect Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) asthma questionnaire 
• collect run -in drug kit 
• dispense/collect rescue medication (if needed)  
• dispense and provide training on handheld device 
• assess alert criteria for worsening asthma  
A patient who is not enrolled in the study on the basis of results of baseline assessments (eg, because inclusion and exclusion criteria were not met or enrollment did not occur within the 
specified time) may be considered for screening again if there is a change in the patient’s medical background, a modification of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, or other relevant change. (Note: Details of rescreening criteria and procedures are included in the monitoring plan.) 
Patients who continue to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria wil l be assigned a permanent 
unique randomization number. 
15. Procedures During Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment  
a. Double -Blind Treatment Period (TV1 to TV6)  
During the treatment period (TV1 though TV6), daily in the morning and evening at 
approximately the same time each day, patients (with assistance from parents/legal 
guardians/caregivers, as needed) will use the handheld device at home to record asthma symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use, after which they will perf orm lung 
function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) and then will take their dose of the IMP and record IMP 
dosing in the patient diary built into the handheld device.  
On the morning of each TV, patients will be instructed to record their asthma symptom score an d 
rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI use and complete their morning lung function 
assessments (FEV 1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28405], but to delay dosing until they get to 
the investigational center. Patients are also to withhold their  rescue SABA for  a minimum of 
6 hours prior to obtaining lung function assessments. If the patient inadvertently takes the 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27759] been withdrawn from 
IMP but remain in the study should withhold their alternative asthma therapy dosing until after 
treatment visit assessments and avoid rescue medication for a minimum of 6 hours prior to clinic lung function assessments. The treatment visit should be rescheduled if either or both occur. 
At the investigational center, after appropriate instructions and training (competent handheld 
device use and dosing technique using the training devices provided), patients will repeat t heir 
lung function assessment (FEV
1 and PEF) under the supervision of the investigational center 
staff. They will then take their morning dose of the IMP  unless IMP has been withdrawn. IMP 
administration at the investigational center should be timed so tha t lung function assessments 
will be approximately [ADDRESS_27760] been withdrawn from IMP will be asked to perform 1 -hour postdose lung function 
assessments; although the patients will not be taking a dose of IMP, the assessment should be approximately [ADDRESS_27761] 
FEV
1 value from 3 acceptable and  2 repeatable maneuvers (maximum of [ADDRESS_27762]) will 
be obtained before and 1-hour after the morning dose. The postdose measurements should be taken  at 60  minutes ±[ADDRESS_27763] will be completed by [CONTACT_28406]’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver (as 
applicable) at the investigational center, before any other assessments are performed, at specified visits. The same parent or caregiver should complete assessments at each visit. Specific instructions are provided in the study reference manual. 
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_5292], oropharyngeal examination, vital signs, lung 
function assessments, and recording of adverse events. Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the treatment p eriod will be confirmed by [CONTACT_19201] a swab for culture of the suspect area. 
Patients and parents/legal guardians/caregivers will be provided with guidelines for when to contact [CONTACT_28409]. Patients who meet predefined alert criteria should be evaluated by [CONTACT_28503] (IMPDV). In cases where the IMP is to be wi thdrawn and alternative 
therapy started, the investigational center staff should contact [CONTACT_28407]. If a patient discontinues the study prematurely but remains in the study, all subsequent 
visits will include all assessmen ts according to Table 3. 
− Treatment Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12) and IMPDV 
Patients will attend the investigational center at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The following procedures/assessments will be performed at these visits:  
• inquiry and recording of adverse events and concomitant medications 
• measurements of vital signs  
• perform oropharyngeal examination 
• perform urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential, as applicable)  
• perform predose lung function assessments (FEV

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
145 • provide training on IMP (at all but TV6 and the IMPDV) and have patient 
demonstrate proper technique using the provided training inhaler. The training inhaler is to be kept at the clinic and not provided to the patient to keep at home. Inhaler 
device training is not required for patients placed on alternative asthma therapy and 
who are no longer taking IMP per protocol. 
• observe patient dosing with IMP 
• perform 1 -hour postdose lung function assessments (FEV
1 and PEF) by [CONTACT_28467] (morning only at TV6) 
• provide handheld device training (at all but TV6) 
• collect C -ACT asthma questionnaire (at TV4, TV5, TV6, and IMPDV only) 
• dispense/collect rescue medication (as needed)  
• dispense/collect IMP (at TV3, TV4, TV5, TV6, and the IMPDV only) 
• assess alert criteria for worsening asthma  
• discuss and record recommended asthma therapy (TV6 and the IMPDV only) 
• end IMP in IRT system (TV6 and the IMPDV only) 
• end study participation in IRT system (IMPDV only)  
16. Procedures After Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment  
Patients who participate in the study in compliance with the protocol for the entire duration of the study (screening, run-in, and all TVs) will be considered to have completed the study.  
a. Follow- up 
For patients who complete the study or withdraw prematurely, final evaluations will be 
performed at the IMPDV or on the last day the patient receives the IMP, or as soon as possible 
thereafter. Procedures for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study are described in Section  4.3. Patients should be treated with standard of care after termination of the study as 
appropriate. 
Patients may attend a follow -up visit one week (±2 days) after the last TV. The follow-up visit 
may be in person or over the telephone. The following assessments will be performed during the 
follow-up visit: 
• inquiry of adverse events 
• inquiry of concomitant medication 
The patients will be deemed to have completed the treatment peri od if they have completed all 
periods of treatment, including screening, run- in, and all treatments visits. The patient will be 
deemed to have completed the study period if they have completed all periods of the study, 
including FV in addition to screening, run-in, and all TVs. Patients who stop IMP and return for

147 APPENDIX C. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations 
Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendme nt by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB  and national and local 
competent authorities, as applicable , except when necessary to address immediate safety 
concerns to the patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigato r at each investigational center, the coordinating 
investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 
Protocol Violations 
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include nonadherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific in clusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to IMP administration; and use of prohibited medications. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study. 
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not  prospectively granted by 
[CONTACT_456]. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion a nd exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the 
sponsor of the protocol violation. If such patient has already completed the study or has 
withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 
Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members 
involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all study personnel are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary. 
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27765] signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they participate in  the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals. 
The study monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_28505]. The study monitor will be permitted to review and verify the various 
records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source 
document relating to the study) to verify adherence to the protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded.  
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication.  
Audit and Inspection  
The sponsor may audit the invest igational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Specialty Development, is responsible for determi ning the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. 
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
149 APPENDIX D. ETHICS 
Informed Consent/Assent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by [CONTACT_093], should fully inform the 
patient and each parent/legal guardian of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. All written and oral information about the study will be 
provided in a language as nontechnical as practical to be understood by [CONTACT_7071]/legal guardian 
and the patient. The patient and each parent/legal guardian should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documents. 
A personally signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from the parent/legal 
guardian, and a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient (as applicable 
and as may be specified by [CONTACT_427])  before any study specific procedures or 
assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are 
explained; according to IEC/IRB requirements. The forms will be signed and dated also by [CONTACT_28506]. The investigator will keep the original 
informed consent and assent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_11309] (and each parent/legal guardian). It will also be explained to the patients (and each parent/legal guardian) 
that they are free to refuse participation in the study and free to withdraw from the study at any 
time without prejudice to future treatment. The parent/legal guardian will be counseled about the importance of the patient completing all visits even if the patient is withdrawn from IMP but 
chooses to continue their participation in the study (ie, does not withdraw consent). The 
parent/legal guardian will be asked to provide alternative contact [CONTACT_3031] (as allowed by 
[CONTACT_1295]) in the event that the study center is unable to contact [CONTACT_7071]/legal guardian to encourage continued participation in the study. 
Competent Authorities an d Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national competent authority and to 
the respective IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigatio nal 
center before the IEC/IRB and competent authority (as applicable) for the investigational center 
give written approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_16995]. 
Personal med ical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety or for verifying 
data in the source and the CRF. This review may be conducted by [CONTACT_11200], properly 
authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, Global Quality Assurance (GQA), or competent authorities. Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.  
In compliance with national and local regulations and in accordance with Teva standard procedures, this clinical study will be registered on trials registry website s. 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27766] to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_23524]. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investigational center for a 
required study visit: 
• The investigational center staff  must attempt to contact [CONTACT_28507]/or should continue in the study. This includes using alternative contact 
[CONTACT_28495]/legal guardian as outlined in the informed consent (as allowed  by [CONTACT_1295]).  
• In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing addre ss or 
local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of ‘lost to follow-up’.

Pharmacogenomics is not evaluated in this study.  
 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27771] complaint include but are not limited 
to: 
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is receive d at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging, or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint by [CONTACT_23527] 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.  
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply) should be 
sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
2. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide the following information, as available: 
• investigational center number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300]  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable  
• product name [CONTACT_28515] 
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double blind or open label studies 
• product available for return (Yes/No) 
• product was taken or used according to protocol (Yes/No) 

 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 02  Study FSS- AS-[ZIP_CODE] 
158 • description or nature of complaint 
• associated serious adverse event (Yes/No)  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) [Yes/No] 
• date and name [CONTACT_23538]: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immediately. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.  
2. Handling o f Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s) 
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all IMP, the sponsor will provide the 
information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 
problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient. 
3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting (Section Section  7.1.2 and Section 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS], respectively).  
4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the 
complaint has been investigated by [CONTACT_16998], if necessary, an event 
closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product. 
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_23528]. 
 
 Placebo Controlled Study– Asthma  
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_27772] supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which 
data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF.  
If data are processed from other institutions or by [CONTACT_11174] (eg, clinical laboratory, central image cent er, or data from the patient diary built into the handheld device) the results will be sent 
to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). 
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and inspectors from competent 
authority (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements.  
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, so urce documents) of each patient’s data 
at all times. The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the unambiguous identification of each patient. 
Data Collection 
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11 ([LOCATION_003]) and documents of other concerned competent authorities. Before us ing the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all users will 
receive training on the system and study specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights. 
Data will be collected at the investigational cente r by [CONTACT_23529], and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, data from the patient diary built into the handheld device, electronic patient-
reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retain ed but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These 
data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded 
directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly to  the CRF.  
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening 
failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered in the CRF.

2. Purpose of the study  
Aim: Evaluate the effect s of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145207] ( RUL) electroconvulsive therapy  (ECT). Hypothesis : Addition of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145208] . 
3. Background and Significance  
Depression is the leading cause of disability in individuals aged 15 -44, resulting in 400 million disability days in 
a year (1). The total economic burden of the disease is estimated to be composed of $26.[ADDRESS_166126] 
medical costs, $5.4 billion in suicide -related mortality costs, and  $51.[ADDRESS_166127]  (1).  
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the gold -standard treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) that is 
severe  (2-5).  The standard method of ECT used in the US now is right unilateral ultra -brief study. RUL ECT uses 
a pulse width of </= 0.[ADDRESS_166128] sessions  (6). 
Because the maximum ECT output is limited by [CONTACT_8415], a frequent problem encountered by [CONTACT_145233]  (7). 
Hence i t would be useful to develop means to lower  seizure threshold.    
In addition, some  studies show a reduction in efficacy with ultra -brief as compared to brief ECT with the 
former requiring higher number of ECTs to achieve remission in depression symptoms (8).  There represents a  
need for increasing the efficacy for RUL ultra brief  ECT given its favorable cognitive -side effect profile.  
Combining RUL ultra brief  ECT with appropriate psychopharmacological agents t o alter seizure profile is a 
feasible way of optimizing the efficacy.  
4. Design and Procedures  
4.[ADDRESS_166129] of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145209] (MDD) referred for  RUL ultra brief  ECT. The study is powered to determine changes in 
seizure duration and seizure threshold by [CONTACT_79323] [ADDRESS_166130] 10 
participants.   
The participant is not responsible for any research -related costs.  The participants will be under the purview of 
their physician who is responsible for the participant’s care. The study te am will ask for participant s’ 
permission to contact [CONTACT_145234]’s enrollment during the study.   
 
 4.[ADDRESS_166131] of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145206]  
 
05/2/[ADDRESS_166132] session. Participants will go through the informed 
consent procedure. After providing informed consent participants will undergo a clinical assessment to 
confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
 
All female subjects in the reproductive age group will  be tested for pregnancy using a commercially available 
test kit specified by [CONTACT_145235]. The Pregnancy test must be negative to 
continue in the study. If sexually active, subjects mus t agree to  use appropriate contraceptive measures for 
the duration of the study  for inclusion . Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization 
(such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as  birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, 
or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after 
unprotected se x, are not acce ptable methods for routine use and will result in exclusion from the study . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_166133] treatment as usual, however, study participants  will be randomized to receive a 
single, extended -release bupr opi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (Wellbutrin® XL) 300 mg tablet to be taken by [CONTACT_1966], in the morning ([ADDRESS_166134])  on the day of ECT session [ADDRESS_166135].   
 
The study is powered to determine changes in seizure duration and seizure threshold by [CONTACT_79323] 10 subjects  
([ADDRESS_166136] session 2) . 
Counterbalanced r andomization will be used to assign subject drug administration to ECT session 1 or 2  with 
inter -individual cross -over . The PI (Steven T Szabo Jr MD PhD) and coordinator (Gopalkumar Rake sh) will be 
blinded to randomization details. Computer generated r andomization  would be done by [CONTACT_145236] – the director of the ECT program.  The sleep lab clinical care coordinator (Mark Mayo) would be backup 
to generate randomization if [CONTACT_145243] ner is absent.  
 
The medication would be dispensed from Central Pharmacy in Duke North. It would be stored in the sleep lab 
in the red zone on the fifth floor of Duke South and carried by [CONTACT_145237] ( Mark Mayo ) 
to the ECT suite for administration to study patients.

electrode placement with a MECTA spectrum device (MECTA Corporation, Portland, Ore.) with a pulse width 
</= 0.[ADDRESS_166138] a nd second treatment s, subjects would receive bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145210] . 
Subsequent treatments would be  administered at 5.5 times seizure threshold  from the treatment session 
without bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145211] .  
 
4.5 Clinical assessments  
The Mont gomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is an assessment tool for depression symptom 
severity and will be carried out at baseline at every ECT visit.  This is usual practice that the ECT clinician 
employs prior to the clinical administration of ECT.  We will also measure time to orientation recovery post

Effect of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145206]  
 
05/2/[ADDRESS_166142]. Patients are referred by [CONTACT_145238]. Inpatients 
admitted on Williams’ Ward in Duke South (4 th floor red zone) will be approached for participation after 
discussion with the ECT team they have been referred to. Outpatients will be recruited in the manner as 
described in section 4.2. Selection criteria for subjects has been described in Section 5.  Capacity to consent 
will be assessed by a member of the treatment team who is not an inves tigator on this study (such as the 
inpatient attending psychiatrist or the unit director). Study team members (who are not members of the 
subject's clinical team) will approach potential subjects after the study is introduced to potential subjects 
first by  [CONTACT_145239]. For both inpatients/outpatients referred to ECT recruitment would 
proceed as follows: 1) study team member reviews charts for ECT consult roster to ID potential eligible 
individuals 2) Discuss with ECT team w hether someone is appro priate 3 ) A member of patient's clinical ECT 
team asks patient if they  want to hear about study and 4 ) With patient agreement, study team member 
discusses study with them. Study team member  discussing  informed consent will fully disclose and explain 
the ri sks and benefits of the study procedures, and answer the patient’s questions about the study and the 
material presented in the informed consent form. Alternatives to study participation will be discussed, and 
the voluntary nature of participation in the st udy will be emphasized. This consent discussion will be 
documented in a consent note placed in the patient’s chart.  
 
There would be no compensation for patients in this study. We do not deviate from usual course of 
treatment except for a one -time administr ation of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145214]. Subjects would receive standard of care and there are no additional 
visits or rating scales applied as part of the study.  
 
7. Consent Process – see Sectio n [ADDRESS_166143]’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent – All patients recruited for this study must have 
capacity to give legally effective consent.  
 
9. Study Interventions  – This has been described in detail in section 4.3  
 
10. Risk/benefit assessment  
The potential risks of the study design are problems associated with ECT  and administratio n of 
extended -release bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145215].   Risk and benefits are for 
procedures done specifically for the s tudy.  
10.[ADDRESS_166144]. The likelihood of these 
complications is reduced by (1) careful medical workup and the use of cardiology consu ltants in 
patients with significant preexisting cardiac disease; (2) careful monitoring of cardiac status during 
ECT; (3) modification of anesthetic procedures for prophylactic purposes (e.g., use of 
pharmacological agents to block hemodynamic changes). Fa tality associated with ECT is estimated 
to occur in 1/10,[ADDRESS_166145] of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145206]  
 
05/2/[ADDRESS_166146] commonly results in memory deficits. These memory deficits are of two types: anterograde and 
retrograde amnesia. There is little ob jective evidence that memory  impairments persist more than 
four weeks following an ECT course. The effect of ECT on memory is cumulative, depending on 
number of sessions. It is unusual to see these deficits after the first or second treatments.  
 
The magnit ude of both memory deficits depends on  parameters used in the conduct of ECT.  In 
general, these deficits are more severe with bilateral (BT) versus right unilateral (RUL) electrode 
placement. Spacing of treatments may be increased or the treatment course terminated in the 
context of unacceptable side effects.  
For the study, patients would have seizure threshold estimated during second ECT  in addition to 
seizure threshold estimation during the first . This exposes them to debatable cardiovascular risk 
from  sub convulsive stimulations  (9). Some rare but concerning adverse effects related to supra -
threshold stimulus titration of ECT in elderly patients are post -ECT delirium/confusion and persistent 
memory impairment (6)  
 
10.1.2 Specific risks/side effects of bupro pi[INVESTIGATOR_145216], bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145217], 
adolescents, and young adults in short -term trials. These trials did not show an increase in the risk of 
suicidal thoughts and behavior with antide pressant use in subjects aged [ADDRESS_166147]  
Seizure risk is 0.1 % for 450 mg  of sustained release Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . This risk  is comparable to  that of other 
antidepressants  (10).  
Regarding safety for combined use of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145218], we found 3 case reports that reported the 
occurrence of seizures when this combination was used together. In 2 case reports there were other 
medications used in addition to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and one case report had discontinuation of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_145219] (11-13). In all these patient scenarios,  they received 
bilateral (BT) ECT, and the bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145220] (IR) and not sustained release 
(SA). Another set of [ADDRESS_166148] (14, 15).  
 
     10.1.[ADDRESS_166149]  
 
There are case reports and studies that detail the development of spontaneous seizures after a course of 
ECTs or after a few ECTs (16-18). The incidence of the phenomenon is less than 0.1%.  We plan to use only 
[ADDRESS_166150] of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145206]  
 
05/2/[ADDRESS_166151].   
 
 10.1.6 Risks of blood collection  
As described above, blood collection  will occur twice (3 ml each time) through a catheter placed in 
the individual’s arm vein just before they receive ECT.  Complications of drawing blood from a 
catheter which is placed in an individual’s arm vein for a brief period occur at approximately 2% of 
the time, a nd include discomfort at the site of puncture, possible bruising and swelling around the 
puncture site, and rarely infection or faintness from the procedure.  
 
10.2 Methods to minimize risks: - The following are methods to minimize r isks associated with thi s 
study  
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_166152].  Screening will include assessment of medical history, 
neurological history (seizure, stroke, and brain  lesion), head trauma, pregnancy, and substance 
abuse/dependence. Screening will be performed by [CONTACT_145240] n evaluation, physical examination, and 
blood work.    
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_166153] device has internal limits on stimulation parameters.  These limits prevent the device from 
being programmed to deliver pulses that exceed predetermined limits.  The device logs all 
parameter values.  
 
10.2.4 Minimizing risks associated with blood collection  
To minimize the risks of drawing blood from a catheter  vein, sterile technique s will be used by 
[CONTACT_116137].  
 
10.2.5 Minimizing risk of seizures with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145221]. Review of literature indicates 300 mg of 
sustained release formulation to be a safe dose in patients  (10). The sustained  release preparation 
reaches peak level more gradually compared to  other preparations of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] .  
 
10.[ADDRESS_166154] of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145206]  
 
05/2/[ADDRESS_166155] – Subjects would not incur any costs because of participa tion in this research study. 
There would be no compensation for patients in this study. We do not deviate from usual course of 
treatment except for a one -time administration of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145222]. Subjects would receive standard of care and there are no additional 
visits or rating scales applied as part of the study. The study sponsor would pay for the study drug and 
blood draws to obtain bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145223].  
 
 
11. Data Analysis & Sta tistical Considerations  We will use mixed effects modeling to see if extended -release 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145224]. The independent groupi[INVESTIGATOR_145225] (ECT 
session [ADDRESS_166156] session 2) with primary outcome variables being se izure duration and seizure threshold.  
There are no previous studies that have looked at effect of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_145226]. We plan 
to recruit only 10 patients as this would be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
12. Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
Data and safety monitoring will follow standard protocol procedures. Any serious adverse event will be 
reported within 24 hours to the Duke IRB. Adverse events will be doc umented and addressed accordingly. 
The participants will be fully informed of the nature of the study requirements prior to enrollment and 
periodically throughout the study. The participants’ well -being will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_145241], a nd the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145227] (DUHS) Institutional Review Board (IRB) office and all applicable 
regulatory authorities in accordance with the Center’s standa rd operating procedures.  The study monitor 
will be [CONTACT_145244]. [CONTACT_89878] will ensure the quality of the study and establish that all study staff are 
complying with the investigational plan and IRB regulations.  Monitoring of this protocol is simplifi ed by 
[CONTACT_145242] a small number of investigators and a single facility in which the study is 
being conducted.  Throughout the investigation, the monitor will ensure that the facilities being used 
continue to be acceptable for the purp oses of the study, that the investigational plan is being followed, 
that any changes to the protocol have received IRB approval and have been reported to the sponsor, that 
accurate, complete, and current records are maintained, that accurate, complete, and  timely reports are 
made to the IRB.  This will be accomplished through quarterly meetings during which the status of the 
protocol, investigators, and IRB compliance are reviewed.  The monitor will review each research chart for 
completeness and accuracy. He will confirm that inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met for each 
subject enrolled, and compliance with all other aspects of the investigational plan are met.

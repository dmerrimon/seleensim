Objectives
1.1 Study Objectives
The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding transdermal preparation of 
granisetron (Sancuso ®) to the current postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) standard prophylaxis regimen with dexamethasone and diphenydramine  in patients with the previous history of severe, particularly delayed and/or post-discharge, PONV and undergoing surgical procedure under general anesthesia.The specific aims of the study include: 
1. efficacy of the investigated therapy in prevention of PONV up to 120 hours after surgery2. incidence and seriousness of the observed side effects3. ability of patients to self-administer preoperatively and maintain the investigated patch during 
the perioperative period
4. level of satisfaction with the preoperative PONV prophylaxis.
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
Number of complete responders (CR, defined as no nausea or vomiting/retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_51953] 120 
hours postoperatively, no additional antiemetic medication up to 120 hours after surgery)
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints
Frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting during the observed period, patient satisfaction scores, 
length of stay, frequency of re-admission, frequency and type of side effects

Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common and distressing symptoms to patients. 
The general incidence of vomiting is about 30%, the incidence of nausea is about 50%, and in a subset of high-risk patients, the PONV rate can be as high as 85%. Unresolved PONV may result in prolonged post anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay and unanticipated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536757] a significant increase in overall health care costs. The goal of PONV prophylaxis is therefore to decrease the incidence of PONV and thus patient-related distress and reduce health care costs. The major shortcoming of currently used antiemetics is their relatively short duration of prophylactic activity (e.g., about 4-6 hours for all 5HT3 receptor antagonists- 5HT3RA) STUDY00002 329

requiring its repeated dosing or, for longer acting antiemetics (e.g., scopolamine patch or 
dexamethasone), the presence of significant side effects and limited effectiveness. It was reported previously that IV granisetron could be more effective than other 5HT3RA antiemetics because of its unique metabolic pathways and stronger 5HT3 receptor affinity. It is therefore important to investigate if the administration of granisetron in the prolonged activity formulation will provide effective antiemetic prophylaxis beyond 24-48 hours after administration.It is proposed that the non-invasive patch application could extend the available repertoire of the current 5HT3RAs oral or IV regimens in PONV.  Sancuso ® was approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2008, and is indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately and/or highly emetogenic (HE) chemotherapy regimens of up to 5 consecutive days’ duration. The present study will evaluate its effectiveness in the prophylaxis of PONV.
2.2 Previous Data
Granisetron as the hydrochloride  (HCl) salt has been approv ed as an anti-emetic and 
marketed since the earl y 1990s. Prior to its approval, a comprehensive development program 
was conducted and the data submitted for re gistration. Currently available granisetron 
formulations (oral and iv) were first marketed in the early 1990s (trade names include Kytril ®  and Kevatril ®). Generic oral and iv granisetron formulations are now available. 
In the extensive clinical experience gained since, these formulations have proven highly 
effective in the prevention of CINV, and no po st-marketing safety concerns have arisen.
   Clinical Studies of Sancuso ® in CINV (no published work available about its effects in 
PONV)
•A Phase I PK study (in 6 male and 6 female healthy subjects) demonstrated the 
delivery of granisetron over 5 days from a 15 cm 2 TDS applied to the abdomen. Mean maximum observed plasma concentration (C max ) was approximately 1.9 ng/ml and the approximate plateau value achieved equated to 1.1 ng/ml (392MD/4/C). 
•A Phase I relative bioavailability study (in 12 healthy male subjects) of 4-way 
cross-over design, compared 3 dosages of Sancuso ® (15, 33 and 52 cm 2 ) after a single 6-day application to the upper arm, to that of a 2 mg once-daily oral dose of granisetron for 5 days. Data indicated that average observed plasma concentration (C avg ) was reached after 24 hours and maximal concentrations were reached 48 hours after patch application. Based on C avg, a 52 cm2 TDS applied for 6 days resulted in a similar plasma concentration to that obtained with once-daily oral dosing of 2 mg granisetron. The pharmacokinetics of granisetron showed dose-proportionality 
(392MD/11/C). 
•A Phase II study (in 175 patients receiving moderately emetogenic (ME) single-day 
chemotherapy) evaluated efficacy of Sancuso ® for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV. Efficacy of Sancuso ® in acute emesis was comparable to the reference product, a single oral dose of 2 mg granisetron; in delayed emesis, efficacy was no different from placebo TDS. Sancuso ® was well-tolerated (392MD/8/C). 
•A Phase III multi-national study (in 637 patientsreceiving MEC (moderately emetogenic 
chemotherapy)  and HEC (highly emetogenic chemotherapy) multi-day 
chemotherapy) evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and safety of Sancuso ® in prevention of CINV associated with multi-day chemotherapy. The study demonstrated non-inferiority of Sancuso ® to oral granisetron in complete control (CC) of nausea and vomiting over the course of multi-day ME or HE chemotherapy (392MD/15/C and Boccia et al, 2010). 
•A study to evaluate the skin irritation and sensitization potential of Sancuso ® in 
212 healthy subjects assessed the cumulative skin irritation and sensitization potential of Sancuso ® over a 21-day period. The study concluded that Sancuso® and its matching placebo are slightly irritant when applied on healthy skin, with a lower STUDY00002 329

2.3 Study Rationale
Clinical guidelines recommend the use of 5HT3RAs in the prevention of PONV and 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Granisetron is a potent 5HT3RA, with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, or for dopamine-D2, histamine-H1, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_536758]. Oral and intravenous (iv) formulations of granisetron have been marketed for over [ADDRESS_698965] in more than 90% of patients. ProStrakan, Limited has developed a new granisetron formulation, Sancuso® , a transdermal delivery system (TDS) (granisetron TDS or patch) for the prevention of CINV.  Sancuso® consists of a stable matrix of granisetron base (6% w/w) in a commercially-available adhesive (DURO-TAK ® 387-2287), designed to sustain delivery of granisetron over a number of days following topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407]. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of Sancuso ® has indicated that it provides continuous delivery of granisetron over 7 days, providing exposure similar to an oral dose of 2 mg per day (Howell et al, 2009). Previous data indicate prolonged activity of this preparation in prophylaxis of CINV. There is no data available about the efficacy of this formulation in the prophylaxis of PONV.It should be noted however that there is increasing concern among anesthesiologists and surgeons about patients displaying so called post-discharge (or late) form of PONV These symptoms occur at least 48-[ADDRESS_698966] several days (often after patient has been already discharged from the medical facility). It is therefore feasible that the investigated formulation of granisetron will provide prophylactic antiemetic activity throughout the entire period, including acute and delayed phases of PONV.

7.2 Study Procedures
Patients will be recruited from the surgical population undergoing preoperative evaluation in 
Anesthesiology Preoperative Evaluation Clinic at Hershey Med. Ctr. (~15,000 per year). Selected patients (ASA 1-3, N=60) with history of severe PONV after one or more of previous general anesthesia, and scheduled to undergo surgical procedures with general anesthesia will be enrolled into IRB approved protocol. The patch will be placed by [CONTACT_44126] 24 – [ADDRESS_698968] intraoperative PONV prophylaxis (IV dexamethasone and 4 mg and  diphenydramine  25 mg ). Postoperative evaluation will include recording of incidence and severity of PONV at the time of discharge from PACU (acute PONV), and at 120 hrs (delayed or post discharge PONV).  The final phone interview will be performed [ADDRESS_698969] discharge PONV. Study will be explained to the patient and consent obtained.  The investigational pharmacy will be notified that a study patient has been enrolled and they will prepare the patches for distribution to the patient. EKG will be performed and the results will be recorded preoperatively.A member of the research team will obtain the assigned patches from the investigational pharmacy and deliver to the anesthesia provider (member of the research team). The provider will then demonstrate to the patient how to apply the patch and the patient can practice using a placebo patch to show that the correct placement. Patient will then take the actual patch home with them.  Patient will also be given a PONV diary to take home with them.  Upon returning home from surgery, the patient will be asked to record their instances of nausea and vomiting on a daily basis for up to five days after surgery.  At hour [ADDRESS_698970]-op, a case manager will telephone the patient and note any recorded STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
instances of nausea and vomiting since the patient has returned home.  The case 
manager will also check the status of the patch and any medications that were taken as a result of nausea and vomiting.  One week after removal of patch (120h post-op + 7 days), a case manager will call the patient a final time to collect adverse events and to assess patient satisfaction with the patch.
7.2.2 Visit 2 - approximately 24-48 hours preoperatively (patient’s home)
Patient will apply the patch to their upper arm 24-[ADDRESS_698971]. Any potential side effects (systemic or local) will be recorded at that time. The subsequent standardized general anesthesia protocol for elective surgery will include general endotracheal anesthesia with sevofluran (no nitrous oxide), muscle relaxants (with reversal), intraoperative IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], including standard PONV prophylaxis (dexamethasone and diphenydramine  25 mg IV  ).  
Early postoperative evaluation will include recording of incidence and severity of 
PONV at the time of discharge from PACU (acute PONV). The incidence of vomiting or retching will recorded by [CONTACT_60397]. Patients with symptoms requiring a rescue antiemetic—nausea score ≥4 on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), retching or 
vomiting, or patient request—within [ADDRESS_698972] of care. Promethazine will be used as slow infusion bolus (over 5-10 min) in large, good flowing peripheral IV. If the first line rescue medication does not work the patient will be given ondansetron 4 mg IV). The NRS is an 11-point linear scale on which patients rate their nausea, with [ADDRESS_698973] possible nausea. 
The subsequent evaluations will be performed either at the patient's bed (if in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or by [CONTACT_536768] 120 hrs (delayed or post discharge PONV). The patient will be supplied with a diary to record the information that will be requested on the follow-up phone calls.
The primary efficacy endpoint will be complete response (CR), defined as no emetic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_140586]; the proportions of patients with no emesis and no additional rescue medication in the 120 hours following the completion of surgical procedure and the change from baseline nausea score using the NRS. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study medication, will be also recorded throughout and continued until [ADDRESS_698974] 
experienced since the removal of the patch.
7.3 Duration of Participation
Patient will remain in the study until the final follow-up phone call has been made (7 days STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
following removal of the patch).

9.0 Statistical Plan
9.1 Sample size determination
We are planning an open label study of cases treated with granisetron patch (no comparison 
group, historical control group). Prior data indicate that the failure rate (at least 1 x PONV postoperatively or administration of additional antiemetics) among patients with severe PONV is 0.85.  If the true failure rate for experimental subjects is 0.4 (decrease of incidence of PONV by [CONTACT_2016]), we will need to study [ADDRESS_698981] the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental subjects is equal to historical control with probability (power) 0.8.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use an uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis.
9.[ADDRESS_698982] of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use

12.0
Risks
12.1 CONTRAINDICATIONS
Sancuso is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to granisetron or to any of the 
components of the patch.
12.2 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
12.2.1 Gastrointestinal
The use of granisetron in patients may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention 
caused by [CONTACT_531004].STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
12.2.2 Skin Reactions
In clinical trials with Sancuso, application site reactions were reported that were 
generally mild in intensity and did not lead to discontinuation of use.  The incidence of reactions was comparable with placebo.  
If severe reactions, or a generalized skin reaction occur (e.g., allergic rash, including 
erythematous, macular, papular rash or pruritus), the patch must be removed.
12.2.[ADDRESS_698984] be advised to cover the patch application site, e.g. with clothing, if there is a risk of exposure to sunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days following its removal because of a potential skin reaction [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3)] .
12.2.[ADDRESS_698985] been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.
Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination 
of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Sancuso and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Sancuso and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Sancuso is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs.

use of Sancuso. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  Application site reactions (pain, 
pruritus,  erythema, rash, application site irritation, vesicles.
Cardiac Disorders :  bradycardia, chest pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], sick sinus syndrome
12.[ADDRESS_698988] been reported in clinical studies with Sancuso.
Because granisetron is metabolized by [CONTACT_154934] P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes 
(CYP1A1 and CYP3A4), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and hence, the half-life of granisetron.  In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by [CONTACT_536770] . In in vitro  human microsomal studies, ketoconazole 
inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride.  However, the clinical significance of in 
vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known.  In a human pharmacokinetic 
study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride.  The clinical significance of this change is not known.
Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular 
symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

21.0 Adverse Event Reporting
21.1 Adverse Event DefinitionsSTUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below 
responses, as written:
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug
Suspected adverse reaction Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
•Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Unexpected adverse event or Unexpected suspected adverse reaction.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Unanticipated adverse device effect Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
21.2 Recording of Adverse Events
All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to 
study team believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. All adverse events (including those labeled) will be recorded in each patients Case Report Form and evaluated for relationship to study drug, severity, date of onset, date of resolution and outcome.
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
•The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
•The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy
Note:  Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed 
criteria, does not constitute an adverse event.  
•The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject 
participation in the clinical research study
The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].
21.[ADDRESS_698991] findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable 
relationship to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.
21.4 Reporting of Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the FDA  
21.4.1 Written IND Safety Reports
The Sponsor-Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA 
Form 3500A) to the responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be a serious and unexpected, suspected adverse reaction.  Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be provided to all participating investigators (if applicable) and sub-investigators.
Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no 
event, later than 15 calendar days following the Sponsor-Investigator’s receipt of the respective adverse event information and determination that it meets the respective criteria for reporting.
For each written IND Safety Report, the Sponsor-Investigator will identify all 
previously submitted IND Safety Reports that addressed a similar suspected adverse reaction experience and will provide an analysis of the significance of newly reported, suspected adverse reaction in light of the previous, similar report(s) or any other relevant information.
Relevant follow-up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the 
applicable review division of the FDA as soon as the information is available and will be identified as such (i.e., “Follow-up IND Safety Report”).
If the results of the Sponsor-Investigator’s follow-up investigation show that an adverse 
event that was initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the Sponsor-Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report as soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/201 9
21.4.2 Telephoned IND Safety Reports – Fatal or Life-threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reactions
In addition to the subsequent submission of a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed 
FDA Form 3500A), the Sponsor-Investigator will notify the responsible review division of the FDA by [CONTACT_74170], fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction. 
The telephone or facsimile transmission of applicable IND Safety Reports will be made 
as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor-Investigator’s receipt of the respective adverse event information and determination that it meets the respective criteria for reporting.
21.[ADDRESS_698992] (IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or reported harm (adverse event) experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_40454] (1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. Harms (adverse events) will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and procedures.
21.6 Reporting Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to ProStrakan, Ltd.
The investigator will also provide ProStrakan with a copy of the FDA form 3500A completed 
for all serious adverse events.  The information will include the investigator’s assessment of causality.  This information will be sent to the Company within 10 days of receipt of the adverse event reported by [CONTACT_093].  A copy of the completed FDA 3500A form submitted to the FDA will be sent to [EMAIL_10266] .  The company will enter all safety 
information in the Global Safety Database along with the investigator’s assessment of 
relationship of the event to the study medication.  Any follow up information will also be sent to the Company within [ADDRESS_698993] abstraction. The participant will complete a paper daily diary. The data will be double-data entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture application) in a timely fashion.  Data validation error checks will be programmed into REDCap to minimize the entry of erroneous data. Data entry discrepancies will be reviewed and resolved by a Clinical STUDY00002 329
Approval: 2/1/[ADDRESS_698994], ensure that all protocol deviations/violations are recorded, determine the timeliness of data entry, and ensure that all data errors have been resolved. 
The initial data monitoring visit will occur after five participants have completed the 
study. The frequency of monitoring will continue to be evaluated based upon previous findings, protocol changes, changes in the research team, or indications of poor data quality or participant safety issues.
22.1.2 Safety Monitoring
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74160] (AE) are correctly 
recorded on the AE data collection forms by [CONTACT_102867]; be available to answer any questions that the research coordinators may have concerning the AEs; and will notify the IRB, FDA, sponsor, Company and/or DSMB of all applicable AEs as appropriate.  All assessments of AEs will be made by a licensed medical professional who is an investigator on the study.The research coordinators will complete the appropriate AE forms and assist the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_536765], FDA, Company and/or DSMB of all Unanticipated Problems/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).The Public Health Sciences Data Monitoring staff will confirm that the AEs are correctly recorded on the data collection forms and entered into the REDCap database.  The monitor will confirm that the AEs are consistent with the source documents are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies in the timeframe required.

BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE  
Intravenous sedation (IVS) is an integral aspect of the oral and maxillofacial surgeon’s practice. For many 
minor oral surgical procedures, intravenous sedation is often necessary to manage patient anxiety and 
discomfort, while also  facilitating a safe and efficient procedure in the outpatient setting.  Ideally, 
sedative agents have anxiolytic, amnestic, and analgesic properties while maintaining cardiopulmonary  
stability.  The medications used should allow for rapid onset of action,  as well as a quick recovery, with 
minimal side effects.  
Several pharmacologic agents are frequently used for conscious sedation in the oral surgery practice.  
These medications often include midazolam, fentanyl, ketamine and propofol, either alone or in 
conjunction with one another.  While propofol and fentanyl have proved to be efficacious agents for use 
in intravenous sedation, they are not without associated side effects.  Propofol has the potential to 
cause a quick progression from conscious sedation t o general anesthesia, with the undesired effect of 
associated cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].1,[ADDRESS_1159440] -
operative nausea and vomi ting (PONV).[ADDRESS_1159441] explored the use of midazolam as a sole anesthetic, very high doses are required for deep 
sedation.  This can lead to dose -dependent respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], prolonged emergence and longer 
recovery time.4,6 
Dexmede tomidine (Precedex, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], Inc., Lake Forest, IL) is a highly selective alpha2 -adrenergic 
agonist that possesses hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties.1,5,[ADDRESS_1159442] on respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].1,5  Unlike propofol and fentanyl, dexmedetomidine’s lack of adverse 
effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_834783] e during intravenous sedation in the oral and 
maxillofacial surgery practice.   
Several  studies involving dexmedetomidine exist in the oral and maxillofacial surgery literature .  
Dexmedetomidine has been compared as a substitute for midazolam, as well as p ropofol, in conscious 
sedation by [CONTACT_834796].  For third molar surgery, dexmedetomidine was noted to preserve the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_834784].[ADDRESS_1159443] selectivity for alpha -2A versus alpha -2B receptors.14  While alpha -2A receptors are found in the 
CNS and are therefore responsible for the analgesic and sedative effects of the drug, alpha -2B recept ors 
are found in vascular smooth muscle and thereby [CONTACT_834797].  Because of this, initial loading doses of dexmedetomidine may be associated with a 
transient increase in blood pressure, followed by [CONTACT_834798].4,12,15 Hall et al reported that d exmedetomidin e demonstrated a decrease in  heart rate  from 
baseline  between 1 6 and 18%, and a decrease in blood pressure of 10 to 20%.[ADDRESS_1159444] -operative observation periods of increased duration.  
Intravenously administered dexmedetomidine has a distribution half -life of 6 minutes and an 
elimination half -life of 2 hours.12  It undergoes biotransformatio n in the liver and is excret ed primarily in 
the urine .9  
 
PURPOSE  
The primary goal of this prospective randomized trial is to determine whether there is a significant 
difference in the number of respi[INVESTIGATOR_834785]/general anesthesia (DS/GA) between two different anesthetic medication combinations: 
midazolam and dexmedetomidine versus midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol.  
Secondary variables to be measured include hemodynamic changes during the sedatio n, difference in 
the amount of movement during injection of local anesthesia, time until discharge, patient satisfaction 
with the sedation, and surgeon satisfaction with the sedation.  
 
HYPOTHESIS  
A sedative combination of midazolam with dexmedetomidine for  intravenous DS/GA during third molar 
surgery will provide less respi[INVESTIGATOR_834786] a sedative 
combination of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
The proposed study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, with two intravenous treatment 
groups during third molar surgery.  The patient will be masked to the anesthetic protocol used during 
the IVS for third molar surgery, and there will be a mas ked independent scorer to evaluate the number 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_834787], extent of patient movements, facial 
expressions and vocalization during local anesthesia injection, and time of procedure, time to 
ambulation, and t ime of virtual discharge.   
Group 1 (Control): Midazolam/fentanyl/propofol (MFP)  
Group 2 (Study): Dexmedetomidine/midazolam (D/M)

Randomization   
Subjects will be assigned to D/M or MFP by a computer -generated randomization  scheme with an 
undisclosed blocking factor in accordance with a 1:[ADDRESS_1159446] the patient's name [CONTACT_834808]'s chart. The 
patient's data will be de -identified by [CONTACT_834799]'s study ID on all  subsequent data files and 
forms associated with the patient for this trial.  
Investigator Team Roles  
Surgeon : Responsible for performing the surgery (masking is near impossible given that 
dexmedetomidine is colorless whereas propofol is white).  Furthermor e, in the outpatient OMFS surgery 
clinic the patient’s airway is not secured with an endotracheal tube.  Masking the surgeon may be 
unsafe in this setting and thus will not be attempted.  
 
Anesthetist : Responsible for medication preparation and administrati on, recording of drug 
administration and vital signs, patient monitoring, monitoring of apneic events. The anesthetist will be 
unmasked by [CONTACT_834800].  
 
Scorer : Responsible for recording and scoring the respi[INVESTIGATOR_834788], BPS-NI 
Scale, length o f procedure, time to discharge , any adverse events or outcomes, and vital signs ; scorer 
will be masked as to treatment  group . 
 
Blinding    

Only the scorer will be masked. To preserve masking o f the scorer, all medications, infusion pump, and 
IV tubing will be located behind a barrier to ensure that the scorer will not know the group to which the 
patient has been assigned.  In addition, the patient will not be informed as to their sedation, thus  
minimizing bias in determining patient satisfaction with treatment.  
METHODS  
1. Procedures to evaluate inclusion/exclusion  
a. Past medical history, medications, allergies  
b. Clinical examination  
c. Every patient  will have a panoramic radiograph and a cone beam CT if required based on 
surgeon’s examination  
2. Informed consent followed by [CONTACT_834801]  
3. Procedures performed as part of the trial.  
a. NPO status performed by [CONTACT_419009]  
b. Standard ASA monitors including pulse oximetry, NI BP, th ree-lead EKG, capnography  
c. Pre-treatment vitals and  BMI recorded by [CONTACT_419009]  
d. IV access obtained by [CONTACT_834802]  
e. Administration of antibiotic  and dexamethasone  
i. The subject will preoperatively be administered 600mg of clindamycin 
intraven ously, unless the patient has a reported allergy, in which case an 
alternative antibiotic will be given.  In addition to the antibiotic, 8mg of 
dexamethasone will be given intravenously to aid in reducing postoperative 
edema.  
f. Supplemental oxygen will be pr ovided via nasal cannula at 2 L/min  
g. Vital signs will be recorded every 5 minutes by [CONTACT_834803]  
h. The scorer will document respi[INVESTIGATOR_834788] (i.e. chin lift, positive 
pressure).  Required cessation of infusion or additional requested bolus es will also be 
recorded.  
i. Anesthetist begins IVS  
i. Group 1 (control):  
1. 0.03mg/kg midazolam, 0.1 mcg/kg of fentanyl and an infusion of propofol 
at 125 mcg/kg/min  
2. Propofol b oluses at 0.1 mg/kg  
ii. Group 2 (study):  
1. 0.03mg/kg midazolam, initial bolus of dexmedetomidine at 1 mcg/kg for 
10 minutes followed by a main tenance infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg/hr  
2. All medications, along with the infusion pump and IV tubing, will be 
located behind a barrier so that the scorer will not know which 
medications are  
j. Local anest hetic administ ration (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ) 
k. Operative p rocedure  
l. Anesthetic will be discontinued at initiation of suturing/closure  
m. The procedure completion time will be recorded by [CONTACT_834804].   
n. Vitals will be obtained at the conclusion of the procedure and every [ADDRESS_1159447] op vital signs will be evaluated statistically for each 
patient (15 and 30 minutes).  
o. The patient will be disch arged based on the criteria found on the modified Aldrete score 
(greater or equal to 9 or the preoperative score is met).  
4. Evaluations  
a. The surgeon will complete a Surgeon Satisfaction Survey regarding satisfaction with the 
IVS and the Cooperation Scale.   
b. The patient will complete the Patient Satisfaction Survey  
Stopp ing Criteria  
IVS will be stopped intraoperatively in this study as it would in the regular clinic setting.  If the procedure 
cannot be completed safely due to inability to control the patient f rom moving with the sedative agents, 
the procedure and sedation will be discontinued.  Other criteria to stop the IVS will include tachycardia 
>150bpm, bradycardia <40bpm, and/or inability to control the patient’s airway.  
IV medications will be temporarily  stopped if a patient remains apneic or in laryngospasm after 
intervention.  The IV medication can be resumed later in the procedure.

Risks  
 
Subjects in the study group are not at increased risk compared to the control group.  
 
Normal risks associated with third molar surgery will be discussed at your initial visit.  These include, but 
are not limited to, pain, bleeding, infection, swelling, da mage to adjacent teeth/structures, temporary or 
permanent numbness of the lower lip/chin/cheek/gums/teeth and/or tongue, chronic sinusitis, 
oroantral communication, alveolar osteitis (dry socket), and the need for additional procedures.

future infection, and decreased chance of future pathology.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
Data will only be saved on one computer  (password protected)  at the Blondell Dental Clinic at 
Montefiore Medical Park in the primary investi gator’s office ([CONTACT_834810]).   The subjects are 
assumed to present randomly and are  assigned study  numbers  in sequence according to the exterior 
enve lope label.  These study IDs  are not  associated with any personal identifiers  with the following 
exceptions: 1) The patient's name [CONTACT_834809]  (the envelope will be 
shredded at the end of the procedure) , and 2) T he study ID -med ical record key  will be saved in a 
separate database with a different password.  The questionnaire  documents will be locked in a filing 
cabinet in the primary  investigator’s office until the conclusion of the study when they will be shredded.  
In addition,  safety findings will be provided to an independent statistician after 25%, 50%, and 75% of 
the patients have been followed for [ADDRESS_1159449]’s electronic dental record. All other 
documentation will be shredded at the conclusion of the study.

All adverse events will go to the IRB as well as the committee.  The committee will meet once a year to 
review all adverse  events and to determine if any further protocol changes are necessary to ensure 
subject safety and to confirm that the risk vs. benefit has not changed. The committee will then submit a 
letter to the IRB after the meeting.  
 
Participant Recruitment and Inf ormed Consent  
Patients requiring third molar extractions who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be recruited.  
These patients are obtained via walk -in emergencies and referrals from within the Montefiore Medical 
Center general dental and ortho dontic departments.  Patients will have the option of having the 
procedure done without IVS.  
Informed consent will  be obtained by [CONTACT_834805] . The full protocol 
including risks, benefits and alternatives will be provided to subjects in writing, and the subject will have 
the opportunity to ask questions. Consent will be available in English and Spanish with necessary  
interpreters. A third party will witness all consents.  Only subjects with capacity to sign info rmed consent  
will be included . Oral consent will also be obtained from the surgeons.  
 
The patient will receive a copy of the informed consent form.  
HIPAA  authorization will also be provided and signed by [CONTACT_834806].  
 
Statistical Analysis  
 
Observed respi[INVESTIGATOR_834791] 6.1% on ketamine v. 19.3% on 
midazolam/fentanyl.18  The relative magnitude of these rates was consistent with the 5% v. 15% rates 
for respi[INVESTIGATOR_834792] a power analysis for th e comparison of IV and IM 
ketamine.19  Thus for α=.05, two -tailed test with 80% power, 114 subjects are required per group.  If 5% 
of subjects change their mind after randomization with regard to participating, then [ADDRESS_1159450] deviations, or if 
non-normal, by [CONTACT_834807].  Differences in means between groups at each time point will be 
presented as their difference with a 95% confidence interval f or the difference, and displayed using a 
line plot with standard error bars.  Categorical variables will be summarized using relative frequency 
distributions, with differences between groups and associated 95% confidence intervals.  Histograms 
will be pres ented for non -normal continuous variables and relative frequencies.  
 
Comparison of the groups with regard to the proportion of patients with at least one adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_834793] a Fisher's Exa ct test. The distribution 
of the number rating score  for patient satisfaction will be assessed (VAS scales have been supported for 
their ratio scale properties), and if assumptions are met, an optimal mixed effects model (with repeated 
measures over time) will be derived after evaluating various covariance matrix structures.  Because 
patient, physician, and grade of operating conditions will be evaluated at the end of the trial only, and 
because these scales are ordinal, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests will be used .  To evaluate the differences in 
hemodynamic stability  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], mixed effects models will be derived for heart rate, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_834794].  For the 
number of O 2 saturation events ≤92%, and for each of the numbers of respi[INVESTIGATOR_834795], Poisson regression with a log link function will be used; in addition multi (recurrent) -event 
survival models (i.e. Anderson -Gill; Wei -Lin-Weissfield; Prent ice, Williams, Peterson) will be applied and 
the optimal model chosen to determine whether there is a significant difference in the relative number 
of events that occurred as well as the difference in the distribution (spacing) of these events over the 
observed time period.   To assess whether dexmedetomidine significantly increases postoperative 
recovery time when compared with propofol , a transformation of scale will be derived to better 
approximate normality, and a difference between the groups with regar d to recovery times will be 
assessed using a t -test for independent samples.  This procedure will also be performed for time to 
ambulation and time to “virtual discharge.”  Because the Aldrete scale is ordinal and assessed only once, 
the difference between  groups will be tested using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.  All tests of hypotheses 
will follow an intention -to-treat protocol, will be two -tailed with α=.05, and performed using SAS 
Version 9.3, Cary, NC. Results will follow CONSORT guidelines.  The trial wil l be registered with 
clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
Cost  
The subjects’ insurance will be billed for the treatment.  There will be no additional cost to the patient.  
There will be no reimbursement for travel or compensation for participation.  
 
Collaborations  
o Results  of the study will be shared Montefiore IRB.  This information will contain no 
identifiers of the involved subjects

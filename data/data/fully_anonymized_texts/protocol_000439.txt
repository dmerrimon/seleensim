Statistical MethodsThe primary efficacy parameter will be the change from baseline to Week 6 
in MADRS total score. The primary analysis will be performed using a 
mixed-effects mo del for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, 
study center, visit, and treatment group –by-visit interaction as fixed effects 
and the baseline value and baseline by -visit interaction as covariates. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of 
within -patient scores. 
The secondary efficacy parameter will be the chan ge from baseline to Week 6 
in CGI -S score. The secondary efficacy parameter will be analyzed using an 
MMRM as used for the primary analysis.

7.0 INTRODUCTION
Bipolar disorder is a complex, chronic illness causing dramatic mood swings and unusual 
shifts in energy and behavior, ultimately  resulting in functional impairments. I t manifests 
itself as alterations in mood and energy  from euphoria and excitability  (mania or 
hypomania) to depression and psy chomotor retardation ( Goodwin and Jamison, 1990 ) 
and is associated with significant morbidity  and mortality . Bipolar disorder in the 
[LOCATION_002] affec ts 5.7 million adults or about 2.6% of the population 18 y ears and 
older in an y given year (Kessler et al, 2005 ) and has a considerable economic effect on 
our societ y (Wyatt and Henter, 1995). In the y ear 2000, this disorder ranked as the 
seventh leading c ause of worldwide nonfatal disease burden ( World Health Organization, 
2001). Suicide rates within this population are among the highest of all psychiatric 
illnesses (Muller -Oerlinghausen et al, 200 2).
The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significantly  more morbidity  and 
mortality  than the manic or hy pomanic phase. Patients with bipolar disorder experience 
depressive s ymptoms much more frequentl y than manic or h ypomanic s ymptoms 
(Hlastala et al, 1997 ; Judd etal, 2002, 2003; Keller et al, 1 986; Post, 2005; Post et al, 
2003). In addition, compared with bipolar mania, bipolar depression is associated with an 
increased risk of suicide and psy chosocial impairment ( Altshuler et al, 2002; Calabrese 
etal, 2003 , 2004; Dilsaver et al, 1997; Leverich et al, 2003; MacQueen et al, 2001 ).
Although there is a substantial burden associated with bipolar depression, the treatment 
of this phase of bipolar disorder has not been as widely  studied as the treatment of bipolar 
mania ,and pharm acotherapeutic option s are limited. At pr esent, onl y Seroquel 
(quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) , Seroquel XR (quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196]), Symby[CONTACT_276200] (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_297561]) , and 
Latuda (lurasidone HCl) are approved b y the FDA for the treatment of patients with 
bipolar depression. Other common pharmacotherapi [INVESTIGATOR_557911], anticonvulsants 
(eg, valproate ,lamotrigine), antidepressants, at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_34922], or combinations of 
these.
Treatment needs are not completely  met by  [CONTACT_557944] y available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and only  a 
low percentage of patients persist ently  benefit from them. A significant percentage of 
patients do not fully  respond to the currentl y available treatment sand continue to 
experience subthreshold sy mptoms and even relapse. Side effects commonly  associated 
with the currentl y available treatment sfor bipolar depression include tremors, 
psychomotor slowing, cognitive impairment, exacerbation of agitation, nephrotoxicity , 
altered th yroid function, and sexual dysfunction. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_557912] d risk of metabolic side effects, including body

17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
Dysfunction in dopamine ( DA) neurotransmission has been implicated in the 
pathophy siology  of bipolar disorder. Several line s of evidence suggest that the manic 
phase is associated with increased DA neurotransmission and the depressive phase with 
decreased DA neurotransmission. I t has been h ypothesized that the cyclical nature of 
bipolar disorder is due to alterations between t hese hy per-and hypodopaminergic states
(Berk et al, 2007 ). The contribution sof individual D 2-like receptor subt ypes (D 2, D3, D4) 
to bipolar disorder arenot fully  established . However, there is increasing evidence that 
D3receptors may  play  an important role in depression. Evidence for this has been derived 
mainly  from studies in mice with a targeted disruption of D 3receptors (D 3(-/-) mice). 
These animals are more resistant to stressful procedures , display  anxioly tic-likebehavior ,
and are more sensitive to antidepressants in behavioral models compared with the 
wild-type littermates ( Leggio et al, 2008 ; Steiner et al, 1997). A compound with a 
“DA system stabilizing” effect and with preferable D 3receptor functional antagon ist 
properties may  prove to be most beneficial for the treatment of all the phases of bipolar 
disorder including bipolar depression. RGH -188 (cariprazine) exhibits these 
characteristics.
Cariprazine is an orall y active and potent dopamine D 3-preferring D 3/D2receptor partial 
agonist discovered b y Gedeon Richter Plc ., Budapest, Hungary , and currently  in 
development b y Forest Laboratories, LLC (an Allergan Affiliate ),and Gedeon Richter 
Plc,for the treatment of schizophrenia , acute bipolar mania , bipolar depression, and as 
adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder . In September 2015, cariprazine 
(VRAYLAR™) was approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of schizophrenia, at 
doses of 1.5 to 6 mg/day , and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed e pi[INVESTIGATOR_557913] I disorder, at doses of 3 to 6 mg/day . 
The chemical name [CONTACT_557962] -N-{4- [2-[4-
(2,3-dichlorophen yl)-pi[INVESTIGATOR_3746]-1- yl]-ethyl]-cyclohexy l}-N’,N’ -dimethy lurea
hydrochloride. Its molecular formula is C 21H32Cl2N4O HCl; its molecular weight is 
463.87. Two main metabolites, desmethy l and didesmethy l cariprazine, have been 
identified. The receptor binding profile of both these metabolites is similar to that of the 
parent compound .
A unique feature of cariprazine is that it binds with significantl y higher affinity  to D 3than 
to D2receptors. Its affinity for D 3receptors is approximately  1 order of magnitude greater 
than that for D 2receptors . Similar to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], but unlike other aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_246823], cariprazine acts as a “DA system stabilizer.” Cariprazine display s partial 
agonist as well as antagonist activity  on bios ynthesis -(and release -) modulating 
presynaptic D 2receptors and has preferential dopaminerg ic actions in the limbic regions. 
However, cariprazine is more potent than aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and the degree of its apparent 
partial agonist activity  is greater.

the ser otonin 5 -HT 1Aand 5 -HT 2Breceptors, respectively . Antidepressant- likeand/or 
anxioly tic-like effects of cariprazine may  also be mediated through these receptors. 
Cariprazine has low potency at other receptor sites, such as the 5 -HT 2C, histamine H 1, and 
adrenergic receptor sites.
Cariprazine was evaluated in patients with bipolar depression in 2 multicenter, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies ( Study  RGH -MD-52[2011] and 
Study  RGH -MD-56[2014] ). 
Study  RGH -MD-52 was 11 weeks in duration: a n o-drug washout period of up to [ADDRESS_732559]: placebo (n = 77), cariprazine low dose (0.25- 0.75 mg/day , 
n =75) and cariprazine high dose (1.5 -3.0 mg/day, n = 75). The dose was fixed for first 
4weeks of double -blind treatment; all patients received the lower of the dose range 
(1capsule; placebo, cariprazine 0.25 mg/day , or cariprazine 1.5 mg/day ). At the end of 
Week 4, the dose could be increased to 2 capsules if r esponse was not adequate 
(<40% reduction in Montgomery -Åsbe rgDepression Rating Scale [MADRS] score from 
baseline) and there were no significant tolerability issues as judged b y the Investigator. 
Approximately  76% of the patients completed the study : 78% in the placebo group, 
84% in the cariprazine low- dose group, and 65% in the cariprazine high -dose group. 
More patients discontinued for adverse events (AEs) in the cariprazine high -dose group 
(9.3%) than in the placebo group (2.6%) and cariprazine low -dose group (4.0%). The 
average patient age was 39 years, and approximately  64% were female. The [ADDRESS_732560] to demographics and baseline characteristics. For the 
primary  efficacy  parameter, the change from baseline to the end of Week 8 in the 
MADRS total score using mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM), the 
overall p- value was not statistically  significant. Numerical improvement was seen in the 
cariprazine high -dose group relative to the placebo group up to end of week 6. Similar 
results were seen for other efficacy  paramete rs. SAEs were reported in 6patients 
(2patient s in the placebo group, 2patients in the ca riprazine low -dose group, and 
2patients in the cariprazine high -dose group). Treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) reported in at least 10% of patients in any t reatment group included insomnia, 
akathisia, headache, dry  mouth, nausea, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_557914]. Of 
these, insomnia, akathisia, dry  mouth, nausea and diarrhea were reported more frequently  
in the cariprazine -treated patients.

0.75 mg/day  (n=141), cariprazine 1.5 mg/day  (n = 146), cariprazine 3 mg/day  (n = 146). 
Overall, 72.5% of the patients completed the study: 72.4% in the placebo group, 73.0% in 
the cariprazine 0.75 mg/day  group, 80.1% in the cariprazine 1.5 mg/day  group, and 
64.4% in the cariprazine 3 mg/day  group. The average patient age was 42 years, and 
approximately  62% were female. For both the primary  and secondary  efficacy  
parameters, c hange from baseline in MADRS total score and Clinical Global 
Impressions -Severit y (CGI-S)score at Week 6, statistically  significant improvement was 
demonstrated for the cariprazine 1.[ADDRESS_732562] -hoc anal ysis of patients who completed 
the full 8 we eks of treatment (completer population) in Study  RGH -MD-56 demonstrated 
similar reductions from baseline relative to placebo in MADRS total score for the 
cariprazine 1.5 and 3 mg/day  groups at Week 6 and Week 8.Cariprazi ne was generally  
well-tolerated. Nodeaths were reported during the study . Serious adverse events were 
reported for 5 patients (3.4%) in the placebo group, 1 patient (0.7%) in the cariprazine 
0.75 mg group, and 2 patients (1. 4%) each in the cariprazine 1.5 mg and 3 mg treatment 
groups. Adve rse events that led to discontinuation were reported in similar proportions of 
patients across the placebo (10.3%) and cariprazine (8.2% -11.6%) treatment groups. The 
most common AEs that led to discontinuation were akathisia, agitation, anxiety , and 
depres sion. Overall, TEAEs were reported for 55% of patients in the placebo treatment 
group and 57%- 62% of patients in the cariprazine treatment groups. Akathisia and 
irritability  were the onl y TEAEs reported for ≥ 5% of patients in any  cariprazine 
treatment group and at an incidence at least twice that of the placebo group. 
Based upon these data , the current study  is designed to prospectivel y confirm the efficacy  
of a fixed- dose regimen of cariprazine 1.5 mg /day or 3 mg /day compared to placebo for 
treatment of the depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_557915] I disorder . The safet y and 
tolerabi lity of the fixed -dose regimens will be evaluated .

9.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTIO N
This clinical study  will be a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group ,fixed -dose study  in adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (DSM -5; American Ps ychiatric Association, 
2013) diagnosis of B ipolar I disorder who are currently  experiencing a major depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
The study  will be conducted in outpatients (i.e., non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) and will con sist of 
approximately  7 to 14 day s of screening and washout f ollowed by  6weeks of 
double -blind treatment and a 1-week safet y follow- up period. At the end of the screening
period, patient s meeting the eligibility criteria for this study  will be randomized (1:1:1 ) to 
1 of 3 treatment groups ( placebo, cariprazine 1.5mg/day , cariprazine 3 mg/day ). The 
study  is designed to enroll outpatients, but as per local clinical practice, patients may  be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216328] [ADDRESS_732563]. Further need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557916]. A total of 480 patients are planned to be 
randomized in this study .
Patients who complete 6 weeks of double -blind treatment or who prematurely  
discontinue before completing 6 weeks of double -blind treatment will be followed for 
1more week (safet y follow- up period). During the safet y follow -up period, patient s may  
be started on a standard treatment as determined by [CONTACT_978]. No investigational product 
will be administered during the safet y follow- up period.

9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE 
OF CONTROL GROUPS
The double -blind design was adopted to minimize sy stematic bias resulting from the 
Investigator or the patient knowing the treatment being administered. Randomization is 
expected to minimize patient selection bias and increase baseline comparability  among 
the treatment groups. The doses of cariprazine under study  were chosen on the basis of 
experience from the RGH -MD-52 and RGH -MD-56 studies (see Section 7.0), as well as 
experience in the cariprazine development program in healthy  volunteers and patients 
with other indications and other at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_557917]. The use of a placebo control is critical to the study  to allow discrimination of 
patient outcomes caused by  [CONTACT_557945] b y other factors (e.g., the observer or patient expectations, the natural progre ssion 
of the disease, the conditions of being in a study ).
No double- blind down-taper has been included as cessation of cariprazine at doses 
comparable to those under study  has not given rise to appreciable discontinuation 
symptoms.

9.3.3 Removal of Patient s from Therapy or Assessment
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICFceases 
participation in the study , regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the 
protocol . Patient s can be prematurel y disco ntinued from the study  for one of the 
following reasons:
Screen Failure ( Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria)
Withdrawal of consent
Adverse event
Lack of Efficacy
Protocol violation
Non-compliance with Study  Drug
Lost to follow -up
Study terminated b y Sponsor
Site terminated by  [CONTACT_2728]
Other
A patient completing Visits 1 through 6 will be considered a completer. All randomized
patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study ,regardless of the cause ,should be
seen for a final assessment at an early termination (ET) visit. A final assessment will be 
defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled for Visit 6/ET ). All investigational 
products dispensed at earlier visits thathad not been previousl y collected should be 
collecte d at the final visit . Patients refusing to come in for a final visit must be requested 
in writing, with a registered letter, to come in for an ET visit and to return any  unused 
investigational product. A cop y of the letter, together with the source documentation, will 
be kept b y the Investigator. The reasons for premature discontinuation from the study will 
be reflected on the stud y termination record of the eCRF .
Patients with Visit 6 /ET more than [ADDRESS_732569](s)
Investigational product will be supplied in blister packs containing 10capsules and will 
be labeled with the protocol number, the visit numbe r/space to write visit numbe r, storage 
information, warning language (viz, “Caution: New Drug —Limited by [CONTACT_33839]”), and instructions to take the capsules once dail y as directed, and the 
medication identification number. Investigational product labels will be country  specific . 
Immediately  before dispensing the investigational product , the Investigator will write the 
patient ’s initials, site number, and date on the label .
All investigational products will be provided b y the Sponsor ,or designees, to the study  
centers. Investigational product must be stored in an appropriate secure area ( e.g., a 
locked cabinet in a locked room) at controlled room temperature  
with excursions permitted between )and must be 
protected from light, heat ,and moisture.
The Investigator is responsible for recording the receipt and use of all investigational 
products supplied and for ensuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these 
supplies . All un used investigational products must be returned ;and,whenever 
investigational products are returned ,unit counts must be performed . All investigational 
products must be accounted for .At the end of the study , or upon drug expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], any  
unused investigational product must be returned to the Sponsor or Sponsor's designee.
9.4.[ADDRESS_732570] Laboratories, LLC Page 33 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2

Each stud y center will be provided with investigational products. An interactive 
voice/intera ctive Web response sy stem (I xRS) will be used during the stud y to monitor 
enrollme nt and medication allocation. If the patient meets the randomization criteria, the 
study  center will contac t the I xRS at end of Visit 2 to randomize the patient. IxRSwill 
randomize the patient to the appropriate treatmen t arm (placebo, cariprazine 1.5 mg/day, 
or cariprazine 3.0 mg/day ) and determine the investigational product number to be 
assigned to the patient based on the randomization.
9.4.4 Selection of Dos ages in the Study
The doses of cariprazine selected for this study  were based on the results from 
2completed studies in patients with bipolar depression ( RGH -MD-52 and RGH -MD-56), 
as well as experience in the cariprazine development program in healthy  volunteers and 
patients with other indications and other at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_557920] .Study RGH -MD-52 indicated numericall y better results for the 
high-dose cariprazine group (1.5- 3.0 mg/day ) relative to placebo up to end of Week 6. In 
the cariprazine low-dose group (0.25- 0.75 mg/day), better efficacy  was observed 
following a dose increase, and tolerability  was not compromised. Thus, cariprazine 0.75, 
1.5, and 3.0 mg/day  were selected for further evaluation in Study  RGH -MD-56.
In Stud y RGH -MD-56, for both the primary  and secondary  efficacy  parameters, change 
from baseli ne in MADRS total score and CGI -S score at Week 6, statistically  significant 
improvement was demonstrated for the cariprazine 1.[ADDRESS_732571] -hoc analy sis of 
patients who completed the full 8 weeks of treatment (completer population) in 
Study RGH -MD-56 d emonstrated similar reductions from baseline relative to placebo in 
MADRS total score for the cariprazine 1.5 and 3 mg/day  groups at Week [ADDRESS_732572] -hoc completers anal ysis in Study  RGH -MD-56 
led to the selectio n of the cariprazine 1.5 and 3 mg/day  doses for further evaluation in this 
study . A dose higher than 3 mg/day  was not chosen because of concerns related to the 
potential for higher extrapy ramidal sy mptom rates with increasing cariprazine dose.
A fixed -dose regimen allow sfor unambiguous evaluation of safet y and efficacy  of 
individual doses .

9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All investigational products will be dispensed in blister packs. Each blister pack will 
contain 10 capsules arranged in 10 columns and 1 row, adequate for the 7 day s of the 
week plus 3 extra day s. The configuration of the blister packs is provided in 
Table 9.4.5–1.
At Visit 2, patients w ho continue to meet all eligibility  criteria will be assigned a 
randomization number and dispensed a corresponding blister pack of double -blind 
investigational product for the first week of double -blind treatment. Patients will be 
instructed to take 1 caps ule daily , in order from left to right of the blister pack ,beginning 
on the evening of Visit 2 or the morning after Visit 2
At Visit 3 (end of week 1 of double -blind treatment ) patients will be dispensed 1 blister 
pack . At Visits 4 and 5 (end of week 2 and end of week 4 of double -blind treatment), 
patients will be dispensed 2 blister packs.
All patients randomized to cariprazine dose groups will receive cariprazine 1.5 mg/day  
for 2 weeks, from Day  1through Day 14. For patients randomized to the cariprazine 
3.0mg/day  group, the dose will be increased to 3.0 mg/day  on Day  15. 
Drug holiday s (up to a maximum of 3 consecutive day s) are allowed if there are 
tolerability  problems at the discretion of the Investigator . Patients unable to tolerate the 
fixed dose of the investigational product or patients off drug for 4 or more consecutive 
days will be prematurely  discontinued from the study .
All investigational products will be taken orall y as a single daily dose at app roximately  
the same time of day  (morning or evening). The dosing time can be switched if there are 
tolerability  problems. Any  switch must allow at least [ADDRESS_732573] Laboratories, LLC Page 35 of 121

Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
The MADRS (Montgomery  and Åsberg, 1979) i s a 10 -item, clinician- rated scale that 
evaluates the patient’s depressive s ymptomatology  during the past week. Patients are 
rated on items assessing feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, 
suicidality , reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty  in concentration, and lack of interest. 
Each item will be scored on a 7- point scale with a score of 0 reflecting no symptoms and 
a score of 6 reflecting symptoms of maximum severity. This scale will be administered 
by a trained rater with adequate experience in the assessment of the patient’s depressive 
symptomatology  using the MADRS.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
An AE is a ny untoward medical occurren ce in a patient or clinical investigation patient
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a 
causal relationship with thistreatment .An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A) . 
Forest Laboratories, LLC Page 40 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2

For the purpose of the site’s data collection responsibilities, any  untoward event that was 
reported from the time the patient signed the ICF until [ADDRESS_732580] , is to be considered an AE.
Examples of AEsare as follows :
Changes in the general condition of the patient
Subjecti ve sy mptoms offered by  [CONTACT_44742]
Objective signs observed by  [CONTACT_391604]
All diseases that occur after signing inform consent , including an y change in severity 
or frequency  of preexisting disease
All clinically  relevant abnormalities in laboratory  values or clinicall y relevant 
physical findings that occur during the study schedule
Please note medical procedure sscheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the 
study  should not be capture das AEs , but should be listed in the medical history  if related 
to a pre -existing condition .
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment
For each AE, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal relati onship to the 
investigational product. The causality  assessment must be recorded on the appropriate 
AEreporting page of the patient ’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed by 
[CONTACT_16134]:
Is there a reasonable possibility  the investigation alproduct caused the event?
Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
product and AE ; i.e.:
There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the 
investigational product and the event, and /or
The even t is unlikel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent 
disease, other investigational product s, or other factors, and/or
Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist 
Forest Laboratories, LLC Page 41 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
investigational product and AE, i.e.:
There is no reasonable temporal relationship between the 
investigational product and the event, or
The patient did not take the investigational product, or
The event is likel y to be attributed to underl ying/concurrent 
disease, other investigational product s, or other factors, or
The event is commonl y occurring in the (stud y) population 
independent of investigational product exposure
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity Assessment
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severit y of each AEby [CONTACT_44745] a 
severit y rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient ’s eCRF . Severity,
which is a description of the intensity  of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from 
seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE -required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Severit y will be assessed 
according to the following scale:
Mild: A type of AEthat is usually  transient and may  require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  
interfere with usual activities of daily  living.
Moder ate: A type of AEthat is usually  alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the research participant.
Severe: A type of AEthat interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life threatening
Requires i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557924], LLC Page 42 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapa city, or
Is a c ongenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44719], based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may  jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], orthe development of investigat ional product dependency  or drug abuse.
Emergency  room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44720].
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ( e.g., elective procedures for pre existing conditions that did 
not worsen , such as cosmetic surgery  and hy sterectomy ) or routine (i.e. required) 
country -specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557925].
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
At each visit, patient s are to be queried regarding any  AEs or SAEs that have occurred 
since the previous visit. Patient s will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading

9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
9.7.1 Patient Populations
Four populations will be considered in the statistical anal ysis of the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Screened Population
The Screened Population will consist of all patient s who signed informed consent and 
received a PID number .
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Population
The Randomized Population will consist of all patient s in the Screened Population who
were randomized to a treatment group in the stud y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population
The Safet y Population will consist of all patient sin the Randomized Population who took 
at least [ADDRESS_732592].
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent -to-Treat Population
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all patient s in the Safety  Population 
who had at least 1postbaseline assessment of MADRS total score .
9.7.2 Patient Disposition
The number and percentage of patients in 3 of the study  populations (Randomized, 
Safety, and ITT) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_44747]; the Screened 
Population will be summarized overall onl y by [CONTACT_91294]. 
Forest Laboratories, LLC Page 57 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
Screen -failure p atients (ie, patients screened but not randomized) and the associated 
reasons for failure to randomize will be tabulated overall for the Screened Population. 
The number and percentage of patients who completed the double- blind treatment period, 
and of pati ents who prematurel y discontinue d during the same period and who entered 
the safet y follow-up period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across 
treatment groups for the Randomized Population. Patients are considered to have entered 
the sa fety follow- up period if they  had Visit 7 (Week 7). The reasons for premature 
discontinuation from the double- blind treatment period as recorded on the termination 
pages of the eCRFs will be summarized (number and percentage) b y treatment group for 
the Randomized Population.
9.7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic parameters ( e.g.,age, race, ethnicit y, sex, weight, height, BMI ) and other 
baseline characteristics will be summarized by  [CONTACT_557950] s.
Prior medication is defined as an y medication taken before the date of the first dose of 
double -blind investigational product. Concomitant medication is defined as any  
medication taken on or after the date of the first dose of double -blind investigational 
product .
Both prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by [CONTACT_557951]. Multiple medication use by  a patient w ill only  
be counted once .
9.7.4 Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of Exposure
Exposure to double -blind investigational product for the Safet y Population during the 
double -blind treatment period will be summarized for treatment duration, calculated as 
the number of day s from the date of the first dose of double -blind investigational product 
taken to the date of the last dose taken, inclusive . Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard
deviation, minimum, median, and maximum) will be presented b y treatment group. 
Forest Laboratories, LLC Page 58 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement of Treatment Compliance
Dosing compliance for a specified period is defined as the total number of capsules 
actuall y taken b y a patient during that period divided by  [CONTACT_557952] e same period multiplied by  100. The total number of 
capsules actually taken during a specific period is calculated as the number of day s in that 
period multiplied by  [CONTACT_557953]. The 
number of capsules expected to be taken for a specific treatment period will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_557954] s in that period by  [CONTACT_557955] . Descriptive statistics for investigational product compliance will be presented by  
[CONTACT_557956] 2 consecutive visits, as well as for the whole 
double -blind treatment period of the study  for the Safety Population.
9.7.5 Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy  analy ses will be based on the ITT Population, unless stated otherwise. The 
baseli ne for each specific efficacy  endpoint is defined as the value recorded at 
Visit 2/Week 0. I f this value is not available, the last available value before the first dose 
of double -blind investigational product will be used as the baseline value. Efficacy  results 
will be considered to be statistically  significant after co nsideration of the 
multiplicity -control strategy  for controlling the Ty pe I error at 0.05 level; details are 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Nominal p- values may  be computed for other efficacy  
analyses as a measure of strength of association between the endpoint and the treatment 
effect rather th an formal tests of hy potheses. All statistical hy pothesis tests will be 
performed at the 2 -sided 5% significance level for main effects. All confidence intervals 
will be 2- sided 95% confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise.
For efficacy  analy ses in which study  center is a factor, a small center will be defin ed as a 
center with fewer than [ADDRESS_732593] 2 ITT patients within the center. Pooling will be done within each 
country  using the following algorithm: 
Based on the number of ITT patients, small centers will be ordered from the largest to the 
smallest, and centers of the same size will be ordered from the largest center number to 
the smallest center number. The pooling process starts with the largest small center from 
the top, which will be pooled with the small est from the bottom until a non -small center 
is formed. The process will be repeated using the small centers left out after the first pass. 
If any center s are left out at the end of the process, they will be pooled with the smallest 
pseudo- center. If there is more than [ADDRESS_732594] Laboratories, LLC Page 59 of 121
17 Feb 2016Amended Protocol RGH-MD-54 Amendment 2
These pseudo- centers will be used for all effi cacy anal yses when the model is adjusted 
for study  center.
 
 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Parameter s
The primary  efficacy  parameter will be the change from baseline to Week 6 in MADRS 
total score. The primary anal ysis will be performed using a MMRM with treatment 
group, stud y center, visit, and treatment group –by-visit interaction as fixed effects and 
the baseline value and baseline by -visit interaction as covariates. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -patient scores. The 
Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to esti mate denominator degrees of freedom. 
The anal ysis will be performed based on all postbaseline scores using onl y the observed 
cases without imputation of missing values.

.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Parameter s
The secondary  efficacy  parameter will be change from baseline to Week 6 in CGI -S 
score. The secondary  efficacy  parameter will be analy zed using an MMRM with 
treatment group, stud y center, visit, and treatment group –by-visit interaction as fixed 
effects and the baseline CGI -S score and baseline CGI -S score –by-visit interaction as the 
covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of 
within -patient scores. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate 
denominato r degrees of freedom.
To control the overall ty pe I error rate for multiple comparisons of 2 active doses versus 
placebo at Week 6 for the primary  and secondary  efficacy  parameters, the parallel 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_557926] (Chen et al, 2005). The [ADDRESS_732595] will be u sed to derive the local p -values for the 
interaction h ypotheses. The adjusted p -values for the 4 elementary  hypotheses will be 
calculated based on the closed testing principle. Statistical significance will be 
determined b y comparing the adjusted p -values to α = 0.050.

[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Product Plasma Concentration Parameters
Plasma samples will be analy zed for the concentrations of cariprazine and its desmethy l 
and didesmethy l metabolites using a validated bioanal ytical method. A population PK 
approach will be used to estimate individual -level drug- exposure parameters 
(i.e., steady-state area -under -the-curve (AUC), stea dy-state maximum concentration 
[Cmax] , stea dy-state minimum concentration [ Cmin] ) for each of the 3 analytes. This will 
be performed via the use of appropriate nonlinear mixed -effects modeling software. The

9.7.9 Determination of Sample Size
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline at Week 6 in MADRS total 
score. The secondary  endpoi nt is the change from base line at Week 6 in CGI -S score. For 
the comparison of the primary  endpoint, the sample size of 160 subjects per arm will 
provide approximately  82% statistical power to show statistically  significantly  higher 
effect in each dose of cariprazine versus placebo. The study  has statistical power of 90% 
to show at least one of the two cariprazine doses is statistically  significantly  more 
efficacious than placebo in the primary  endpoint. These calculations assumed an effect 
size of 0.36 (tr eatment gro up difference relative to SD). For a given successful 
(statistically  significant) dose versus placebo with respect to the primary  endpoint, its 
probability  in detecting an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_732599] to the secondary  endpoint is 88%. All statistical powers presented in this 
section were calculated adjusting for multiple comparisons using matched parallel 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_557927] -wise Ty pe I error rate bein g controlled at a 0.05 
level ( 2-sided). The dropout rate is assumed to be 22% at Week 6. Within -person 
correlation for both primary  and secondary  endpoints is assumed to be 0.6, as well as 
correlation between the two endpoints (pri mary  and secondary ) to be 0.6. Assumptions of 
effect si zes, correlation coefficients, and drop -out ra te are based on RGH- MD-56 study .
9.7.10 Computer Methods
Statistical analy ses will be performed using version 9.1.3 (or newer) of SAS on a 
UNIX operating s ystem.

APPENDIX IV. MONTGOMERY -ÅSBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE
Montgom ery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
The rating should be based on a clinical interview moving from broadly  phrased 
questions about sy mptoms to more detailed ones which allow a precise rating of severi ty. 
The rater must decide whether the rating lies on predefined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or 
between them (1, 3, 5).
It is important to remember that it is only  on rare occasions that a depressed patient is 
encountered who cannot be rated on the items in th e scale. If definite answers cannot be 
elicited from the patient all relevant clues as well as information from other sources 
should be used as a basis for the rating in line with customary  clinical practice.
The scale may  be used for any  time interval between ratings, be it weekly  or otherwise, 
but this must be recorded.
Item List
1. Apparent sadness
2. Reported sadness
3. Inner tension
4. Reduced sleep
5. Reduced appetite
6. Concentration difficulties
7. Lassitude
8. Inability to feel
9. Pessimistic thoughts
10. Suicidal thoughts

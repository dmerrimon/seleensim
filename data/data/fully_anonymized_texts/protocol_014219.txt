3. Abstract/Brief Overview:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation are common treatments in the care of 
patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Intubation allows for airway control and 
facilitates removal of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919].  Mechanical ventilation allows control 
of arterial carbon dioxide to aid in control of intracranial pressure.  Recent evidence 
suggests that lung protective ventilation (tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg of predicted body 
weight and moderate positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111]) improves outcomes 
following brain injury and reduces brain-lung cross talk. 
The treatment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171920], intracranial pressure and venous return.  Traditional 
treatment of increasing positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (PEEP) and mean airway pressure 
then, represent competing interests.  Methods for improving arterial oxygenation 
while avoiding negative hemodynamic effects are needed.
The impact of head injury on respi[INVESTIGATOR_171921] a few 
clinical investigations. (1-3)  Of note, the earliest of these noted that the ventilation 
perfusion (V/Q) matching following TBI was not the result of lung collapse or 
parenchymal lung disease but secondary to alterations in perfusion. There are 
three possibilities for this finding:
1. redistribution in regional perfusion, which is partially mediated by [CONTACT_171946]
2. pulmonary microembolism, leading to increased dead space 
3. lung surfactant depletion due to excessive sympathetic stimulation and 
hyperventilation.
The introduction of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide or 
aerosolized epoprostenol offer an opportunity to improve oxygenation in patients 
with TBI without increasing airway pressures in the face of V/Q inequalities.
This study will evaluate the changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_171922].

facilitates removal of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919].  Mechanical ventilation allows control 
of arterial carbon dioxide to aid in control of intracranial pressure.  Recent evidence

Respi[INVESTIGATOR_171925] a common complication 
resulting in hypoxemia and is associated with release of inflammatory mediators 
which may damage distal organs including the brain.  The etiology of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171926]: 7-2-[ADDRESS_201737] and pulmonary contusion may further worsen 
lung injury.  It has been suggested that brain injury primes the lung to be a greater 
risk to a second hit (pneumonia, ventilator induced lung injury, lung contusion). 
Loss of consciousness can lead to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_171927]. Importantly, respi[INVESTIGATOR_171928] 50% of 
deaths and prolonged ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. (4,5)
The treatment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171920], intracranial pressure and venous return.  Traditional 
treatment of increasing PEEP and mean airway pressure then, represent 
competing interests.  Methods for improving arterial oxygenation while avoiding 
negative hemodynamic effects are needed.
The impact of head injury on respi[INVESTIGATOR_171921] a few 
clinical investigations. (1-3)  Of note, the earliest of these noted that the ventilation 
perfusion (V/Q) matching following TBI was not the result of lung collapse or 
parenchymal lung disease but secondary to alterations in perfusion. There are 
three possibilities for this finding:
1. redistribution in regional perfusion, which is partially mediated by [CONTACT_171946]
2. pulmonary microembolism, leading to increased dead space 
3. lung surfactant depletion due to excessive sympathetic stimulation and 
hyperventilation.
The introduction of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide or 
aerosolized epoprostenol offer an opportunity to improve oxygenation in patients 
with TBI without increasing airway pressures in the face of V/Q inequalities.
In 1983, Cooper and Boswell demonstrated that hypoxemia in a series of 21 
patients with head injury was related to a decrease in functional residual capacity 
and increased shunt. (2) In this study the addition of 10 cm H 2O PEEP reversed 
the fall in FRC and improved oxygenation. However, these patients were all 
paralyzed and nursed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Paralysis and the supi[INVESTIGATOR_171929].  
More recently, Koutsoukou et al evaluated 21 subjects with brain injury (intracranial 
hemorrhage and TBI) and no evidence of acute lung injury and found that PEEP 
of 10 cm H 2O prevented a deterioration in respi[INVESTIGATOR_171930].  On 
day 1, PaO 2/FIO 2 was > 400 (FIO 2= 0.46) but both lung elastance and airways 
resistance were slightly elevated in both groups. These findings are not

bed head up. These changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_171931] 5 and 
only elastance was spared in the group receiving 10 of PEEP. (3)
Mechanical ventilation following TBI is provided with the normal goals, reduce the 
work of breathing, provide adequate oxygenation, maintain normo- or hypocapnia 
and avoid lung injury.  However, in an effort to improve brain tissue PaO 2 (TbO 2) 
mechanical ventilation in TBI may include increases in mean airway pressure and 
FIO [ADDRESS_201739] on mean arterial pressure, cerebral 
perfusion pressure and venous return. (6)
Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that at low doses (5-
20 ppm) improves V/Q matching and at higher doses (80 ppm) reduces pulmonary 
artery pressures.  Nitric oxide plays a role in a number of biologic processes and 
pathways that have been associated with improvements in brain function. (7,8) 
INO has been used in patients with TBI with successful increases in oxygenation 
in small case series. (10-11). These reports are not systematic applications of INO 
but rather rescue therapy in the face of ARDS.
The use of INO in ARDS has not proven to impact outcomes. (12-13) Several 
studies have shown improved gas exchange but no changes in morbidity or 
mortality.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_77078], INO is often used in ARDS to help improve gas 
exchange without increasing the risk of lung injury by [CONTACT_171950].
This study will determine the etiology of lung dysfunction following TBI and 
describe the effect of INO on cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_171932]. 
Inhaled nitric oxide (INOmax) is FDA approved and delivered via the INOmax DS IR 
and FDA cleared delivery and monitoring device.  The use of inhaled nitric oxide 
is limited to a maximum of 80 ppm.  We will deliver 20 ppm, a dose that is widely 
prescribed. 
6.Study design:
This study will determine the impact of inhaled nitric oxide on gas exchange and 
hemodynamics in a series of up to 43 patients with TBI over an 18 month period. 
The delivery of INO will be blinded.  The study will also describe the changes in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_171933] a 3 day period.
Version date: 7-2-18 Page 6 of 12All subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_201740] sensor will be placed for continuous recording 
of data.  Within 36 hours of admission, the following measurements will be made 
by [CONTACT_5984]:
1. Static and dynamic lung compliance using tidal volume and airway pressures 
(CLstatic = Pplat  -PEEP/VT) CLdynamic= Pplat - PEEP/VT).  These 
measurements are made non-invasively using the integral monitoring of the 
mechanical ventilator.
2. Airway resistance using airway pressures and flow (Raw = Pplat - PEEP/Mid 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]).  These measurements are made non-invasively using the 
integral monitoring of the mechanical ventilator.
3. Dead space to tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) will be calculated using the Enghoff 
modification of the Bohr equation:  Vd/Vt = PaCO 2 - PeCO 2/PaCO 2, where Vd 
is the dead space volume and Vt is the tidal volume; PaCO 2 is the partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, and PeCO 2 is the mixed expi[INVESTIGATOR_171934] (exhaled) air. In the absence 
of arterial blood gases we will calculate PaCO 2 from determination of alveolar 
concentrations (PACO 2) in expi[INVESTIGATOR_171935].
4. Functional residual capacity (FRC) will be measured by [CONTACT_171951], which uses a step change in FIO 2 to 
measure FRC through nitrogen washout while monitoring oxygen consumption 
and carbon dioxide production. These measurements are made non-invasively 
using the integral monitoring of the mechanical ventilator.
5. Positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) will be titrated from baseline PEEP as 
set at time of enrollment to-15 cm H 20 (in 5-cm H 2O increments) while 
measuring all the variables listed in #1-[ADDRESS_201741] PEEP and determine recruitability of the lung. FRC will be measured 
at three levels of PEEP from baseline to a maximum of 15 cm H 2O. This is an 
automated measurement requiring approaximately 15 minutes to complete. If 
the patient develops hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg or mean 
arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) participation in the PEEP trial will be terminated.
6. Following these initial measurements, patients will be randomized to receive 
either a placebo (nitrogen and oxygen) or inhaled NO at 20 ppm for 2 hours ± 
30 minutes.  After receiving the placebo or inhaled NO, the measurements in 
#1-4 will be reassessed (no change in PEEP will be made during this time 
unless required for clinical purposes).    
7. If the patient remains on the ventilator at day 3 (72 hours after admission),  1-
6 above will be repeated.
Version date: 7-2-18 Page 7 of 12Subjects will receive placebo or drug for no more than 5 hours total.
If the patient responds to NO with a brisk increase in SpO2 or PaO2 – sudden 
withdrawal of NO can result in a fall in oxygenation (rebound pulmonary hypertension).  
This is uncommon in the absence of pulmonary hypertension.  Prevention of rebound 
pulmonary hypertension is accomplished by [CONTACT_171952]2 by 10-20% prior to 
discontinuation of NO, followed by a return to baseline FIO2 over 30 mins.
If ICP goes up by >20% NO will be discontinued.
7. Research data collection/study procedures: 
The patient baseline demographics including injury mechanism, severity and 
distribution, Glasgow coma scale score, age, gender, any witnessed aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
and lung mechanics measurements listed above will be collected to data sheets 
and then entered into a RedCap database.  We will also record ventilator settings, 
lung compliance, airways resistance, dead space to tidal volume ratio, functional 
residual capacity, blood gases and duration of total mechanical ventilation, days in 
the ICU, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171936].   See sequence of events for study 
measures.
8. Specimen collection: 
The following blood samples will be taken:
At baseline up to 3.5 ml will be taken. 1.5 ml for arterial blood gas testing  (tests 
include: arterial pH, PaCO 2, PaO 2, SaO 2 and HCO 3) ) and 2 ml for measurement 
of inflammatory mediators specific to the lung.
After 90 to 120 minutes of nitric oxide/placebo delivery, less than 1.[ADDRESS_201742] will remain in the study and all other 
data will continue to be collected 
Version date: 7-2-18 Page 8 of 129.Potential Benefits: 
The detailed measurement of respi[INVESTIGATOR_171937].  This information which is not routinely measured can be used to optimize 
ventilator support beyond traditional monitoring.  The determination of FRC and 
recruitability of the lung may assist the clinical team in identifying the best PEEP 
for each individual patient.
If the patient has a significant increase in PaO 2 associated with INO/placebo 
delivery, the clinical team can use that information to implement INO therapy as 
part of clinical care. It is unlikely that placebo will increase oxygenation 
appreciably.  We will not unblind the study, the clinical team will have to make this 
decision based on a supposition of INO delivery.
Understanding the changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_171938].
10.Potential Risks, Discomforts, and inconveniences: 
Level of risk: Greater than minimal risk.
The measurements to be made utilize non-invasive measures of lung volumes, 
flows, and pressures to determine mechanics.
Arterial puncture/venipuncture may cause pain/discomfort, bruising, fainting, and 
infection from phlebotomy sites.
Hypotension in severe pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular failure (very 
uncommon).
Methemoglobinemia has only been reported at 80ppm.  
The stepwise increase in PEEP to determine changes in FRC will be limited to a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_201743] blood pressure and heart rate continuously monitored 
(as is standard of care) throughout the measurements.
Research personnel will remain at the bedside throughout the measurements of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_171939] 30 minutes to complete.
11.Data Safety monitoring plan and/or DSMB:

deemed that patient safety is compromised.
12.Data Analysis: 
Descriptive statistics will be employed to summarize relevant patient demographic 
factors as well as on baseline measurement of clinical variables.  As a check on 
the success of randomization, these variables will be compared between groups 
using t-tests or chi-square tests, as appropriate.
The primary endpoint for this study is a change in PaO 2:FiO2 ratio of [ADDRESS_201745] with pooled variance
Group sample sizes of 19 in group one and 19 in group two achieve 82% power to 
detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.40. The proportion in group 
one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.10 under the null hypothesis and 
0.50 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the control 
group) is 0.10. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with pooled variance. 
The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.05. The significance level 
actually achieved by [CONTACT_171953] 0.0361.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_171940] (Mean, SD, range).
Up to 43 subjects may be enrolled, in order to obtain the required 38 evaluable 
subjects.  Patients will be removed from the study and its analysis if extubated by 
[CONTACT_171954] 72 hour NO protocol.
13.Data storage and confidentiality (include sample storage if applicable) 
We will ensure that paper forms are stored securely under lock and key when not 
in the direct custody of an investigator.  Forms may have direct identifiers for the 
purposes of linking data from different medical records. Electronic data will not be 
entered with direct identifiers. A subject number will be used to link back to the 
identifier. The key linking identifier to subject number will not be stored with the 
electronic data. Electronic data will be stored in a password protected Redcap 
database.  Analytical datasets will be stored on secure servers that also limit 
access to the investigator team. Should results of the study be published or 
reported, individual names or other identifying information will not be used.  One 
year after the study and publication are complete the data will be destroyed.

15. Consenting process and plan 
Study personnel will screen patients for inclusion and exclusion. 
Due to the study population, all patients will be cognitively impaired due to their 
injuries, therefore surrogate consent will be obtained. Prior to approaching the 
patient’s LAR/nok we will contact [CONTACT_102]’s admitting physician and the ICU 
attending to assure their assent for patient enrollment. 
The LAR/next of kin is identified using the social worker’s note and contact 
[CONTACT_171956]’s bedside maintained by [CONTACT_60397].  Once the 
Version date: 7-2-18 Page 11 of 12LAR/next of kin is identified, the investigator and/or the study coordinator arranges 
to meet the LAR/next of kin in a private waiting room.  The study staff allows the 
LAR/next of kin to decide if additional family members, friends, or advisors will be 
present.  We frequently speak to the LAR/next of kin with a clergy member present 
or a family friend who has a medical background. 
The informed consent, including the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization language approved by [CONTACT_171957]’s legal teams, is presented 
and reviewed to the LAR/nok and any questions are answered.  
The study is time sensitive but LAR/nok will be allowed to review the consent 
document for 12 hours. A phone number is provided for the LAR/nok to call with 
additional questions. Subjects who cannot be enrolled during the first 36 hours 
after admission to UCMC will be considered screen failures.
Once subjects are deemed to be able to provide informed consent, the researchers 
will take them through the consenting process.

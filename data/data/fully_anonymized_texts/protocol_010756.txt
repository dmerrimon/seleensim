Name [CONTACT_790]/Company:  Bausch & Lomb Incorporated   
Name [CONTACT_356840] : enVista ® Trifocal Intraocular Lens   
 
Title of Study:  A Prospective Multicenter , Randomized, Active -Controlled  Clinical Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of the enVista ® One -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356726]:  Approximately  twenty  (20) clinical centers  in North America  
 
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the enVista  trifocal intraocular l ens (IOL) 
when implanted in the capsular bag.  
 
Methodology:  The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained to the 
potential participant. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the treatment and follow -up 
requirements will be determined .  Written informed consent will be obtaine d from each study 
subject prior to performin g any study- specific procedures that are not part of the Investigator’s 
routine standard of care. Enrolled subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be seen at 11 or  12 
visits according to the following schedule:  
 
Visit Name  [CONTACT_356841] 0A/B  Both Eyes  Day -[ADDRESS_444945]-Operative Visit 5  Both Eyes  Day 330 – [ADDRESS_444946]-Operative Visit 6  
(subjects that consent at 
particip ating sites)  Both Eyes  Day [ADDRESS_444947] Visit 5  
 
Approximately five hundred and one (501) subjects ( approximately 1,002 eyes) will be enrolled in 
this study  to obtain complete follow -up for one year on at least [ADDRESS_444948] subjects  and 150 active 
Control subjects : 
- Group 1 (Test) : Approximately 334 subjects will be treated  bilaterally with the enVista  
MX60EF ( trifocal ) multifocal  IOL  (MIOL) ; 
- Group 2 (Control) : Approximately 167 control subjects will be implanted bilaterally  with 
the enVista  MX60 E monofocal IOL  
 
“Treatment” is defined here as the IOL touching the eye. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will 
be randomly assigned to Group 1 or 2 in a 2:[ADDRESS_444949] eye’s Operative Visit (Day 0).  Subjects and designated postoperative evaluator(s)  will be 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_444950]-corrected distance visual acuity ( BCDVA , CDVA) at the 
Preoperative Visit will be treated first (eye A) and used in the primary monocular evaluations. Glare 
testing of both eyes will be done if either requires it to determine eligibility.  If the qualifying visual 
acuity is obtained with a glare source, the eye with the worse BCDVA with glare will be designated 
as eye A.   If BCDVA is the same for both eyes, the right eye will be treated first. Postoperatively, 
all eyes will undergo ophthalm ic examinations at regular intervals per the study visit schedule 
through Visit 5 (330 -  420 days after second eye IOL implantation).   
 Study enrollment will occur  in three Phases as follows:   
Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] – Approximately 27 Group 1 (Test IOL) subjects will be enrolled and followed 
to Post -Operative Visit 3B  (30 to 60 days after second eye IOL implantation) before a decision 
is made to initiate Phase II enrollment .  Approximately 14 s ubjects wi ll also be randomized to 
Group 2 (Control IOL) during this phase.  A designated unmasked statistician(s) will 
summarize P hase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356727] -corrected near visual acuity ( DCNVA)  and distance -
corrected intermediate visual acuity ( DCIVA)  data from Group [ADDRESS_444951] near and intermediate 
distances will be selected for Phase II and Phase III evaluation . Phase I safety data will also be 
summarized for review by [CONTACT_356772] h the study, and a 
decision to initiate Phase II will be made by [CONTACT_356773] I data.  
Phase II – Approximately [ADDRESS_444952] been enrolled and followed through Visit 4, summaries 
and/or listings of all available safety data through Visit [ADDRESS_444953] 25 Phase I and Phase II 
Group 2 subjects who complete Visit 4 also will be submitted concurrently to the FDA.   While 
safety data submission and FDA review for these subjects is occurring, additional subjects may 
be enrolled up t o a maximum of approximately 72 Phase II  subjects  (including those whose 
data were submitted to FDA) .    
Phase III -  Remainder of subjects will be enrolled and followed to Post -Operative Visit [ADDRESS_444954] consented and enrolled in the Trial Frames Astigmatism sub -study, to Visit 
6.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_444955] will be conducted as Phase I /Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356728] s 
to be  tested during Phase s II – III. Fixed near and intermediate distances of 40 cm and 6 6 cm, 
respectively, will be measured for all  enrolled subjects .  During Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  DCNVA will be 
collected at three candidate distances: 30  cm, 35  cm, and 40 cm, and DCIVA will be collected at 
three candidate distances: 56, [ADDRESS_444956] 14 
subjects  implanted with the enVista  monofocal IOL  in Group 2. Photopic mon ocular DCNVA and 
DCIVA will be assessed at each candidate distance at Visit  3A using ETDRS charts normalized f or 
letter size as a function of  distance tested . The near and intermediate distance VA data from  Phase  
I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356729]. For 
all assessments other than near and intermediate VA  measurements, Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356730] s’ data 
will be pooled with the other  subject s’ data.  
The best distances of 40 cm and 66 cm will be used for near and intermediate visual acuity testing, 
respectively, in Phases II and III of the study, an d intermediate visual acuity will also be tested at 
60 cm in Phases II and III.   
 
Number of S ubjects Planned:  Approximately  five hundred and one (501) subject s 
(approximately 1,002 eyes) will be treated  in this study. Approximately 334 subjects will be 
implanted bilaterally  with the enVista  MX60EF trifocal MIOL, and approximately 167 control

Secondary Safety Analyses 
 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 111 
 The rates  of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by [CONTACT_1766], as well as the rates of visual 
disturbances r eported as “very” bothersome by [CONTACT_1766], using the QoV questionnaire measure  
through Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation) will be 
summarized categorically  by [CONTACT_356779] . Each subject  will 
be counted only once in the calculation of the rate.  
 
Contrast sensitivity will be summarized using continuous summary statistics by [CONTACT_356780], 
spatial frequency, treatment group and visit.  
 
The incidence of the type of AE spec ified in each co -primary safety endpoint will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_356781] “all” eyes.  
 
The incidence of all other types of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_356782], fellow eyes, and “all” eyes for the mITT Set.  
 Additional supportive safety analyses  are described in Section 13.5.5 and/or  the study St atistical 
Analysis P lan (SAP). 
  
Primary Effectiveness Analyses 
 
The statistical success of the trial will depend on the statistical success of all three primary 
effectiveness endpoints.  
 
Photopic monocular logMAR  BCDVA in first implanted eyes at Post -Operative Visit [ADDRESS_444974] ( mean Test group IOL VA minus 
mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be estimated  in addition to a two- sided 90 % 
confidence interval. If the upper confidence limit (equivalent to a  one- sided upper 95% confidence 
limit for the treatment effect) is less than 0.1, then the Test lens will be statistically non -inferior to 
the Control lens.[ADDRESS_444975] group will be summarized categorically (20/20 or better, 20/25 or 
better, 20/32 or bette r, 20/40 or better, and worse than 20/40)  for the mITT  and Best Case Sets .  
Two-sided exact binomial 90% confidence interval s around the proportion s of eyes 20/[ADDRESS_444976] Case Sets, one- sided exac t binomial tests comparing the 
proportion of m ultifocal IOL eyes with BCDVA 20/40 or better to the relevant control rate (92.5% 
for all eyes and 96.7% for best case eyes) will be performed and p- values will be presented. If the 
p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then the null hypothesis will be rejected. If the  null hypothesis 
is not rejected for the mITT  and Best Case Sets in the primary analyses, then it will be concluded 
that the m ultifocal IOL is statistically successful in this outcome.  
 
Photopic monocula r distance- corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm, and distance -
corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at [ADDRESS_444977] -Operative Visit 4 will 
be summarized using continuous summary statistics in logMAR units by [CONTACT_356783] #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 111 
 the mITT  Set Phase II and III subjects  (comb ined) . The DCNVA and DCIVA data from the Phase 
I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356737].  
 
If there are missing mITT  analysis set  monocular DCNVA or DCIVA data at Visit [ADDRESS_444978] ( mean Test group IOL  VA minus mean Control group IOL  VA) in 
logMAR units will be summarized using continuous summary statistics and a two -sided 95% 
confidence interval. If the p-value from the multiple imputation analysis of treatment effect is less 
than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_444979] is less than or equal to -0.10 logMAR units for DCIVA 
(i.e., the Test lens mean logMAR VA is at least 0.10 less than the mean for the control)  or less than 
or equal to - 0.[ADDRESS_444980] -Operative Visit 4 will be compared between treatments 
using the methods described above for monocular DCNVA and DCIVA. The endpoints will be 
evaluated hierarchically in the following order: DCNVA,  UCNVA, DCIVA, and  UCIVA.  
 First eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA (all in logMAR units) at Visit 5 will be summarized using 
descriptive  statistics  (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the ITT Set by 
[CONTACT_1570]  (MX60EF Trifocal MIOL, MX60E Monofocal IOL) . The means at Visit 5 for each 
of these outcomes will be compared between the treatment groups qualitatively.  
 Any additional supportive effectiveness analyses  will be  described  in Section 13.5.5 and/or the 
SAP. 
 
Sample size calculations:  
 
General Justification  
 The sample size of [ADDRESS_444981] lens group subjects and 150 C ontrol group subjects is specified in 
ANSI Z80.12- 2007 (R2012)  and ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 9:2006. Moreover, ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 7 specifies that a 
minimum of 300 subjects should complete a clinical evaluation of an IOL.   
To allow for losses of up to 10%, approximatel y ⌈300 /(1−0.1)⌉ = [ADDRESS_444982] group subjects and 
approximately  ⌈150 /(1−0.1)⌉ = 167 Control group subjects will be enrolled.  
 
Phase I/ Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356738] s for Near and Intermediate VA Testing  
 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_444983] 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between the best 
distance and the second best distance is at least 0.[ADDRESS_444984] group subjects will be enrolled in Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356739] [ADDRESS_444985] 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between the best 
distance and the second best distance is at least 0.[ADDRESS_444986] group subjects will be enrolled in Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356740] [ADDRESS_444987] 95% when the probability of an event is 1% or greater .  
 
Regarding the rate of secondary surgical interventions due to the optical properties of the lens, the 
expected Control group rate is  0.1% and the expected Test group rate is 0.5%. With [ADDRESS_444988] group, the upper limit of the observed one -sided 95% 
confidence interval will be expected to be less than 0.034 with 99% power when the Control 
proportion, 𝝅𝝅𝑪𝑪, is 0.[ADDRESS_444989] expected proportion, 𝝅𝝅𝑻𝑻, is 0.005; results are based on [ADDRESS_444990] the confidence interval.  
 ISO [ZIP_CODE]-7 Annex B shows the relevant sample size calculations and assumptions for th e ISO 
grid safety endpoints. 
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints 
 
Regarding the rates of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by [CONTACT_1766], as well as the rates 
of visual disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by [CONTACT_1766], using the QoV questionnaire 
measure through Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation) , no 
statistical hypotheses  will be tested. Therefore, no sample size calculation  is required . 
 
Regarding mean c ontrast sensitivity  at Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye 
IOL implantation) and Post -Operative Visit 5 (Day 330 to 420 after second eye IOL implantation), 
no statistical hypotheses will be tested. Therefore, no sample size calculation is required.   
 
Primary Effectiveness Endpoints 
 
The primary effectiveness objective s are  to demonstrate non- inferiority  of the T est lens when 
compared to  the Control lens  and satisfactory performance of the Test lens when compared to  the 
ISO grids (ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 7 Safety and Performance Endpoints)  in photopic monocular best -corrected 
distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and to demonstrate superiority of the Test lens over the Control 
lens in distance- corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm , and distance -corrected 
intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at [ADDRESS_444991]-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 
180 after second eye IOL implantation) . Approximately the first [ADDRESS_444992] group

1) and 150 (Group 2), a two group 0.[ADDRESS_444994] 99% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the Test and Control IOLs are not equivalent (the difference in means, µT - µS, is 
0.10 or farther from zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the means 
of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0.[ADDRESS_444995] 99% power to detect a difference in means of -0.10, assuming 
that the common standard deviation is 0.15, when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 
138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414  subjects).  
 
Regarding the assessment of clinical superiority in DCNVA and DCIVA, the probability that the 
Test group’s mean logMAR VA will be at least 0.1 units less than the C ontrol group’s mean 
logMAR VA will be 89 % if the true difference is -0.12 units , 97% if the true difference is -0.13 
units , and 99% if the true difference is -0.[ADDRESS_444996] deviation 
is 0.15 when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total 
sample size of 414 subjects).  
 
Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints 
 Secondary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses will be tested hierarchically in the order : DCNVA, 
UCNVA, DCIVA,  and UCIVA.  
 All Phase I  evaluable Test group subjects evaluable Control group subjects will be excluded from 
the near and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests, leaving an expected evaluable sample size 
of approximately [ADDRESS_444997] group subjects and 138 Control group subjects to be included in the near 
and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests.  Regarding photopic binocular distance- corrected near visual acuity (D CNVA) at [ADDRESS_444998] -

 5 Introduction  
Cataracts are a common condition in adults over 40 years of age , and surgical replacement of 
the cataractous lens with an intraocular lens (IOL) remains an effective way to restore vision 
to cataract patients .4  Monofocal IOLs provide adequate distance vision but require spectacle 
use for near or intermediate distance vision activities.  Subsequent to monofocal IOL 
development and commercialization, m ultifocal intraocular lenses ( MIOLs) , including bifocal 
and trifocal IOLs, have been successfully developed to improve near and intermediate distance 
vision and increase spectacle independence following cataract surgery.  5-[ADDRESS_445022] 
show n high patient satisfaction in patients with trifocal MIOLs.  11, 15, 16  These s tudies and 
others indicate contras t sensitivity and levels of photic phenomena in patients with trifocal 
MIOL implants are similar to that of  patients with bifocal M IOLs under both photopic and 
mesopic conditions, and spectacle independence in up to 100% of the patients has been reported . 
12-19    
The enVista® MX60EF trifocal MIOL is a [ADDRESS_445023] - 0.15 µm of spherical aberration, with 
apodized diffractive structures on the anterior surface, a square edge on the posterior surface and modified C -loop haptics. The design and material of the lens allow  it to be folded and 
inserted into the capsular bag through a small incision to minimize the possibility of surgically 
induced astigmatism.   The MX60EF lens is a modification to the Bausch + Lomb enVist a® 1 -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_356734], model MX60 E, approved under PMA Suppleme nt 
P920056/S024 by [CONTACT_8956] 05/23/2017 as an update to PMA P910056/S010, approved on 
05/30/2012 for the parent enVista MX60 monofocal IOL .  PMA P910056/ S010 approved a 
material change and design modifications to the previously approved Bausch +  Lomb mode l 
C31UB IOL, including a design change from 3- pi[INVESTIGATOR_356742] 1 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_356743].  
The enVista® Trifocal Model MX60EF will be manufactured, packaged and sterilized with the same materials and processes  used for the enhanced enVista® IOL Model MX60E.  The 
enVista Model MX60E lens material is a  modification to the enVista Model MX60 material, 
designed to enhance the unfolding rate of the lens at the lower eye temperature encountered 
during surgical procedures. 
The induced -0.15 µm negative spherical aberration MX60EF trifocal M IOL lens design 
(incorporated on the enVista EF base refractive design to give a residual spherical aberration  
of ~0.10µm ) is expected to produce comparable decentrati on performance t o a spherical 
aberration -free lens design and best contrast -related performance in the presence of other 
higher order aberrations.  Mathematical m odeling and optical bench experiments have shown 
that increased d epth of focus due to residual  spherical aberration  comes at the cost of lower 
modulation transfer function ( MTF ). 
20-22 Since  the enVista ® MX60 EF lens is distance 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 111 
 dominant under  mesopic (low light ) condit ions, any level of corneal spherical aberration  
compensation using the MX60EF trifocal MIOL should result in improving the MTF.  
 
Thus, the rationale for the investigation described in this document  is to collect and analyze 
data suggesting potential clinical benefit that clearly outweighs any potential risks associated with use of the MX60EF product.  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose  
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the enVista  trifocal

7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active- controlled binocular study of the 
enVista  one-pi[INVESTIGATOR_356744] M IOL (model MX60EF) in subjects 
undergoing cataract ext raction compared to the enVista one-pi[INVESTIGATOR_356745] (model MX60E ).  
Subjects sched uled to undergo cataract surgery by [CONTACT_356784] (IOL s) will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will be examined 
preoperatively to obtain a medical history, establish a baseline for ocular conditio n, and 
determine eligibility. Both e yes of each  subject will be included in the study and must meet 
eligibility criteria at the Pre -Operative Visit. At the time of the first surgery, subjects will be 
enrolled and randomly assigned by [CONTACT_356785] ( IRT) system in a 2:1 
ratio to either the enVista trifocal M IOL or the enVista monofocal IOL, respectively .  
Postoperatively, subjects will undergo ophthalmic examinations at regular intervals per the 
study visit schedule. The Investiga tor will provide standardized pre -, peri -, and postoperative 
care for all study subjects at hi s/her  clinical  site (refer to Section 11  for additional information). 
A delegated examiner (s) at each site who is masked to the randomized assignment of each 
subject will perform  postoperative measurements.   Every effort will be made to e nsure that 
postoperative assessments for a subject are completed by [CONTACT_167015].   
7.2 Investigators  
The clinical investigation will be  conducted at approximately twenty  (20) investigative sites  in 
North America .  
The clinical investigation will be conducted by [CONTACT_356786] l ocal regulations  and who are 
willing to demonstrate use of the MX60E product, if they have not already done so.  Additionally, the Device Investigator Agreement (on file for each site) also verifies Investigator obligations.   
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 111 
 Each Investigator site will attempt to enroll approximately twenty- five (25) subjects . In the 
event that selected sites do not meet expected enrollment, the Sponsor may decide to increase 
enrollment as needed at other currently active sites , replace non- enrolling s ites and/or add 
additional site(s) for a total of up to 25 actively enrolling  sites, to satisfy study enrollment 
requirements . No Investigator shall  contribute more than 10% of the total number of treated 
subjects  in the study.  
7.3 Study Duration  
Eligible subjects who are enrolled in this study will be followed for approximately one year 
following the  second eye surger y. 
8 Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects  
Approximately five hundred and one (501)  subjects ( approximately 1,002 eyes) at 
approximatel y twenty (20) clinical sites in North America scheduled to undergo bilateral 
phacoemulsification cataract surgery and IOL implantation will be enrolled in this clinical 
study.  
The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained t o the potential 
participant. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be 
determined. When it has been established that the subject is willing to participate, written 
informed consent will be obtained (Section 15.3) . In order to determine  eligibility, w ritten 
informed consent must be obtained from each study subject  prior to performing any study 
specific procedures that  are not part of the Investigator’s routine standard of care. Enrollment 
will be consecutive enrollment of all eligible subjects. A complete ophthalmic examination will be done at the Preoperative Visit scheduled within [ADDRESS_445030] Inclusion Criteria  
This study will include subjects who meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 
1. Subjects must be 22 years of age or older on the date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is 
signed.  
2. Subjects must have the capability to understand and provide written informed consent on 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) approved 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and a uthorization as appropriate for local privacy 
regulations.

 12 Primary and Secondary Safety and Effectiveness Variables  
12.1 Evaluation of Safety 
The p rimary safety endpoints will be:  
• The incidence  of all serious adverse events, including SSIs related to the optical 
propert ies of the IOL,  in first eyes through study exit  
• The rate of secondary surgical interventions due to the optical properties of the lens for 
first eyes  through study exit  
• The incidence of adverse events in first eyes compared to ISO Safety and Performance Endpoint (SPE) rates as defined in ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 7 through study exit   
 
The secondary safety endpoint s will be : 
• The rates  of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by [CONTACT_1766], as well as the rates of 
visual disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by [CONTACT_1766], using the QoV questionnaire  measure through Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye 
IOL implantation)  
• Mean photopic contrast sensit ivity with glare and mesopic contrast sensitivity with and 
without glare at Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL  
implantation) and Post -Operative Visit 5 (Day 330 to 420 after second eye IOL 
implantation)  
• Incidence of the types of AE s specified in the co -primary safety endpoints, but for 
fellow and “all” eyes  
• Incidence of all other types of adverse events in primary eyes, fellow eyes, and “all” eyes
 
 12.2 Evaluation of Effectiveness  
The primary effectiveness endpoints will be:  
• Photopic monocular best -corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) in first eyes at 
Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic monocular distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) in first eyes at [ADDRESS_445062] -Oper ative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic monocular distance -corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) in first 
eyes at [ADDRESS_445063] -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL 
implantation)
 
 
Secondary effectiveness endpoints will be:  
• Photopic binocular distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at [ADDRESS_445064]-
Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) at [ADDRESS_445065] -
Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic binocular distance -corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at [ADDRESS_445066]-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 111 
 • Photopic binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA) at [ADDRESS_445067] -
Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• First eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA evaluated at Visit [ADDRESS_445068] sensitivity sub -study. 
The known risks of multifocal IOL implantation that exis t in addition to the risks of monofocal 
IOL surgerie s (cf. ISO standard [ZIP_CODE]-7 Annex Table B.1) include the following: 
• Under scotopic and mesopic conditions the patient has reduced contrast sensitivity, and  
• There is an increased risk of post-operative photic effects such as halos and glare.  
Studies on other adverse perception effects following multifocal IOL implantation, such as stereo acuity disturbances and aniseikonia, have generally indicated an acceptable performance range. 
[ADDRESS_445069] sensitivity during the informed consent process.  As noted above, 
candidacy of patients for multifocal IOL implantation depends not only on objective findings during a complete ophthalmologic examination, but also on patients’ motivation to achieve spectacle independence.   The risks and benefits must be weighed on an individual basis by [CONTACT_356798].  Ensuring the subject’s thorough 
understanding of the optical side -effects of multifocal IOLs and ascertaining the subject’s 
degree of enthusiasm for spectacle independence form the basis of informed consent and risk mitigation.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_356750], the value of conducting a clinical 
study to support approval of a multifocal IOL is substantial in terms of assessing potential 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445070] improvement in their distance vision and would then only require the use  of corrective lenses 
(such as glasses or contact [CONTACT_13276]) for near and intermediate vision. If a subject is randomized to receive the enVista MX60EF trifocal IOL, they may have improvement in their near and intermediate vision while maintaining distance visual acuity comparable to a monofocal IOL, possibly allowing them to be able to read, use a computer, and watch television without reading glasses or bifocals.   Further discussion of potential or actual risks during cataract surgery and with the use of multifocal or monofocal enVista IOLs as well as IOL injectors to be used in this study can also 
be found in the study Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_445071].   
 To reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, careful precautions for interactions between subjects and study personnel, and study personnel and Sponsor and/or CRO staff  must be taken  
when in contact , including following local, state, and national recommendations and guidance 
found at www.aao.org/covid -19.  It is recommended Investigators periodically revisit the 
aao.org/covid -19 website to identify and implement any updated recomm endations made by 
[CONTACT_317489].     
 New risks  to all study participants beyond those described in the preceding section include:  
 
• Possible transmission of Coronavirus infection, and possible further complications 
(including but not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death) , beyond the risk of adverse 
events  due to the investigational test lens and/or procedure(s).  
• Risk will be higher in an ophthalmic clinical study because of the close contact [CONTACT_356799] -clinic  procedure s and assessments 
(since Investigators and post -surgical examiner s must make measurements close to t he 
face of subjects ), in addition to the need for multiple follow -up visits/exam ination s

12.4.1  Adverse Events Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, adverse events include: all ocular AEs; all ocular and non -ocular 
serious adverse events (SAEs); adverse device effects (ADEs); and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs).  AEs, SAEs, ADEs and UADEs are defined as follows.  
 An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or injury, or 
untowa rd clinical sign  (including abnormal laboratory finding)  in a subject , user  or other 
persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device .  This definition includes 
events related to the medical device or procedures involved.  For  users or other persons, this 
definition is restricted to events related to  the study device . 
 A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an 
AE that leads to:  
• death  
• a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that  either results in :  
o a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function (e.g., blindness), or 
o in-patien t or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
o a potentially vision- threatening condition, or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- or vision-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

 An Adverse Device Effects ( ADE) is any adverse event related to the use of an investigational 
medical device.  This definition includes any events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use , deployment, implantation, installation or operation, or any malfunction of 
the investigational medical device.  This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on healt h or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death is not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a s upplementary plan or application), or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Note: Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is NOT to be reported as an AE, per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-7.   
Severe or Very Bothersome Visual Disturbances on the Quality of Vision questionnaire 
Visual  disturbances reported will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_356752] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Any visual disturbance that leads to secondary surgical intervention should be considered a serious adverse event; however, the following conditions may lead to visual disturbance and secondary surgical intervention but may or may not be  considered related to 
the optical properties of the IOL . Detailed case narratives will be created for each of these 
subjects for future ana lyses and final determination as to whether the AE is related to the optical 
properties of the IOL. 
1) Residual refractive error which can be corrected with spectacles  
2) Posterior capsular opacification evident on slit lamp examination  3) Macular edema confirmed by [CONTACT_294138]/or fluorescein 
angiography 4) Corneal edema, punctate keratopathy due to dry eye syndrome or other corneal

 6) Surgical complications noted at the operative visit that may reasonably be expected to 
affect postoperative outcomes. 
The investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine if an SSI is warranted.  
If there is any uncertainty as to whether the SSI is related to the optical properties of the IOL or to some other unrelated factor, the Investigator should cons ult with the Medical Monitor.   
12.4.[ADDRESS_445076] sources of  identifying AEs include:  
• direct observation by [CONTACT_737]  
• askin g the study participant a non- specific question (e .g., “Have you had any 
problems since the last visit?”)  
• unsolicited volunteering of information by [CONTACT_87755] (e .g., “Doctor, I have 
had blurred vision since I started using this lens.”)  
• laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classific ation as an AE   
 
Specific to this protocol, ocular  AEs in the study eye(s)  and all SAE s (ocular and non -ocular) 
observed or elicited by [CONTACT_11856], reported by [CONTACT_423], or resulting from a test result, 
etc., occurring during the clinical investigation must be reported in the CRF . During the study, 
the Investigator should treat the study subject as appropriate to ensure his/her safety and welfare. Refer to Section 12.4.[ADDRESS_445077] 
exit.   
Pre-existing conditions  will not be considered AE s but will be collected at the Preoperative 
Visit as medical history . A worsening of a pre -existing condition during the study should be 
documented as an AE and evaluated accordingly.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356753] a medical AE should be captured as a serious AE until the 
cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356754]. However, the following reports of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282930] a medical AE should not be considered either serious or an AE : 
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with worsening of the pre -existing condition (e .g., for 
work -up of  persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
• Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep)  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam)  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_356755] (e.g., for elective 
cosmetic sur gery)  
12.4.[ADDRESS_445078] determine if the event is serious (refer to Section 
12.4.1 for criteria), assess the severity of symptoms , and determine  the relationship of the event 
to the device, using the following guidelines:  
a. Severity  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 111 
 - Mild : Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities  
- Moderate: S ubject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may inter fere with daily activities, but can be relieved by 
[CONTACT_119106]  
- Severe: A  sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment 
 
b.  Relationship to Study Device or Surgical Procedure 
- Related : There is at least a reasonable possibility the AE is related to the study device  
or surgical procedure.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest either 
a causal relationship or association between the study device  or surgical procedure and 
the AE.  
- Unrelated : There is little or no reasonable possibility the AE is related to the study 
device or surgical procedure .  No reasonable possibility means there is no evidence to 
suggest either a causal relationship or association between the study device or surgical procedure and the AE.

[IP_ADDRESS] First Eyes with at Least One Serious Adverse Event  
The proportion of first mITT  Set eyes  with at least one serious adverse event will be 
summarized using ca tegorical summary statistics by [CONTACT_82153]. Each eye will be 
counted only once in the calculation of the rate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Surgical Interventions Related to the Optical Properties of the IOL 
Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be defined as IOL explantation, replacement, or repositioning due to subject intolerance of visual symptoms not adequately improved by [CONTACT_356807]. The investigators will apply this definition to classify each secondary sur gical intervention as either related to the optical properties of the 
IOL or not related to the optical properties of the IOL .  
 Each eye will be classified as either having undergone a secondary surgical intervention related to the optical properties of t he IOL or not having undergone such an intervention. Missing data 
will not be imputed. Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be summarized categorically (Yes, No) by [CONTACT_356808] #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 111 
 subjects  in a table. Secondary surgical interventions will be further subcategorized and 
summarized categorically as Exchange, Removal, Repositioning, or Other.  
 
A two -sided 90% confidence interval around the difference in proportions (Test minus 
Control) will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score method without continuity 
correction. If the upper confidence limit (which is equivalent to a one -sided 95% upper 
confidence limit) is less than 0.[ADDRESS_445131] IOL is statistically non -
inferior to the Control IOL in this outcome.   
[IP_ADDRESS] ISO Grid Adverse Events  
Cumulative and persistent ISO  grid AEs will be summarized categorically for first eyes of the 
mITT Set by [CONTACT_3148]. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment actually received. 
The primary statistical analysis will include first eyes of the mITT Set  implanted with the Test  
IOL.  
 The numerator for each cumulative AE will be the numbe r of first Test group eyes reporting  
the AE at least once after surgery. The denominator for cumulative AEs will be the number of first Test  group eyes.  
 The numerator for each persistent AE will be the number of first Test group eyes with the event 
at Vi sit [ADDRESS_445132] IOL treatment group.

 P
hotopic monocular logMAR BCDVA in first implanted eyes at Post -Operative Visit [ADDRESS_445134] (least squares mean Test group IOL VA minus least squares mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be estimated in addition to a two -sided 90% confidence 
interval. If the upper confidence limit (equivalent  to a one -sided upper 95% confidence limit 
for the treatment effect) is less than 0.1, then the Test lens will be statistically non -inferior to 
the control lens.   The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set. However, non- inferiority will not be evaluated with the PP Set and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis.  BCDVA at Visit [ADDRESS_445135] group will be summarized categorically (20/20 or better, 20/25 
or better, 20/32 or better, 20/40 or better, and worse than 20/40) for the mITT  and Best Case

the proportion of Multifocal IOL eyes with BCDVA 20/40 or better to the relevant control rate 
(92.5% for all eyes and 96.7% for best case eyes) will be performed and p- values will be 
presented. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.   If the null hypothesis is not rejected for the mITT  and Best Case Sets in the primary analyses, 
then it will be concluded that the Multifocal IOL is statistically successful in this outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Photopic Monocular DCNVA

units by [CONTACT_356812]  (com bined) . The 
DCNVA best distance data from the Phase I/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_356757].  
 If there are missing mITT  analysis set  monocular DCNVA data at Visit 4, then missing data 
will be imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation method. 
After imputation of missing data, the statistical hypotheses will be tested  using a statistical 
model with treatment a nd site as fixed factors by [CONTACT_47915].  
 An overall p- value resulting from the multiple imputation method will be estimated . The 
treatment effect (mean Test group IOL VA minus mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be summarized using continuous summary statistics and a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval. If the p- value from the multiple imputation analysis is less than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_445138] is less than or equal to -0.20 (i.e., the Test lens mean logMAR VA is at 
least 0. 20 less than the mean for the control), then it will be concluded that the T est IOL is 
statistically and clinically successful (i.e., superior to the Control IOL) in this outcome.  The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set. However, superiority will not be evaluated with the PP Set and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis.

adverse events will be included in the safety analysis even if occurring or reported outside of scheduled visit windows. If a scheduled visit is completed outside of the prescribed visit window, then the visit and its window will be handled as follows:  
 
• The out -of-window scheduled visit will be reclassified as an interim (unscheduled) 
visit.  
• If one or more unscheduled visits occurred in the window, then the unscheduled visit that occurr ed closest to the center of the visit window will be reclassified as the in -
window (scheduled) visit.  
•     If two unscheduled visits occurred in the visit window, are the closest visits to its center, 
and are equidistant from its center, then the later o f the two visits will be reclassified 
as the in -window (scheduled) visit. 
 Each summary of unscheduled visit data will display the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum of the absolute value of days outside of the visit windows that the summarized data were collected .

 13.6.5 Management of Bias  
Potential bias will be managed by [CONTACT_356824].  
Randomization will be completed using a computer system so that subjects’ treatment assignments cannot be revealed prematurely. Each subject will be randomized independently, and no randomization result will be reassigned to another subject. This process should ensure there is no systematic bias in baseline characteristics, thus producing groups comparable in known and unknown potential confounding factors. The Berger -Exner test will be used to 
evaluate potential selection bias.  
The masking of subjects and postoperative examiner s described in Section 9.[ADDRESS_445149] be allowed to visit all study site locations to assess the data, quality, and study integrity in a manner consistent with applicable health authority regulations and the procedures adopted by [CONTACT_13668]. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, when access to study site locations may be restricted, remote monitoring 
methods may be implemented to ensure data quality and integrity, as per the monitoring plan.  Prior to the start of the study, member(s) of the Sponsor (or designees) will review the protocol,  
CRF, regulatory obligations, and other material or equipment relevant to the conduct of the study with the Investigator/Sub- Investigator and relevant study s ite personnel.  
 Monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, as per the monitoring 
plan, during the course of the investigation to verify the following:  
 
• The rights and well -being of subjects are protected  
• The conduct of the investigation is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment;  21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 812;  ISO [ZIP_CODE] ( 2020 E)

original subject documents, as well as data and records with information relevant to the subject and his/her participation in the study.   Source documentation worksheets may be provided by [CONTACT_356825]. The completed worksheets can then be incorporated into the subject’s medical chart. If it is preferred not to use the worksheets in the subject’s permanent record, 
then the worksheets should be used as a reference to determine the type of study data to record 
in the subject’s permanent record.  
14.3 Case R eport  Forms and Data Verification  
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to an electronic data record de veloped as part of the electronic data capture method utilized in this 
study. 
 Subject data required by [CONTACT_356826]. The Investigator and his/her study site personnel will be responsible for completing the CRFs  in a timely manner . The 
Investigator is required to verify that all of the requested information is accurately recorded on the CRFs. All information requested on the CRFs needs to be supplied, including subject identification and initials, date(s), assess ment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy 
will require explanation. All information on CRFs must be traceable to source documents.   The study monitor will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded on the 
CRFs utilizing the orig inal or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_356762] a

 Appendix B  METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATIONS  
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover.  S tudy procedures performed during the COVID -19 pandemic will be conducted in 
accordance with medical guidance to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission between s tudy 
staff and subjects (available at www.aao.org/covid-19 ).  It is recommended Investigator s 
periodically  revisit the aao.org/covid-[ADDRESS_445172] SUBJECTIVE REFRACTION (WITHOUT CYCLOP LEGIC EYE 
DROPS)  
It is essential that a consistent and standard procedure be used to obtain manifest refraction  
measurements.  The measurements will  be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, 
optometrist or trained ophthalmic technician using a phoropter  or tria l frame with loose lenses , 
in 0.[ADDRESS_445173]. The principal of maximum plus prescription 
while maintaining optimum visual acuity (not just darker letters) should be adhered to. At no time during the study will autorefraction be utilized as a final endpoint r efraction. 
Autorefractor or lensometer readings may only be utilized to obtain a starting point for the refraction , if necessary.   
To ensure consistency, all r efraction s will be performed at an optical distance of 4 meters  using 
the M&S Clinical Trial Suite . This refraction will be co nsidered the “unadjusted manifest 
refraction at 4 m ”.  The “adjusted manifest refraction” is the “unadjusted manifest refraction  “ 
minus 0.[ADDRESS_445174] for optical infinity at 4 m .  Both “adjusted” and “unadjusted” 
manifest refraction values will be recorded on source documentation, but only the adjusted value will entered as eCRF data.   Note that the “ adjusted  manifest refraction ” (“unadjusted 
manifest refraction ” at 4 meters minus  0.25 D) is the value that is used for DCIVA and 
DCNVA measurements .  
1.[ADDRESS_445175] be transferred to the trial frame for  
BCD VA testing. If for any reason (e.g., dense cataract) manifest refraction  cannot be obtained, 
the results should be documented as not done (ND) and not entered as zeros. In the event of 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445176] demonstrate a stable refraction (within ± 0.50 D  for both sphere and 
cylinder ) on two consecutive exam dates. Stability of the refraction is determined under the 
following conditions:  
• Lenses are not worn for at least 1 week (rigid contact [CONTACT_13276]) or 3 days (soft contact [CONTACT_13276]) 
prior to the first refraction used to establish stability and  through the day of surgery;   
• The two refractions are performed at least [ADDRESS_445177] procedure be used to obtain visual acuity ( VA) measurements. 
The VA measurements should be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist or trained ophthalmic technician using the  Clinical Trial Suite (M&S Technologies, Niles, IL) 
hardware and software that will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  Tra ining on the use of Clinical 
Trial Suite instrumentation will be conducted and documented by a qualified representative of 
M&S Technologies prior to its use with enrolled subjects.  VA testing will be performed by [CONTACT_356833] a trial frame . 
Visual Acuity Testing  for all subjects : 
• Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) will be measured at distance of [ADDRESS_445178] refraction obtained at 4 meters  (Unadjusted Manifest Refraction)  
• Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA) will be measured at distance of 4 meters with 
a +0.25D lens to adjust for optical infinity  
• Distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) will be measured at distance(s) 
specified in Appendix A
 with the “adjusted manifest refraction”, which is the  manifest 
refraction obtained at [ADDRESS_445179] 
refraction  (Adjusted  Manifest Refraction)  
• Uncorrected intermediate  visual acuity  (UCIVA) will be  measured with Phase II and Phase 
III subjects a t distance(s)  specified in Appendix A  at 66  cm with no corrective lens  
• Distance corrected near visual acuity  (DCNVA) will be  measured at distance(s) specified 
in Appendix A  with the “adjusted manifest refraction”, which is the  manifest r efraction  
obtained at 4 meters  minus 0.25 D ( Adjusted  Manifest Refraction ). 
• Uncorrected near visual acuity  (UCNVA) will be  measured at distance(s)  specified in 
Appendix A  with no corrective lens 
 2.1 Description and Testing Methodology  The Clinical Trial Suite is a computerized vision testing system consisting of a computer tablet and frame to hold the tablet that allows it  to be stationed at different distances from a seated 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445180] during testing and warn him/her if  
squinting is observed.  The subject is not to proceed to the next letter until a defi nite response 
is given.  If the subject changes a response (e.g., “that was a ‘C’ not an ‘O’) before the next letter has been read aloud, then the change must be accepted.  If the subject changes a response having read the next letter, then the change is n ot to be accepted.  The examiner should never point to 
the char t or to specific letters o n the chart during the test.  A maximum effort should be made 
to identify each letter on the chart.  This may include encouraging the subject to guess.  If the subject  identified a letter as [ADDRESS_445181] lighting conditions to be used in VA testing are Photopic: 85 (± 2) cd/m
2 and Mesopic: 
3 (± 0.5) cd/m2. If an Investigator is unable to use these lighting conditions or has lighting 
conditions that vary slightly from these target illuminations, they should discuss their current lighting conditions with the Sponsor . 
 2.[ADDRESS_445182] Instructions  
 Subjects will be instructed that their vision will be tested  at different distances, sometimes with 
the room lights on and sometimes with the room  lights off.  They will be asked  to sit quietly 
during testing, with no head movements relative to the chart display allowed.  If subjects need one or more  brief  breaks from the testing, this will be  allowed.

24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93 of 111 
 Using an Ophthalmoscope, light is shone into the eye and the retina and the optic nerve are 
examined. This exam is used to evaluate the internal structures of the eye. The Investigator will classify the fundus as “normal” or “abnormal.”   If abnormal, the i nvestigator will describe 
the abnormality.  The investigator will also rate the clarity of fundus visualization as “adequate” or “inadequate” .   
 7.[ADDRESS_445184] ID numbe r, and submitted to the Sponsor (or 
designee) for assessment.  The image quality will be assessed to determine adequacy for visualization of retinal structures, with the results rated on the following scale:  
0 = Ungradable (including failure to visualize the macula or optic nerve)  
1 = Poor quality image  
2 = Fair quality image  
3 = Good quality image  
4 = Excellent quality image  
 If difficulty with visualization  is encountered during the process of obtaining OCT images , 
conventional fundus photographs will be taken .   
 8.[ADDRESS_445185] the following characteristics  (in both eyes)  upon having 
consented to the Trial Frame Astigmatism Simulation  sub- study:  
1. Signed consent (no later than Visit 5) to participate in the sub- study 
2. Completed visit [ADDRESS_445186] -corrected distance visual acuity of 20/[ADDRESS_445187] corneal edema, increased IOP or any AE / SAE at Visit 5, as 
per the reportable AEs/ SAEs clarified in section 12.4.[ADDRESS_445188] -operative residual astigmatism (axis between 30 to 60 
degrees or 120 to 150 degrees)  will be excluded from participation in the sub- study. 
Enrollment will be sequential with consecutive subjects enrolled onto the Trial Frame 
astigmatism simulation sub -study at each site in order of their completion of post -operative 
Visit [ADDRESS_445189] will provide  consent for the Trial Frame 
astigmatism simulation sub -study by [CONTACT_23780] 5  and return at Visit 6 to  undergo the 
trial frame evaluation to assess distance- corrected visual acuities with various amounts of 
astigmatism. Eligibility for the sub -study will be confirmed by [CONTACT_319300] V isit 5 and 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445190] s will be enrolled in it when  the Informed Consent  document is signed. V isit 6  will 
include review/update of  concomitant medication s, adverse events, and measurement of 
monocular distance corrected visual acuity for far (4 m), intermediate (66 cm), and near (40 
cm) distance under photopic conditions with varying degrees of simulated residual astigmatism 
with 2.00 D, 1.5 D, and 1.0 D  CYL .  Participants in the sub-study will be seen at only one visit  
(Visit 6)  for the  trial frame evaluation  which will complete their participation in the study .   
Assessments are shown in the Study Flow Chart in Appendix A . 
 The below assessments  will be recorded : 
 
i. For the (4 -meter) manifest -corrected distance (4 m) testing : 
▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation) ;  
 ii. For the distance corrected intermediate (66 cm) testing  : 
▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout  astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation)  iii. For the distance corrected near (40 cm) testing: ▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation) 
 The order of testing will follow the  A and B Eye pre -operative assignments relating to the 
order of surgical implantation of the IOL  and each eye of the subject will be tested for each 
distance and astigmatic condition, followed by a repeat of the same testing with the other eye.    The purpose of the Trial Frame astigmatism sub- study is to evaluate the effect of simulated 
residual astigmatism on distance, intermediate, and near visual acuities in eyes implanted with the enVista trifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs).  
 The trial frame evaluation will assess distance -corrected visual acuities with various amounts 
of additional astigmatism at distance / far, intermediate, and near distances, in that order, for 
each eye of each  subject  monocularly.  ETDRS charts appropriate for each distance will be 
used in measuring visual acuity for the vario us cylinder power conditions.  Each eye of the 
participating  subjects will be evaluated monocularly, beginning with the subject’s A eye 
(Right/ Left) and repeating for the subject’s B eye (Left/ Right) .   
 The Trial Frame is placed on the subject and adjus ted to sit comfortably on the subject’s face . 
The subject’s eyes are centered relative to the lens wells of the frame via adjustments to the 
temple length, to the nose pad for frame height , pantoscopic  tilt and leveling of the frame and  
the interpupi[INVESTIGATOR_128381].  The subject’s distance -corrected refraction and testing will begin at f ar distance (4 m) using 
the Clinical Trial Suite system (M&S Technologies, Niles, IL) with no  additional cylinder tria l 
lens in the trial frame for  measurement of monocular distance corrected  visual acuity for each 
eye. The distance correction used in the trial frame for testing at far distance (4 m) is the 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445191] refraction performed  at 4 m ; however, the distance correction used in the 
trial frame for testing at intermediate (66 cm) and near (40 cm) distances is the adjusted  
manifest refraction ( i.e., the manifest refraction at 4 m adjusted by [CONTACT_356835] -0.25 
D).  See Table [ADDRESS_445192] refraction.   
 Examples  
1)            -0.75 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +1.50 cylinder,  2)            -0.50 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +1.00 cylinder, 3)            -1.00 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +2.[ADDRESS_445193] at distance  / far (4 m), 
intermediate (66 cm), and near (40 cm) distances (in that order) using additional plus cylinder trial lenses placed at  the 180⁰ axis (i.e., simulating A TR astigmatism) and then at the 90⁰ axis 
(i.e., simulating W TR astigmatism).  The order of trial lenses to be used with a subject will be 
the 2.00 D plus cylinder lens  (placed first at 180⁰ and then at 90⁰) followed successively by [CONTACT_356836] 1.50 D plus cylinder lens  (placed first at 180 ⁰ and then at 90⁰) and then the 1.00 D plus 
cylinder lens (placed first at 180⁰ and then at 90⁰).  The A eye will be measured first, using the 
various cylinder lenses for distance / far, intermediate, and near distances .   The same ord er 
will then be repeated for the B eye.

   9.0 ASSESSMENT OF LENS TILT AND DECENTRATION 
If upon postoperative examination, tilt  and/or decentration of the IOL are  not seen or deemed 
insignificant, rather than entering any score, a box marked “Not Detectable” will be checked.  
Otherwise, significant lens tilt  and decentration  will be assessed according to the method 
described by [CONTACT_356837], 
[ADDRESS_445195] Length. 40    
 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_445196] to the pupil, helps to identify it.

Purkinje images as seen through a pupi[INVESTIGATOR_225806].  
 With the patient looking at the examiner's finger,  the examiner moves his finger  in the frontal 
plane until  Purkinje images III and IV, as sighted by [CONTACT_4921]'s  eye, become aligned with 
one another. The apparent IOL  tilt (𝚹𝚹') and decentration ( Δ) are directly determined from  this 
viewing situation , as described below . 
 

Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 of 111 
  
Figure 6 from Guyton et al  39 
 
In Figure 6, the appa rent amount of tilt of the IOL ( 𝚹𝚹') is equal to the angle between the patient's 
line of sight  and the aligned Purkinje images III and IV. This angle is  formed by [CONTACT_4921]'s 
finger, the patient's pupil, and the penlight.   In the  example in Figure 6, the direction of tilt is 
from the examiner's  finger toward the pen light, directly down, in the 90° meridian.  
 
Also , illustrated in Figure 6 is the examiner's view of  the Purkinje images as projected onto the 
patient's pupil. Notice that images III and IV are superimposed on each other but do not 
coincide with image I.   This is a right  eye, with the first Purkinje image being displaced nasally  
from the center of the pupil. Also, the first Purkinje image  is displaced downward, because it 
always falls on the line  connecting the light source with the center of curvature  of the 
cornea.   With the patient's eye looking upward, therefore, the first Purkinje image (the corneal 
light reflex)  is displaced downward with respect to the center of the  pupil.  
 The superimposition of Purkinje images III and IV mar ks the  optical axis of the IOL as it passes 
through the entrance  pupil of the eye. Because the desired center point for the  IOL is the center 
of the entrance pupil, the amount of  decentration and direction of decentration of the IOL are  
immediately apparen t from this view. The IOL is decentered  directly upward, approximately 
0.[ADDRESS_445197]  of the patient's eye, perpendicular to the patient's l ine of  
sight as illustrated.  
 If the IOL is not decentered at all, but simply tilted  about its anterior vertex, the relationship 
of the apparent  angle of tilt to the actual angle of tilt can be calculated .   For clinical purposes, 
it is sufficient to remember that  the actual tilt of a centered IOL is 80%  to 85%  of the  apparent 
tilt (𝚹𝚹').   Pure decentration of the IOL, without actual tilt, will produce a certain amount of 
apparent tilt, because the optical axis of the IOL will no longer be perpendicular to the cornea. 
By [CONTACT_356838], l  mm of decentration produces 1.7° of apparent tilt, and 
2 mm  of decentration produces 4.14 ° of apparent tilt.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_445198] LENGTH  µ AND KERATOMETRY 

Protocol #[ADDRESS_445199] -Operative Visits 3, 4 and 5, may be 
obtained from automated keratometry (e.g., IOL Master or LENSTAR) or simulated keratometry (e.g., topography, Scheimpflug photography or optical coherence tomography).  Note that the steep and flat axes which are reported should be orthogonal.  The same method should be used for a specific subject/eye throughout the study.     
11.[ADDRESS_445200] defocus testing performed.  
Approximately 10 subjects from each lens group at each of three photopic pupil sizes (small - 
<3.0mm;  medium -  ≥3.0mm and ≤ 4.0 mm ; large -  >4.0 mm) will be evaluated.  If 10 subjects 
are not available in any one pupil size category, the maximum number available will be used.    
Data will be stratified by [CONTACT_356839] (small -  <3.0mm; medium -  ≥3.0mm and ≤4.0 
mm; and large - >4.0 mm) and axial length (short -  <21.0 mm; medium -  21.0 to 26.0 mm; and 
long -  >26.0 mm). 
 Binocular  defocus testing will be performed under photopic lighting conditions using the 
Clinical Trial Suite (M&S Technologies) at Visit 4 (120- 180 days after second eye IOL 
implantation). Each subject will be defocused with spherical minus trial lenses from their best distance- corrected (Unadjusted ) manifest refraction between +1.50 D and - 3.50 D in 0.5 D 
increments , except in the range of +0.[ADDRESS_445201] sensitivity testing will be performed using the M&S Clinical Trial Suite at all sites , 
using the Una djusted Manifest Refraction . The CTS is calibrated for distance- to-subject and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463] -per-inch so that optotypes follow ANSI and ISO standards .
 
Sine-wave gratings will be produced on a high- resolution monitor . Outer edges of the grating 
will incorporate the Gabor effect , and all edges will be surrounded by a uniform field equal to 
the grating in space -averaged luminance.   Subjects will practice the contrast sensitivity test 
once at all orientations, each at a different spatial frequency, under photopic conditions before 
beginning tests for recorded data.  
Subje cts undergoing contrast sensitivity testing will be dark adapted for at least [ADDRESS_445202] sensitivity testing.  Mesopic ( 2.5 to 3.2 cd/m

Protocol #[ADDRESS_445203] questionnaires 
(each developed using patients requiring refractive correction, including cataract surgery patients) are directly related to the original concepts for which the questionnaires were developed. Results of the QoV questionnaire will find use as a secondary safety endpoint to assess subject visual disturbances (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  The NAVQ is being studied as an exploratory subject survey to assess the similarity of subject-perceived near vision functional task limitations and uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) for subjects in both treatment groups, without comparison between treatment groups or seeking correlations.  
 
The QoV Questionnaire  
The QoV questionnaire 23,[ADDRESS_445204] matter experts in refractive correction, 
iterative focus groups with non-experts, cognitive interviews and evaluation with 900 subjects ([ADDRESS_445205] surgery patients who received monofocal, multifocal, or accommodative IOLs). Reliability of the QoV questionnaire was obtained through Rasch analysis of person and item separation statistics for instrument precision, questionnaire fit statistics, correlation with clinical findings (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual aberrations), and test- retest 
reliability.  
23    
 The NAVQ Questionnaire  
The NAVQ
25-28 will be used as an exploratory measure of difficulties completing tasks 
requiring uncorrected near vision. Its use in this study is not intended to support labeling claims  for the enVista MX60EF IOL and is only exploratory in nature. The NAVQ use in 
this study was halted upon acceptance of version 5.0  of the #945 protocol (see footnote in synopsis ).   
 13.[ADDRESS_445206] Questionnaire  Instructions  
 Questionnaires should be completed independently by [CONTACT_132149] a private space at the 
beginning of each applicable visit, prior to other study assessments being performed.

 1. The QoV questionnaire 23, 24 has two main elements:  
• Ten questions, each asked for frequency, intensity, and bothersomeness of the queried 
symptom and each graded on a 4-point grading scale. 
• Seven photographs which relate to the first [ADDRESS_445207] they can.  The QoV questionnaire instructions for subjects 
will state : 
• Look at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_356768] 7 symptoms and familiarize yourself with the meaning of each symptom. 
• Now answer the questions below about your eyesight in your everyday life. 
• If you have had surgery, please respond based on how you are now, not prior to surgery. 
• Please respond based on how you feel in the past week.

patients receiving monofocal or multifocal IOLs. 26 Rasch analysis of the responses 
reduced the NAVQ to a 10- question data set and confirmed a 5- point grading scale was not 
different from the original 6 -point NAVQ grading scale; 28 the 5 -point grading scale is 
therefore being used in the present study.  
Verbal instructions to subjects  on how to complete the NAVQ will include  the following: 
 
• The questionnaire assesses how you feel about your current vision without additional 
near correction such as spectacles and how it allows you to function with near and intermediate tasks . 
• Please read the questions carefully and answer them as you feel is appro priate for how 
you feel – there are no right or wrong answers. If you feel a particular question in not 
applicable to your situation, please respond with the NA option, but otherwise answer 
all questions. 
• Let the coordinator know when you have finished or have any questions. 
• Please answer ALL questions for the situation IF/WHEN YOU DO THE DESCRIBED ACTIVITY WITHOUT EXTRA READING SPECTACLES.  
• Circle the relevant option.

Protocol #[ADDRESS_445209] surgical procedures will be perfo rmed by a qualified Investigator , using a 
phacoemulsification system adjusted according to the surgeon's usual settings (power 
modulation should be used).  All pre -operative, operative, and post -opera tive procedures 
performed during the COVID -19 pandemic will be conducted in accordance with medical 
guidance to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission between study staff and subjects (available 
at www.aao.org/covid-19 ).  It is recommended Investigators periodically  revisit the 
aao.org/covid-[ADDRESS_445210] ic (Amvisc® Plus) should be used for the procedure. If the investigator determines 
that a supplemental  ophthalmic viscoelastic device ( OVD)  is necessary, based on individual 
subject conditions or surgical circumstances, the use of a commercially available dispersive 
OVD will be permitted.   In such cases, the investigator should document the reason for use of 
a supplemental  OVD in the source document.  
  
The study lens should not be implanted if there is zonular rupture or if the anterior or posterior capsul e has been compromised, or if any complication occurs, which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, may cause untoward effects.  
The surgical procedure will be performed as follows: 
1. The eye will be prepared for surgery and draped according to the surgeon’s standard 
procedure. 
2. Phacoemulsification and any routine adjunctive procedures will be performed according to the Investigator’s usual standard of care. 
3. A clear corneal or limbal incision of approximately 2.[ADDRESS_445211] in -the- bag placement will be made using the surgeon's standard 
instrumentation and technique.  
4. The anterior chamber will be entered through the incision opening and Amvisc® Plus  will 
be used to fill the anterior chamber . If the investigator determin es that a supplemental OVD 
is necessary, based on individual subject conditions or surgical circumstances, the use of a commercially available dispersive  OVD will be permitted.   In such cases, the investigator 
should document the reason for use of a supplemental OVD in the source document. 
5. The cataract will be extracted by [CONTACT_353512].  
NOTE: The study lens should not be implanted if any of the following intraoperative 
complications occur: 
• Capsulorhexis tear, iris damage, posterior capsular rupture, vitreous prolapse, or 
zonular weakness or dehiscence  
• Zonular rupture 
• Evident zonular weakness or dehiscence 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 104 of 111 
 • Posterior capsule rupture 
• Vitreous loss 
• Significant detachment of Descemet’s membrane  
• Wound burn or damage  
• Anterior chamber bleeding 
• Iris incarceration or damage  
• Corneal endothelial touch 
• Unsuccessful/incomplete phacoemulsification  
• Posterior capsule plaque 
• Optic and/or haptic damage/amputation  
6. The study IOL will be removed from the vial and rinsed with sterile saline in accordance 
with the IOL instructions for use. The IOL is introduced into the eye using the BLIS IOL Injector according to inserter package insert and placed into the capsular bag.  To ensure the subject remains masked to the lens type ass igned, the Investigator and any unmasked 
surgical personnel must not verbally or visually disclose the lens type assigned. 
7. Residual viscoelastic should be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_356769]'s preferred removal technique. Care should be taken during irrigation/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_356770] a thorough removal of the viscoelastic material from both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens. It is recommended that the irrigation/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_356771].  
8. Incision closure will be left to the discretion of the Investigator.  As a routine, no suture should be required.  However, depending on the needs of the case, the cornea may be 
sutured at the Investigator’s discretion.  
9. Following completion of the surgery, topi[INVESTIGATOR_54059], antibiotic and anti -inflammatory 
medications may be applied to the eye, followed by a patch or shield, per the Investigator’s standard post -operative regimen.  Additional ophthalmic medications as deemed necessary 
may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion. 
 
IOL Explantation 
The indication of IOL explantation will be made at the discretion of the Investigator if he/she 
judges it appropriate and beneficial for the safety and welfare of the subject.

Objectives:  
1. Determine the proportion of patients with an 80% or greater improvement in arm and neck
numerical rating scale pain (NRS) score following an initial cervical transforaminal steroidinjection (TFESI) at [ADDRESS_865466]-injection and the duration of response up to 12 months.
2. Determine the proportion of patients with a 50%-79% improvement in arm and neck NRS
score following an initial cervical TFESI at [ADDRESS_865467]-injection and the duration ofresponse up to 12 months.
3. Determine the proportion of patients with less than 50% improvement in arm and neck NRS
score following an initial cervical TFESI at [ADDRESS_865468]-injection and the duration ofresponse up to 12 months.
4.Determine the proportion of patients with an initial injection plus up to 3 additional injectionsthat maintain 80% or greater, as well as 50-79%, improvement in arm and neck NRS scorefor up to 12 months.
5. Determine the proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in function defined
by a minimally clinically significant change (MCIC) ( ≥10 point improvement ) or 30%
improvement in Neck Disability Index (NDI) score
13,[ADDRESS_865469]-injection and the duration of response up to 1-2 months.
6.Determine the proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement in theMedication Quantification Scale (MQS III) score
15 (≥6.8 point change, equivalent to 10 oral
morphine equivalents) following an initial cervical TFESI at [ADDRESS_865470]-injection and theduration of response up to 12 months.
7.Determine the proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement in thecategorical EuroQol 5 Dimensions tool (EQ- 5D)
16 defined by ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_865471] -injection and the duration of response up to 12 months.
8.Compare patien t demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics between response groups
and perform predictive modeling to better understand variables that increase the likelihood ofa successful clinical outcome.
9.Report adverse effects.
Hypotheses:  
1.At least 50 % of patients with cervical radicular pain will experience 50% or greater relief of
index pain at 1-month follow- up after cervical TFESI.
2.At least 50% of patients with cervical radicular pain will experience a clinically significantimprovement in function at [ADDRESS_865472] 50% of patients with cervical radicular pain will experience a clinically significantimprovement in analgesic medication use at [ADDRESS_865473] 50% of patients with cervical radicular pain will experience a clinically significantimprovement in health -related quality of life at 1 -month follow- up after cervical TFESI.

18 In general, patients who experience new onset radicular pain tend to improve within 
4-6 months, with complete recovery in over 80% of patients by 24-36 months.2 However, a 
significant proportion of patients experience severe pain and associated functional impairment despi[INVESTIGATOR_646370], which often prompts physician directed interventions. 
Cervical transforaminal epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227] (TFESI) is a target- specific treatment for 
refractory radicular pain. Analgesic mechanisms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_646371], reducing nociceptive input from somatic nerves, stabilization of neural membranes, and blockade of C fiber activity in the dorsal root ganglion.

Previously, this procedure was associated with rare but catastrophic neurologic injury, thought to be related to inadvertent deposit of particulate steroid into the vertebral artery or radiculomedullary arteries, both of which traverse through or close to the cervical neuroforamina.
19,20 Since the physician community has adopted new guidelines that include the 
use of only non-particulate steroid during cervical TFESI12, neurologic infarction has not been 
reported in the literature. When the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_263115] (SIS) clinical practice guidelines are employed, large cohort studies have demonstrated zero prevalence of serious complications associated with this procedure
21. 
 While high-quality outcome literature demonstrates both efficacy and effectiveness for analogous use of this intervention in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]
22,23, far fewer studies have addressed 
clinical outcomes associated with cervical TFESI in which appropriate procedure technique24, 
outcome measurement, dat a analysis, and results interpretation have been reported25. Outcome 
literature reporting on the use of cervical TFESI is limited by [CONTACT_133206]9, retrospective 
design with loss of follow-up26, lack of categorical data analysis10, and a failure to stratify results 
by [CONTACT_646417]10. 
Further, outcome literature reports on the effect of particulate steroid injectate during cervical TFESI
9,27 are no longer relevant to appropriate clinical practice in the context of unequivocal 
guidelines.12,28 Pragmatic studies with a cervical TFESI arm in which  dexamethasone was used 
do allow for some insight regarding success rates associated with this procedure; studies report responder rates of 60% achieving >50% pain relief (CI
95 35-85%) at 4 weeks9, 55% achieving  
>50% (CI 95 43-67%) at 8 weeks10, and 65% achieving >50% at 12 weeks (CI 95 48-81%).29 These 
responder rates are encouraging, but limited by [CONTACT_133758] 95% confidence intervals due to small sample size. Prior systematic review has concluded that the eviden ce for treatment benefit of 
radicular pain by [CONTACT_646418], but does overall suggest approximately 50% patients experience 50% relief of radicular pain for at lea st 4 weeks after cervical TFESI.

 Image guidance is commonly studied, with some investigators suggesting the use of ultrasound 
30,31(30, 31), or CT guidance32 (3), however fluoroscopic guidance with use of digital subtraction

 imaging (DSI) remains the gold standard imaging modality33,34 (4,5). In terms of needle 
approach, a few new studies have been published to suggest possible alternative approaches. 
These include a m odified parasagittal interlaminar approach under CT guidance32 (3), 
parasagittal interlaminar approach under fluoroscopic guidance35 (6), and standard interlaminar 
approach with threaded catheter36 (7). None of these studies (including our own, ref. 36), has 
shown clinically significant benefit between approaches or significant safety differences. Further, multiple studies published prior to our original protocol submission have suggested that the route of delivery into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_646372]
37-39 (8–10).  
Several new studies have been published since [ADDRESS_865476] we found clinically significant reductions in pain and improvement in function in those treated with cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419], with no significan ce between group differences depending on the route used (transforaminal versus 
interlaminar with catheter)
36 (7). Specifically, 49.1% (95% CI 36.4–62.0%), 46.4% (95% CI 
33.8–59.6%), and 51.9% (95% CI 38.4–65.2%) of participants reported >50% pain relief at 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_865477] “much improved” at 6 months. There were no serious adverse effects or complications noted in this study. Another study published in 2020 showed a 60% responder rate at one month with similarly observed low levels of pain at 5 year follow up, likely evidencing the favorable natural history of cervical radicu lar pain
40 (11). Another report of outcomes after CTFESI showed 
significant reductions in pain and high patient satisfaction at two years41 (12).  
Additional clinical outcome literature is nee ded, particularly given recent policy decisions, such 
as that of Oregon State in relation to ending coverage of epi[INVESTIGATOR_646373]12. Without expansion of the evidence-basis for this important procedure, there is a risk that 
this treatment option may be taken away from patients suffering from cervical radicular pain by [CONTACT_646419]. A sham-controlled trial, similar to the Ghahreman study
23, would be ideal; 
however, due to cost considerations germane to a study designed and conducted in a manner that would prevent any possible criticism from the larger medical community, we instead propose a high-quality, large prospective cohort study as a significant contribution to the literature. Even the best designed trials, such as Dreyfuss’ [ADDRESS_865478] been underpowered to definitively demonstrate effectiveness; notably, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of treatment responders in this study was 35%. We aim to conduct a large enough cohort study narrow the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of responders substantially. Preliminary data from our center demonstrates a responder rate of 55% at 4 -week follow -up 
(n=22), based on a definition of ≥ 50% improvement in index pain. These data represent analysis 
of consecutive patients who underwent cervical TFESI for unilateral radicular pain as a part of a different prospective outcome study at our center, nearing completion. This responder rate represents a conservative estimate of what might be expected in the proposed work, as the current study includes less stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 Adverse events have also been further studied. A recent study of events after 1753 CTFESIs 
showed only 6 self–“ limited ” adverse events which included 2 vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 1 instance of

Further, we intend to use the results of this study as foundational data from which to propose a randomized controlled study through a large federal funding mechanism. It is imperative that such a trial be conducted by [CONTACT_646420] a study of a treatment intervention for pain

Power Analysis 
Dreyfuss et al.
9 found that 60% of subjects who received a cervical TFESI with dexamethasone 
reported at least 50% improvement in NRS score (CI 95 35-85%) at 4 weeks. In order to distinguish 
the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval from a theoretical placebo/sham response rate of 30%, but also from less than a 50% responder rate (we suggest being the minimum acceptable to the medical community), a sample size of 105 subjects is necessary (95% CI 51-69%, assuming a 60% responder rate). In order to account for a conservat ive 10% attrition rate by [CONTACT_941] 4 -week 
primary endpoint, we propose to enroll 117 patients.    Procedures

on a fluoroscopy table. A pre- procedure time- out will be performed, as is protocol in the 
University practice.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, cervical ESI will be performed (please note 
that the procedure specifications are provided as an example of the current clinical practice and 
minor variations in parameters are still considered standard of care and do not constitute protocol deviations):  Transforaminal epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227] (As performed as standard of care practice) After injection of 1 to 2 mL of lidocaine to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, a 25-gauge spi[INVESTIGATOR_646379], based on clinical correlation of symptoms/signs and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Advancement to the appropriate target position in the neuroforamen will be performed under fluoroscopic guidance according to practice guidelines.

uptake, 1mL (10mg/mL) of dexamethasone sodium phosphate mixed with  lidocaine will be 
injected . After the injection procedure, participants will be observed and then discharged from 
the clinic with written discharge instru ctions (current standard practice). 
 Repeat injections Participants who achieve 80% or more relief of their usual pain at the 4-week follow-up and who 
subsequently experience a recurrence of their usual index pain are offered a repeat procedure as  
per standard of care . “Usual pain” is defined as their cervical radicular pain (upper extremity 
pain or shoulder girdle/ periscapular pain) which is greater than axial neck pain. Participants with 50-79% relief will be offered a second injection (at 4-week follow-up) with the goal of achieving greater than 80% relief. Responders will be offered a repeat injection if pain returns to the extent that warrants consideration of an additional injection. Duration of relief will be considered the time from the provision of the TFESI procedure until the participant reports a worsening of pain to the extent that warrants consideration of an additional injection. This may occur during an unscheduled follow-up, by [CONTACT_646423], or as reported during scheduled follow-up or when a repeat TFESI is requested and performed.

 The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with 50% or greater reduction in 
neck and arm pain on the NRS pain score at the 1-month follow-up assessment. Secondary outcomes included reduction in median NRS pain score (both neck pain and arm pain), NDI -5, 
MQS III, opi[INVESTIGATOR_646381], PGIC score, and satisfaction score. Secondary outcomes will also be defined based on categorical “responder analysis” definitions of important clinical change given the National Institutes of Health recommendation for responder analysis in the assessment of therapeutic spi[INVESTIGATOR_646382].
45 The responder analysis will 
include the proportion of patients with 30% or greater improvement on the NDI-5,46,47 a PGIC 
score less than 3 (indicating “improved” or “very much improved”), a 6.8 or greater point reduction on the MQS III score (equivalent to approximately 10 daily morphine equivalents),

work status, number of repeat injections, and the proportion of participants who undergo surgical spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  Statistical analysis  
Descriptive statistics (mean and SD for quantitative variables; frequency and proportion for categorical variables) will be calculated for pati ent demographics, along with the primary and 
secondary outcome variables listed above. A multilevel mixed- effects generalized linear model 
with ordinal family and logit link will be used to examine longitudinal changes in index pain following an initial ce rvical TFESI at [ADDRESS_865486]-injection. 
Specifically, index pain will be categorized into three ordinal categories (≥ 80%, 50-79%, or < 50% improvement), and will be used as an ordinal outcome variable, while three time points described here will be used as a time variable. Potential covariates  for the model will include: 1) age, 2) duration of pain, 3) baseline NDI score, 4) degree of nerve compression (grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, or grade 4), 5) work status (employed or unemployed), 6) DM2 (present or absent), 7) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (yes or no), and 8) baseline NRS pain score separately for arm and neck.  Risks/Benefits:  
Risks of study participation include the potential loss of confidentiality.   Risks for standard of care procedure are the same as those for any standard fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_646383]&R Spi[INVESTIGATOR_469527].  These include: local infection, epi[INVESTIGATOR_646384], dural puncture and potential post-dural puncture headache, paresthesia during needle placement, pain at the injection side, failure of technique, allergy to latex or medications being used.

The length of stay and length of recovery is no longer than that of a standard ESI performed in the PM&R Spi[INVESTIGATOR_646386].   
 There are no direct benefits to the individual by [CONTACT_646426].  The patients will be 
presented with the same options of treatment whether they enroll in the study or decide not to.  The information extracted from this study may provide the investigators a better understanding of patient ’s pain response following a cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227].

HepPSI Phase 2  Version  2.7 
STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_589861] faced many barriers to care within conventional healthcare systems. 
 
1.2 BACKGROUND  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) and related health problems have emerged as a national health crisis. In 
2017, an estimated 1.7 million American adults had a pharmaceutical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), and 0.7 
million had a heroin-involved OUD.(1) The increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_461241] (IDU) has led 
to a rise in overdose deaths(2) and new cases of HIV and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV).(3, 4) Injection 
drug use is the primary mode of transmission for HCV infection in the U.S.(5-7) After more than a decade 
of decline, the incidence of HCV is again on the rise, particularly among young adults, (8, 9) and in rural 
areas.(10) The recent outbreak in rural Indiana is also a stark reminder of the ever-present risk for HIV 
associated with IDU. (4) 
 
We are at a unique historical moment, as we possess effective medications that can improve and 
sustain the lives of people who inject drugs (PWID). Currently there are medications that can be 
prescribed to 1) cure HCV (directly-acting antivirals), 2) prevent HIV infection (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis 
[PrEP]) and treat/prevent overdose (naloxone and medications to treat OUD). Furthermore, there is an 
unprecedented opportunity to eliminate HCV, a disease that affects the majority of PWID and causes 
substantial morbidity and mortality.(11)  With the introduction of new directly-acting antiviral (DAA) 
medications, nearly all patients with HCV can be cured with 2–3 months of oral medications with 
minimal side effects. Expanding HCV treatment to populations at risk can reduce incidence and 
prevalence over time(12) (a concept known as “treatment as prevention”) and as such, the World Health 
Organization has proposed an ambitious goal to eliminate HCV by 2030.(13) Unfortunately, there is a 
translational gap in the delivery of these medications to PWID. Prior studies, including our own, show 
that <10% of PWID have been successfully treated.(14-16) While models of HCV care integrated in 
addiction treatment have been successful,(17, 18) many PWID lack access. Moreover, there are still 
major gaps in access to naloxone and PrEP among PWID.(19-22) 
 
A community-pharmacy model has the potential to expand health services delivery and provide 
comprehensive, patient-centered care to PWID. For decades, pharmacists have been utilized in clinic 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_461242].(23, 24) Many successful 
specialty clinics that treat HCV currently depend heavily on the services of pharmacists. Pharmacists 
have extensive clinical training and highly developed expertise in pharmacotherapy, which makes them 
ideally suited for the management of HCV. Through the mechanism of Collaborative Drug Therapy 
Agreements (CDTAs), pharmacists are granted the authority to autonomously perform tasks related to 
medication management in collaboration with the practitioner through detailed protocols.(25) 
Restrictions on these designated services vary from state to state but can include all aspects of 
HepPSI Phase 2  Version  2.7 
STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  3 
 medication management from testing and counseling to prescribing and dispensing medication.(26) 
Kelley-Ross, our community-pharmacy partner, in 2012 successfully implemented a take-home naloxone 
program for persons at risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211](68) and more recently started a program for providing 
PrEP (“One-Step PrEP”),(27) which enables persons to receive all services (screening, counseling, 
prescribing, dispensing, and follow-up) at their pharmacy site.   
 
The HepPSI Study builds upon the existing Kelley-Ross PrEP clinic platform to offer a comprehensive 
package for HCV treatment that would also include access to naloxone and PrEP on-site, as well as 
linkages to low-threshold opi[INVESTIGATOR_461243]. During 
Phase [ADDRESS_589862] 
since been used to inform the development of the community-pharmacy program (One-Step Hep C 
Free) that will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_461244] [ADDRESS_589863] drugs (PWID) who screen 
positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with a reactive antibody test at community sites who are offered 
facilitated linkage to community-pharmacy program through patient navigators. Individuals who are 
eligible and enroll will complete a baseline survey to assess sociodemographics, substance use, HIV risk 
behaviors, and awareness of and interest in HCV treatment. After the survey, the participants will be 
linked to the community-pharmacy program, via the patient navigator, where treatment for HCV and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD), as well as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Naloxone and vaccinations, will 
be offered to participants. 
 
After 6 months, participants will complete a follow-up survey, which will include questions on: whether 
an evaluation for HCV occurred at the community pharmacy or elsewhere, whether HCV treatment was 
initiated since baseline visit and whether cure was achieved,  substance use, HIV risk behaviors, receipt of 
medications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], Naloxone and PrEP receipt, medication adherence, and information 
on injecting networks.  
 
[ADDRESS_589864] if on site. Six months after the 
initial Baseline Visit, participants will be contact[CONTACT_66179] a final Follow-up Survey.

3.3 RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES 
 
3.3.1 RECRUITMENT STRATEGY 
 
Subjects will be recruited though (1) syringe services programs (including the Downtown Needle 
Exchange at Robert Clewis Center) (2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_461245] (including 
Evergreen Treatment Services) (3) community-based agencies that serve persons who inject drugs living 
with HCV (including the Hepatitis Education Project), and (4) low-income housing sites/homeless 
shelters. We will also recruit participants from the Phase [ADDRESS_589867] permission to be 
contact[CONTACT_461257]. 
 
The uncertainty of the COVID-19 response’s impact has led us to develop multiple recruitment plans: 
1. Research staff may receive referrals to the study from personnel who interact with 
potential subjects at these sites.  
2. Potential participants may self-refer to the study by [CONTACT_461258]. 
3. If research staff are able to go to sites listed above for recruitment, they will approach 
potential subjects directly.  
 
We will primarily rely on staff at the community sites listed above to make referrals to study staff 
members and will keep signage and flyers on-site at these locations with our recruitment times at a 
given site. When appropriate, we may directly approach potential participants at these sites. Prior to 
conducting eligibility screening visits in person at these agencies, staff will identify a physical space at a 
given agency that will allow staff to maintain confidentiality. 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_589868] the participant’s contact [CONTACT_3031] (HepPSI

2. Refer interested participants to other resources (including linkages to existing “low-threshold” 
programs that offer OUD medications in close proximity) 
3.[ADDRESS_589872] (HEP) is an advocacy group that provides numerous services for persons 
with HCV, including medical case management, Hepatitis B and C screening, a syringe access program, 
and more. Participants will be recruited from the various community sites where the Hepatitis Education 
Project currently offers HCV screening. This includes local syringe exchange programs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_305090], homeless and urban drop-in shelters, low income housing units, and the main HEP office near 
downtown Seattle*. 
 
HepPSI Phase 2  Version  2.7 
STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  7 
 Community Pharmacists will be onsite at the main HEP office during their syringe service program hours 
(Thursdays 1-5pm, as of 11/05/2020).  
*11/05/2020 – as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, HEP has limited their outreach services and 
general operations. Their syringe service program will be located outdoors in a lot adjacent to the main 
HEP office. 
3.4.2 EVERGREEN TREATMENT SERVICES/ DOWNTOWN EMERGENCY SERVICE CENTER 
Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_461246]. Study recruitment will be focused at the Seattle Clinic site where ETS patient 
attend medical provider appointments, counseling services, and receive their medications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428] (MOUD). ETS medical providers and counselors can refer their patients for HCV treatment to 
the Community Pharmacists and Patient Navigator when both are located at the ETS Seattle Clinic one 
morning a week, or directly to the Kelley-Ross pharmacy/HEP locations. Community Pharmacists and 
Patient Navigator will be onsite at the Seattle Clinic on Thursdays mornings 9am-12pm, as of 
03/04/2021. 
Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) provides supportive housing, case management, substance 
use disorder treatment, and medical services at 12 locations throughout Seattle and several other 
adjacent cities. DESC providers at several locations are able to refer clients interested to HCV care to the 
Community Pharmacists for treatment. However, given the limited space available at DESC locations, 
DESC clients who are interested in participating in the study would need to travel to HEP so that 
research staff could screen for eligibility and complete consent procedures. 
4 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
 
4.1 SCREENING 
 
Staff at community sites will be educated about the study and asked to refer interested individuals who 
may be eligible. If research staff are onsite, community site staff will “hand off” potential participants to 
speak with research staff directly. Otherwise, interested individuals will be referred or self-refer to 
research staff via phone or email.  Once connected to interested individuals, the trained research staff 
will explain the study and screen them in a private space on site or over the phone (See IRB-approved 
Screening Script, Appendix 8.2). Each screened subject will receive a unique screening ID (YXXX) that will 
be documented in a protected spreadsheet, along with the results of the screening encounter. 
4.1.[ADDRESS_589873] is uninterested in participating, the 
HepPSI Phase 2  Version  2.7 
STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_589874]’s date of 
birth, basic demographic information, any major comorbidities that would preclude treatment through 
the community-pharmacy program, and other items related to determining whether the subject meets 
inclusion criteria. The screener form is coded in REDCap to automatically notify the assessor on whether 
the subject is eligible or ineligible to participate in the study.  
No personal identifying information will be entered into the REDCap Phase [ADDRESS_589875] information for tracking 
purposes (See Retention Strategies). At the end of the enrollment process, participants will be assigned a unique 
Study ID (40XX). 
4.2.[ADDRESS_589876] any questions about 
the study procedure. As part of the informed consent, the research staff may assess the subjects’ 
understanding of the information presented during the consent process. This may include having the 
subject articulate their understanding of the study purpose, procedures, risks, etc. 
 
After reading through informed the consent form, subjects who agree to participate will sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
One copy will be sent home with the participant and the other will be stored in a locked cabinet with the 
research study team. This form should never be stored with participant study data.

 [IP_ADDRESS] HIPAA AUTHORIZATION AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION FORMS 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_589877] the study participant complete and sign two HIPAA Authorization Forms. One 
form will be given to the participant and the other will be stored in a locked filing cabinet with the 
research team. This form should never be stored with participant study data. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  RELEASE OF INFORMATION FORMS 
Participants will be asked to sign Release of Information (ROI) forms that allow study staff to disclose 
medical information relevant to the study. Medical information may include sexually transmitted 
disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Participant’s health records may also include sensitive information about behavioral or mental health 
services and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse 
Upon enrolling in the study, participants will sign two ROI forms permitting disclosure of medical information: one 
for Hepatitis Education Project, and one for Kelley-Ross Pharmacy. 
4.3 STUDY VISITS 
Participants will be enrolled and complete the baseline assessment at study start. Over the course of the 
study, two total assessments will be conducted: one at baseline visit (study start) and one at final visit 
(six months post-study start date). Study visits will take place in-person at Hepatitis Education Project or 
other community sites hosting HEP services. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, study staff are prepared to 
transition to remote visits if need be. After the baseline study visit, participants will receive a $30 
reimbursement, and then they will be linked to a HEP Patient Navigator who will facilitate their 
connection to the community pharmacy program. After the final study visit, participants will receive a 
$[ADDRESS_589878] participants during the assessments.

STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  10 
 The baseline survey will assess socio-demographics, substance use*, HIV risk behaviors*, and awareness 
of and interest in HCV treatment. After 6 months, participants will complete a follow-up (final) survey 
which will include information on: 
a) Whether an evaluation for HCV occurred at the community pharmacy or another site since the 
baseline visit 
b) Whether HCV treatment was initiated since baseline visit— assessed by [CONTACT_6270]-report and 
pharmacy/medical records for confirmation.  
c) For patients who report that they have not been treated for HCV, reasons why (co-morbid conditions 
interfering, competing priorities, lack of interest, spontaneous clearance, etc.). 
d) Substance use*—measured by [CONTACT_461261] (ASI)(28)  
e)  HIV Risk Behaviors*—measured by [CONTACT_461262] (RBS)(29, 30) 
f) Receipt of naloxone, PrEP, and medications for OUD: self-report, confirmed with review of pharmacy 
record of dispensation/refills. 
g) Medication satisfaction, tailored to direct-acting antiviral treatment 
h) Medication adherence— assessed by [CONTACT_461263][INVESTIGATOR_9696]-ups and also through self-report 
i) Injecting network (number of partners they have shared injected drugs with and, of those, how many 
they would be willing to refer to the site where they were treated) 
j) Completion of HCV Treatment – self-report and medical record chart review to assess if HCV treatment 
was fully completed. 
k) Sustain Virologic Response (SVR12) – Medical record review to assess obtainment of SVR12 results 
among participants who complete HCV treatment. For patients missing SVR12 results at the time of 6 
month follow-up (either due to not yet having reached [ADDRESS_589879]-treatment date or simply missing data), 
chart reviews will be conducted again up to 3 months after the 6 month follow-up.

5.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
 
5.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) 
 
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.   
 
5.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
5.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
Adequate review, assessment, and monitoring of adverse events require that they be classified as to 
severity, expectedness, and potential relatedness to the study intervention. Study protocols will include 
a description of how adverse events will be classified in these terms and the appropriate course of 
action. 
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT 
 
Classifications include the following:  
HepPSI Phase 2  Version  2.7 
STUDY00010476 10 May 2022 
 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  15 
  
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type causing no loss 
of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and 
symptoms are transient. 
 
Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may 
interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate 
experiences may cause some interference with functioning 
 
Severe:  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating 
 
Severity is not synonymous with seriousness. A severe rash is not likely to be an SAE.  
Likewise, a severe headache is not necessarily an SAE.  However, mild chest pain may result in a day’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129608]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION 
 
The site investigator assesses the potential event relationship to the study intervention and/or 
participation. A comprehensive scale in common use to categorize an event is: 
 
• Definitely Related:  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent/procedure – 
i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_461249]’s clinical state. 
• Possibly Related:  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
• Not Related:  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure. –  
i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is 
inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
 
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or unexpected, meaning not 
anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or 
label. Categories are: 
 
Unexpected - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information about the condition 
under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, product brochure, or investigator brochure. 
 
Expected - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  16 
  
5.3.4 ADVERSE EVENT (AND SAE) REPORTING  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have specific reporting procedures. AEs will be 
collected via REDCap. If REDCap is down, research staff should use the paper form Adverse Event 
Reporting Form (See Appendix 8.3) .  
All AEs are collected on an Adverse Event Form that includes the date of the event, what occurred, 
actions taken by [CONTACT_60551], planned follow up (if any) , whether the event appears to be related to 
the intervention, the seriousness of the event, and whether participant will continue in the study (see 
appendix). All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_33075] (e.g., 
from the time of study drug administration through the end of the study intervention period) are to be 
reported.  
 
Please note that the AE form contains a column to indicate whether the event is serious. Thus, SAEs are 
a subset of the reported AEs. 
 
All SAEs, unless otherwise specified in the protocol and approved by [CONTACT_461267] (as applicable), 
require expedited reporting by [CONTACT_079] [CONTACT_353276]'s safety monitoring bodies. Serious 
adverse events will be reported to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of research staff becoming aware of the 
event. SAEs that are unanticipated problems will be reported to the NIDA PO within 24 hours by [CONTACT_101434] a written follow up will be submitted within 2 days of the event.  
 
Any IRB action response will be reported to NIDA PO within 3 days of the receipt of notice of the action. 
5.4 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 
5.4.1 SAFETY OVERSIGHT 
 
Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. The 
Independent Safety Monitor will act in an advisory capacity to monitor participant safety, to evaluate 
the progress of the study, and  to review procedures for maintaining the data confidentiality, collection 
quality, management, and analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS] INDEPENDENT SAFETY MONITOR 
Jeanette Tetrault, MD – Professor at Yale University School of Medicine 
The Independent Safety Monitor will oversee the safety of the participants and the validity and integrity 
of the data. Responsibilities will include:

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017  17 
 • Evaluating the research protocols and plans for safety and data monitoring 
• Evaluating the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, 
participant recruitment, accrual and retention, performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can 
affect study outcome 
• Considering factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as 
scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the 
ethics or practicality of the trial 
• Reviewing study site performance, making recommendations and assisting in the resolution of 
problems reported by [CONTACT_15328] 
• Ensuring the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring 
[IP_ADDRESS] INDEPENDENT SAFETY MONITOR MEETINGS 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_461250]. At each meeting the ISM will review individual 
SAEs and cumulative AE reports. Following each meeting, the monitor will make recommendations on 
continuation, modification, or termination of the study. 
5.[ADDRESS_589886] up-to-date recommendations and 
protocols available. 
Kelley-Ross Pharmacy Program and HEP staff will operate under the COVID-19 safety protocols of their respective 
home agencies.  
6 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
This study will provide estimates of what proportion of HCV-infected PWID successfully link to and utilize the 
community-pharmacy model.  
The primary feasibility/acceptability outcome will be the proportion (and 95% confidence intervals) of participants 
who are evaluated for HCV treatment in the community-pharmacy program. Secondarily, we will evaluate HCV 
treatment outcomes (initiation, completion, and SVR12/cure), medication adherence, substance use, HIV risk

 behaviors, and receipt of other medications (naloxone, PrEP, and medications for OUD). Finally, we will assess 
treatment satisfaction and willingness to refer an injecting partner to the community pharmacy for treatment. 
Given our estimated sample size of 40 we can provide a range of estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the following hypothetical scenarios: Using binomial “exact” calculation to estimate CIs, if we assume 0.5 of the 
sample (i.e., 20/40 participants) achieves the outcome, the estimated 95% CI is 0.34 to 0.66. If 10/40 achieves the 
outcome (0.25), the estimated 95% CI is 0.13-0.41; if 30/40 achieves the outcome (0.75) the estimated 95% CI is 
0.59-0.87.

those that treat HCV. I am interested in asking you some questions to see if you may be eligible 
for this study. Would you like to be screened?  
 
 Yes  Continue with screening.  
 No  Thank individual for their time, end screening.  
 
Before we start, I want to provide you with more information about this eligibility survey. You 
will not be compensated for the answers you provide for this eligibility survey. Participation in 
the study is not required; it is entirely your choice to participate and saying yes right now does 
not mean you have to be in the study. This survey will take just a few minutes. The answers you 
provide will be assigned a unique ID and stored in our password protected computer. If you are 
eligible to participate in the study, I can explain more about the study. Is this okay with you?  
 
 Yes  Continue with screening.  
 No  Thank individual for their time, end screening.  
8.2.1 ELIGIBILITY SCRIPT 
Eligible – Thank you for your time. I’d like to briefly explain more about the study you are 
eligible for. Participants in this study will be linked to a community pharmacy program where 
they will be offered medications that (1) treat hepatitis C, (2) treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], (3) 
prevent overdose, and (4) prevent HIV infection. You may get other medications that you need 
through the pharmacy program, too. We are interested in whether this new method of offering 
hepatitis C medications through a community pharmacy program that is convenient and 
accessible for people who inject drugs, who are living with hepatitis C, in Seattle. We will have 
two study visits over six months. Upon completing the first visit, you will receive a $[ADDRESS_589892] honorarium, and for the second you will receive a $[ADDRESS_589893] honorarium.

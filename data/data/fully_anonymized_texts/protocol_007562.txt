 2.0 Protocol Synopsis  
Title:  The REFLECT Trial  
A Randomized Evaluation oF the TriGuard™ HDH Cerebral Embolic 
Protection  Device and the TriGUARD™ [ADDRESS_611190] of cerebral embolic LEsions after trans Catheter 
aortic valve implan Tation  
Study device:  The Keystone Heart TriGuard™ HDH Cer ebral Embolic Protection  Device  
(CEPD) and TriGUARD™ [ADDRESS_611191] HDH consists of a temporary, sterile, single use, biocompatible 
filter, introduced transfemorally through a 9F sheath to the aortic arch. Under 
fluoroscopic guidance, the device is positioned in the aortic arch to cover  all 
3 major cerebral arteries (innominate, left carotid, and subclavian arteries), 
and is held in position by [CONTACT_476756]. 
Once the device is in position, emboli and particulate matter are diverted 
away from the cereb ral circulation and downstream to the descending aorta, 
where they are either harmless or can be treated effectively.  
The TriGuard HDH has received CE Mark and was commercially available 
in Europe and Israel  during phase I. Use of the device at European and 
Israeli sites in the REFLECT study was in accordance with its market 
approved use.  
In the [LOCATION_002], the TriGuard HDH was for investigational use only. The 
device has received IDE approval for use in the REFLECT study  (Phase I) .  
TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611192] 3 CEPD filter includes a self -stabilizing frame 
design, a reduced pore size filter mesh,  and a redesigned delivery system  
intended for improved ease of use. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the device 
is positioned in the aortic arch to cover all major cerebral arteries (covering 
the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries), and is  held in 
position by [CONTACT_8121]’s circumferential pressure and the support of the nitinol 
shaft (external communicating device) in the aortic arch without the need for 
a stabilizer in the inominate artery . Once the device is in position, emboli and 
particu late matter are diverted away from the cerebral circulation and 
downstream to the descending aorta, where they are either harmless or can 
be treated effectively.  
The TriGUARD 3 device is for investigational use only.  
Objective:  To assess the safety and efficacy of the TriGuard HDH and TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611193] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.

 aortic valve implantation /replacement  (TAVI1), in comparison with a control 
group of patients undergoing unprotected TAVI.  
Study 
design2: This prospective, single -blind, three arm, randomized,  (2 device: 1 control),  
multicenter safety and efficacy trial is designed to enroll up to 603 total 
subjects in two consecutive phases: Phase I enrolled 258 subjects (including 
54 Roll -Ins) and utilized the TriGuard HDH and Phase II will enroll up to  345 
subjects (including 40-50 Roll- Ins) and will utilize the TriGUARD 3 (Figure 3b  
shows the patient flow/disposition).  
Phase I  
In phase I, a total of 204 evaluable subjects and 54 roll-in subjects were 
enrolled at 26 total investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] , Europe, and 
Israel , of which  20 sites  were  in the [LOCATION_002] . A minimum of 50% of 
subjects were planned to be enrolled at US sites , and no single site was 
permitted to enroll more  than 20% of all subjects . 
Subjects with indications for TAVI and who met study eligibility criteria were  
randomized 2:1 (stratified by [CONTACT_3885]) to one of two treatment arms:  
• Intervention (Phase 1 Cohort)  – TAVI with the Tri Guard HDH CEPD  
• Control  – standard unprotected TAVI  
At sites where the investigator did not have  prior experience with the 
TriGuard device (minimum of 2 prior cases) , up to [ADDRESS_611194] HDH device. These cases were  proctored by a Sponsor 
representative. Investigational sites with ≥[ADDRESS_611195]-
procedure (2-[ADDRESS_611196] -procedure) , and at 30 and 90 days.  
The initial randomized cohort expected  to enroll  up to 285 subjects.  
Note: Enrollment i n Phase I has been halted after enrolling a total of 258 
subjects (54 roll -ins and 204 randomized subjects including 63 controls)  
based on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee following a 
review of interim 30- day data on 90 subjects at the p respecified interim 
analysis time point . A next iteration device designed for increased efficacy, 
ease of use, and improved safety will be  tested in Phase II (below).  
                                            
 
[ADDRESS_611197] Version 10.0 intended to enroll up to 355 subjects and up to 90 roll -ins. Enrollment in this cohort 
(termed Phase I in this protocol version) was halted based on the recommmendation of the independent DSMB 
following interim data review at the prespecified interim analysis timepoint, as well as availability of the 
redesigned TriGuard [ADDRESS_611198] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
11 
 Phase II  
In Phase II, up to 295 randomized subjects and 40-50 roll-in subjects will be 
enrolled at up to 25 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  (inclusive of sites enrolling 
subjects in Phase I) . No single site will be permitted to enroll more than 20% 
of all randomized subjects  in Phase II . 
Subjects with indications for TAVI and who meet study eligibi lity criteria will 
be randomized 2:1 (stratified by [CONTACT_3885]) to one of two treatment arms:  
• Intervention – TAVI with the TriGUARD 3 CEPD  
• Control  – standard unprotected TAVI . 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_476754]  (Medtronic vs. 
Edwards) . 
No single valve type will be implanted in more than approximately  70% of 
randomized patients (phase II).  
Roll-in subjects  (a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 Roll -ins per -site) will 
not be randomized, but will undergo TAVI with the TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611199] -procedure, and undergo 
neurologic (NIHSS)  testing pre -procedure, post -procedure  (2-[ADDRESS_611200] -
procedure) , and at [ADDRESS_611201] 
50% of the initial randomized cohort (approximately 112 subjects) have 
reached the 30 day primary efficacy endpoint  evaluation time point , a sample 
size reestimation will be performed in case the conditional power of the trial 
(assessed by [CONTACT_476757]) is > 40% but <80%, subject to 
approval by [CONTACT_1034].  If this analysis determines that more than [ADDRESS_611202] limit for the study has been reached 
(whichever occurs first).  
Primary 
safety endpoint:  Combined safety endpoint (modified VARC 2 defined
1) at 30 days, defin ed 
as a composite of death, stroke, life- threatening or disabling bleeding, acute 
kidney injury (stage 2 or 3), coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, 
major vascular complication, and valve- related dysfunction requiring repeat 
procedure.  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
(Phase II):  
 Hierarchical composite efficacy endpoint , determined by [CONTACT_371826] -wise 
comparisons among all subjects according to the following pre- specified 
hierarchy of adverse outcomes:  
• All-cause mortality and/or any stroke (fatal and non- fatal, disabling or 
non-disabling) [evaluated at 30 days]

• Total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611205] B wins (score +1) 
and Subject A loses (score -1). If both subjects die or have a stroke, the 
patient with the later event will be the winner. If both have death/stroke on 
same day it is equilibrium (score 0). If both subjects are alive and have a 
stroke on the same day, the comparison moves to the next tier of th e 
hierarchy (NIHSS worsening). If both subjects survive free of stroke to [ADDRESS_611206], and outcomes between treatment groups are then compared.

SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
Hypothesis -driven Secondary Endpoints  (Phase II)  
For the following secondary endpoints, a test for superiority of each  
intervention group to the control group will be performed. To address the 
issue of multiple tests among these secondary endpoints, sequential testing  
is pla nned. Secondary endpoints will be formally tested if and only if the 
primary study hypotheses are confirmed. The secondary endpoints will be 
tested individually, in the order in which they are listed as follows:  
• All stroke [evaluated at 7 days in the e ITT population] 
• NIHSS worsening, defined as any NIHSS score increase from 
baseline  [evaluated at [ADDRESS_611207]-procedure in the efficacy 
Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population] . A sensitivity analysis will 
further compare >2 points NIHSS worsening [evaluated at 2-[ADDRESS_611208]-procedure in the efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis 
population]  
• Composite of all -cause mortality and all stroke [evaluated at 7 
days in the eITT population] 
• CNS Infarction  (NeuroARC defined) [evaluated at 30 days in the eITT 
analysis population]  
• Total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348]-MRI, 
[evaluated [ADDRESS_611209] -procedure in the efficacy Intention to Treat 
(eITT) analysis population]  
The above endpoints will be tested by [CONTACT_476759]- specified sequence, until the 
first non -significant difference is found between the two treatment groups. 
After that, other treatment comparisons will be examined in an exploratory 
manner.  
Phase I: Hierarchical composite efficacy endpoint , determined by [CONTACT_371826] -
wise comparisons among all subjects according to the following pre- specified 
hierarchy of adverse outcomes:

Analysis 
Plan:  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Primary Safety Endpoint Analysis 
(Phase I and II3 reported individually)  
The primary safety hypothesis is that the rate of the VARC 2 Combined 
Safety Endpoint (defined as the composite of death, stroke, life -threatening 
or disabling bleeding, AKI [Stage 2/3 ], coronary artery obstruction requiring 
intervention, major vascular complication, and valve- related dysfunction 
requiring repeat procedure) at 30 days in the group undergoing TAVI with 
either protection device system (Intervention groups) is significantl y less in 
each device group (TriGuard HDH and TriGUARD 3) compared separately 
to the Performance Goal (PG) . 
The PG has been determined based on published literature reporting the 
VARC -2 combined safety endpoint in patients undergoing TAVI with 
Medtronic or  Edwards Valves. Based on an expected event rate of 25% and 
a relative non- inferiority delta of 37.5% (absolute delta 9.4%), the PG will be 
set at 34.4% (25% + 9.4%). A sample size of 179 evaluable subjects in the 
intervention group will provide 85% power to demonstrate that the 
intervention group event rate is significantly less than the PG at the 
alpha=0.05 level. After accounting for a potential 5% loss to clinical follow -
up at 30 days (including subjects who do not meet As Treated population 
criteria), the total required intervention group sample size is [ADDRESS_611231] 3 
and 40-5 0 roll -ins will constitute the primary safety population.  
The primary analysis population for the primary s afety endpoint will be the 
As Treated ( AT) population. The AT population is defined by [CONTACT_389108], regardless of the assigned treatment. In the AT population,  
subjects  in whom vascular access in the contralateral femoral artery has 
been established for the intended deployment of the TriGuard HDH or 
TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611232] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
21 
 in whom the TAVI procedure is initiated (but no vascular access for intended 
deployment of the TriGuard HDH or TriGU ARD 3  is established ) will be 
assigned to the Control group.  As a secondary analysis, the primary safety 
endpoint will be evaluated in the Intention To Treat (ITT) population of 
evaluable subjects (Roll -In patients are excluded).  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Analysis  
Phase II:  
The primary efficacy hypothesis is that TAVI with the TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611233] (unprotected) TAVI for the primary hierarchical 
composite efficacy endpoint  of all -cause mortality or any stroke at 30 days  
(Tier 1), NIHSS worsening 2-[ADDRESS_611234]-procedure (Tier 2) , freedom from 
any cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]- weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611235] -procedure (Tier 3), and total 
volume of post-procedure cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI 
(Tier 4). In tier 1 death/ stroke will be analyzed as time to event by [CONTACT_46062].   
Each subject in the intervention group of phase II  will be compared with every 
control subject (from phases I and II)  based on the pre- specified hierarchy of 
advers e outcomes  according to the Finkelstein -Schoenfeld method.[ADDRESS_611236] B wins (score +1) and Subject A loses (score -1). If both 
subjects die or have a stroke  on the same day , it is equilibrium (score 0 , 
otherwise the patient with the later (by [CONTACT_2669] a day) death/stroke will be the 
winner. If both patients had a stroke on the same day the comparison will 
move to the next tier of the hierarchy.   
If neithe r subject experiences a Tier [ADDRESS_611237]  HDH vs. unprotected TAVI8 and the r ecent SENTINEL9 trial we 
assume the following hierarchical event rates:  
Assumed Event Rates Phase II  
  Assumed 
Control Rates  Assumed 
TriGUARD 3 Rates  
Death or Stroke 11% 6% 
Worsening NIHSS  9% 6% 
Freedom from MRI Findings  
(Lesion Volume 0  mm3) 11% 27% 
Lesion Volume  (mm3)   
>0-50 7% 19% 
>50-150 33% 7.5%  
> 150  48% 46% 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
22 
 15% Missing in MRI Follow -up and 5% missing for all other parameters  
Type I Error = 5%    
Among subjects who reach third tier of the comparison hierarchy, we assume 
a 15% loss to DW -MRI follow -up (due to contraindications to post -procedure 
DW-MRI [e.g., pacemaker implantation] or subject non- compliance).  
Given these assumptions, the initial randomized cohort  sample size of 225 
subjects (2:1 randomization with 150  Intervention and 75 new control 
patients) will provide a power of >80% to demonstrate superiority ( 1-sided 
α=0.025 ) of the intervention group over the control  group for the primary 
efficac y endpoint. Notably, i n several simulations, considering different 
distributions for lesion volume and different distributions for death/ stroke, the 
study power remained greater than 80%. Adding  the [ADDRESS_611238] 92% to demonstrate superiority of the primary 
efficacy endpoint; poolability of the Phase I and Phase II control subject s will 
be assessed at the time of the primary analysis and the results will determine 
the control population used for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint . 5% loss to clinical follow  up at 30 days is included.   
As a primary efficacy analysis, the primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated 
in the effi cacy Intention to Treat (eITT) population. The eITT population is 
defined as:  
• Subjects who are enrolled in the trial and randomized to a treatment 
group, regardless of treatment actually received AND  
• Who do not have conversion to surgery or prolonged cardiac arrest 
(>3 minutes) prior to the post -procedure DW -MRI 
Selection of the eITT population as the primary analysis population for the 
primary efficacy endpoint ensures that, should a small number of subjects 
experience an adverse event due to circumstances  unrelated to procedural 
neuroprotection (i.e., c onversion to surgery or prolonged cardiac arrest prior 
to the post -procedure DW -MRI) , the study will remain powered to detect a 
clinically -meaningful treatment effect, particularly regarding the volume of 
subclinical cerebral ischemic lesions on DW -MRI.  
If the primary endpoint is met in the primary (eITT) analysis population, 
sequential testing of the primary efficacy hypothesis will be conducted in the 
Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis population of evaluabl e subjects (Roll -In 
patients are excluded). As a secondary analysis, the primary efficacy 
endpoint and its components will be evaluated in the Intention To Treat (ITT) 
analysis population of evaluable subjects (Roll -In patients are excluded). The 
ITT popul ation is defined as all subjects who are enrolled the study, by 
[CONTACT_220261], regardless of the treatment actually received.  An 
additional analysis will also be performed in the Per Treatment (PT) 
Population.  
The PT population is defined as subjects in the Intervention group in whom 
device positioning is maintained until final procedure with complete cerebral 
coverage, and all Control group subjects.  An additional analysis of the 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
23 
 primary efficacy endpoint with adjustment for pre -existing cerebral lesi on 
volume will also be performed in the primary eITT analysis population.  
Secondary Endpoints Analysis  (Phase I)  
The efficacy hypothesis for phase I was that TAVI with the TriGuard HDH 
system is superior to standard (unprotected) TAVI for the phase I hierarchical 
composite efficacy endpoint of all -cause mortality or any stroke at 30 days 
(Tier 1), NIHSS worsening  2-[ADDRESS_611239]-procedure or MoCA worsening at 
30 days (Tier 2), and total volume of post -procedure cerebral ischemic 
lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI (Ti er 3).  
Each subject in the intervention group was to be compared with every subject 
from the control group based on the pre- specified hierarchy of adverse 
outcomes according to the Finkelstein- Schoenfeld method2. For example, if 
Subject A dies or has stroke and Subject B survives free of stroke to [ADDRESS_611240] B wins (score +1) and Subject A loses (score -1). If both subjects die 
or have a stroke, it is equ ilibrium (score 0). If neither subject experiences a 
Tier [ADDRESS_611241], th en outcomes 
between treatment (TriGuard HDH and control ) groups were to be compared 
by [CONTACT_346899]- Whitney test.  
Based on published clinical data from randomized controlled trials of subjects 
undergoing TAVI  as well as data from the DEFLECT III randomized tri al of 
TriGuard vs. unprotected TAVI, we assumed the following hierarchical event 
rates:  
Event  Intervention  Control  
Death or stroke  7% 8% 
NIHSS or MoCA worsening  10% 15% 
Total Lesion Volume  70 mm3 100 mm3 
In addition, among subjects who reach Tier 3 of  the comparison hierarchy, 
we assume a 20%  loss to DW -MRI follow -up (due to contraindications to 
post-procedure DW -MRI [e.g., pacemaker implantation] or subject non-
compliance).  
Given these assumptions, a sample size of 270 evaluable subjects (180 
Intervention and 90 Control) would provide >90%  power to demonstrate 
superiority (2- sided α=0.049) of the Intervention group to the Control group 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. Therefore, the total sample size of  the initial 
randomized cohort of  285 subjects ( 190 Intervention and 95 Control) will 
provide sufficient power to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint, even in 
the event that up to 5% of trial subjects do not meet criteria for inclusion in 
the primary efficacy analysis population**  
** Enrollment in th is cohort (termed Phase I in this protocol version) was 
halted after 204 subjects were randomized and 54 roll -ins were enrolled).

primary and secondary endpoints in the pooled population of Roll -In Subjects 
plus Evaluable Subjects.  
Analysis Timing and Adjustment  
Interim Analysis  (Phase I only)  
The assumptions for powering the primary efficacy endpoint were  based on 
neurologic, cognitive, and imaging data from a limited number of subjects in 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611242] III Trial.  Due to uncertainty regarding the primary efficacy 
endpoint, an unblinded interim analysis was planned to be conducted to re-
evaluate the sample size required to demonstrate superiority of the 
Intervention group to the Control group.  
The unblinded interim analysis was to  be conducted when 90 subjects total 
(approximately [ADDRESS_611243] s) who meet the eITT population definition have completed the [ADDRESS_611244] 
been re-calculated, if necessary, to ensure 80% conditional power to 
demonstrate superiority (overall 2- sided α= 0.05) of the Intervention group to 
the control group for the primary efficacy endpoint, taking into account the 
interim unblinded results, according to the eITT population definition (there 
was to  be no imputation of missing data in this interim analysis; i.e., missing 
data will be excluded). The conditional power and sample size re- calculation 
for the final analysis was planned to be ascertained by [CONTACT_476771], DeMets and Lan.[ADDRESS_611245] by 
[CONTACT_2054], conditioned on the distribution of the observed interim 
data. If the conditional power was found to be 50% - 80% (the “promising 
zone” according to Chen, DeMets and Lan), the plan was to use simulations 
to ascertain the increase in sample size that is required to yield 80% 
conditional power for the Mann -Whitney  test. If the interim analysis 
determined that more than [ADDRESS_611246] limit 
for the study has been reached (whichever occur ed first).  If the conditional 
power was found to be  <50% or >80%, the study would have proceeded  as 
is without a sample size adjustment  (i.e., only the initial randomized cohort 
of [ADDRESS_611247] been enrolled) .  
There was no intention to stop the study for overwhelming efficacy at the 
interim analysis. However, as a precautionary measure and to be 
conservative (due to the presence of an unblinded interim analysis), the 
O’Brien Fleming alpha spending method was to be used to calculate an alpha 
penalty for the final analysis regardless of whether a sample size increase is 
needed (final analysis two- sided alpha = 0.049).  
Note: Enrollment in Phase I (TriGuard HDH CEPD ) has been halted after 
enrolling a total of 258 subjects (54 roll -ins and 204 randomized subjects 
including 63 controls)  based on a recommendation of the DSMB following 
data review at the prespecified interm analysis time point . A next iteration  
device (TriGUARD 3) designed for incr eased efficacy, ease of use, and 
improved safety will be tested in Phase II.  
Adaptive Design (Phase II)  
Once at least 50% of the Phase II cohort has been enrolled and has reached 
the 30 day primary efficacy endpoint  evaluation time point, the independent 
unblinded statistician will perform a conditional power analysis. If the trial, 
based on the results at that point is either ≤ 40% powered to achieve success 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
27 
 in meeting the primary endpoint or is ≥80% powered to achieve the primary 
endpoint , no sample size reestimation will be required. If the conditional 
power of the study is >40% but <80% the independent unblinded statistician 
will recommend a sample size reestimation, subject to approval by [CONTACT_429].  
Promising zone computation  
After the trial has enrolled 50% of the originally planned sample size of the 
initial randomized cohort  (approximately 112 subjects ), an independent 
statistician will estimate all 4 levels of the Finkelstein -Schoenfeld hierarchy 
for device and control, and use these estimates to re-calculate the trial’s 
power given the originally planned 225 Phase II patients.   
If the trial power is between >40% and <80%, the trial will be considered 
promising and the trial will readjust the sample size to attain 80% power. If 
on the other hand t he power falls to ≤ 40% or to ≥ 80%, the sample size will 
not be adjusted.  
Conditional power computation  
The conditional power will estimate all four Finkelstein- Schoenfeld levels and 
use these estimates to simulate future enrolled patients. The power 
simulation will fol low exactly the same algorithm as used to power the original 
Phase II study with updated estimates of effect size.  
Alpha spending and controlling type I error  
Since the study leadership and sponsor do not conduct any formal statistical 
hypothesis  test, this design will not incur any alpha penalty or affect the 
overall type I error. As detailed by [CONTACT_91558]11 and based on the 
work of Chen10 as long as the sample size reestimation occurs only when  
the conditional power falls in the promising zone, no additional alpha spend 
is required and the overall type I error is preserved.

 4.0 Introduction  
4.1 Background  
4.1.1  Periprocedural Stroke  
Stroke is a dreaded complication of endovascular procedures due to its association with an 
extreme morbidity and mortality burden.12, 13 Periprocedural stroke rates increase with the 
complexi ty of cardiac surgery, ranging from 1-5% for coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] 
(CABG) or isolated aortic valve replacement to as high as 7.4% for combined CABG and valve surgery and 9.7% for multiple valve surgery.
14 Periprocedural stroke during catheter -
based cardiovascular procedures is also a major concern. While stroke after left heart catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is rare (<0.5%),
15 it is associated 
with significant morbidity and an in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_476702] 25% to 30%.16, 17 
Cerebral microembolism is the primary mechanism of periprocedural stroke during catheter -
based interventions, and is primarily caused by [CONTACT_476773].18 In particular, retrograde catheterization with 
crossing of the aortic valve has been associated with focal diffusion- imaging abnormalities 
suggesting cerebral embolic events in 22% of patients, in addition to a 3% rate of clinical neurological deficits.
19  
Given the frequency and dire implications of periprocedural stroke, methods to reduce cerebral embolism during cardiac interventions are sorely needed.  
4.1.2  Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Cerebral  Injury  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  TAVI and Periprocedural Stroke  
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an important alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) for high -risk and moderate -risk patients with aortic 
stenosis, offering overall less morbidity, similar mortality and significantly reduced recovery 
time.
4, 20-22 However, periprocedural neurological injury remains an important limitation of 
TAVI. In high -risk surgical candidates in the randomized PARTNER trial, TAV I was 
associated with an approximately two- fold increased risk of stroke or TIA (5.5% vs. 2.4%, 
p=0.04) compared with SAVR at 30 day s.4 In inoperable subjects, stroke or TIA occurred in 
6.7% of TAVI patients at 30 days, with 5.0% of subjects suffering a major stroke.5 A meta-
analysis of 10,037 published TAVI patients found an overall 30- day stroke rate of 3.3±1.8%, 
with the majority being major strokes (2.9±1.8%).23 In this study, stroke was associated with 
a more than 3.5- fold increase in 30- day mortality (25.5±21.9% vs. 6.9±4.2%).  
In the more recent PARTNER 2 trial, the rates of any stroke in moderate risk patients with AS after TAVI were similar to the rates after SAVR: 5.5% vs. 6.1% at 30 days and as high as 9.5% vs. 8.9% at [ADDRESS_611263] phase (within 2 days of the procedure) is primarily procedure -
related (TAV I versus SAVR).24 More than 50% of strokes in TAV I patients occur during this 
early phase. During a later constant hazard phase ([ADDRESS_611264]-procedure), pati ent 
factors including generalized heavy atherosclerotic burden, recent cerebral ischemic event, and higher NYHA class appear to be the primary determinants of risk.  
As during other types of cardiac procedures, periprocedural stroke during TAVI is generally  
ischemic and embolic.

y for TAVI, make dislodgement  of aortic debris more likely .26 Second, disruption of 
aortic valvular and annular calcification during TAV I is an additional source of embolic 
material; procedural transcranial Doppler monitoring indicates that the valve itself is the 
primary source of cerebral emboli following TAV I, and that most emboli are c omposed of 
debris dislodged during direct manipulation of the calcified aortic valve and crushing of the 
leaflets and aortic annulus during implantation.[ADDRESS_611266] on clinical and 
neurocognitive outcomes.  
Diffusion -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW -MRI) is a highly sensitive and specific 
technique to visualize acute ischemia.[ADDRESS_611267] cerebral infarcts, 
particularly small lesions, compared with computed tomography (CT) due to stronger field magnets, thinner slices, and different pulse sequences.
32 DW-MRI has an average sensitivity 
of 94% and specificity of 97% in detecting stroke in humans.33 It has been used extensively 
as a surrogate for cerebral embolization after catheter -based and surgical cardiovascular 
interventions.31, 34 In addition, standardized endpoint definitions  for TAVI trials (VARC -2)  
include MRI or computed tomographic  neuroimaging as an important  supplement to the 
clinical diagnosis of stroke and TIA, as well as a requisite for diagnosing stroke in patients with non- focal global encephalopathy.
35  
Several small  studies (Tables 1 -4) have reported DW -MRI data after unprotected TAVI. Foci 
of restricted cerebral perfusion on DW-MRI (cerebral ischemic  lesions) are present in 
approximately 77% of patients (reported range 58% to 93%) after TAVI (Table 1). Most 
patients have multiple lesions (mean 4.6) ( Table 2) , distributed bilaterally in a pattern 
suggesting cerebral embolization. Several studies have reported the volume of single (Table 3) and total per -patient (Tables 4 and 5) lesion volumes after TAVI, with wide variance
between studies; the relative degree to which this variation is attributable to methodological 
and patient -level differences in the extent of affected cerebral tissue is unclear .

The clinical significance of asymptomatic DW-MRI lesions is incompletely characterized. 
However, in  population -based studies  the presence of clinically silent brain infarcts has bee n 
associated with frailty, declines in physical function, reduced cognitive ability, depressive 
symptoms, and an increased risk of subsequent stroke  or TIA .32, 45, [ADDRESS_611270] -procedural ischemic lesions  and risk of future neurological events36, 50, 51 or 
measurable impairments of neurocognitive function (using the Mini Mental State Examination).
20, 40, 43, [ADDRESS_611271] been exploratory (not 
powered to detect clinically meaningful neurocognitive changes) and lack long term follow -
up. Furthermore, while routine clinical examination can reliably detect focal neurological abnormalities and deficits, more subtle evidence of global neurological dysfunction such as cognitive decline, memory and mood disturbances, reduction of psychomotor speed, and personality changes require specific testing for diagnosis and may be missed. The MMSE, 
the most frequently used cognitive test in these studies, is relatively insensitive to mild cognitive impairment and declines in non- memory domains .

4.1.[ADDRESS_611273] prompted investigation into methods to minimize or prevent periprocedural cerebral 
embolism during cardiac surgery and endovascular interventions.  Because atheromatous 
and calcific embolic are substantial contributors to cerebral embolism  during TAVI, a 
mechanical means of preventing such material from reaching the cerebral circulation could 
be an effective approach. Because approximately 50% of TAV I-related neurological events 
are directly procedure- related,[ADDRESS_611274] I Trial (NCT01448 421) of the  first-generation TriGuard cerebral embolic 
protection device (CEPD)  (from which the TriGuard HDH  device and the TriGUARD 3  device  
used in the present study were  developed) demonstrated good procedural success and 
safety, as well as a reduction in total per -patient cerebral ischemic lesion volume after TAVI 
with embolic protection compared with a historical control of unprotected TAVI.[ADDRESS_611275] -TAVI DW-MRI Lesion Data for TAVI Without vs. With Embolic

Thus far, several randomized control trials have addressed the issue of embolic protection 
device during TAVI.  
The DEFLECT  III trial8 included [ADDRESS_611276] HDH 
device. Complete cerebral vessel coverage was achieved in 89% of subjects. Device use was associated with greater freedom from ischemic brain lesions  and a shift towards smaller 
lesion volumes compared to controls.  Clinically, device protection afforded better 
neurocognitive function and numerically lower rates of death and stroke.  
The EMBOL -X trial
72 included 30 patients , with half of the patients randomized to protection 
with the EMBOL -X device (self -expandable mesh placed in the aorta). Protected patients had 
fewer lesions and the authors  reported statistically significant smaller lesion  volumes in the 
supply region of the MCA.  No mortality was observed in this trial in both groups.  
Mistral - C73 included 55 patients with 1:1 randomization to protection with the SENTINEL 
device (2 cone shaped filters placed into the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common 
carotid artery). Patients with SENTINEL protection had numerically fewer lesions and a 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
38 
 smaller total lesion vol ume.  Neurocognitive deterioration was present in 4% of patients with 
device protection and 27% of patients without (p=0.017). Mortality was also reduced in the 
device arm (not statistically significant).  
CLEAN -TAVI74 published in 2016 included 100 patients  with 50 patients randomized to 
device protection with Claret (2 cone shaped filters described above). The trial showed a 
statistically significant reduction in the number of lesions and total lesion volume in the device arm. Stroke rates were similar between groups and one death occurred in the control group.  
Finally, the  recently published SENTIN EL trial
9 included 119 controls and 242 device patients 
(including 123 safety patients). Patients in the device arm had smaller lesion volumes and a lower number of lesions.  Stroke rates were reduced in the device arm but no differ ence was

4.3 Device Description  
The following is a summary description of the Investigational Devices. For additional information, please refer to the Instructions for Use.  
4.3.1  Devices Summary  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_611280] HDH CEPD  (Figure 1) is a temporary, sterile, single use, 
biocompatible filter, introduced transfemorally through a 9F sheath to the aortic arch. Under 
fluoroscopic guidance, the device is positioned in the aortic arch to cover all 3 major cerebral arteries (innominate, left carotid, and subclavian arteries), and is held in position by [CONTACT_476775]  (Figure 2). Once the device is in position, emboli 
and particulate matter are diverted away from the cerebral circulation and downstream to the descending aorta, where they are either harmless or can be treated effectively.   
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611281] HDH CEPD  is available in a single size, and is composed of a structural nitinol 
frame, lower stabilizer legs that push it towards the upper wall of the aortic arch, an upper 
stabilizer that protrudes into the innominate artery ostium, and a nitinol mesh . The frame 
includes 4 radiopaque markers to increase CEPD  visualization under fluoroscopy, and ends 
in a 60 mm tail c omprised of braided nitinol wires with a Duraskin™ -coated coil on top of it. 
A connector with 180° of rotational freedom connects the CEPD  frame to the delivery tether.  
The CEPD  filter consists of a thin and durable nitinol mesh (nominal pore size 130 X 2 50 µm) 
attached to the frame, allowing maximal blood flow while diverting clinically significant emboli 
toward the descending aorta. The CEPD  is heparin coated to reduce thrombogenicity and 
increase lubricity. The chemical and physical properties of this immobilized, biocompatible, hydrophilic, ultrathin polymeric coating reduce the likelihood of blood component adherence and activation, reducing the formation of thrombi or emboli.  
The CEPD filter  unit is connected to a delivery tether  that serves for pushi ng, maintaining and 
retrieving  the filter from the aortic arch. In addition to the filter, the TriGuard System includes 
a delivery subsystem for crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_476703] -available 7F and

 9F sheaths  (please refer to the TriGuard HDH  Instructions for Use for a listing of compatible 
introducer sheaths) .  
Device deployment is accomplished by [CONTACT_094]- loading (crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) the CEPD  through the 
dedicated crimper into the distal end of a commercially -available 7F sheath delivery system. 
Under fluoroscopy, the 7F  sheath is pushed via a commercially -available 9F sheath delivery 
system, already inserted through a femoral artery access site. The device is then de-
sheathed into the 9F introducer and the 7F introducer is removed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_611282] 3 CEPD  (Figures 1a , 1b and 2a) is a temporary, retrievable,  
sterile, single use, biocompatible filter, introduced transfemorally through an 8F sheath to the aortic arch. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the device is positioned in the aortic arch (Figure 
2a) to cover all 3 major cerebral arteries (covering the innominate, left carotid, and left 
subclavian arteries), and is held in position by [CONTACT_8121]’s circumferential pressure and the 
support of the nitinol shaft (external communicating device) in the aortic arch. Once the device is in position, emboli and particulate matter are diverted away from the cerebral circulation and downstream to the descending aorta, where they are either harmless or can be treated effectively . 
The TriGUARD 3 CEPD  is available in a single size, and is composed of a structural nitinol 
frame that push es it towards the upper wall of the aortic arch, and a Polymer  mesh. The 
frame is radiopaque to increase device visualization under fluoroscopy. A nitinol connector 
connects the device frame to the delivery system . 
The CEPD  filter consists of a thin and durable Polymer  mesh (nominal pore size 115 X 145 
µm) attached to the frame, allowing maximal blood flow while diverting clinically significant emboli toward the descending aorta. The filter is heparin coated to reduce thrombogenicity 
and increase lubricity. The chemical and physical properties of this immobilized, biocompatible, hydrophilic, ultrathin polymeric coating reduce the likelihood of blood component adherence and activation, reducing the formation of thrombi or emboli.  
The CEPD filter  unit is connected to a delivery system  that serves for pushing, maintaining 
and retrieving  the filter from the aortic arch. In addition to the filter, the TriG UARD 3 System 
includes a delivery subsystem for crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_476704] a commercially 
available 8F braided sheath.  
Device deployment is accomplished by [CONTACT_094]- loading (crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) the CEPD  through the 
dedicated crimper into the distal end of the [ADDRESS_611283] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.

[ADDRESS_611288] 3 are expected to improve device safety, 
effectiveness,  performance, and ease of use (Table 6d) and will be tested in Phase II .  
In comparison with TriGuard HDH  system , the TriGUARD 3 system includes the following 
design changes : 
• A simplified self -positioning, self-stabilizing frame design that utilizes circumferential 
pressure and the support of the nitinol delivery shaft  to improve vessel wall apposition 
and eliminate the need for dedicated stabilizer elements in the innominate artery and 
aortic arch, improving device safety, particle deflection efficacy, and ease of deployment and positioning. In addition, the revised device design permits the use of cerebral protection in a broader anatomic subset of patients because it is not limited by [CONTACT_476776], atheroma, or tortuosity in the innominate artery.  
• R educed filter mesh pore size ( 115 × 145 µm vs. 130 × 250 µm) for deflection of 
smaller particles, achieved via a different mesh material ( Polymer vs. nitinol);  
• An increased filter area of 68.3 cm
2 vs. 20.9 cm2. 
• A frame that is fully visible via fluoroscop y (eliminating the need for radiopaque marker 
bands) for improved monitoring during deployment and positioning; and  
• A refined delivery subsystem that reduces the delivery profile (8 F vs. 9 F ) expected 
to improve safety, reduce the number of procedural steps required for deployment, 
and allow over-the-wire introduction and positioning for better ease of use.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint of the study is combined s afety at 30 days, defined according 
to modified VARC -2 1 (“TAVI early safety”) as the composite of:  
• All-cause mortality  
• All stroke (disabling and non- disabling)  
• Life-threatening or disabling bleeding  
• Acute kidney injury – Stage 2 or 3 (including renal replacement therapy)  
• Coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention

48 
 • Major vascular complication  
• Valve -related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure (BAV, TAVI, or SAVR)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Phase II  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is  the hierarchical composite efficacy endpoint , 
determined by [CONTACT_371826] -wise comparisons among all subjects according to the following pre-
specified hierarchy of adverse outcomes:  
• All-cause mortality and/or any stroke (fatal and non- fatal, disabling or non- disabling) 
[evaluated at 30 days]  
o If both had a death/ stroke , a time to event analysis by [CONTACT_476777] a win  
o If both patients had a stroke at the same day the comparison moves to the next 
tier 
• NIHSS worsening  (increase from baseline)  [evaluated at  [ADDRESS_611302]-procedure]   
• Freedom from any cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]- weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611303]-procedure  
• T otal volume of cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]- weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611304] B wins (score +1) and Subject A loses (score -1). If both 
subjects die or both have a stroke on the same day, it is equilibrium (score 0). If both 
subjects survive free of stroke to 30 days, the comparison moves to the next tier of the 
hierarchy. A lack of an event is given a +1 score. An event which is less severe than the 
comparison gets a 0 score (for example death vs. stroke) 
After all between- subject comparisons have been performed, scores are summed to 
obtain a cumulative score for each subject, and outcomes between treatment groups are 
then compared.  
5.4.2  Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_611305] for superiority of each intervention group to the control group will be performed. To address t he issue of multiple tests among these 
secondary endpoints, sequential testing is planned. Secondary endpoints will be formally tested if and only if the primary study hypotheses are confirmed. The secondary endpoints will be tested individually, in the order in which they are listed as follows:  
• All stroke [evaluated at 7 days in the eITT population]  
• NIHSS worsening, defined as any NIHSS score increase from baseline [evaluated at 
[ADDRESS_611306] -procedure in the efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population]. 
A sensitivity analysis will further compare >2 points NIHSS worsening [evaluated at 2-
[ADDRESS_611307] -procedure in the efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population]  
• Composite of all -cause mortality and all stroke [evaluated at 7 days in the eITT

The above endpoints will be tested by [CONTACT_476759]- specified sequence, until the first non-
significant difference is found between the two treatment groups. After that, other treatment 
comparisons will be examined in an exploratory manner.

6.2.1  Screening and Enrollment  
Patients meeting indications for TAVI will be pre-screened for study eligibility by a member 
of the research team, including a review of the patient’s  medical history  and any existing 
diagnostic imaging testing that has been performed as a part of the patient’s normal medical 
care.  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611330] be documented prior to the performance of 
any study -specific screening procedures or assessments.  Following receipt of informed 
consent, a baseline screening assessment will be conducted to verify eligibility; the required 
documentation must also be provided to the Patient Review Committee (§ 11.1) to determine 
anatomic eligibility for the trial.  
The patient will be considered enrolled in the study when all the following criteria have been 
met: 
• The patient has provided written informed consent  
• Baseline screening has been conducted and: 
o The Patient Review Committee has determined that the patient meets the evaluated anatomic  eligibility criteria  (based on imaging analysis by 
[CONTACT_476780])  AND  
o The investigator has determined that the patient meets all applicable remaining 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria  
• The point of enrollment has been reached:  
o For evaluable subjects  (Intervention and Control groups), the point of 
enrollment is the moment of randomization. Randomization will occur:  
 Within 72 hours  prior to the scheduled initiation of the TAV I procedure  
AND 
 After the investigator has confirmed the subject meets all anatomic  
eligibility criteria  
o For Roll -In subjects , the point of enrollment is the introduction of the TriGuard 
HDH or TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611331] number, or reason for non- enrollment of subjects screened but not enrolled in the study.  All enrolled subjects 
are required to complete all assigned follow -up ass essments. No single site was permitted to 
enroll more than 20% of the total number of evaluable subjects (i.e., no single site may enroll more than 57 evaluable subjects  in the initial  randomized cohort  [in addition to any roll -in 
subjects ] in Phase I, and  no more than 45 randomized subjects  in the initial randomized 
cohort  [in addition to any roll -in subjects] in Phase II .  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_476754] (Medtronic vs. Edwards).  
No single valve type will be implanted in more than approximately 70% of randomized 
patients (phase II).  
After at least 50% of the patients in the initial randomized cohort (approximately 112 subjects) have reached the 30 day primary efficacy endpoint evaluation time point, a sample size 
reestimation will b e performed in case the conditional power of the trial (assessed by [CONTACT_476781]) is > 40% but <80%, subject to approval by [CONTACT_1034].  If this 
analysis determines that more than [ADDRESS_611332] limit for the study has been reached (whichever occurs first).  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611333] is considered enrolled in the Roll -In phase of the study 
when:  
• The patient has been judged to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria (including 
approval by [CONTACT_398384]), and has signed a Patient Informed Consent form  
• The TriGuard HDH or TriGUARD 3 device has been introduced into the patient’s 
bloodstream  
6.2.3  Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients  
Subjects  can withdraw from the study at any time; the reason(s) for withdrawal (if given) will 
be docum ented. All data available at the time of withdrawal (if any) will be used for analysis. 
There will be no further follow -up (per this study protocol) on a subject  who has withdrawn. 
Subjects  who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. The withdrawal of a subject  can 
be initiated by [CONTACT_476782]/ she determines it is in the best interest of the patient . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_611334]/ Ethics Committee .  
Patient -level deviations are those that occur in direct association with a specific study patient. 
These include, but are not limited to, deviations from informed consent procedures, 
inclusion/ex clusion criteria, protocol -specified procedures and assessments,  and device 
handl ing and usage. 
Site-level deviations are those that occur at the study center but are not directly related to a 
study specific patient. All efforts should be made to avoid any protocol deviation.  
6.[ADDRESS_611335]’s treatment 
allocation:  
• Subject and his/her family members  
• Site personnel administering neurological evaluations (NIHSS  and mRS) ; these 
individuals will also be blinded to DW -MRI results  
• Members of the Data Safety Moni toring Committee  
• MRI Core Laboratory personnel  performing imaging analysis  
Un-blinding will occur only after the database has been locked for the analysis of the primary 
endpoint or to protect subject rights, welfare, or well -being at the request of the DSMB. The 
circumstances under which the DSMB may request unblinding to treatment allocation will be 
outlined in the DSMB charter prior to the onset of the trial.

2 If the full screening/baseline review of eligibility criteria is conducted before the day of enrollment, t he 
following repeat review of selected eligibility criteria should be performed on the day of  enrollment and 
randomization (§6.2.1) to confirm study eligibility, using the most recent available laboratory values and 
clinical assessments: 1.) Ensure that the subject has not had symptoms or chemistry results indicating acute myocardial infarction (§[IP_ADDRESS].5); 2.) Ensure that the most recent eGFR remains ≥30 (§[IP_ADDRESS].10); 3.) 
Ensure that there are no signs of cardiogenic shock or severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) (§ [IP_ADDRESS].13); and 4.) Review the planned approach for TAVI, as certain approaches will make the 
subject ineligible for the study (§ [IP_ADDRESS].1, § [IP_ADDRESS].2) 
3 Screening/baseline ECG may be performed up to [ADDRESS_611338] been 
no intervening signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia (in which case the ECG should be performed within 24 hours prior to enrol lment ). The post -procedure ECG must be performed within 24 hours of the

7.7.2  Phase II:  
In Phase II, a telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] 90 days (± 14 days) post -procedure will establish : 
• Mortal ity 
• Stroke  
If death or stro ke is reported, source documentation will be requested from treating facility  
to enable CEC adjudication of cause of death (cardiovascular [subclassified and neurologic -event related]  or non- cardiovascular ) and stroke classification according to the 
protocol -specified definitions.  
8.0 Device Accountability  
The Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_476712]/her trial site and 
must maintain associated trial records according to 21 CFR Part 812.140  (§15.5.2) . The 
investigator may assign the responsibility for device accountability to an appropriate study staff member, but remain s the final responsible person.  
The investigator will maintain device use/disposition records that document device delivery 
to the trial site, the inventory at the site, administration to each patient as well as any device that was  opened but not used . These records must include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], and the unique code numbers assigned to the trial patients. The investigator must maintain records that adequately document which device was used (or 
exposed to the circulation) of each subject  and any device malfunctions.  
At the trial closeout visit, the Investigator must return to the Sponsor any unused devices and a copy of the completed device inventory. The Investigator’s copy of the device reconciliation records must document all device usage (including devices that were opened but not used) 
and any unused devices that have been returned to the sponsor.  
9.0 Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events, and End -points 
Potentially Meeting End- point Criteria  
In this study, patients should be encouraged to report adverse events (AEs) spontaneously or in response to general, non- directed questioning. Any time during the study, the patient 
may volunteer information that resembles an adverse event (AE). If it is determined that a clinically significant AE has occurred, the investigator should obtain all the information 
required to complete the AE CRFs.  Non-clinically -significant adverse events will not be 
required post discharge from the initial study procedure.  
9.1 Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any 
untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other 
persons , whether or not related to the study  device.  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
67 
 NOTE : This definition includes events related to the study  device or to the procedures 
involved, but does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the 
study device.  
Pre-Existing Conditions:  
Pre-existing medical conditions or a repeat of symptoms reported prior to the TAVR 
procedure will not be recorded as an AE. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study 
are to be considered adverse events. For users or other persons , this classification is 
restricted to events related to the study device. 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  is an adverse event that:  
1. Led to a death  
2. Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that : 
a. Resulted in a life- threatening illness or injury  
b. Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
c. Required in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
d. Resulted in medical or  surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to body structure or a body function.  
3. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
9.[ADDRESS_611369] (ADE)  
An a dverse device effect is an adverse event related to the use of a medical device. This 
includes:  
• Any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the Instructions for 
Use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or any 
malfu nction of the medical device 
• Any event that is a result of a use error or intentional misuse  
9.[ADDRESS_611370] (SADE)  
A serious adverse device e ffect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a s erious adverse event.  
9.[ADDRESS_611371] (UADE)  
An u nanticipated adverse device e ffect is any serious adverse effect on the health or safety 
or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect,  
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that  relates to the rights, safety 
or welfare of subjects.  
NOTE: An a nticipated serious adverse device e ffect (ASADE) is a serious adverse device 
effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application).

68 
 9.6 Device Deficiencies , Malfunctions, and Use Error 
Investigators are instructed to report all possible device deficiencies , malfunctions , misuse or 
use error observed during the course of the trial. These incidents will be documented in the 
case report form provided as follows:  
• Device deficiency : Inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance. NOTE: Device deficiencies include 
malfunctio n, use error, and inadequate labeling. They may or may not affect device 
performance or lead to an adverse event.  
• Device malfunction: Failure of an investigational medical device to perform in 
accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance wi th the Instructions 
for Use or protocol. NOTE: A device malfunction occurs when the device is used in compliance with the Instructions for Use, but does not perform as described in the Instructions for Use.  
• Use error:  Act or omission of an act that results  in a different medical device response 
than intended by [CONTACT_3460]. NOTE 1: Use error includes slips, lapses and mistakes. NOTE 2: An unexpected physiological response of the patient does not itself constitute a use error.  
• Device misuse: Any use of the investigational device by [CONTACT_476785]. This is a form of Use Error.  
9.7 End-points Potentially Meeting End-point  Criteria  
Investigators are instructed to report all cardiovascular events and all adverse events potentially meeting end- point criteria. These events  will be documented in the case report 
form as SAEs and be assessed by [CONTACT_7195]. Events classified as potential end-
points will then be sent to CEC adjudication ( §11.2).  
9.[ADDRESS_611372] be listed on the appropriate CRF. All AEs will be characterized by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Intensity or Severity  
• Relatedness  
• Outcome  
• Treatment or Action Taken  
9.8.1  Intensity or Severity  
The following categories of the intensity of an adverse event are to be used:  
Mild Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
patient’s usual activity or is transient, re solved without treatment 
and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  Interferes with the patient’s usual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment.  
Severe Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of 
the patient’s usual activity and requires tr eatment.  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
69 
 9.8.2  Relatedness  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship to the device:  
Not related  
 The cause of the AE is known and the event is not related to 
any aspect of study participation.  
Unlikely to be 
related  There is little or no temporal relationship to the study device and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possibly 
related  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationship  to the study procedure(s); 
however, follows no known pattern of response , and an 
alternative cause seems more likely or there is significant uncertainty about the cause of the event.  
Probably 
related  It is likely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationship  to the study procedure(s) 
and follows a known pattern of response ; a potential 
alternative cause, however, may explain the event.  
Related  A related  event has a strong temporal relationship and an 
alternative cause is  unlikely.  
 
If the relationship between any adverse event and the use of the investigational medical 
device is considered to be possibly or probably related, that event will be classified as an ADE or SADE.  
 
9.8.3  Outcome  
The clinical outcome of the AE or SAE will be characterized as follows:  
Death  The SAE CRF must be completed for this outcome  
Recovered without 
sequelae  The patient returned to baseline status  
Ongoing Patient did not recover and symptoms continue;  
Recovered with 
sequelae  The patient has recov ered but with clinical sequelae 
from the event  
Unknown  The patient outcome is unknown 
 
 
9.8.4  Treatment or Action Taken  
The treatment or action taken after the occurrence of an AE or SAE will be reported as:  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.

 Interventional 
Treatment  Surgical, percutaneous or o ther procedure  
Medical Treatment  Medication dose reduction/interruption or 
discontinuation, or medication initiated for event  
None  No action is taken  
9.9 Reporting  
9.9.1  General Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
Investigators are required to keep records on “all relevant observations, including records 
concerning adverse device effects (whether anticipated or unanticipated)” according to 21 
CFR 812.140. Adverse event collection will occur from the point of study enrollment to study closure. All new or worsening (from baseline) clinically significant adverse events will be 
captured on the AE CRF through the 90-day follow -up telephone visit . Non-clinically -
significant adverse events will not be required post discharge from the initial study procedure.  
It is the res ponsibility of the Investigator to assess the subject for adverse events  and, if it is 
determined that a clinically significant AE has occurred, to capture the required adverse event 
information on the AE CRF. Independent monitoring will be conducted (§ 14.1) to review 
source documentation and verify the complete and accurate capturing of adverse events.  
The general procedure for investigators reporting any adverse event is as follows:  
• If an adverse event occurs, complete all sections of the Adverse Ev ent CRF  
• Each unique event/diagnosis must be documented separately  
• Documented pre- existing conditions are not considered to be reportable AEs unless 
there is a change in the nature or severity of the condition  
• The AE CRF must be reviewed by [CONTACT_476786] (potential) UADE, the sponsor recommends that the Investigator notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_611373] learning of the AE using the electronic data capture (EDC) CRF. If necessary, the Investigator may be requested to provide de-identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_10467] (e.g., physician/nurse 
notes or summaries) regarding the event.  
The Investigator must also notify the responsible IRB /EC regarding new and significant safety 
information a nd any event s identified by [CONTACT_476787]. that require expedited FDA or 
other regulatory authority reporting as serious, unexpected, and related to the investigational 
device. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure site- specific IRB/E C reporting 
requirement are met.  
The sponsor is responsible for reporting SAEs and device deficiencies to regulatory authorities in line with applicable regulatory requirements and for reviewing the risk analysis, determining the need for corrective or preventative action, and informing investigators and 
regulatory authorities accordingly.  
9.9.[ADDRESS_611374] learning of any SAE using the EDC CRF. All cardiovascular events and all 
adverse events potentially meeting endpoint criteria will be considered an SAE (even if they do not result in death or prolong the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and should be reported as well (see also section 11.2). If necessary, the Investigator may be requested to provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_99606]-
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
71 
 identified source documentation (e.g., physician/nurse notes or summaries) regarding the 
event. The sponsor will conduct an evaluation of the event and, if it is determined by [CONTACT_476788] a UADE, it will be reported as described in the following section.  
At EU sites  (phase I) , Serious Adverse Device Effects ( SADEs ) must be reported to genae,

It is the responsibility of each Investigator to report all serious a dverse events and/or serious 
adverse device effects and device deficiencies that could have led to a serious adverse 
device effect to the IRB/EC , according to national regulations and IRB/EC  requirements. If 
required by [CONTACT_2091], the Investigator may also be required to report SAEs to the regulatory authority.  
European investigators  (phas e I) who become aware of an event must report the event to 
genae  and to the Sponsor . While there is no legal requirement within the Medical Device 
Directives obliging users to have an active role in the medical devices vigilance system, user involvement is  critical to successful post market surveillance by 1.) Ensuring that suspected 
incidents are communicated to manufacturers, and 2.) Making the proper implementation of field safety corrective actions possible.  
9.9.[ADDRESS_611376] report any (potential) unanticipated adverse device effects to the sponsor 
and their IRB as soon as possible but no later than within [ADDRESS_611377] learns of the event [21 CFR 812.150]. UADEs should be reported imm ediatel y via 
telephone (contact [CONTACT_476789]) as well as on the eCRF.

Investigators should consider  the device labeling and the listing of expected adverse events 
(§9.10) in determining whether an event may qualify as “unanticipated. ” 
If an event is determined by [CONTACT_476787]. to be a UADE, the sponsor will report  the 
event to the FDA, relevant competent authorities and the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed) if necessary (in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12- 1), and to all 
investigators to enable reporting to their respective IRB/EC. The sponsor will provide this

10.0 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
10.[ADDRESS_611381]  risks of trial participation 
are not materially different than those encountered by [CONTACT_476791] (§9.10 ). However, the use of the TriGuard HDH or 
TriGUARD 3 embolic protection device s may involve exposure to additional  risks (§ 9.10) 
as well as other potential  risks of an unknown nature.  
10.[ADDRESS_611382] research organization has been 
included in the study team to ensure high quality follow -up and minimize potential drop out. 
In addition, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee will monitor the safety of subjects throughout the trial.  
10.3 Potential Benefits  
The targeted trial population (subjects with severe symptomatic AS meeting indications for TAVI) has been demonstrated to be at risk for stroke and other neurological complications during and after  the procedure. The study intervention has the potential 
to benefit subjects by [CONTACT_476792], limiting subsequent  cerebral ischemia . Potential risks and benefits will be 
evaluated on an individual basis and discussed with each patient prior to enrollment in the study.

 11.0 Study Committees  
11.1 Patient Review Committee (PRC ) 
The PRC will ensure appropriate and consistent appli cation of selected anatomic eligibility 
criteria to all potentially eligible subjects  at all study sites. The PRC will consist of at least one 
imaging specialist , two interventional cardiologists,  and a Sponsor representative (non- voting 
role).  
Following initial pre-screening for study eligibility by [CONTACT_476793],  the following information will be submitted to the PRC for review  for each 
potentially eligible subject : 
• A completed Screening Worksheet  
• The results of  independent core laboratory analysis of CT imaging (standard and 
contrast -enhanced angiography preferred) of the left heart, aorta, great vessels, and 
peripheral access vessels  performed up to 1 year prior to procedure .  
The PRC will meet regularly during the enrollment phase to determine whether potential 
candidates meet selected applicable anatomic eligibility criteria ( §[IP_ADDRESS].15 , §[IP_ADDRESS].16 , 
§[IP_ADDRESS].17 , §[IP_ADDRESS].18, § [IP_ADDRESS].19). PRC responsibilities, membership, meeting 
frequencies, and procedures will be outlined in the PRC charter prior to the onset of the trial.  
11.2 Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
The CEC  will be responsible for adjudicating all site -reported cardiovascular events and all 
adverse events potentially meeting endpoint criteria, in an ongoing fashion during the trial. In 
order to fully capture all endpoints,  events  potentially  meeting end -point criteria will be 
considered an SAE  (even if they do not result in death or prolong the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  and 
sent to the medical monitor for further assessment. Events appropriately  classified 
as potential endpoints by [CONTACT_476794].  
Events potentially meeting end- point criteria and therefore defined as SAE for this 
purpose include:  
• Death  
• Stroke/TIA or any  other Neurological Dysfunction (NeuroARC definitions)  
• MI or Coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention 
• Bleeding (including  life-threatening or disabling bleeding, Major and Minor  bleeding)  
• Acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3 or requiring dialysis)  
• Major vascular complications  
• Valve -related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure  
The CEC will include at least  one interventional cardiologist with relevant clinical experience 
and one neurologist with experience in clinical trials involving stroke who are otherwise 
independent of the Sponsor or the conduct of the study. Members will not have scientific, 
financial  or other conflicts of interest related to Keystone Heart Ltd. or the Investigators. The 
CEC will operate and conduct all meetings and event reviews independent of the Sponsor unless specific expert knowledge regarding the characteristics or function of the study device is requested by [CONTACT_476795].  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611383]  (DSM B) 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSM B) is responsible for the oversight  and safety 
monitoring of the study. The DSM B advises the Sponsor regarding the continuing safety of 
the trial subjects and those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the continuing validity and scientific merit of the trial. The DSM B will be composed of members are leading experts 
in cardiovascular medicine, vascular neurology  (with experience in clinical trials involving 
stroke) , and biostatistics who are not participating in the trial and have no affiliation with the 
sponsor.  
During the enrollment phase of the trial, the DSM B will review accumulating safety data to 
monitor for the incidence of serious adverse events that would warrant modification or termination of the trial  according to a pre- specified safety monitoring plan. Any DSM B 
recommendat ions for study modification or termination prompted by [CONTACT_476796]. However, if the DSM B at any time 
determines that a potential serious risk exists to subjects in this trial, the DSM B chairman will 
immediately notify the Sponsor.  
The DSM B will meet at regular intervals to review the safety data. DSM B responsibilities, 
membership, meeting frequencies , and procedures will be outlined in the DSM B charter  prior 
to the onset of the trial . The circumstances under which the DSMB may request unblinding 
to treatment allocation will also be outlined in the charter.   
12.0 Statistical Considerations and Analysis Plan 
12.1 General Analysis Definitions  
Analysis will be conducted using SAS (version 9. 3 or greater), unless otherwise noted. 
Descriptive s tatistics for continuous variables will include mean, median, standard deviation, 
quartiles, minimum, maximum, and sample size for each treatment group. Binary variables will be summarized using frequencies, percentages, and sampl e size for each treatment 
group. For time -to-event data, Kaplan- Meier estimates at the indicated time points will be 
displayed graphically. Further clarifications regarding endpoint criteria assessment and 
analysis between subjects will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
12.1.[ADDRESS_611384] 50%  of the initial randomized Phase II cohort has been enrolled and has 
reached the 30 day primary efficacy endpoint  evaluation time point , the independent 
unblinded statistician will perform a conditional power analysis. If the trial, based on the results at that point is either  ≤40% powered to achieve success in meeting the primary 
efficacy endpoint or is ≥80% powered to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint no sample 
size reestimation will be required. If the conditional power of the study is >40% but <80% the 
independent unblinded statistician will recommend a sample size reestimation, subject to approval by [CONTACT_1034]. If this analysis determines that more than [ADDRESS_611385] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611386] limit for the study has been reached (whichever occurs first).  
Promising zone computation 
After the trial has enrolled 50% of the originally planned sample size of the initial randomized 
cohort  (112 patients), an independent statistician will estimate all 4 levels of the Finkelstein-
Schoenfeld hierarchy for device and control, and use these estimates to re- calculate the trial’s 
power given the originally planned 225 Phase II patients.   
If the trial power is between >40% and <80%, the trial will be considered promising and the trial will readjust the sample size to attain 80% power. If on the other hand the power falls to 
≤ 40% or ≥ 80%, the sample size will not be adjusted.  
Conditional power computation 
The conditional power will estimate all four Finkelstein- Schoenfeld levels and use these 
estimates to simulate future enrolled patients. The power simulation will follow ex actly the 
same algorithm as used to power the original Phase II study with updated estimates of effect size. 
Alpha spending and controlling type I error  
Since the study leadership and sponsor do not conduct any formal statistical hypothesis  test, 
this design will not incur any alpha penalty or affect the overall type I error. As detailed by [CONTACT_91558]
11 and based on the work of Chen10 as long as the sample size 
reestimation occurs only when the conditional power falls in the promising zone, no additional alpha spend is required and the overall type I error is preserved.   
 
12.2 Sample Size Calculation   
12.2.1  Hypothes es 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary Safety Hypothesis  (Phase I and Phase II reported 
individually)  
The primary safety hypothesis is that the rate of the primary safety endpoint (a composite of 
death, stroke, life- threatening of disabling bleeding, AKI [Stage 2 OR 3], coronary artery 
obstruction requiring intervention, major vascular complication, and valve- related dysfunc tion 
requiring repeat procedure) in the group undergoing TAVI with either protection device 
system ( Intervention Groups) at 30 days will be less  in each device group (TriGuard HDH 
and TriGUARD 3) compared separately to a performance goal (PG) of 34.4%.  
Specifically, the primary safety analysis will assess if the Intervention group’s safety event 
rate is significantly less than the PG of 34.4% using a one- sample z -test of proportions.  The 
formal null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H0: π ≥ 0.344  
 H1: π < 0.[ADDRESS_611387] will be carried out by [CONTACT_476797] -
sided 95% confidence interval of the primary safety endpoint event rate in the  intervention 
arm to the PG. With the planned evaluable sample size of 179 subjects and a one- sided 
alpha of 0.05, the critical value for rejection of the null hypothesis is 28.5%:  if the primary 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
77 
 safety endpoint occurs in 28.5% or less of intervention group subjects, the performance goal 
will be met.  
After accounting for a potential 5% loss to clinical follow -up at 30 days (including subjects 
who do not meet As Treated population criteria), the total required intervention group sample 
size is [ADDRESS_611388] 
3 and the 40-50 roll -ins will constitute the primary safety population.  
Trial success depends on both primary endpoints being met in their primary analysis populations; i.e., the primary sa fety endpoint must be met in the primary (AT) population and 
the primary efficacy endpoint must be met in the primary (eITT) population in order for the trial to be declared a success.  Because both primary endpoints (safety and efficacy) must be 
met (i.e., both H
[ADDRESS_611389] be rejected) for the trial to be declared a success , no adjustment to 
alpha for multiple endpoints is required for the two primary study endpoints.

mortality or any stroke at 30 days (Tier 1), NIHSS worsening from baseline assessed at 2-[ADDRESS_611391] -procedure (Tier 2), freedom from any cerebral  ischemic lesions detected by 
[CONTACT_35774] -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611392] -procedure (Tier 
3), and total volume of post -procedure cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI (Tier 
4).  
Specifically, the primary efficacy hypothes es are:  
H0: The hierarchical composite of death/stroke, NIHSS worsening, freedom from 
any lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI, and larger total lesion volumes is not different 
between Intervention and Control groups  
H1:  The hierarchical composite of death/stroke, NIHSS worsening, freedom from 
any lesions detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI, and larger  total lesion volumes is lower  in the 
Intervention group than in the Control group  
The null hypothesis will be tested at the final analysis at a one-sided 0. [ADDRESS_611393] according to the 
method described in Finkelstein- Schoenfeld2 and Pocock77. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Hypothesis -driven Secondary Endpoints  
In order to control alpha at 0.02 5 level overall, the secondary endpoints will be tested if and 
only if the primary study endpoints are met. Secondary testing will be conducted sequentially 
beginning with all stroke,  followed by [CONTACT_476798], followed by [CONTACT_476799] -
cause mortality and all stroke, followed by [CONTACT_476800] , followed by [CONTACT_476801].

The hypothesis is that the event rate for  all stroke in the Intervention Group at 7 days will be 
lower than the Control Group at 7 days.

• NIHSS worsening, defined as an NIHSS score increase from 
baseline [evaluated at 2-[ADDRESS_611395]-procedure in the efficacy 
Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population]  
The hypothesis is that the rate of the patients with worsening NIHSS score in the Intervention 
Group at post-procedure (2-[ADDRESS_611396] -procedure)  will be lower than the Control Group at 
post-procedure  (2-[ADDRESS_611397] -procedure) .  
The formal null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H0: πNIHSS -I = πNIHSS -C 
 H1: πNIHSS -I < πNIHSS -C 
where πNIHSS -I is the true rate of worsening NIHSS scores in the Intervention arm and πNIHSS -
C is the true rate of worsening NIHSS scores in the Control arm.  
The null hypothesis will be tested at a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_611398] of proportions . 
• Composite of all -cause mortality and all stroke [evaluated at 7 
days  in the eITT analysis population]  
The hypothesis is that the event rate for  the composite of all -cause mortality and all stroke in 
the Intervention Group at 7 days will be lower than  the Control Group at 7 days.  
The formal null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H0: πCOMP -I = πCOMP -C 
 H1: πCOMP -I < πCOMP -C 
where πCOMP -I is the true rate of the composite of all -cause death and all stroke  in the 
Intervention arm and πCOMP -C is the true rate of the composite of all -cause death and all stroke 
in the Control arm.  
The null hypothesis will be tested at a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_611399] of proportions . 
• CNS infarction  (NeuroARC defined) [evaluated at 30 days in the 
eITT analysis population]  
The hypothesis is that the event rate for  CNS infarction  in the Intervention Group at 30 days 
will be lower than the Control Group at 30 days.  
The formal null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H0: πCNS -I = πCNS -C 
 H1: πCNS -I < πCNS -C 
where πCNS -I is the true rate of CNS infarction  in the Intervention arm and πCNS -C is the true 
rate of CNS infarction  in the Control arm.  
The null hypothesis will be tested at a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_611400] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
79 
 • Total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions  detected by [CONTACT_1348]-MRI, 
[evaluated [ADDRESS_611401] -procedure in the efficacy Intention to 
Treat (eITT) analysis population]  
The hypothesis is that the total volume of cerebral i schemic lesions in the Intervention Group 
will be lower than the Control Group.  
The formal null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
 H0: πTLV-I = πTLV-C 
 H1: πTLV-I < πTLV-C 
where πTLV-I is the true total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions in the Intervention arm and 
πTLV-C is the true total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions  in the Control arm.  
The null hypothesis will be tested at a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_611402]. 
12.2.2  Expected Control Primary Safety Endpoint Event Rate  
An expected event rate for the control group was determined based on published data from 
subjects undergoing unprotected TAVI.  
A search of  bibliographic scientific databases (PubMed and EMBASE) was undertaken to 
identify studies reporting VARC combined safety outcomes using the following search parameters:  
• Language = English, species = humans  
• Publication date January 2011 (publication of original VARC definitions) to present  
• Keywords included: Valve Academic Research Consortium or VARC; aortic valve; and percutaneous, transcatheter, transluminal, transarterial, transfemoral, or transapi[INVESTIGATOR_476714]:  
• Peer -reviewed publications only. Abstracts, case reports, conference presentations, 
editorials, and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_476715].  
• Reported using VARC or VARC -2 definitions (explicitly mentioned in text), and 
reported VARC combined safety  endpoint or the VARC -2 early safety endpoint at 30 
days  
• N≥20 (studies reporting outcomes in fewer than 20 TAVI subjects were excluded)  
• Patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI with Medtronic or Edwards valves. Studies reporting outcomes exclusively in valv e-in valve or subjects undergoing TAVI via any 
approach other than transfemoral or transapi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (e.g., transaxillary, transsubclavian, direct aortic) were excluded. When larger cohorts included these subjects, the results in these subjects were excluded when data allowed; otherwise they were included.  
• Publications with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_476716], and the most recent procedural timeframe (or largest N) was used and the other(s) discarded.  
Additional relevant studies were identified through a manual search of secondary sources, including the bibliographies of initially identified articles and review articles and commentaries.  
Although the primary safety endpoint is the VARC -[ADDRESS_611403] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
80 
 evaluated to inform determination of the PG. Based on differences between the definitions 
(see Table 9 below), we would expect the VARC -2 event rate to be slightly higher based on 
the addition of all stroke and Stage 2 acute kidney injury; however, mor e published data 
according to the earlier VARC definitions is likely available.

Note : Bold text indicates differences between the two definitions. This table represents an overall 
comparison; details of individual component definitions have also changed between consensus documents.  
The literature search and sift identified a total of 19 studies reporting the original VARC 
combined safety endpoint and 6 studies reporting the VARC -2 early safety endpoint (Table

D’Onofrio [ADDRESS_611405] estimation of the expected event rate in the population 
of subjects with severe AS undergoing TAVI via the transfemoral or transapi[INVESTIGATOR_476717]. The average event rate in studies reporting outcomes 
according to the VARC -2 definition (the primary safety endpoint for the REFLECT Trial) was 
25.9%;  among studies reporting the slightly more circumscribed VARC 1 definition, the 
average event rate was 23.8%.  Therefore, the expected event rate of the primary safety 
endpoint in the Control group was estimated at 25%.   
12.2.[ADDRESS_611406] device:  
For T ier 1 of the hierarc hy, a n expected event rate of all -cause mortality or stroke (disabling

A recent ly published letter104 presented a meta- analysis of the above trials for the primary

Based on the above, and considering SENTINEL being the most recent trial (with up to 9% 
stroke rate and 1.8% death rate in the controls), we conservatively estimate an ~11% rate of 
all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days in subjects undergoing unprotected TAVI  and a 50% 
reduction yielding a ~6% assumed event rate in the protected group.  CoreValve

NOTE: Italics indicates that the event rate is not directly reported, but the given percentage represents a best estimate based on 
component event rates; for the composite of death and all stroke, it is assumed that no subject with a non-disabling stroke also 
experienced a death or disabling stroke within the 30-day timeframe (with the exception of CoreValve Extreme, in which data 
indicates that [ADDRESS_611408] experienced both a major and a minor stroke).  
*Percentages given are Kaplan Meier estimates, and therefore do not equal the number of subjects experiencing an event divided by [CONTACT_476802] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
83 
 The remaining component event rates  (Tiers 2 -4) are estimat ed based on data from the 
above mentioned trials , which employed identical NIHSS assessments and DW -MRI analysis 
methodology . 
We conservatively expect 9% of controls and 6% of device group patients to have any NIHSS 
worsening  (table 6b).  
Among subjects who survived free of stroke to [ADDRESS_611409] -procedure (2-[ADDRESS_611410] -procedure)  assessment (Tier 3 of the 
hierarchy),  we expect 11% of controls and 2 7% of device group patients to be free of any 
lesions on MRI. These assumptions are based on the above trials and more specifically on the published results of DEFLECT III
8 (Per Treatment) which used a similar device with full 
cerebral protection (as opposed to SENTINEL) and the same MRI assessment  modality as 
planned in this trial (see also table 6a). 
Among patients surviving without stroke at 30 days, and who did not experience NIHSS worsening, and who had MRI lesions on DW-MRI (final 4th Tier) we expect  the rates of  lesion

The primary analysis population for the primary endpoint is the efficacy Intention to Treat 
(eITT) population (§12.3.1), which excludes subjects with conversion to surgery  or prolonged 
cardiac arrest  prior to the post -procedure DW-MRI. Selection of this population as the primary 
analysis population for the efficacy endpoint ensures that, should a small number of subjects 
experience an  adverse endpoint event  due to circumstances unrelated to procedural  
neuroprotection, the study will remain powered to detect a clinically -meaningful treatment 
effect , particularly  regarding the volume of  subclinical cerebral ischemic lesions on DW -MRI.   
12.2.4  Sample Size Estimation  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_611412] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
84 
 The primary safety endpoint is combined safety (VARC -2 defined as a composite of death, 
stroke, life -threatening or disabling bleeding, acute kidney injury [Stage 2 or 3], coronary 
artery obstruction requiring intervention, major vascular complication, and valve- related 
dysfunction requiring repeat procedure), evaluated at 30 days.  
Based on published literature of patients undergoing unprotected TAVI (§12.2.2), establishing 
the expected Control event rate of 25%, and a 37.5% relative margin (absolute delta 9.4%) , 
a Performance Goal (PG) has been has been set at 34.4% (25% + 9.4%). The primary safety analysis will assess if the Intervention group’s safety event rate is significan tly less than the 
PG of 34.4%.  
A sample size of 179 evaluable subjects in the intervention group will provide 85% power to 
determine whether the intervention group meets the PG at the one- sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_611413] of proportions. After accounting for a potential 5% loss to 
clinical follow -up or dropout from the primary analysis population (As Treated) at [ADDRESS_611414] 3 and 40- 5 0 roll -ins will con stitute the primary safety 
population.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_611415] to the 
hierarchical composite primary efficacy endpoint was estimated using the following assumptions:  
• All-caus e mortality or any stroke at 30 days will occur in ~11% of Control subjects 
and ~6% of Intervention subjects  (5% absolute reduction, ~45% relative reduction)  
• Among subjects without all -cause mortality or any stroke to [ADDRESS_611416]-procedure will occur in 9% of Control subjects and 6% of 
Intervention subjects ( 3% absolute reduction, 33.3%  relative reduction)   
• Among subjects without all -cause mortality or any stroke to [ADDRESS_611417]-procedure , MRI findings will occur in 89% of Control 
subjects and in 7 3% of intervention subjects (16% absolute reduction, 17.9% relative 
reduction) . 
• Among subjects without all -cause mortality or any stroke to [ADDRESS_611418] procedure, but with MRI findings, lesion volumes can be 
divided into 3 out of  4 subsets - 0 mm
3, >0-50 mm3, >50 -150 mm3 and >[ADDRESS_611419] rates of 11%, 7%, 33% and 48%, respectively, in the control group and 27%, 19%, 7.5% , and  46%, respectively, in the intervention 
group. 
• For sample size calculations a relative reduction of 30% is expected in each lesion volume subset, based on the comparison of total lesion volumes between device and control groups in DEFLECT I, MISTRAL C
73 SENTINEL9 and CLEAN -TAVI74.  
• The smallest detectable difference in MRI is a single voxel. In addition, inter -rater 
mean differences between two independent observers was 15% or ~5 voxels  (40.5 
mm3) in the KSH Methodology/Reproducibility Study  (data on file) . Accordingly, a 
meaningful difference to declare a win/lose between MRI lesion volumes  was set at 
a 15% relative difference or a [ADDRESS_611420] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
85 
 • Loss to post -procedure DW -MRI follow -up is expected to occur in 15% of all subje cts 
(due to contraindications to post -procedure DW -MRI [e.g., pacemaker implantation] 
or subject non- compliance)  
• Loss to follow -up for all other reasons is expected to be 5%.  
• Overall α (one- sided) =0.025; (see §12.4.2) 
To deter mine the required sample size, calculations were performed by [CONTACT_80729] 5000 
samples on SAS software postulating the above parameters; mortality and stroke rates and 
proportions of patients with NIHSS worsening, any  MRI lesions and volumes divided to 
subs ets were simulated by a random binary function. 
An evaluable sample size of 225 subjects (2:1 randomization with 150 in the Intervention 
group and 75 new  Control subjects ) is sufficient to demonstrate superiority of the Intervention 
group to the Control group for the primary efficacy endpoint  when pair-wise comparisons are 
made between subjects using the Finkelstein -Schoenfeld method,[ADDRESS_611421].  
Therefore, the initial randomized cohort sample size of 225 subjects ( 150 in the Intervention 
group and 75 new control subjects ) will have >80% power to demonstrate superiority of the 
Intervention group for the primary efficacy endpoint  (one sided α=0.025). Notably, in several 
simulations, considering different distributions for lesion volume and different distributions for 
death/ stroke, the study power remained greater than 80%.  
Adding  the [ADDRESS_611422] 92% to demonstrate superiority of the primary 
efficacy endpoint. 5% loss to follow  up is included.  
12.3 Analysis  Populations  
12.3.1  Efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) Analysis Population 
The efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population is defined as : 
• Subjects who are enrolled in the trial and randomized to a treatment group, regardless of treatment actually received AND  
• Who do not have  conversion to surgery or prolonged cardiac arrest (>3 minutes) pri or 
to the post -procedure DW -MRI 
The eITT population of evaluable (i.e., not Roll -In) subjects will be used for the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, the primary analysis of the secondary hypothesis -
driven endpoints,  and the primary analysis of all secondary neurologic efficacy endpoints.  
12.3.2  Intention to Treat Analysis Population  
The Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis population is defined as all subjects enrolled in the study, by [CONTACT_220261], regardless of the treatment actually received.  
The ITT population of evaluable (i.e., not Roll -In) subjects will be used for the primary analysis 
of secondary performance endpoints and Other Measures. The ITT population will also be 
used for a secondary analysis of the primary  and secondary  efficacy endpoint s and the 
primary and secondary safety endpoints.  
12.3.3  As Treated Analysis Population 
The As Treated (AT)  analysis population is defined by [CONTACT_115378], rather 
than the treatment assigned. In the AT population,  subjects  in whom vascular access in the 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611423] s 
in whom the TAVI procedure is initiated (but no vascular access for intended deployment of 
the TriGuard HDH or TriGUARD 3 is established) w ill be analyzed as part of the C ontrol 
group.  
The AT population will be used for the primary analysis of all primary and secondary safety 
endpoints.  The AT population will also be used as the secondary analysis population for the 
secondary performance endpoints and Other Measures.  
12.3.4  Per Treatment Population 
The Per Treatment (PT) analysis population is defined as subjects in the Intervention group in whom device positioning is maintained until final procedure with complete cerebral coverage, and all Control group subjects.  
The PT population will be used for an additional analysis of the primary and secondary 
efficacy en dpoint s and other measures . 
12.3.5  Roll-In Patient Population 
The Roll- In (RI) patient population is defined as all subjects who undergo TAVI with the 
TriGuard HDH or TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611424] 
device (minimum of 2 prior cases) will enroll a minimum of  [ADDRESS_611425] is considered enrolled in the Roll -In phase of the study 
when:  
• The patient has been judged to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, and has signed a Patient Inf ormed Consent form  
• The TriGuard HDH of TriGUARD 3  device has been introduced into the patient’s 
bloodstream  
The RI patient population will be used for a separate analysis of all primary and secondary 
endpoints and Other Measures. Additional analyses will evaluate primary and secondary 
endpoints in the pooled population of RI Subjects plus Evaluable Subjects.   
12.4 Method of Analysis and Reporting   
12.4.1  Baseline Characteristics  
The following data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by [CONTACT_476804] (Roll- In subjects are excluded), ITT (Roll- In subjects are excluded), AT (Roll-
In subjects are excluded) , PT (Roll- In subjects are excluded), and Roll -In analysis sets. 
Descriptive s tatistics for continuous variables will include mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum, and sample size for each treatment group. Binary variables will be summarized using frequencies, percentages, and sample size for each treatment group.  
• Baseline demographics  
• Baseline comorbidities, risk factors and medical history  
• Cardiac risk factors, angina status and cardiac history  
• Procedural characteristics

12.4.2  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety hypothesis is that the rate of the Combined Safety Endpoint (defined 
according to VARC 2 as the composite of death, stroke, life- threatening or disabling bleeding, 
AKI [Stage 2/3], coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, major vascular complication, and valve- related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure) at [ADDRESS_611426] 3  system (Intervention group) 
is significantly less than the Performance Goal (PG). The following analysis will be carried out in the AT (primary analysis population) and ITT populations  including Roll- ins. 
The primary safety analysis will assess if the Intervention group’s safety endpoint rate is significantly less than 34.4% using a one- sample z -test of proportions. Specifically, the null 
and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  
H
0: π ≥ 0.344  
H1: π < 0.344 
where π is the true, unknown, safety event rate for the Intervention arm.    
The number and percentage of patients in each group experiencing the safety endpoint rate will be presented for each treatment; in addition, one-sided 95% confidence intervals  of the 
percentage will be presented, based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. For the intervention group, the above null hypothesis will be carried out at a one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_611427] 23 days (30 days minus the allowable 7 day visit window) of follow -up will be included in the analyses.  
As a secondary analysis, to account for any missing data in the primary  endpoint (caused by 
[CONTACT_476805] 23 
days of follow -up), a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_272232].  Here the above safety null 
hypothesis will be repeatedly tested, first assuming 0 patients with missing data failed (i.e., 
experienced the safety event), then assuming [ADDRESS_611428] is the “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” point, i.e., the number of Intervention missing data subjects who 
must be imputed as failures in order for the safety null hypothesis to no longer be rejected.  
In addition, in the final analysis, assessments of study -center and of region effect on the 
primary safety endpoint will be carried out on the interventional group within the AT population 
using logistic regressions. A 0.[ADDRESS_611429] geographic region; this pooling will be carried out prior to the unblinding.  
In addition, a logistic regression to assess the consistency of the primary safety endpoint rate across the following categories will also be performed on the interventional arm (separately 
for Phase I and Phase II) within the AT population:  
• Subject gender (male versus female)  
• Valve prosthesis  type (Edwards vs. Medtronic)  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
88 
 • Operative risk (by [CONTACT_476806] [STS] Risk Score)  
• Type and duration of antiplatelet therapy:  
o Pre- and peri -procedural therapy:  
 Protocol -recommended antiplatelet therapy vs. other  
o Maintenance therapy:   
 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to 90 days vs.  
 Monotherapy (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87494]) to 90 days vs.  
 Warfarin with antiplatelet therapy to 90 days vs.  
 Other  
As above, a 0.[ADDRESS_611430] (unprotected) TAVI for the primary hierarchical composite efficacy endpoint of all -
cause mortality or any stroke at 30 days (Tier 1), followed by [CONTACT_476798] (increase 
from baseline) 2-[ADDRESS_611431]-procedure (Tier 2), followed by [CONTACT_476807] -MRI (T ier 3), followed by [CONTACT_476808] -procedure cerebral ischemic lesions 
detected by [CONTACT_1348] -MRI divided into preset subdivisions  (Tier 4). Poolability of  the Phase I and 
Phase II control subject s will be assessed at the time of the primary analysis and the results 
will determine the control population used for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint as detailed in the SAP . 
The analytic approach is based on the statistical method described by [CONTACT_476809].
2 A similar approach was used in PARTNER Trial (Cohort B) where the co-
primary end point was hierarchical composite of the time to death from any cause or the time to the first occurrence of repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (after the index procedure) due to valve-related or procedure related clinical deterioration.
105 In addition, this approach was further 
explored and recommended for cardiovascular trials by [CONTACT_476810].77 
In brief, we propose the following analysis methodology:  
Each subject in the intervention group is compared with each and every subject  from the 
control group based on the following prespecified hierarchy:  
• All-cause mortality or any stroke (disabling or non- disabling) [evaluated at 30 days]  
o If both had a death/ stroke a time to event analysis by [CONTACT_476777] a win 
o If both patients had a stroke at the same day the comparison moves to the next 
tier 
• NIHSS worsening (increase from baseline)  [evaluated at post -procedure ([ADDRESS_611432] -
procedure) ]  
• Freedom from any cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]- weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611433]-procedure  
• Total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions detected by [CONTACT_35774]- weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW -MRI) [ADDRESS_611434] -procedure  
For example:

 • If Subject A has stroke and Subject B survives free of stroke or death to [ADDRESS_611435] B wins (score +1) and Subject A loses (score -1). 
• If Subject A and Subject B both have death/ stroke,  time to event by [CONTACT_476811] 
a win . 
• If both had a stroke on same day, the comparison moves on to the next  tier. 
• Assuming neither experiences a stroke or death before [ADDRESS_611436] A loses (score -1) and Subject B wins (score +1). In case both 
have NIHSS worsening the patient with the lesser worsening wins.  
• Assuming neither subject experiences a stroke or death before [ADDRESS_611437] A wins (score +1) 
and Subject B loses (Score -1).  
• Assuming neither subject experiences a stroke or death before [ADDRESS_611438] A wins (score +1) and 
Subject B loses (Score -1).

This analytic approach does not result in a natural point -estimate (e.g., propo rtion, mean, 
median, time- to-event); however, Pocock et al . provided a computational framework for the 
test statistic called “win ratio". In brief , it is calculated as a proportion of "wins" for each group 
out of the total num ber of the pairwise comparisons.  
No imputation of missing DW-MRI data will be performed for the primary analysis. However, 
in order to assess the sensitivity of results to missing DW -MRI data, multiple imputations with 
the linear regression approach will be used as the secondary sensit ivity analysis.  This 
assessment is necessary because the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (causing loss to DW -MRI follow- up) may vary according to patient clinical characteristics and 
prosthesis type.
[ADDRESS_611453] -
procedure diffusion- weighted MRI will be imputed via multiple imputation linear regression 
(10 imputed data sets will be created). The covariates used for the imputation model will be treatment group, age at time of enrollment, body mass index, race, smoking status, creatinine level, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, aortic arch disease burden, porcelain aorta, aortic valve area at baseline, procedure time, country, valve type, balloon post dilatation, arch type, and level of calcification.  This creation of the [ADDRESS_611454] pacemakers.  
The assumptions for powering the primary efficacy endpoint are based on neurologic, and imaging data from a limited number of subjects in the above mentioned RCTs  (§12.2.2) . In 
Phase I d ue to uncertainty regarding the primary efficacy endpoint, an unblinded interim 
analysis was planned to be conducted to re- evaluate the sample size required to demonstrate 
superiority of the Intervention group to the Control group.  The unblinded interim analysis was 
planned to  be conducted when [ADDRESS_611455] ( DSMB ) and the unblinded results will not be 
made privy to the sponsor, investigator, or any REFLECT team member, even in the event of a DSMB recommendation of an increase in sample size (i.e., the sponsor will not be made 
privy to the reason for any DSMB  recommendation of an increase in sample size).  If the 
interim analysis would have determined that more than [ADDRESS_611456] continued (contingent on 
DSMB recommendation and prior FDA approval, and at the Sponsor’s discretion) until the 
required number of subjects  would  have been enrolled, or until the total subject limit for the 
study has been reached (whichever occurs first).  
Specifically,  at the interim analysis  in Phase I , the trial sample size was to  be re -calculated, 
if necessary, to ensure 80% conditional power to demonstrate superiority (overall 2- sided 
α=0.05) of the Intervention group to the control group for the primary efficacy endpoint, conditioned on the interim unblinded results and loss to DW -MRI follow -up, according to the 
eITT population definition (there will be no imputation of missing data in this interim analysis; i.e., missing data will be excluded; also, sample size can only be increased at this interim 
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
92 
 stage; it will not be decreased beyond what is currently planned). The conditional power and 
sample size re- calculation for the final analysis were to be ascertained by [CONTACT_476813], DeMets and Lan.[ADDRESS_611457] by [CONTACT_2054], conditioned on the 
distribution of the observed interim data. If the conditional power is 50% - 80% (the “promising 
zone” according to Chen, DeMets and Lan), we were to use simulations to ascertain the 
increase in sample size required to yield 80% conditional power for the Mann -Whitney  test. 
If the conditional power was determined to be <50% or >80%, the study was to  proceed as 
is without a sample size adjustment  (i.e., only the initial randomized cohort of 225 subjects 
were to be enrolled) . The above- mentioned computer simulations were t o be carried out 
assuming the distribution of TLV data follows a negative binomial distribution within each 
treatment group. The intent of this analysis was to ensure adequate power to detect a 
clinically meaningful treatment effect  at the end of the study  by [CONTACT_476814].  
There was no intention to stop the study for overwhelming efficacy at the interim analysis. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to be conservative (due to the presence of an 
unblinded interim analysis), the O’Brien Fleming alpha spending method was to  be used to 
calculate an alpha penalty for the final analysis regardless of whether a sample size increase is needed (final analysis two- sided alpha = 0.049).  
NOTE: A revised adaptive design has been developed for Phase II of the study to inform a 
potential sample size increase based on interim conditional power; for details, please refer to §12.1.[ADDRESS_611458] using the proposed approach (Finkelstein 
and Schoenfeld) will be the model dependent variable. The following two models will be built: 1.) Model inclusive of treatment, study center, and treatment -by-study center interaction, and 
2.) Treatment region ( US versus OUS , Phase I only), and treatment -by-region interaction. A 
0.[ADDRESS_611459] geographic region; this pooling will be carried out prior to the unblinding.  
Additionally, an assessment of treatment -by-study -center and treatment -by-region on each 
component of the primary efficacy endpoint will be carried out on the eITT population using 
analysis of variance on the cube root  transformation for total lesion volume data and logistic 
regression for death/stroke and NIHSS worsening, with effects for 1.) Treatment, study 
center, and treatment -by-study center interaction, and 2.) Treatment, region ( US versus OUS , 
Phase I only ), and treatment -by-region interaction. As above, a  0.15 level of significance will 
be used to assess the significance of the interaction; a non-significant interaction or an 
interaction that is significant but only quantitative (and not qualitative) in nature will support the pooling of patients across study centers and across regions for the primary analysis ; and 
centers with less than [ADDRESS_611460] – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
93 
 In addition, the above analysis will be repeated in the eITT population (separately in Phase I 
and Phase II analysis sets) to assess the consistency of treatment effects on each component 
of the primary efficacy endpoint across the following variables:  
• Subject gender (male versus female)  
• Valve prosthesis type (Edwards vs. Medtronic)  
• Operative risk (by [CONTACT_476806] [STS] Risk Score)  
• Type and duration of antiplatelet therapy : 
o Pre- and peri -procedural therapy:  
 Protocol -recommended antiplatelet therapy vs. other  
o Maintenance therapy:   
 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to 90 days vs.  
 Monotherapy (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87494]) to 90 days vs.  
 Warfarin with antiplatelet therapy to 90 days vs.  
 Other  
As above, analysis of variance on the cube root transformation for total lesion volume data 
and logistic regression for death/stroke and NIHSS worsening will be used, and a 0.15 level of significance will be used to assess the significance of the interaction.  
If the primary efficacy endpoint is met in the primary (eITT) analysis population, sequential 
testing of the primary efficacy hypothesis will be conducted in the ITT analysis population of evaluable subjects (Roll -In patients are excluded.) As a secondary analysis, the prim ary 
efficacy endpoint and its components will be evaluated in the ITT analysis population of 
evaluable subjects (Roll -In patients are excluded). As an additional analysis, the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be evaluated in the PT population of subjects  with available data.  
An additional analysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint will also be performed in the primary 
eITT analysis population with adjustment for pre- existing cerebral lesion volumes.  The 
adjustment will be performed using a quantile regression with the resultant score being the 
dependent variable and group and the pre-existing cerebral lesion volumes  will be 
independent. Speci fically, the PROC QUANTREG procedure will be used to model the 
median of the score with QUANTILE=0.[ADDRESS_611461] for superiority of each intervention group to the control group will be performed. To address the issue of multiple tests among these secondary endpoints, sequential testing is planned. Secondary endpoints will be formally tested if and only if the primary study hypotheses are confirmed. The secondary endpoints will be tested individually, in the order in which they are listed as follows:  
• All stroke [evaluated at 7 days in the eITT population]  
• NIHSS worsening, defined as any NIHSS score increase from baseline [evaluated at 
[ADDRESS_611462] -procedure in the efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) analysis population]. 
A sensitivity analysis will further compare >2 points NIHSS worsening [evaluated at 2-

of Roll- In Subjects plus Evaluable Subjects.  The results of all analyses will be reported using 
descriptive statistics.  
12.4.9  Additional Analyses  
The following data will be summarized using descriptive statistics presented by [CONTACT_1570]:  
• Subject enrollment and data compliance by [CONTACT_476815] (data compliance at each visit is percent of patients whose data forms have been collected and entered divided 
by [CONTACT_476816])  (ITT, 
eITT, PT, and AT populations)  
• Frequency (number and percent of patients) with each type of concomitant medication  
(AT population)  
• Frequency (number and percent of patients) with each site- reported Treatment 
Emergent AE overall and by [CONTACT_14340] (a treatment emergent AE is an AE that started or worsened during  or after  the index 
procedure)  (AT population)  
• Frequency (number and percent of patients) with each site- reported Treatment 
Emergent Serious AE overall and by [CONTACT_14340]  
(AT population)  
• Frequency (number and percent of patients) with each site- reported Treatment 
Emergent AE or SAE, by [CONTACT_142223] -adjudicated relationship to the investigational device or 
procedure (AT population)  
• Protocol deviations (number and percentage of patients with each deviation type)  (ITT 
population)  
• Kaplan- Meier plots for MACCE and TAVI early safety through 30 days (AT Population; 
patients without an event will be censored at 30 days or day of withdrawal, whichever is earlier)

information will remain confidential for a period of 36 months following the study completion.  
14.0 Data Collection and Monitori ng 
14.1 Data Collection and Monitoring  
All required data for this study will be collected on standardized Case Report Forms (CRFs) using an electronic data capture system (EDC).  The investigator (or designated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]) 
will assure primary data collection based on source- documented hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174175].  
Independent monitoring will be performed to ensure that the investigator and his/her study 
team conduct the clinical investigation in accordance with contract specifications, this 
protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH- GCP, ISO [ADDRESS_611471] patient charts and other sources containing original records of patient 
data. Source document verification will occur in accordance with the pre-specified  Monitoring 
Plan.  
Progress of the trial will be monitored by:  
• On-site review, as deemed  appropriate by [CONTACT_456]  
• Telephone communications between site personnel (e.g., Site Investigator, Trial Coordinator) and trial monitors  
• Review of CRFs and associated clinical records  
• Review of regulatory documents  
Responsible entities for monitoring in the US and EU respectively are listed in § 3.0.   
If a monitor becomes aware that an Investigator is not complying with the requirements mentioned above, the sponsor will be notified by [CONTACT_2037]. The sponsor will evaluate t he 
non-compliance and if necessary, immediately either secure compliance or discontinue 
shipments of the investigational device to the Investigator and terminate the Investigator’s participation in continued enrolment in the investigation. The Investigator  will be required to 
return all unused devices to the sponsor.

Prior to obtaining informed consent, information should be given in a language and at a level of complexity understandable to the subject in both oral and written form  by [CONTACT_476824]. Patients should not be coerced, persuaded, or unduly influenced to 
participate or remain in the trial. A subject or his/her legal representative must be given ample 
time and opportunity to inquire about details of the trial and all questions about the trial sh ould 
be answered to the satisfaction of the subject or the representative.  
Prior to participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_190938]/her legal representative, and by [CONTACT_28490] (investigator or designee).  If the subject or his/her 
legal representative is unable to read the consent form, a witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After the informed consent form is read to the subject and signed by [CONTACT_190938]/her legal representative, the witness should also sign the consent form, attesting that informed consent was freely given by [CONTACT_476825] s/her legal 
representative. For non -English speaking subjects, the written informed consent should be 
translated into the subject’s native language, or a short form (including the elements of informed consent translated into the subject’s native language) should be used. The informed 
consent process should be documented in each subject’s medical record.   
The subject or his/her legal representative must receive a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form.  
The Investigator shall inform the subject of any new significant findings occurring during the clinical investigation, including the need for additional medical care that may be required, that 
may be relevant to the subject and his/her willingness to continue participation in the study. The consent form should be updated or amended whenever such new inf ormation becomes 
available and updated consent shall be recorded.  
15.8 Termination of the Study  
Keystone Heart Ltd. reserves the right to terminate the study but intends only to exercise this 
right for valid scientific or administrative reasons and reasons related to protection of patients. Possible reasons for early trial termination include:  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs) present an unreasonable risk to patients  
• Recommendation from the DSM B 
If the trial is terminated early, the Sponsor will provide a written statement to the Investigators to enable notification of the IRBs/ECs. The Sponsor will also inform the FDA and the relevant Competent Authority (where required). In the case of early termination of trial enrollment, follow -up visits will cont inue for all enrolled subjects.  
The S ponsor may terminate an investigator’s or site’s participation in the study if there is 
evidence of an investigator’s failure to maintain adequate clinical standards or evidence of an investigator or staff’s failure to comply with the protocol. Should investigator or site

Clinical Frailty Scale  A me asure of frailty based on clinical judgement, scored 
according to the following categories108: 
1. Very Fit  – People who are robust, active, energetic, and 
motivated. These people commonly exercise regularly . 
They are among the fittest for their age.  
2. Well – People who have no active disease symptoms but 
are less f it than Category 1. Often, they exercise or are very 
active occasionally, e.g., seasonally.  
3. Managing Well  – People whose medical problems are 
well controlled, but are not regulatory active beyond routine 
walking.  
4. Vulnerable  – While not dependent on o thers for daily 
help, often symptoms limit activities. A common complaint is 
being “slowed up,” and/or being tired during the day.  
5. Mildly Frail – These people often have more evident 
slowing, and need help in high order independent activities 
of daily living (finances, transportation, heavy housework, 
medications). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], mild frailty progressively impairs 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_476722], meal preparation, and 
housework.  
6. Moderately Frail  – People need help with all outside 
activities and with  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_476723]. Inside, they often have 
problems with stairs and need help with bathing, and might 
need minimal assistance (cuing, standby) with dressing.  
7. Severely Frail  – Completely dependent for personal care, 
from whatever cause (physical or cognitive). Even so, they 
seem stable and not at high risk of dying (within ~6 months).  
8. Very Severely Frail  – Completely dependent, 
approaching the end of life. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], they could not recover 
even from a minor illness.

applies to people with a life expectancy < 6 months, who are 
not otherwise evidently frail.  
Based on the above categories, subjects also will be 
classified as Not Frail (Category 1- 3), Mildly Frail (Category

[ZIP_CODE].3 Appendix III: Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD M EDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_611498] the health of the people. The physician'sknowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with t he words,
"The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of MedicalEthics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical carewhich might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient."
4. Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentationinvolving human subjects.
5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being of the hum an
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic,
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of
disease. Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuouslybe challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.
7. In current medical practice and in medical research,  most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures involve risks and burdens.
8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and
protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need special
protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must berecognized. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent forthemselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for those who will notbenefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research is combined with care.
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for
research on human subjects  in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements.
No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of
the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration.
B. BASIC PRINCIPLE S FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
10. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity ofthe human subject.
11. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles,be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information,
and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.
12. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the environment,
and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
[ADDRESS_611499], the confidentiality of the patient's 
information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
22. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and pot ential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. 
The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has under stood 
the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely -given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written consent must be 
formally documented and witnessed.  
23. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well -informed physi cian who is 
not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
24. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally 
authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included 
in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
25. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
REFLECT – US IDE Trial [CIP -09 (v13.0)]         Keyston e Heart Ltd.  
128 
 26. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance 
consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed 
consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving 
research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The 
protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
27. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the 
investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results 
should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of  interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of experimentation 
not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
a. T he physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the research 
is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the patients who are research subjects.  
b. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use 
of placebo,  or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic 
method exists. See footnote  
c. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of access to 
the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by [CONTACT_1758]. See footnote  
d. The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the patient -physi cian 
relationship.  
e. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's 
judgment it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, 
these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.  
Note : Note of clarification on paragraph [ADDRESS_611500] be taken in making use of a placebo- controlled 
trial and that in general this methodology should only be used in the absence of existing proven therapy. However, a placebo- controlled trial may be ethically acceptable, even if proven therapy is available, under the 
following circumstances:  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons its use is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method; or  
• Where a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method is being investigated for a minor condition and 
the patients who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk of serious or irreversible harm.  
All other provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki must be adhered to, especially the need for appropriate ethical 
and scientific review.

Person Administering Scale _____________________________________  
Administer stroke scale items in the order listed.  Record per formance in each category after each subscale exam.  Do not go 
back and change scores.  Follow directions pr ovided for each exam technique.  Scores should reflect what the patient does, not 
what the clinician thinks the patient can do.  The clinician should record answers while administering the exam and work quickl y. 
Except where indicated, the patient s hould not be coached (i.e., repeated requests to patient to make a special effort). 
Instructions   Scale Definition Score 
1a.  Level of Consciousness: The investigator must choose a 
response if a full evaluation is pr evented by [CONTACT_198992], language barrier, orotracheal trauma/bandages.  A 
3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than reflexive posturing) in response to  noxious stimulation.  0 =    Alert;  keenly responsive. 
 1 = Not alert; but arousable by [CONTACT_198993], 
answer, or respond. 
 2 = Not alert; requires repeated stimulation to attend, or is 
obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to 
make movements (not stereotyped). 
 3 = Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or 
totally  unresponsive, flaccid, and areflexic. ______ 
1b.  LOC Questions:   The patient is asked the month and his/her age. 
The answer must be correct - there is  no partial credit for being close.  
Aphasic and stuporous patients w ho do not comprehend the questions 
will score 2.  Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, 
language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are 
given a 1.  It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not "help" the patient  with verbal or non-verbal cues.  0 = Answers both questions correctly. 
 1 = Answers one question correctly. 
 2 = Answers neither question correctly.  ______ 
1c.  LOC Commands:   The patient is asked to open and close the 
eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand.  Substitute another one step command if the hands cannot be used.  Credit is 
given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to 
weakness.  If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result 
scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands).  Patients with 
trauma, amputation, or other phy sical impediments should be given 
suitable one-step commands.  Only the first attempt is scored.  0 = Performs  both tasks correctly. 
 1 = Performs  one task correctly. 
 2 = Performs  neither task correctly. ______ 
2. Best Gaze:   Only horizontal eye movements will be tested.
Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored, but caloric testing is not done.  If the patient 
has a conjugate 
deviation of the eyes that can be ov ercome by [CONTACT_198994], the score will be 1.  If a patient has an isolated peripheral 
nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1.  Gaze is testable in all 
aphasic patients.  Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing 
blindness, or other disorder of vis ual acuity or fields should be tested 
with reflexive movements, and a choice made by [CONTACT_093]. 
Establishing eye contact [CONTACT_198995] t he presence of a partial gaze palsy.   0 = Normal.  
 1 = Partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, 
but forced deviation or total gaze paresis is not present. 
 2 = Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by [CONTACT_198996]. ______

3. Visual:   Visual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by
[CONTACT_55908], using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate. 
Patients may
 be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the 
moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal.  If there is 
unilateral blindness or enucleation, vi sual fields in the remaining eye 
are scored.  Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including 
quadrantanopia, is found.  If patient is blind from any cause, score 3. Double simultaneous stimulation is perfo rmed at this point.  If there is 
extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to respond to 
item 11.  0 = No visual loss.  
 1 = Partial hemianopia. 
 2 = Complete hemianopia.  
 3 = Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness). ______ 
4. Facial Palsy:   Ask – or use pantomime to encourage – the patient
to show
 teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes.  Score symmetry of 
grimace in response to noxious st
imuli in the poorly responsive or 
non-comprehending patient.  If faci al trauma/bandages, orotracheal 
tube, tape or other physical barriers obscure the face, these should be removed to the extent possible.  0 = Normal symmetrical movements. 
 1 = Minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on 
smiling). 
 2 = Partial paralysis (total or near-total paralysis of lower 
face). 
 3 = Complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of 
facial movement in the upper and lower face). ______ 
5. Motor Arm:  The limb is placed in the appropriate position: extendthe arms (palms down) 90 degrees  (if sitting) or 45 degrees (if 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). 
 Drift is scored if the arm falls before [ADDRESS_611522] the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.   0 =  No drift;  limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds. 
  1 =  Drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before 
full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support. 
  2 =  Some effort against gravity;  limb cannot get to or 
maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, 
but has some effort against gravity. 
  3 =  No effort against gravity;  limb falls. 
  4 =  No movement.   UN = Amputation or joint fusion, explain:  _____________________

6. Motor Leg:   The limb is placed in the appropriate position:  hold
the leg at 30 degrees (always tested supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  Drift is scored if the leg 
falls before [ADDRESS_611523] the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the 
explanation for this choice.   0 =  No drift;  leg holds 30-degree position for full 5 seconds. 
  1 =  Drift; leg falls by [CONTACT_2671] 5-second period but does 
not hit bed.    
  2 =  Some effort against gravity;  leg falls to bed by [ADDRESS_611524] gravity.

7.  Limb Ataxia:   This item is aimed at finding evidence of a unilateral 
cerebellar lesion.  Test with eyes open.  In case of visual defect, 
ensure testing is done in intact vis ual field.  The finger-nose-finger 
and heel-shin tests are performed on both sides, and ataxia is scored only if present out of proportion to weakness.  Ataxia is absent in the patient who cannot understand or is paralyzed.  Only in the case of 
amputation or joint fusion, the examiner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.  In 
case of blindness, test by [CONTACT_198997].  0 = Absent. 
 
 1 = Present in one limb.  
  2 = Present in two limbs.  
 
 UN = Amputation or joint fusion, explain:  ________________ 
     ______ 
 
  
 
8.  Sensory:   Sensation or grimace to pi[INVESTIGATOR_55855], or 
withdrawal from noxious stimulus  in the obtunded or aphasic patient.  
Only sensory loss attributed to st roke is scored as abnormal and the 
examiner should test as many body areas (arms [not hands], legs, 
trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss.  A 
score of 2, “severe or total s ensory loss,” should only be given when 
a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated.  
Stuporous and aphasic patients will, therefore, probably score 1 or 0. 
The patient with brainstem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2.  If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic, score 
2.  Patients in a coma (item 1a=3) are automatically given a 2 on this 
item.  0 = Normal;  no sensory loss. 
  1 = Mild-to-moderate sensory loss;  patient feels pi[INVESTIGATOR_198948]; or there is a 
loss of superficial pain with pi [INVESTIGATOR_29107], but patient is aware 
of being touched. 
  2 = Severe to total sensory loss;  patient is not aware of 
being touched in the face, arm, and leg.   
  
 
______ 
9.  Best Language:   A great deal of information about comprehension 
will be obtained during the preceding se ctions of the examination.  
For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], to name [CONTACT_199000].  
Comprehension is judged from responses  here, as well as to all of 
the commands in the preceding general  neurological exam.  If visual 
loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech.  The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a coma (item 1a=3) will 
automatically score [ADDRESS_611527] choose a 
score for the patient with stupor or limited cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one-step 
commands.  0 = No aphasia;  normal. 
 
 1 =  Mild-to-moderate aphasia;  some obvious loss of fluency 
or facility of comprehension, without significant 
limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression.  
Reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, 
makes conversation about prov ided materials difficult 
or impossible.  For example, in conversation about 
provided materials, examiner  can identify pi[INVESTIGATOR_198949]’s response. 
  2 = Severe aphasia;  all communication is through fragmentary 
expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing 
by [CONTACT_158711].  Range of information that can be exchanged is 
limited; listener carries burden of communication.  Examiner cannot identify materials prov ided from patient response. 
  3 = Mute, global aphasia;  no usable speech or auditory 
comprehension.  
 
  
 
  
 
 ______ 
10.  Dysarthria:  If patient is thought to be normal, an adequate 
sample of speech must be obtained by [CONTACT_198998].  If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be 
rated.  Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barriers to 
producing speech, the examiner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice.  Do 
not tell the patient why he or she is being tested.  0 = Normal. 
 1 = Mild-to-moderate dysarthria;  patient slurs at least some 
words and, at worst, can be understood with some 
difficulty. 
 2 = Severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so slurred as to be 
unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric. 
UN = Intubated  or other physical barrier,

11. Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect):   Sufficient
information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior 
testing.  If the patient has a seve re visual loss preventing visual 
double 
simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are 
normal, the score is normal.  If the patient has aphasia but does appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal.  The presence of 
visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality.  Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the 
item is never untestable.    0 = No abnormality. 
 1 = Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention  
or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one 
of the sensory modalities. 
 2 = Profound hemi-inattention or extinction to more than 
one modality; does not recognize own hand or orients 
to only one side of space. ______

[ZIP_CODE].8 Appendix VIII : Angiographic Imaging Acquisition Guidelines  
REFLECT TRIAL  
Angiographic Acquisition Guidelines 
 All angiograms should be obtained paying strict attention to the following features:  
1.Acquire  all standard procedural fluoroscopic/ angiograms in DICOM format  at the
highest magnification which will still incorporate the entire segment of the aortic arch
and the ostia of the 3 major cerebral vessel takeoffs (innominate, left carotid and leftsubcla vian).
2.All images should have subject identifiers removed prior to uploading images to theweb-based image transfer system. Imaging studies should be appropriately labeled
with Study Name, site ID, subject ID and date that the imaging study was performed.
3.Submit  the best LAO projection for  assessment of the Aortic Arch and the 3 major
cerebral vessel takeoffs (innominate, left carotid and left subclavian) . If renal
dysfunction or other clinical concerns limit contrast administration, angiogr aphy of the
innominate artery alone is sufficient. All subsequent fluor oscopic/angiographic images
should be taken using the same LAO projection that was used for the initialassessment.
4.Submit  f
luoroscopic images  using the initial arch projection  to document proper dev ice
positioning at the following recommended time points:
•After  deployment of the TriGuard™ HDH or TriGUARD 3, angiography of the
device and the entire arch is strongly recommended and can be done during or
after pi[INVESTIGATOR_476753] .
•Tracking of the TAVR del ivery system to the aortic annulus
•Final deployment of the first prosthetic valve
•Removal of the TAVR delivery system  (after any additional post -dilatation or
additional valve implantations have been completed)
•If the position of the TriGuard™ HDH or TriGUARD [ADDRESS_611541] image of any device complication  or malfunction

CTA Acquisition Guidelines (CIP-09-2 ver  03)   Confidential Page 4 1.0 Background
Cardiac Multi -Detector  Computed Tomographic Angiography (Cardiac M DCT Angiography)
is intended to evaluate aortic valve anatomy, aortic root dimensions for prosthetic valve
sizing, and assessment of the aorta  and peripheral vessel s for anatomy and disease burden.
The CT scan results will be used for assessment of the aort ic arch for compliance with
positioning of Keystone Heart TriGuard ™ as well as planning the best fluoroscopy angle for 
the procedure.  Assessment of the ileo -femoral arteries will indicate if the peripheral arteries
anatomy can accommodate the TriGuard  delivery system.
2.0 Equipment 
•Multi -detector CT scanner (64 -slice minimum) with ECG -gating capability.
oThe scans  submitted for analysis of the aortic root should be ECG -gated ; non-
gated scans in areas with cardiac motion lead to measurement inaccuracy  and
therefore incomplete information for device selection .
oAbdominal aorta and p eripheral vessel image acquisition may be non -gated .
•Dual-source scanner pr eferred due to enhanced temporal resolution and reduced
motion artifacts.
3.0 Scans 
1)Chest Topogram .
2)Prospective ECG -gated non -contrast scan of aortic  root and thoracic aorta .
3)Retrospective ECG -gated contrast enhanced scan of the aortic root  and thoracic aorta,
immediately followed by n on ECG -gated contrast enhanced scan of the abdominal
aorta and periphe ral vessels .*
*If CT scanner is incapable of sequential ECG -gated to non -ECG gated scan, the contrast
enhanced CT study can be performed using retrospective ECG -gating in its entirety.
4.[ADDRESS_611546] coronary
angiogram  / aortogram . The aim is to first evaluate the degree of calcification in the aortic
valve, and then to obtain adequate contrast in the following region s of interest: endo -luminal
surface for v isualization of left heart, aorta, and peripheral access vessels (i.e., femoral
arteries ). Temporal resolution should be optimized to reduce motion artifact. Spatial
resolution should be as high as possible (goal is smallest isotropic voxel size).
4.1 Step  1: Patient Preparation
•Administer medication per institution standard practice for CT scanning.
•Attach ECG electrodes for gating of scan. Verify quality of ECG tracing on scanner
console.
•Prepare intravenous line for administration of contrast media.
•Assess heart rate variability during breath -hold.
CTA Acquisition Guidelines (CIP-09-2 ver  03)   Confidential Page 5 4.2 Step 2: Chest Topogram
•A chest topogram can be used to plan subsequent imaging.
Figure CTA -1: Example image of chest topogram
4.3 Step 3:  Prospective ECG -gated non -contrast scan of aortic root
The aim of this scan is to quantify the extent of calcium in the aortic valve  and aorta,
equivalent to scans calculating a coronary calcium score  (e.g. Aga tston score) .
1.The submitted scan should cover the area  from the temporal -mandibular -joint (TMJ)
to the diaphragm  to encompass the entire heart, aortic arch and thoracic aorta.
2.Prospective ECG -gating  with sequential slice acquisition is preferred .
3.Scan at p eak voltage of 120kVp with tube current of 14 0-150 mAs tube current .
4.Slice thickness 2.5 -3.0 mm with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22347] 1 .
4.4 Step 4: ECG -gated contrast enhanced scan of the aortic root  and thoracic
aorta, and non-ECG gated contrast enhanced scan of abdominal aorta and
peripheral vessels
The aim of this scan is to assess the anatomy of the aortic root , aortic arch and cerebral
vessels, thoracic / abdominal aorta, and peripheral vessels  (please refer to Table 1 below for
suggested parameters) .

CTA Acquisition Guidelines (CIP-09-2 ver  03)   Confidential Page 6 1.The optimal scan  would include  the area from the temporal -mandibular -joint (TMJ) to
the mid-thigh , using  dynamic 4D acquisition and retrospective ECG -gating  from the
TMJ to the diaphragm (to evaluate the aortic root, aortic arch, cerebral vessels and
thoracic aorta), followed by a non -ECG -gated scan from the diaphragm to the mid -
thigh (to evaluate the abdomi nal aorta and peripheral vessels). If a sequential ECG -
gated/non -ECG gated study is not available , the entire study could be performed using
retrospective ECG -gating.
2.Detector collimation is 0.4 -0.625mm.
3.Slice thickness is ≤ 0.8mm.
4.Peak voltage of 120kVp w ith tube current from [ADDRESS_611547] Enhanced Scan  Acquisition Procedure
•Prepare iodinated contrast injection apparatus ( suggested  scan parameters are
provided in Table 1).
•Ensure availability of immediate treatments in case of contrast allergy.
•Set up scan parameters.
•Instruct patient to lie still duri ng scan, even if they experience warmth or tingling due
to the injection of contrast.
•Initiate contrast injection.
•When contrast rea ches threshold at bolus -tracking location, instruct patient to hold
breath at end -inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], then initiate main scan.
•At completion of scan , verify scan is of adequate quality.
•Record amount of contrast given.
•Record heart rate average and range.
•Record dose -length -product
4.4.[ADDRESS_611548] -processing  Procedure
•Verify heart rate ECG triggers are at consistent place in cardiac cycle, edit if
necessary. Additional editing/removal of arrhythmias may be performed.
•Reconstruct at multiple phases (20 p referred, increments of 5 -10%), with ≤0.8mm
slice thickness. If the system has the capability, also reconstruct a “best systolic” and
“best diastolic” phase.
4.5 Step 5: Submission of CT data
All available CT data should be sent electronically to the data center (Core Laboratory).
•Data should be stored in DICOM 3.0 format, not DICOMDAT.
•Submitted images must have patient identifiers (protected health information (PHI)
such as name, date of birth, medical record number) removed at time of image
transfer to  the data center.
•Please use the following during anonymization:

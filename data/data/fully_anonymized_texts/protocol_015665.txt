1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United S tates. Given the magnitude of 
the problem, interventions aimed at promoting smoking cessation have the potential to make large changes 
in improving health outcomes. Resources to aid with smoking cessation such as telephone -based 
counseling are generally un derutilized. The electronic medical record (EMR) in use at Johns Hopkins has 
limited decision support to promote referral to the Maryland Quit Line, a free smoking cessation counseling 
resource. We propose a  cluster randomized trial with a waitlist control  at 22 Johns  Hopkins Community 
Physicians (JHCP) sites, which offer primary care . The intervention  will include a multi -modality 
intervention to promote provider use of smoking cessation resources  which include an E pic-based Best 
Practice Advisory  (BPA)  that allows providers to electronically refer to the Maryland State Quit  Line, 
educational materials, and provider visits with Quit  Line representatives to review use of smoking cessation 
practices (academic detailing) . Sites will be randomized to one of thr ee arms  with increasing support : 1) 
six-month waitlist control ; 2) BPA with optional educational modules ; 3) BPA with online educational 
modules , a quick -reference educational document , and  additional academic detailing. We hypothesize that 
by [CONTACT_67940]  a new Epic B PA that allows providers to easily refer to the Maryland Quit Line 
electronically, we will increase use of this  resource . We also hypothesize that adding additional educational 
materials and having Quit Line representatives perform educational  outreach visits will further increase use 
of the Quit Line and will increase prescription of medications to assist with smoking cessation. Ultimately 
we hope to improve patient care by [CONTACT_118130]' us e the Maryland Quit Line and pharmacotherapy . 
We hope that the use of these resources will decrease smoking rates and thereby  [CONTACT_118131].  
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
The primary goal of this study is to test t he effectiveness of instituting an Epic BPA in increasing  
Maryland Quit Line referrals. The secondary goals are to measure the BPA’s  effect  and the effect of  
additional provider education on patient engagement with the Quit Line, and on prescription of med ications 
that aid in smoking cessation.  A third goal is to obtain initial provider feedback on the BPA to inform roll -
out of this BPA across the health system.  
 
Aim 1 : In a three -arm, cluster randomized trial, to t est the effectiveness of an Epic BPA  with provider 
educational support and provider detailing  in provision of smoking cessation services.

 Hypothesis 1 : An Epic -based BPA to prompt providers to electronically refer people who are ready to quit 
smoking to the Maryland Quit Line will increase use  of this service  compared to waitlist control.   
 
Hypothesis 2 : An Epic -based BPA supplemented with educational materials and academic detailing will 
increase Quit -Line referral compared to control.  
 
Hypothesis 3: Additional provider support including educa tional materials, in -person academic detailing,  
will increase successful referrals to the Quit Line and prescription of cessation pharmacotherapy  compared 
to waitlist control and BPA only   
 
 
3. Background   
Smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death in the United Sates. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_118129], the burden of disease caused by [CONTACT_118132].1 22.2% of adults in the 
U.S. smoke, and 18.4% smoke daily.[ADDRESS_131959] on phy sician prescribing behaviors.8 We hope to use 
a multi -modality educational intervention, including academ ic detailing, to enhance the effects of the EMR 
tools and increase use of smoking cessation resources.  
By [CONTACT_118133], facilitating use of  the Q uit Line, and educating clinicians 
about counseling and pharmacotherapy, we hope to im prove the use of these services and increase 
engagement between clinicians and patients about smoking cessation  and to ultimately decrease smoking 
across the health system   
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedur es (distinguish research procedures 
from those that are part of routine care ). 
Overview : We propose a cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness of an E pic-based BPA with and 
without  supplemental education and academic detailing on 1 ) Quit Line referrals , 2) Patient Quit  Line 
engagement , 3) Prescription of pharmacotherapy , and 4 ) Smoking cessation. To this end, we will 
randomize the 35 sites from Johns Hopkins Community Physicians to one of three arms: 1) Cluster C: no 
intervention initially, BPA ad ded after 6 months ; 2) Cluster B: BPA alone  with emailed link to MD  Quit 
Line educational material ; 3) Cluster A: BPA with online educational modules, a quick -reference 
educational document, and additional academic detailing . Outcom es will be assessed at 6  and 12 months.

 Concept ual Model :  
 
 
Study design : This will be a waitlist -control,  cluster randomized trial . JHCP sites will be randomized 
to Arm A (BPA plus educational interventions), Arm B (BPA only), or Arm C (control group, no 
intervention).  After  6 months, Cluster C will be granted access to the BPA.  
 
Study Population : The study will include all JHCP practices and primary care providers at those sites. 
JHCP is the largest health specialty group practice in Maryland and cares for over 230,[ADDRESS_131960] 18 year s of age and will be active smokers as 
indicated in the EMR.  
 
Recruitment : All JHCP sites that provide adult primary care will  be included.   Providers (physicians 
and office health professionals like CMAs) will be the target of the intervention. Patients will not 
directly know about the study but there will be a  smoking cessation  handout available at each office if 
patients are interested.  
 
Consent : Because this is an evaluation of an EMR intervention, looking at outcomes in aggregate  only, 
not by [CONTACT_118134], we are applying for a waiver of consent.  
 
Randomization : Randomizati on to one of the three clusters will occur at the level of each JHCP site. 
Sites will be stratified by [CONTACT_118135] a randomization  sequence will be generated by [CONTACT_118136].  
 
Intervention : There are several components to the interventio n: 
 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 4 of 11 
 1. BPA : The BPA is an Epic prompt that fires when a provider opens an encounter with a patient 
who is actively smoking. Providers will be asked to assess smoking cessation readiness and to refer 
patients to the free Maryland Quit Line if the patient is re ceptive. The Quit Line will receive an 
electronic referral with the patient’s details. A Quit Line certified smoking cessation counselor will 
then call the patient at a later date and provide counseling. Receptive patient will receive up to four 
calls. The y will receive counseling from a trained quit coach and be offered free access to NRT.    
2. Quit Line : This free telephone -based counseling service is offered to smoker in Maryland. 
Services offered include on -the-phone smoking cessation counseling and free nicotine replacement.  
3. Consolidated educational hand out : A one -page hand out will be sent to providers 
electronically for quick reference. The hand out will include a summarization of counseling, 
pharmacotherapy, cessation referrals, and coding for cessati on counseling.  
4. Online modules : Providers will be directed to optional, self -paced educational modules. The 
Maryland HABITS program is a series of online modules that include  general concepts in smoking 
cessation, pharmacotherapy, and counseling skills. The modules are text and video based and can be 
completed in about one hour. Providers can also watch example videos of interviews using these 
skills.   
5. Academic detailing : Academic detailing is a tool in which educators visit providers in their 
practice setti ng, assessing their knowledge base, providing targeted education on a specific topic, 
and reinforcing the major points of the education.[ADDRESS_131961] one -on-one question and answer sessions 
exploring the providers' views on counseling, practices, and knowledge about medications and 
community resources. The counselors will provide teaching to each provider based on their 
individual level of knowle dge and openness to the education.  
Detailing as operationalized accommodate d individual practice level concerns related to provider 
time and burden. As such, detailing occurred as an interactive group educational session conducted 
with a tobacco session ex perts that was initially offered in -person only and later expanded to 
include live -webinar with the goal of increasing uptake by [CONTACT_39487].  
 
 
Sites will be randomized to three arms:  
 
Arm  A: At JHCP sites randomized to Arm A, clinicians will receive an ema il describing the new 
smoking BPA, educational materials offered, and  a small tutorial on using the BPA and a  new smoking 
cessation smart set in Epic.  Education materials will include the educational hand out and academic 
detailing from Maryland Quit Line counselors .  
Arm  B: At JHCP sites randomized to Arm B, clinicians will receive an email describing the BPA and 
order set , along with internet links to MD Quit Line without additional supplemental education. This 
will allow us to compare use of the BPA alon e to the BPA plus supplemental education . 
 
Arm  C: This last Arm will serve as the waitlist control, receiving no intervention initially. After six 
months, clinicians in Arm C will receive either the BPA intervention  similar to Arm B without 
additional educ ation  or BPA + education, similar to ARM A   Arm C not only serves as a control 
condition, but also allows for the gradual roll out of the BPA across JHCP to ensure that the MD state 
Quit Line can handle the increase in referral volume.   
   
These three arms  will help us determine how best to roll out this BPA across the Hopkins Health 
System.

Control : JHCP sites randomized to Arm C will receive no intervention, serving as controls for the first 
6 months of the trial period. After six months, Arm C will  be randomized to  receive  either  the Epic 
BPA  or the BPA + education. .

Provider feedback on BPA:  
We will obtain initial provider feedback on the BPA [ADDRESS_131962] site (to verify that BPA was active), years in practice and provider type. On the survey  we will 
include the statement that participating in this surve y serves as consent to the study. To protect 
confidentiality, no names or DOB will be collected. Data will be stored on the Johns Hopkins Secure 
Server and site data will be presented only in aggregate, by [CONTACT_118137] (e.g. we will not report on individual 
sites, but rather by [CONTACT_118138]).

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_131963] current therapy stopped.  
The control group will receive routine care  from th eir provider, which can include counseling, 
pharmacotherapy, and Quit  Line referral.   The study will not prevent any provider from assisting 
smokers to quit with all guideline -based care.  
 
e. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
While implementing the BPA to increase electronic referrals to the Quit  Line is quite easy since the 
interface is already built, it is important for the health system to determine the added value of additional 
training for providers to use this referral effe ctively. We think a delay of 6 months in the added training 
does not increase risk beyond expected benefits. In addition, the Maryland State Quit  Line will need 
this time to see if they can handle the increased volume.  
To evaluate the effectiveness for the  BPA, we feel a control group is needed. Arm B (the 
educational control) is necessary to evaluate whether the BPA with education is better than a BPA 
launched alone without education.

7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable . 
• Provider electronic referrals to the Maryland Quit line  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
• Patient prescribed nicotine replacement, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], or varenicline  
• Patient engagement with Quit Line (number of interactions, us e of services)  
• Patient -reported smoking cessation  after 1 year  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
Based on prior research with  a comparable tool used in the inpatient setting  where compared to control arm 
physi cians, intervention physicians were more likely to order tobacco treatment medication (24% v. 9%, P 
= 0.0001, Fisher's exact test), and make a referral to the state smokers' quitline (19% v. 0%, P < 0.[ADDRESS_131964] a 20% absolute increase  in the percenta ge of the population of active smokers who are referred to 
the Quit Line  among providers that receive the BPA, and a 30% increase  among providers receiving the 
BPA + educational materials/detailing , compared to the control condition . Our main outcome,  is quitline 
referral , which is a dichotomous outcome. We will use logistic regression accounting for clustering by [CONTACT_118139] -line referral between the BPA only arm, and the waitlist 
control  (B vs C) , the BPA + educat ion and the waitlist control  (A vs C) , and the BPA + educational 
materials  arm and the BPA only arm (A vs B) . The two primary testing contrasts will be B vs C and A vs 
C, each will be evaluated at type I error of 0.[ADDRESS_131965] of A vs B is exploratory in nature, to estimate the potential 
incremental increase in quitline referral with additional provider education. The difference in % referral 
between arms and its corre sponding 95% CI will be calculated. Due to the design of cluster randomization 
by [CONTACT_21127], provider level and patient level characteristics that are not balanced by [CONTACT_118140].  
 
In this [ADDRESS_131966]  7 JHCP sites per arm, with an average cluster size of 1000 smokers per site 
(based on current patient numbers in the clinics, number of smokers, and proportion willing to qu it). 
Assuming i ntracluster correlation  of 0.1, and a 5% quitli ne referral in the control Arm C, we will have 
88.6% power to detect a 20% absolute increase in quitline referral in  Arm B when testing the contrast of B 
vs C using a Z -test at  type I error of 0.025, and 99.4% power to detect a 30% absolute increase in qui tline 
referral in Arm A when testing the contrast of A vs C using a Z -test at  type I error of 0.025.   
 
For the survey, qualitative answers will be read by [CONTACT_6283]. Wadlin and Chander, and coded for recurrent 
themes. These themes will then be summarized for stu dy investigator to inform future roll out of the BPA.  
Quantitative data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There are approximately 190 providers at 
JHCP. We anticipate that 2/[ADDRESS_131967] interacted with the BPA, as part of the in itial BPA roll 
out. Thus our maximum sample size is 125 providers.

d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
None expected.  
 
e. Financial risk s to the participant s. 
Financial risk to participants will be minimal but may include the cost of medications they 
would have otherwise not been prescribed.  
f. Risks Related to Survey Administration: To protect confidentiality, no names or DOB will be 
collec ted. Data will be stored on the Johns Hopkins Secure Server and site data will be 
presented only in aggregate, by [CONTACT_118137] (e.g. we will not report on individual sites, but rather by 
[CONTACT_118138]).  
 
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefi ts for the participant and for society . 
 
Patients:  All p atients will have improved access to smoking cessation  support through the state Quit 
Line. Some patients will have this support immediately and some after 6 months.   
 
Providers:  Providers will benef it from access to materials to improve the medical knowledge. They 
will have access to tools that will make prescribe more efficient, potentially improving work flow. 
If patients quit as a results of these interventions, the provider’s quality metrics will  improve.   
 
Society: As discussed previously, smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death in 
the [LOCATION_002]. If our intervention is show n to improve use of state Quit Line, and especially if it 
shows an improvement in successful smoking ce ssation, it may serve as a model for implementation 
more broadly. Such a finding may also be used for continued funding of the BPA and electronic 
referral system.    
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total co mpensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
We do not plan to provide  compensation to medical providers or patients.  
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to partici pants and identify who 
will pay for them.  
There are no direct costs associated with this trial.

Template  1015045  Version 5.0 13 of 60  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1  The Baha Systems  
The Cochlear Baha bone conduction systems offers two alternative  ways to transmit vibrations from 
the external sound processor to the  osseointegrated implant:  The Baha Connect System uses a ski n-
penetrating abutment and allows direct bone conduction. T he passive  Baha Attract System uses a 
magnetic connection through intact  skin. Magnetic conduction have the advantage over skin -
penetrating  systems of eliminating the daily cleaning , reduction in r eported adverse skin reactions  of 
the implant  site and are perceived as  more cosmetically appealing by [CONTACT_789862]. The skin -
penetrating abutment of the traditional Baha System is seen as a barrie r for many candidates. The 
passive Baha Attract System was  developed in  consideration of all these feature s and  incorporates 
implantable and external parts  as illustrated in  Figure 1 . 
 
Figure 1: The passive Baha Attract System   
The sound processor (1) is connected (via a snap coupling) to the sound processor mag net (2), 
which, together with the implant magnet (3), constitute the transcutaneous coupling. The implant 
magnet is fixated to the titanium implant (4).  
Both Baha Systems make use of the same exter nal sound processors and are built on the same 
implantable  platform, the osseointegrated BI300 Implant . Both systems have been proven t o be safe 
and effective through years of clinical use  and data from clinical investigations1, 2, 3. While the Baha 
Connec t System enables direct bone conduction through the percut aneous implant, the passive 
transcutaneous Baha Attract System offers less efficient bone conduction (especially at high 
frequencies) due to attenuation of sound vibrations through the intact skin t hat separates the external 
transducer from the osseointegr ated implant.  
 
1.1.2  The ATB System  
The ATB System ( Osseointeg rated Steady State Implant  System ) is developed to provide the benefit s 
of a non -skin-penetrating system  combined with the benefits of a skin -penetrating system . Compared 
to the passive transcutaneous  Baha Attract System, the ATB System will provide a more efficient 
transmission of sound, especially in the high frequency range, as the implantable transducer 
eliminates the attenuation of sound vi brations through the soft tissue that is inherent to the p assive 
system. With the ATB System it will also be possible to position the transducer closer to the ear canal, 
which may further improve audiological outcomes.   
 
 
 
  
   
CBAS5539  CIP Version [ADDRESS_1088021] bone -conduction throu gh an 
implanted actuator on the osseointegrated BI300 Implant (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2:  The ATB System  
The ATB System function as follows:  
• The external sound processor - SP (1) captures and digi tally processes sound  
• The SP transmits power and digital i nformation to the internal implant (2)  
• The implant converts the digital information into a an electric analogue implant (3)  
• This electric signal is transmitted to the actuator (4)  
• The actuator conv erts the electric signal to vibrations that are transmi tted to the mastoid bone 
trough the osseointegrated BI300 Implant  (5) 
 
With t he ATB System the following transition  paths have been established : 
• From a traditional percutaneous solution – the Baha Conn ect System  
• Via a magnetic connection solution (Baha Attrac t System ) with better aesthetics but limited 
performance due to skin attenuation, especially in the high frequency area  
• To the ATB System which combines aesthetics with higher performance to meet th e needs of 
subjec ts with mixed hearing loss . The target fi tting range is 55dB Sensorineural hearing loss 
(SNHL).  In addition, since the actuator creating the vibration  is connected directly to the 
BI300 Implant , the attenuation of higher frequencies that o ccurs when using the Baha Attract  
System , could be avoided .  
1.2 Aim 
The aim of the investigation is to demonstrate that the ATB System provides an improvement in 
hearing outcomes and quality of life compared to unaided hearing in patients with a conductive or  
mixed hearing loss  or single -sided sensorineural deafness  (SSD).  
The aim is also to measure  and present preoperative audiological test  results with a Baha  BP110 
Power Sound P rocessor on a Baha Softband  in relation to the Investigational device. S afety 
parameters will be collected.

2 MEDICAL DEVICE (S) USED DUR ING AND AFTER THE 
INVESTIGATION  
2.1 Investigational device  
2.1.1  Description  of the investigational device(s)  
The ATB System is intended for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, or single -sided 
sensorineural deafness (SSD). Patients should have sufficient  bone quality and quantity to support 
successful implant placement . This system should only be used by [CONTACT_23872], qualified professionals. 
The ATB System has a fitting ra nge of up to 55 dB SNHL  bone conduction threshold in mixed 
hearing loss.  
The regulatory classification  of the system is expected to be Class  III active implantable medical 
device (AIMD) in the EU  and Class II or III in the US1. The instruments of the ATB System that have 
previously been CE marked and FDA cleared for the current  Baha or Cochle ar Implant (CI) systems 
maintain their  current classification . The BI300 Implant will also maintain its classi fication in the EU 
(Class IIb) and in the US (Class II).  
Figure 3:  The ATB System  parts :1 Sound Processor, 2 Receiver , 3 Stimulator , 4 
Actuator, 5 BI300 Implant, 6 Lead  
 
 
 
 
 
The ATB S ystem (F igure 3) consists of the following components:  
Button sound processor  (1):  
The ATB Sound Processor (SP) consists of an all -in-one off -the-ear button p rocessor: processing unit 
with active coil, magnet (with s even possible strengths), and two battery cells. The ATB SP has 
identical hardware as the  CP950 Sound Processor  for Cochlear I mplants, but with ATB specific 
firmware. The ATB SP will commercially be  referred to  Osia™ Sound Processor . 
The sound is pi[INVESTIGATOR_789853]. It is sent to the 
active coil which transmits the signal to the implant coil. The processing unit also contains light 
emitting diodes (LED) a nd one command button, which allows the patient to control  the processing 
unit e.g. switching the sound processor on/off. Power to the sound processor is provided by [CONTACT_1192] 675 
Zinc-Air batteries which are accessed by [CONTACT_789863]. A SoftWear  Pad (also used 
with the Baha A ttract Sound Processor Magn et) will be available, which distributes the force imposed 
by [CONTACT_789864] p oint pressures on the skin ( Figure 4). Complete information for the A TB 
SP is found in the user manual  4.

ATB-Implant (OSI100 Implant)  consist of:  
Receiver - stimulator (2 and 3)  
The coil, magnet and case in the receiver -stimulator is reused from the Freedom Cochlear Implant 
platform (CI24RE), w hich has been used in Cochlear  implantable systems since 2005 . The Codacs®  
system also use  identical coil, magnet and case.  A magnet located at the centre of the imp lant coil 
allows the coil of the external sound processor to be placed in the correct position, over the receiver -
stimulator coil. The receiver -stimulator contains ATB specific electronics, which is  powered by [CONTACT_789865].  The receiver -stimulator is completely over-moulded  by a 
silicone coating . 
Actuator  (4) 
Actuator is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_789854]. The 
actuator d esign concept is conceived of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -bender connected to two identical tungsten moving 
masses. When the pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -element is electrically driven by [CONTACT_789866], a vibration is 
generated at the central fixation clamp, the location where the actu ator is fixed to the BI300 I mplant. 
All external weld seam s of the ATB Actuator are over -moulded  by a silicone coating.  See figure 5.  
Figure 5.  : The ATB Actuator  
The design of the Actuator reuses critical design features from the BIM400 Implant magnet of  the 
Baha Attract System . The size of the actuator, includ ing the silicone coating, measures 31.4   22.6 x 
4.9 mm. The Actuator will come pre -mounted on the Isolator  inside the sterile blister packaging , being 
prepared for the IOTS testing, see section 2.3 .4. 
Lead (6)  
Actuator is connected to the receiver -stimula tor via a standard Cochlear lead (currently used in the CE 
marked Codacs® System) . The lead is over-moulded  by a silicone coating .

Template  1015045  Version 5.0 17 of 60  CP950 Magnets  
The CP950 magnets come in 6 various strengths; ½ (wea kest) to 6 (strongest). The CP950 magnets 
are identical as  the magnet used in the CP950 Sound Processor for Cochlear implants and are 
therefore regulatory approved and bear CE marking. They are used according to their intended use.  
 
BI300 Implant (5)  
The ATB System  uses the same osseointegrated BI300 Implant for anchorage in the bone as in 
existing Baha Connect and Baha Attract systems  and is identical to the Cochlear Vistafix VXI300 
Implant which all are regulatory approved . The BI300 Implant bears CE mark ing and  comes in two 
different lengths, 4mm and 3 mm and i s made of titanium.  The surface is moderately roughened 
(TiOblast™) on its intraosseous parts.  The BI300 Implant is used according to their intended use.

2.3.2  Fitting Software (FS) 
Two different fitting software  platforms will be used f or fitting of sound processors during this clinical 
invest igation, the Baha Fitting Software (BFS) (current ly released  version)  for the reference device 
Baha Power Sound Processor, and the Osia™ Fitting Software (OFS)  CSDS Clin Trial version 1.[ADDRESS_1088025]/user at visit 1. Communication between the fitting software and the sound processor shall be 
achieved using a Hi -Pro 2 p rogramming interface from GN Otometrics (GNO) and a Progra mming 
Cable Long Blue/Red  (Figure  6).  
The investigator  shall use the OFS  to configure the operational features  of the Osia  Sound Processor 
for each subject/user  at visit 4 . Communication between th e fitting software and the sound processor 
is achieved using a Freedom Programming Pod , Cochlear Nucleus Programming Shoe with Cable as 
well as CP950 Prog ramming Shoe Adaptor Cable Kit  and two Battery ZN Air P675 I mplant  Plus. 
This fitting software  for the  Osia Sound Processor  version 1.02  is built on and has equ ivalent 
graphical user interface and features as the current regulatory approved Baha Fitting Software (BFS) . 
Complete information is found in the Instruction For Use (IFU)  7, 8.

2.3.3  Programming  pod  
The Freedom  Programming Pod, approved and used for Cochlear’s CI products, will be used as  it is 
with the ATB System. The programming pod provides a connection between the pr ogramming 
computer  and the ATB Sound P rocessor via a USB cable  and a program ming shoe  with cable as well 
as an  adaptor cable  kit and two batteries .

response provides an indication of the state of the actuator and of the actuator lead.  
 
The test system concept is similar to the existing intraoperative tests ava ilable for CI and Codacs, and 
uses a number of similar and /or identical components (including a compute r with dedicated software, 
Osia Sound Processor, Freedom  Programming Pod, Cochlear Nucleus Programming Shoe with 
Cable as well as CP950 Prog ramming Shoe Adaptor Cable Kit  and two Battery ZN Air P675 Implant 
Plus (Figure 7 ). The test also relies on the use of a custom silicone Isolator to provide mechanical 
isolation for the actuator during the test  (Figure 8 ). The Isolator will come pre -mounted on the actu ator 
inside the sterile blister packaging. During the test  the receiver -stimulator will already be in place 
under the patient's skin and the actuator will be mounted in the Isolator (which is secured to the BI300 
Implant using the Guide pin). The test take s approximately two minutes to perform, and the software 
provides the user with an unambiguous test result regarding device integrity prior to closing and 
suturing the surgical site.  A Signal Check wand (currently available for CI and Codacs) is also 
available to check the radio -frequency (RF) link between the tr ansmitting coil of the sound processor 
and the internal coil in case of no response from the implant is received during the intraoperative test.  
The sound processor should be switched on and the Sig nal Check wand held to the coil. If the signal 
check light s up the coil is working.

Template  1015045  Version 5.0 25 of 60  4 DESIGN OF THE CLINICAL I NVESTIGATION  
4.1 Design  of the clinical investigation  
This clinical investigation is an open, two armed , prospective, mult icentre clinical investigation and is 
divided into a 3 -month  period  (primary  efficacy  analysis) followed by [CONTACT_789869] [ADDRESS_1088036] will be compared to his/her own preoperative  unaided 
hearing situation, with the Baha BP110 Power Sound Processor on a softband preoperatively and 
with the Investigational device  at [ADDRESS_1088037] is not la nguage specific (no words used), thus rendering comparative data in 
an international, multilingual setting.   
The self -reported assessment of hearing outcome using the APHAB questionnaire was chosen as an 
important secondary efficacy assessment; hence, the APHAB scale was used for determination of the 
sample size in the investigation9. The APHAB has been used in investigations previously and has 
shown to be a good tool for measuring changes in patient  benefits.  
The rationale for measuring and collect  data  with Baha BP110 Power Sound Processor on a 
Softband as a secondary assessment is based on the fact that the FDA guideline for middle ear 
implants suggests that a comparative non -inferiority or superi ority study design (using within -patient 
comparison) may b e required.   
The Baha BP110 Power Sound processor on a Softband was chosen for a secondary assessment,  
since the  ATB System mimics the performance of a Baha Power Sound Processor (with the same 55 
dB fitting range) on the passive transcutaneous Baha Attrac t System1. Therefore it is also a relevant 
choice to present as a postoperative hearing situation for the subject.  
This investigation is limited to adult subjects. The paediatric population constitu tes an inhomogeneous 
patient group (age -related), and curr ently there are no audiological tests that are suitable for 
comparisons across age ranges and across multiple countries/languages.

• Has the subject previously been suggested a bone conduction hearing implant (BCHI) 
solution ( yes/no, reason for rejection)  
5.5 Audiogram  
Unaided audiometric threshold measures (including both air - and bone conduction thresholds) should 
demonstrate that the subject has a conductive, mixed hearing loss or single -sided sensorineural 
deafness and meets th e audiol ogical inclusion criteria.   
 
An existing audiogram may be used as long as it has been completed during the last six months,  and 
contains all the required relevant frequencies  (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 
and 8000Hz) . The subje ct’s pre -operative Pure Tone Average PTA4 (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 
4000Hz) should be computed and recorded to ensure the subject meets the inclusion criteria.  
 
If an audiogram is older tha n [ADDRESS_1088040] the masked if applicable.  
 
Audiograms for bone conduction thresholds will also be performed at Visits 6, 7, and vi sit 8 to  monitor 
hearing thresholds postoperatively . 
5.6 Soft tissue thickness  
At visit 1 or visit 2  (start of surgery) , depending on local practice and requirements, soft tissue 
thickness should be measured. For the ATB System, the skin thickness should not e xceed 6 mm to 
ensure optimal retention and system performance. The measurement should be performed in the 
centre of the ma rked coil position. For complete instruction see the surgery  guide 5.  
5.7 Surgery  
The surgery, performed at visit 2,  does not take accoun t for any particular circumstances or factors 
relevant to an individual patient or case. Other surgical approaches and variations are practiced and 
may be more appropriate in certain patient cases. After considering all relevant circumstances, factors 
and informat ion in each case, the appropriate surgical procedure is determined by [CONTACT_789870].  Complete information is found in the surgery 
guide5. 
 
During surgery the following variables should be colle cted:  
 
• Surgery time (time between first incision to last suture)  
• Bone polishing/removal at the actuator site (yes/no)  
• BI300 Implant length (3mm/4mm)

Distance from B I300 to receiver/coil (centre to centre).  An alternative option to preoperative 
measurements with a ruler, is to take a lateral skull radiography postoperatively and 
measure the distance between the implant receiver magnet and the BI300.  
• Type of anaesthesi a (gener al/local)  
• Soft tissue reduction (yes/no)  
• Surgical incision type ( C-shaped flap is anterior based for an anterior actuator position or

At visit [ADDRESS_1088042]. 
 
The Digital Link Calibration (e.g. coil -to-coil measurement) that is a step  in the connection step in the 
Osia Fitting Software, should be performed at each occasion that the software is being used to fit or 
fine tune the device to optimize the performance of the device throughout the study. This will also 
provide an indication o f the so ft tissue thickness.  
 
For the sound processors Individual Stable Gain (e.g. feedback measurements as part of the Fitting 
Software) the Feedback Analyser should be performed at each occasion that the software is being 
used to fit or fine tune the de vice to optimize the performance of the device throughout the study . For 
the Investigational device this data will be collected, saved and eventually transferred to the Sponsor 
for analysis.  
5.10 Magnet choice  
At visit 4 (sound processor  fitting) the most suita ble magn et should be selected for the sound 
processor to be t ested, and the instruction for u se5 should be followed . It is important that the strength 
is not too weak or too strong. There are [ADDRESS_1088043]’s  preferenc e. 
5.11 Bone Conduction (BC) Direct  
BC Direct is a tool in the  Baha Fitting Software  (current version)  to estab lish the unmasked bone 
condition threshold with tones presented through the sound processor. At Visit 1, BC Direct data s hall 
be collected with the Baha BP110 Power Sound P rocessor on a Softband and shall be used to 
calculate the fitting (settings)  of the sound process or for the Softband test . BC Direct measurements  
(as part of the Osia Fitting Software)  will also be performed at visit [ADDRESS_1088044] is 
using the investigational device . BC thresholds obtained at the following frequenc ies will  be recorded; 
250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, [ADDRESS_1088045] receiving simultaneous bilateral ATB systems one of the treatment ears will 
be selected as the investigational ear for efficacy purp oses. Sp eech in noise performance will be 
documented for the second ear alone and bilaterally. However, efficacy outcomes for the 
investigational ear only will be pooled with the outcomes measures made for the unilaterally implanted 
subjects. Investigation al ear c hoice will be as judged by [CONTACT_789871]. 
Patient -reported outcomes (APHAB, SSQ and HUI), will be collected post -surgery in a bilateral 
situation. Safety -related information, including adverse events, will be collect ed and r eported for each 
ear receiving the ATB system.  
6 ASSESSMENTS  
Assessments  that will be performed during the clinical investigation is outlined in the flow chart, see 
section 8 . 
During the assessments, the signal processing of the sound processors  will be harm onised according 
to given instructions given in the eCRF. This will also be included in the staff training at each 
participating centre during the site initiations.   
6.1 Postoperative audiometric assessment  
Bone conduction thresholds for the study ear will be monitored postoperatively, to characterize 
observed unaided thresholds postoperatively. These measures will occur at visit 6 (3 months 
postoperative)  and 7 (6 months postoperative) , once healing and swelling is most likely to be resolved 
and repeat ed at vi sit 8 (12 months postoperative). Bone conduction thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 
1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, [ADDRESS_1088046] is to establish the hearing thresholds in free field through a speaker in front 
position (0 degrees azimuth) according to the so -called ascending or modif ied Hughson -Westlake 
method  (Figure 10 ). The test shall be performed with the non -test ear blocked (in case of normal or 
near-normal hearing or a large asymmetry  with the non -test ear having significantly better hearing 
thresholds). The signal to b e used should be narrow band noise .

9.[ADDRESS_1088061] family and is expected to 
provide the same benefits as these systems in terms of hearing restoration. In addition, the ATB 
System will provide additional advantages as it combines benefits from both a percutaneous ( skin-
penetrating)  and transcutaneou s Baha system  
The ATB System provides efficient sound transmission through direct bone conduction, similar to a 
percutaneous  implant . Direct bone conduction through a transducer that is directly coupled to the 
bone is currently only achieved with the percu taneous Baha Connect System. With the active 
transcutaneous ATB System, the actuator is directly attached to the bone via the osseointegrated 
BI300 I mplant underneath  the skin, thus eliminating any loss of energy in the sound vibrations through 
the skin. H ence, efficiency of sound transmission is on a par with a percutaneous system.  
The ATB System provides the cosmetic benefits of a transcutaneous system, such as the Baha 
Attract System. A percutaneous implant is seen as a barrier and is often rejected by c andidates due 
to cosmetic concerns. A transcutaneous system, without an abutment protruding through the skin, is 
often perceived as a more aesthetic option.  
The ATB System, like the Baha Attract System, will significantly reduce the risk of implant site 
infections, and eliminates the need for daily maintenance care . For the transcutaneous Baha Attract 
System and ATB System, the implant site is sealed and does not provide a direct path for infections. 
Skin irritation and/or infection requiring treatment and/ or precluding the use of the sound processor 
are relatively frequent for percutaneous devices due to the exposed abutment  and daily site care is 
required to maintain a reaction -free skin penetration . Some patients are not able —for medical or other 
reasons —to perform the daily implant site care that  the skin -penetration requires.  
The ATB System is expected to be associated with a significantly lower risk of osseointegration failure 
than for the percutaneous Baha Connect System. This risk is expected to be s imilar to that of the 
Baha Attract System, which also uses the osseointegrated BI300 Implant. According to the latest post 
market surveillance report s13,[ADDRESS_1088062] been reported to Cochlear’s 
complaints handling system , nor in the  review of scientific literature for the Baha Attract System 15. 
Transition pathway between the systems . Surgical transition between the three systems (reusing the

Template  1015045  Version 5.0 44 of 60  9.2.1  ATB Sound Processor (Osia Sound Processor)  
The ATB SP has identical hardware as the  CP950 Sound Processor  for Cochlear I mplants, but with 
ATB specific firmware.  Since the CP950 Sound Processor is recently new and no post market 
surveillance data is  yet available , the safety data is based on literature reviews and reviewing the 
complaints and adverse event (reportable complaint) trending rates for the predicate devices and for 
the Baha Attract System. The most common complaint is magnetic retention is sues of the sound 
processor. Skin irritation for predicate device is not reported as an issue. For the Baha Attract system 
skin irritation is fairly common but not reported as a seriou s problem and often solved by [CONTACT_789879].  
9.2.2  Receiver -stimulator ( CI24RE ) 
During the period 1 July 2009 to Dec 2015, the cumulative number of registered implant surgeries (IS) 
with CI24RE implants was 153 040 ([ADDRESS_1088064] year). Of total number of 
registered implant surgeries, 80 reportable complaints (0,052% of total IS) have been attributed to the 
receiver -stimulator. Overall, reportable complaints in the category ‘Reliability/quality/defect’ occurred 
at an average ra te of 0.006% of the total number CI24RE implant surgeries per month. The 
complaints are being monitored and there is no upward trend. The majority of complaints in the 
category ‘Medical/surgical issue’ have been coded as “Other medical”, “Skin flap infecti on” and 
“Medical/surgical issue (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_789857])” and the maximum harm for a complaint that was attributed 
to the device was revision surgery to explant the device.  
Based on the post market surveillance activities performed, the CI24RE Series of Implant s are 
considered to be performing in the field within acceptable limits and expectations. All known product 
issues are appropriately contained, or being managed through existing CAPAs. The Clinical 
Evaluation Report (411167, Clinical Evaluation Report Nucl eus CI24RE Cochlear Implants) provides 
clinical evidence to establish the acceptability of the risk benefit analysis of the CI24RE Series of 
Implants16. 
9.2.3  Codacs  
During the period 18 October 2013 to 31 October 2015, the cumulative number of registered implan t 
surgeries with Codacs DI110 implant and DF110 Fixation System was 65 ([ADDRESS_1088065] year). No 
reportable complaints were attributed to the receiver -stimulator or the lead. The number of reportable 
events related to medical/surgical issues or no -fault-found was 2 (3.1%). Based on the post market 
surveillance activities performed, the Codacs DI110 implant and the Codacs DF110 Fixation System 
are considered to be performing in the field within expectations (D701349, Post Market Surveillance 
Report, Coda cs DI110 implant and DF110 Fixation system)17. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1088066] 2015, 55 341 BI300 implants (including abutment) have been sold with a 
reported monthly complaint rate around 0.1 -0.2%. The  complaint relevant to the ATB System is BI300

Before start of each site in the clinical investigation each investigator will have done documented 
surgery training according to the su rgery guide either at a  cadaver  lab te st or on a plastic skull.   
MRI examinations can be performed safely on a person with this implanted device only under very 
specific conditions. An MRI information package  is supplied with each implant for additional 
information regarding magnetic resonanc e imaging18.

Template  1015045  Version 5.0 48 of 60  10.3 Sample size calculation  
10.3.1  Sample size calculation for the primary efficacy analysis  
In order to achieve 90% power to detect a clinically signifi cant difference of 10 dB in free -field hearing 
thresholds or 10 dB SNR  between the unaided situation and the ATB System at the 3 months visit 
with Fisher’s  non-parametric permutation test for paired observations, one-sided test with significance 
level 0.025, on the ITT population  11 (PTA -4) and 13 (SNR) evaluable subjects are needed. The 
sample size was calculated using simulation on study id CBAS5675 (Cochlear 2017) data which used 
the simulated ATB system on Mixed/Conductive subjects.  The within subject S D for change Unaided 
to ATB in PTA4 was 9.5 dB and 11.3 SNR. Since significant result want to be detected in both arms 
(SSD and Conductive/Mixed) 13+13=26 subjects should be included in the investigation.  
10.3.2  Sample size calculation for the secondary  analysis  
In order to achieve 90% power to detect a clinically significant difference of 15 units in APHAB Benefit 
between the unaided situation and use of the Investigational device at the 3 months visit with Fisher’s 
one-sided non -parametric permutation test for p aired observations , one-sided test with significance 
level 0.0 25, on the pooled ITT population (SSD  and Conductive/Mixed together) , [ADDRESS_1088071] deviation (SD) of 23.[ADDRESS_1088072] -operative 
use of a Baha sound processor mounted on a percutaneous implant over 12 months (Study ID 
CBAS5439). To compensate for drop out of two patients in the study, 30 subjects should be included 
in the investigation.  
10.3.3  Sample size estimation for the primary safety analysis at 6 months  
Primary safety analysis will be evaluated at 6 months and an estimation of 50 subjects results in 25 
patient years at 6 months, which will yield enough safety data for the primary safety analysis. At the 
12-month analysis 50 subjects results in 50 patient years.  
10.3.4  Overall sample size considerations  
In order to achi eve 90% power both for the primary analysis (PTA4 and SNR, Investigational Device 
vs. Unaided) and the primary safety analysis, 50 evaluable subjects are needed.  Each arm SSD and 
Conductive/Mixed should at least consist of 13 patients to assure a power of 90% in both arms for the 
primary analysis.  
10.[ADDRESS_1088073], the 
Fisher’s non -parametric permutation test for paired observations will be used for all paired analyses of 
continuous variables. For paired analysis of dichotomous and ordered categorical variables the Sign 
test will be used.  
The main efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population and complementary efficacy 
analyses will be  performed on the PP population. The main analysis will be performed after the 3 
month visit. A complementary analysis will be performed 9 months after the main analysis (12 -month 
visit). All significance tests will be one-sided and performed at the 5% sig nificance level.  
Imputation of missing values  (definitions made in SAP)  will be performed for all efficacy variables. No 
imputation of baseline values or baseline carry forward will be made . 
  
   
CBAS5539  CIP Version 5 
  
   
  
Template  1015045  Version 5.0 49 of 60  All analyses, tables and figures will be produce d for SSD and Con ductive/Mixed separately and also 
pooled as on population.  
10.5 Efficacy analysis  
10.5.1  Primary efficacy analysis  
Primary efficacy analysis will be determined by [CONTACT_789881] -field threshold audiometry: 
PTA4 (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz)  and chan ge adaptive speech recognition in noise (50% 
performance), from preoperative  Unaided versus Investigational device at the 3 months visit for the 
ITT population, using Fisher’s one-sided non -parametric permutation test for paired observations at a 
significa nce level of  0.025 to demonstrate an improvement in PTA4 . Each arm SSD and 
Conductive/Mixed will be tested separately. Both PTA4 and SIQ must be significant at alpha 0. 025 for 
the primary analysis to be considered as confirmative in each arm separately. In  addition, a pooled 
analysis for all subjects will be made.  
10.5.2  Secondary efficacy analyses

Page [ADDRESS_110340]-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a significant concern in all patients undergoing any form of anesthesia
 with a varied level of incidence from 20% to as high as 80% in some studies [1]. PONV is a significant cause of
 morbidity and dissatisfaction among patients, and begins to become a systems concern when it takes place in the
 ambulatory surgery environment. The Previous studies have indicated a high prevalence of ambulatory surgery
 in the [LOCATION_002], representing up to and in some studies exceeding 60% of all surgical procedures [1]. Post-
operative nausea and vomiting represents a significant cause of unanticipated requirement for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100188], representing 7.4% of unanticipated admissions in one study [2]. Examination of
 potential costs relating to PONV demonstrated less spent on patients who received perioperative anti-emetics vs.
 those who did not receive prophylaxis (considering drug costs) [1]. 
Ondansetron has been well established medication for the prophylaxis of PONV for well over a decade across
 several patient populations [3,4]. Several studies have been performed to determine the difference between dose
 levels and regimens of ondansetron with varied results. However, certain consensuses seem to exist among studies
 with a dose of 4mg Ondansetron given nearing the end of the procedure before anesthesia finish time having
 a greater effect on PONV prophylaxis than a single dose given before or at the procedure start time [5,6,7]. A
 previous study conducted to compare a dose of 4mg Ondansetron at the beginning of the surgical case, compared
 to 4mg Ondansetron approaching surgical finish, to a divided dosing of 2mg Ondansetron in the beginning and 2mg
 Ondansetron at the end demonstrated that 4mg at the end was superior to the divided 2mg + 2mg dosing which was
 superior to the 4mg at the beginning [7]. Some studies have compared 8mg of Ondansetron at the end of surgery to
 4mg Ondansetron with varying results, some showing it as more effective and others failing to distribute a consistent
 improvement, no studies reported an increased incidence of side effects [8,9].

 each represents modalities with aspects shown to be successful in attempts at post-operative nausea and vomiting
 prevention.

10. Subjects - Risk and Benefits
Risks to Subjects
The primary salient risk to subjects due to this study is the added anxiety on the day of their procedure. Other risks
 are those associated with the two study drugs dexamethasone and ondansetron. There is a risk of temporary
 headache associated with ondansetron usage that varies in studies from 0.1-9%. However, the doses of
 ondansetron being used are less than that described in the package insert in regards to side effects (12-16mg in
 package insert compared to 4-8mg in study).
Side effects of Dexamethasone when given as a one time dose of 4mg are very mild and transient. A small subset
 of patients may see a small rise in serum glucose concentration, however this has been shown in multiple studies
 to not be clinically significant, even in patients with diabetes. Although with higher and repeated doses of steroids
 there is also a risk of infection, a single small dose of dexamethasone does not increase the risk of an infectionas
 demonstrated in several studies. There is also a risk of allergy to any medication, however, steroids are often used to
 treat allergy and as such this risk is very low.
In addition, there is a risk of being involved in a study as it has the chance to provide a distraction to the individual
 administering medications as it may deviate from his/her typi[INVESTIGATOR_5485]. 
However, the drug risks are not significantly increased as a result of this study as they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_100189]. The advent of CMS Merit Based Incentives Payments
 (MIPS) adoption by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_100190] >75% of patients already receiving this combination per standard
 care.
There is also the risk of loss of confidentiality.
Description of Procedures Taken to Lessen the Probability or Magnitude of Risks 
In order to lessen the magnitudes of risks we have designed a pragmatic protocol that mirrors the common behaviors
 in the department in terms of dosing time which also closely mirrors the literature. This should lessen any behavioral
 interference of the study. 
In terms of drug side effects, we are using a drug that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_100191]. Adding on to this we are using ondansetron dosing regimens that are well below the limits in
 the package insert and those associated with the side-effect of headache. 
In order to reduce stress to the participant, the individual consenting will emphasize no impact will occur relating to
 surgical or anesthetic care as a result of declining to participate, and that the study involves practices commonly
 used in the department. 
Provisions for Research Related Harm / Injury
Patients will have availability of care within the Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100192]. Beyond this the study does not present more than minimal risk.
Expected Direct Benefit to Subjects
The expected direct benefit is a reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. All three arms of the study
 have been proven to be effective in reducing PONV and none of the three has been studied directly yet to prove
 definitive superiority to any of the other treatments used in this study.  
Benefit to Society
PONV represents a common reason for admission following ambulatory surgery, this reduction of PONV can result in
 less costs incurred by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], insurance companies, and tax payers.
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
The subjects will only interact with members of their care team that they would have interacted with if this study did
 not exist. Their consent will be from their primary Anesthesiologist doing the case and their post-operative follow
 up once they go home will be done by [CONTACT_941] 5E98th street nurse who normally would be calling for follow up. This will
 prevent any additional impact on the patients relating to additional care team members.
There are no plans for additional follow up beyond the normal post-operative period. 
Economic Impact on Subjects
No economic cost is anticipated for subjects as this will not affect their anesthetic service billing. There is a possible
 economic benefit if they are able to avoid an unexpected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100193].
Page [ADDRESS_110350] arm consists of 4mg Dexamethasone given between anesthesia induction and procedure start time and a
 dose of 8mg Ondansetron given before procedure finish time with the aim of it being 30 minutes prior to anticipated
 procedure finish.
The data recorded with be the patient's age and sex, the type of procedure performed, the duration of the procedure,
 the duration of anesthesia, the time of antiemetic dosing, and the dose of antiemetic given.
Following the anesthesia finish, the patient will be monitored in the recovery area per normal protocol and the
 patient's nurse will be instructed to record any incidents of vomiting and the patient will be queried regarding
 their nausea immediately upon arrival into the recovery area, one hour following arrival, and immediately prior to
 discharge. All responses will be recorded. 
Patients will then be contact[CONTACT_100203], with the addition that the nurse will specifically ask
 about any epi[INVESTIGATOR_100194]. 
Description of Procedures Being Performed
A dose of dexamethasone will be administered at the time of induction of anesthesia and before procedure start time.
 Depending on which arm the patient is randomized to they will either receive a dose of ondansetron at this time or
 will solely receive a dose of ondansetron before procedure finish. This will involve the injection of an IV medication
 through an already existing intravenous line. 
A data sheet will then be filled out post-operatively describing any epi[INVESTIGATOR_100195]-emetics given. The patients will be called as part of normal post-operative care and any epi[INVESTIGATOR_100196]. 
Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
Source records will be the data sheet filled out during the time the patient is at [ADDRESS_110351]-operative call.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
Data collected will be: the patient's age and sex, the type of procedure performed, the duration of the surgery, the
 duration of the anesthesia care, the anti-emetics administered perioperatively and postoperatively, any recorded
 epi[INVESTIGATOR_100197]-operative period at [ADDRESS_110352]-operative phone call period is planned.

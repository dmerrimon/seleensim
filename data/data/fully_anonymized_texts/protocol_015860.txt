Title: Decreasing Bioburden to Reduce Healthcare-Associated Infections and Readmissions  
ABATE (A ddressing Bioburden while Admitted To Eliminate) Infection Trial  
Project Narrative 
Healthcare-associated infections are one of the [ADDRESS_1019924] frequent causes of death in the [LOCATION_002] and 
incur over $6.[ADDRESS_1019925] focused on 
intensive care unit (ICUs), where the daily risk for infection is the highest, the majority of healthcare-associated 
infections occur outside of ICUs. This cluster-randomized controlled trial will evaluate whether bathing non-ICU 
patients with antimicrobial soap prevents healthcare-associated infections and the readmissions they cause.  
Abstract 
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. 
Prevention of HAIs is a national priority for patient safety and best practice because of their high morbidity, 
mortality, and cost, incurring over $6.[ADDRESS_1019926] infections result from 
common bacteria that normally live on the skin or in the nose and which overcome the body’s normal defenses 
because of invasive medical devices, surgical incisions, or the physiologic effects of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Studies in 
intensive care units (ICUs) indicate that decolonization of patients’ skin with chlorhexidine, and nares with 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745655]. However, evidence is lacking about the effectiveness of decolonization in 
non-ICU settings, where the majority of HAIs occur, and where medical care, risk of infection, patient-to-patient 
interactions, pathogen transmission, and bathing practices differ considerably from ICU settings. 
Decolonization is thus rarely used in these settings, despi[INVESTIGATOR_745656]. 
The ABATE Infection Trial ( Addressing Bioburden while Admitted To Eliminate Infection) will efficiently 
evaluate the impact of decolonization on HAIs in the general patient population outside ICUs. This cluster-
randomized trial will randomize 54 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745657] 400,000 patients to evaluate 1) universal daily 
chlorhexidine bathing to prevent infections from all pathogens, combined with 2) nasal decolonization with 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745658]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), one of the most common 
causes of HAIs. While decolonization has been successful in short-stay high risk areas, such as ICUs, this trial 
will address the much larger problem of HAIs in non-ICU medical and surgical wards. This patient population 
has typi[INVESTIGATOR_745659]-based trials.   
This trial will provide a critically needed evaluation of decolonization to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745660]. It will provide essential information to determine 
whether routine decolonization through daily bathing with chlorhexidine should become standard practice for 
[ADDRESS_1019927] from those effective in ICU settings are needed for these patients outside ICUs. 
This trial will also illustrate the strengths of a new model of clinical effectiveness research that quickly 
and efficiently addresses critical management questions by [CONTACT_745900], and using the organizational and informatics strengths of a large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619].

 Specific Aims – UH2 
Pragmatic Clinical Trial – Planning Phase 
 
It is a national priority to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and cost of healthcare-associated infections 
(HAIs) and their associated readmissions to their lowest practicable level. There have been notable successes 
in preventing HAIs in intensive care units, where the risk per patient is highest. The focus now needs to 
address the larger fraction of HAIs that occur in general medical, surgical, and oncology units, where medical 
care, risk of infection, patient-to-patient interactions, pathogen transmission, and bathing practices differ 
considerably from ICU settings. To that end, we propose the ABATE Infection Trial ( Addressing Bioburden 
while Admitted To Eliminate Infection) to reduce the reservoirs of bacteria on the skin and in the nose that are 
the major causes of these infections. This cluster-randomized trial will assess whether the strategy of body 
decolonization with chlorhexidine plus nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745661].   
We recently completed a successful ICU based cluster-randomized trial involving [ADDRESS_1019928] the ABATE Infection Trial in general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7011]. In the 
planning phase of this trial, we will: 
 
1) Recruit hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272822] a cluster-randomized trial of 1) routine daily bathing with chlorhexidine for all 
patients plus 2) routine nasal decolonization with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745662]-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) in general medical and surgical units to reduce infection and 
readmissions.  
 
2) Obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the cluster-randomized trial and maximize 
efficiency by [CONTACT_745901][INVESTIGATOR_745663] a central IRB. 
 
3) Develop trial educational materials and routine electronic nursing queries for daily bathing and 
decolonization in general medical and surgical inpatient areas. Additionally, begin baseline strain 
collection activity to assess resistance. 
 
4) Obtain baseline data on HAI infection rates for participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745664]. These will be obtained using corporate data warehouse capabilities of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745665] (HCA).

 Specific Aims – UH3 
Pragmatic Clinical Trial – Trial Intervention Phase 
The majority of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur outside of ICUs, in general medical, 
surgical, and oncology units. The ABATE Infection Trial ( Addressing Bioburden while Admitted To Eliminate 
Infection) seeks to reduce these HAIs and the readmissions they cause to their lowest practicable level by 
[CONTACT_745902]. This cluster-randomized trial will target all 
pathogens through bathing with chlorhexidine and additionally target carriers of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) through nasal decolonization with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]. This intervention strategy will be 
compared to routine care in non-ICU medical, surgical, and oncology units.   
This trial will assess a high yield strategy that is relevant to the large majority of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. If 
successful, this decolonization strategy would become best practice for preventing infection among 40 million 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745666].  
Specific aims for the Trial Intervention Phase are as follows: 
 
1) Conduct a 50+-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745667]-randomized controlled trial of routine chlorhexidine bathing and 
selective MRSA decolonization versus standard-of-care practices for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124070]-
critical care adult medical, surgical, and oncology units. The primary outcome will be clinical burden of 
gram-positive multi-drug resistant organisms. Secondary outcomes will include clinical burden of gram-
negative multi-drug resistant organisms, bloodstream infections, and readmissions caused by [CONTACT_80601]. 
 
2) Assess whether universal chlorhexidine bathing and selective MRSA decolonization result in increased 
resistance to chlorhexidine or mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745668]. 
 
3) Estimate the costs associated with the intervention (chlorhexidine + selective MRSA decolonization) 
and the attributable medical costs of healthcare associated infections in adult general inpatient units 
and infectious readmissions, in order to evaluate the potential for cost savings associated with the 
strategy of reducing bioburden to prevent infection

 1.0 Significance - Overall 
 
1.1 The Problem of Healthcare-Associated Infections: Burden and Trends 
 Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are one of the top [ADDRESS_1019929] of over 7 billion Euros.2 Among developed nations, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 1.[ADDRESS_1019930] an HAI at any given time. 3 Thus, 5-10% 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745669], a risk that is estimated to be 20-fold higher in developi[INVESTIGATOR_40620].  
 The recognition of HAIs as a leading cause of death has led to numerous state and national responses. 
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report “ To err is human: building a safer health system” galvanized 
efforts to prevent healthcare associated adverse events, including HAIs.4 In 2003, the IOM identified HAI 
prevention as a top 20 priority area for national action.5 In 2008, the U.S. Government Accountability Office 
issued a report on HAIs in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745670].6 In the meantime, The Joint 
Commission continued to increase its requirements for routine HAI surveillance for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564016],7 and 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) outlined and implemented a multi-year plan requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745671].[ADDRESS_1019931] been passed in 29 states which require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745672], generally through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) 
National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system.[ADDRESS_1019932] criteria for 
identifying HAIs, NHSN has become the national repository for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745673]; nearly 
5,[ADDRESS_1019933] medical costs of approximately $500-1,[ADDRESS_1019934] infection and $10,000-20,[ADDRESS_1019935] 
defenses. These bacteria may be the patient’s normal flora, or they may be new, often antimicrobial resistant, 
organisms acquired during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Current evidence and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_745674] 65-70% of 
catheter-related bloodstream and urinary tract infections may be preventable.[ADDRESS_1019936] of step-
down units which represent an intermediate level of care between the ICU and a routine non-ICU area, as well 
as medical, surgical, mixed medical/surgical, and oncology units. It is estimated that 75% of HAIs occur outside 
of ICU settings. [ADDRESS_1019937]

discharge.[ADDRESS_1019938] 
on infections, but also to monitor adverse effects on individuals and microbial resistance patterns.  
 
1.5 Importance of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) Subset of HAIs 
  Any strategy for preventing a large fraction of all HAIs must be effective against MRSA, which is 
arguably the most important single pathogen in healthcare-associated infection when accounting for virulence, 
prevalence, diversity of disease spectrum, and propensity for widespread transmission.[ADDRESS_1019939] focused on healthcare facilities since critically and 
chronically ill patients experience the majority of MRSA morbidity and mortality.  
  Among HAIs in 2009-10, S. aureus  (two-thirds of which is MRSA) has become the most common 
pathogen . It is the most common cause of ventilator associated pneumonia and surgical site infection, and has 
recently become the most common cause of central-line associated bloodstream infections.[ADDRESS_1019940] 
importance when asked to provide a “top 100” list of health issues for comparative effectiveness research and 
rank them into quartiles.[ADDRESS_1019941] mandated reporting of MRSA infections through CDC’s NHSN 
surveillance system, and [ADDRESS_1019942] precautions (i.e. single room, use of gowns and gloves), and prevent transmission.[ADDRESS_1019943] MRSA is unprecedented in US healthcare. 
 
1.6 MRSA Strategies for Disease Prevention – Screening and Isolation 
  We first describe MRSA prevention strategies as a prelude to describing strategies that target all 
pathogens. Two main strategies have emerged as successful in reducing MRSA infection in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The first 
involves “active screening” to find MRSA carriers and isolate them to prevent the spread of MRSA to other 
6 
 patients. Active screening involves culturing patient’s nostrils (nares), the major reservoir for MRSA in humans. 
The goal of this strategy is to implement contact [CONTACT_745903].45 46 Preventing transmission prevents many infections since 33% of 
patients who become colonized in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745676] [ADDRESS_1019944] shown 
that active screening can reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-associated transmission and MRSA infection by 35-70%.47 48 49 50 51 
     Although active screening for high risk patients is mandated by 10 states,9 screening and isolation do 
not benefit the large and growing population of 1.8 million inpatients who already harbor MRSA.41 Between 5-
12% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745677],[ADDRESS_1019945] need by [CONTACT_745904].  
 
1.7 MRSA Strategies for Disease Prevention –Decolonization 
  The second major strategy for preventing MRSA infection involves the use of various topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855],17 53 54 and 
sometimes systemic,55 antimicrobial agents to “decolonize” MRSA carriers and prevent subsequent MRSA 
infection. Systemic regimens are not favored in the US due to side effects and the theoretical risk of 
accelerated emergence of antibiotic resistance. Most commonly, a combination of chlorhexidine body washes 
and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745678] a period of 5-[ADDRESS_1019946] all pathogens may be more effective than strategies that target a specific pathogen like MRSA. 
This is particularly relevant due to rising numbers of other highly antibiotic resistant pathogens such as 
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli, including extended spectrum 
beta-lactamase producers and carbapenemase-resistant enterobacteriaceae, for which therapeutic options are 
limited. Such strategies may also require fewer resources, and thus be “dominant” in terms of coupling greater 
benefits with lower costs. For example, a successful universal strategy could obviate the need for routine 
screening for MRSA and applying targeted isolation or decolonization. We describe here the evidence in 
support of universal chlorhexidine bathing and universal application of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745679] S. aureus  and also to other pathogens. 
  One increasingly well evaluated universal strategy for pathogen control in ICUs is the routine use of 
chlorhexidine bathing in place of usual soap and water baths for all patients. This strategy stems from the 
strong evidence that chlorhexidine is the most effective skin preparation for central line placement when 
outcomes of central line infections are measured, and from other studies showing marked reductions in skin 
bacterial colony counts for several days following serial bathing.54-[ADDRESS_1019947], national recommendations for 
prevention of surgical site infections (SSI) from the CDC’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433239] (HICPAC) call for bathing or showering with chlorhexidine at least twice before the operation. The 
CDC ranks this recommendation as a category IB: “Strongly recommended for implementation and supported 
by [CONTACT_745905], clinical or epi[INVESTIGATOR_745680].”56 
  In addition, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons has recommended universal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745681] S. aureus  carriage.57 This strategy is supported 
by [CONTACT_745906] S. aureus  surgical site infections in excess of 20%.58 59 
 
1.9 Effectiveness of Decolonization with Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745682]. It reduces bacterial carriage, which 
commonly precedes infection. This reduction in bioburden reduces the likelihood of infection from a patient’s 
own flora and also reduces the spread of pathogens from one patient to another. Nevertheless, definitive trials 
are needed to develop best practice guidance on when decolonization should be used, and, as with any 
antimicrobial agent, use must be balanced by [CONTACT_745907].  
  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745683] a prescription drug that was FDA approved in [ADDRESS_1019948] shown 90% efficacy within two weeks of a 5-day regimen.60 61 62 63 64 It also significantly reduces short-
term hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-associated MRSA transmission and infections by [CONTACT_46431] 50% in observational and cross-over 
7 
 intervention studies. 16 17 53 54 65 66  Long term efficacy over weeks to months drops substantially after a single 
treatment regimen to approximately 60% after 6-8 weeks, largely due to re-colonization with the patient’s 
original strain.17 57-59 61-64 67 Increased failure to decolonize was noted if additional cultures were taken from 
body sites other than the anterior nares, suggesting that both serial treatment as well as additional 
decolonization of sites other than the nose are necessary for prolonged eradication of MRSA.17 65 68 69  
 To improve body surface decolonization, chlorhexidine body washes are now routinely given with 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745684]. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) has been safely used for bathing, 
showering and dental hygiene for over [ADDRESS_1019949] that is 4% solution intended 
for direct application to skin as an antimicrobial skin cleanser. Numerous studies have shown marked 
reductions in skin bacteria following serial CHG bathing or showering,70-[ADDRESS_1019950] 
demonstrated a 52-87% reduction in bloodstream infection in ICU patients.15-17 78 There is also growing 
evidence that CHG skin bathing may reduce MRSA acquisition and infection by 50% in high risk settings such 
as ICUs.16 17 55 66 This approach and others led to our recent definitive cluster-randomized trial of 43 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745685] (see Preliminary Data Section 6.10.2, (confidential trial results). 
  The definitive success of decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745686] a trial evaluating whether these successes can be translated to non-critical care 
units. Since most HAIs occur outside the ICU and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], targeting the larger general patient 
population has the potential to make a much greater impact on HAIs by [CONTACT_745908] a time when patients are highly vulnerable to infection.

Inc, personal communication regarding routine use in >400 ICUs) or outpatient daily bathing for 9 months.74

causing irritation, dryness, or discomfort.” [ADDRESS_1019953] been 
reported in some,48 105 but not all studies.17 106 107 As an example, Robicsek et al. reported that mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745689] a 3-year period of widespread use, but did increase from 4.1% to 
7.2% among MRSA isolates.[ADDRESS_1019954] reported declines in mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745690].108 109 110 Finally, one ICU study has reported evidence of clinically meaningful levels 
of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745691] 8.6% despi[INVESTIGATOR_745692],[ADDRESS_1019955] that there is considerable 
transfer of pathogens from one patient to another, for instance on the hands of healthcare workers and 
sometimes via inanimate objects (medical equipment, furniture, etc). Thus, interventions that affect all patients 
in a location are more likely to succeed, and also much more likely to predict the performance in actual 
practice. Cluster randomization also has advantage of studying interventions under conditions of actual use, of 
minimizing the disruption to normal practice, and of allowing the use of health system resources for ensuring 
compliance with the intended treatment. We discuss these issues in more detail in Sections 2.1-2.3 below. 
 
1.13 Summary of Overall Significance 
  The well publicized focus on HAI prevention by [CONTACT_745909], including 
the CDC, CMS the Joint Commission, the Institute of Healthcare Improvement, the IOM, the National Quality 
Forum, the newly formed national Partnership for Patients of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(dedicated to patient safety and HAI prevention across the continuum of healthcare), and numerous national 
societies including the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the 
Society for Healthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_128456], provide the impetus to perform a definitive high impact trial on 
HAI prevention in non-ICU inpatient populations. 
Large cluster randomized trials for HAI prevention (our own) in ICUs have demonstrated that it is 
possible to prevent many HAIs. There is a great need to focus on broader patient populations in whom the 
majority of HAIs occur and in whom medical care, risk of infection, patient-to-patient interactions, pathogen 
transmission, and bathing practices differ considerably from ICU settings. A randomized trial sufficiently 
generalizable to assess HAI reduction in broad patient populations has not previously been undertaken 
because the scope of such a study is not possible under usual funding mechanisms. A head-to-head trial of 
decolonization versus standard of care bathing will enable us to determine whether this potentially important 
strategy has a role in all patient populations.  
 
2.0 Significance – UH2 Planning Year 
 
 The topic for this proposal is thus a critically needed area of comparative effectiveness study. It 
addresses the following two top quartile (the highest rating) priority topi[INVESTIGATOR_745693]’s top 
100 national priority areas across all domains of medicine released in 2009:44 
 
 Compare the effectiveness of strategies for reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAI), including 
catheter-associated bloodstream infection, ventilator associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections  
 
 Compare the effectiveness of various screening, prophylaxis, and treatment interventions in eradicating 
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in communities, institutions, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
 
The ability to conduct a well designed pragmatic trial requires careful thought as to the best study design to fit 
the question to be answered – in this case, how best to ascertain whether routine decolonization can reduce 
HAIs, including MRSA infection, in the general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745694].  
 
2.1 Design Elements of Pragmatic Design in Comparative Effectiveness Trials 
 In designing this proposal, we will provide a practical roadmap of a well-designed trial that showcases 
the six defining characteristics of comparative effectiveness research (CER) highlighted by [CONTACT_745910] 2009 report “Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research.”[ADDRESS_1019956] a related cluster-randomized 
trial on decolonization in ICUs (see Section 5.0.1-5.0.2 Investigative Team and Sections 5.30.1, 6.10.1-6.10.2, 
Preliminary Data). In this proposal, we will highlight the ability of the ABATE Infection Trial to address the six 
defining characteristics of comparative effectiveness research (CER) (see Section 4.3). These six 
characteristics are:  
 #1: CER has the objective of directly informing a specific clinical decision from the patient perspective or a 
health policy decision from the population perspective. 
9 
  #2: CER compares at least two alternative interventions, each with the potential to be “best practice.” 
 #3: CER describes results at the population and subgroup levels. 
 #4: CER measures outcomes—both benefits and harms—that are important to patients. 
 #5: CER employs methods and data sources appropriate for the decision of interest. 
 #6: CER is conducted in settings that are similar to those in which the intervention will be used in practice. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1019957] quality improvement activities in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745695]. To  
the extent they do address outcomes, they are often unable to determine with confidence that an intervention 
improves (or harms) patients. We highlight two important reasons for the inability to learn as much as possible 
from quality improvement initiatives. First, the improvements are implemented without a robust comparator. It 
is very common, for instance, to perform a before-after comparison. These comparisons provide the least 
persuasive evidence,[ADDRESS_1019958] quality improvement methods. This will be a key step in the creation of a 
learning health system – one that generates evidence in the course of delivering best quality clinical care. We 
will share methods and materials for implementation as well as programs for trial processes and outcomes. 
 
2.3 Cluster-Randomized Trial Design for Quality Improvement Research for HAI 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_745696], conventional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have important limitations. 
Although they are excellent tools for judging efficacy (performance under ideal conditions), they often fail to 
judge effectiveness (performance under conditions of actual use). This is because most RCTs require more 
standardization and a higher level of medical care than occurs in practice. In addition, generalizability may be 
lost because participants in RCTs are often not representative of the eventual target group. Furthermore, RCTs 
are often very costly and time-consuming to implement. For example, the ALLHAT study of initial treatment of 
hypertension, often cited as a pragmatic clinical trial,[ADDRESS_1019959] over $80 million and took 8 years to complete.116 
Cluster-randomized trials are RCTs which randomize groups (clusters) rather than individuals. Cluster 
randomization is the only feasible method for randomization when an intervention must be applied or is usually 
applied to an entire group, such as a community-based health promotion campaign or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745697]. They are also the only method for evaluating 
interventions for which the status of individuals is linked, for instance when shared exposure to contagious 
illness is an important consideration, as commonly occurs in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225].  
Cluster-randomized trials have several advantages in comparative effectiveness studies. First, by 
[CONTACT_745911][INVESTIGATOR_307], practice, or health plan level, cluster-randomized trials can more readily 
study interventions under conditions of actual use. For instance, a cluster-randomized trial that uses existing 
clinical and administrative mechanisms incorporates the impact of group dynamics (advocacy, peer pressure, 
reminders) among healthcare providers. Second, cluster-randomized trials are often intended to be applied to 
an entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or clinic population without exclusion, which enhances 
generalizability. Third, cluster-randomized trials are able to harness the healthcare delivery system’s existing 
administrative capacities, including quality improvement programs and data collection systems, simplifying the 
logistics of implementation and reducing study costs.[ADDRESS_1019960] be familiar with the national guidance related to waiver of documented individual informed consent 
and also familiar with the intersection of research inquiry and routine healthcare improvement processes.117 118 
Additional experience and familiarity is needed related to minimal risk criteria, the issues related to 
randomizing groups (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], clinics, communities) rather than individual patients, whether the activity is 
being performed under standard quality improvement methods, and whether the activity under study is already 
commonly used in healthcare despi[INVESTIGATOR_147677] a definitive trial. Finally, the IRB needs to understand the full 
range of options, including delegation of the consent decision to a designated representative of the cluster. 
 In this proposal, we will share and publish our ethical considerations and approach to IRB issues that 
are highly relevant to this and other cluster-randomized trials. This shared experience will help the medical 
community use rigorous research methods to develop evidence for best practice as part of usual medical care.    
 
3.0 Significance – UH3 Trial Implementation Years 
 
As mentioned above, our topic addresses two of the top 100 national priority areas –HAI elimination 
and MRSA eradication - identified by [CONTACT_745912].[ADDRESS_1019961] change. In addition, it is uncommon for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745698]. To mirror actual practice, prevent confusion and avoid trial contamination due to shared patients and 
staff across units, cluster-randomized trials of inpatient processes should ideally randomize hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], not units. 
In addition, pragmatic clinical trials should utilize routine and recognizable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745699], computer-based training, and routinely scheduled events (e.g. nursing acuity 
assessments, bathing, central line dressing changes) and be cognizant of the impact of the trial on necessary 
and expected activities such as nursing shift change, and cleaning and product restocking schedules. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1019962] (EHR) systems and the impetus provided by [CONTACT_745913]. In this trial, we will showcase how robust EHR systems across large health systems can be 
leveraged to implement standardized protocols, easily query compliance, and obtain key data elements such 
as the presence of devices during customary nursing documentation routines, employ usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745700], and ensure rapid data capture and cleaning for trial analyses. In this way, 
robust EHR systems can close the gap between effectiveness and efficacy across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295900].  
 
3.5 Analysis of Cluster-Randomized Trials  
Finally, cluster-randomized clinical trials need to employ different statistical methods that account for 
the relatedness of outcomes within groups. For example, increasing numbers of patients with infectious 
outcomes will increase the contagiousness level in a group setting. Thus, accounting for intra-cluster 
correlation is imperative to obtaining credible results for trials that use this methodology.  
 
3.6 Trial Significance – Overall Summary  
Healthcare-associated infections are a top [ADDRESS_1019963] of future 
cluster-randomized trials.  
 
4.1 Innovation – Overall Project 
We will conduct a trial whose result can influence the care of the majority of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745701]: 
 
 Element #1: CER directly informs a specific clinical decision from the patient perspective or a 
health policy decision from the population perspective. 
The ABATE Infection Trial will evaluate whether chlorhexidine bathing should be routinely used for 
essentially all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745702]-discharge infections. This is relevant for 
both patients and policy. 
 
 Element #2: CER compares at least two alternative “best practice”  interventions.  
The ABATE Infection Trial is a head-to-head comparison of routine bathing of non-critical care patients 
with soap and water (current best practice) versus daily chlorhexidine bathing (improvement strategy) 
for all patients plus nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745703].  
 
 Element #3: CER describes results at the population and subgroup levels. 
The ABATE Infection Trial will analyze its results across the overall hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745704], such as those harboring multi-

 drug resistant pathogens, and those with significant comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, renal failure, cancer) 
This is important since it is well documented that these patient subsets are at higher risk13 30-35 40 45-46 of 
healthcare-associated infections and may benefit disproportionately from decolonization. 
 
 Element #4: CER measures outcomes —both benefits and harms —that are important to patients. 
The ABATE Infection Trial will evaluate not only beneficial outcomes of reducing HAI and the 
readmissions they cause, but also potential harms including whether resistance to the decolonization 
agents (chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]) is differentially engendered in the two arms of the trial.  
 
 Element #5: CER employs methods and data sources appropriate for the decision of interest. 
The ABATE Infection Trial uses a cluster-randomized trial and a corporate data warehouse to evaluate 
this question across a large number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In addition, it uses routinely available data sources 
that are commonly used to assess HAIs by [CONTACT_745914] U.S. and applies them 
in such a way so as to maximize and showcase the use of electronic medical records. 
 
 Element #6: CER is conducted in settings that are similar to those used in practice. 
The ABATE Infection Trial uses a cluster-randomized trial to mimic the way bathing care is usually 
delivered in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and the method by [CONTACT_745915][INVESTIGATOR_600]. In 
addition, this trial will be implemented in a large number of community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], the most common type 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745705] U.S.. 
 
The focus on prevention of HAIs in non-ICU settings is an important area of innovation. Trials to reduce 
infection in non-critical care areas are largely lacking because of the large number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745706], but affect very large numbers of patients in 
the aggregate. Collectively, patients in non-ICU settings are responsible for the majority of healthcare-
associated infections and any hope for elimination must invest in these critically needed trials to determine the 
best strategy for adoption. This trial will be a first-in-class effort in this important patient safety realm.  
This trial will also make an important contribution to the active debate about when to focus HAI 
prevention strategies on those that target specific pathogens, like MRSA, vs strategies intended to impact 
many pathogens.[ADDRESS_1019964] of decolonization on patients’ normal bacterial flora and on the ecology of the 
healthcare systems that employ it. The practical consequences have much to do with the organization and cost 
of medical care.  Our recent trial, the REDUCE MRSA trial125 (see Preliminary Data Sections 5.30.1, 6.10.1-
6.10.2) has definitively opened the door to testing all pathogen approaches in the general patient population. 
 
4.2 Innovation – UH2 Planning Year 
 
In contrast to most trials, the ABATE Infection Trial will recruit community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745707] U.S.. Thus, our trial will take place in generalizable contexts and produce 
generalizable solutions. Our Health Care System (HCS) collaborator, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554863] (HCA), 
consists of over [ADDRESS_1019965] across the continuum of healthcare delivery and will be a valuable consideration for other trials.   
 
4.3 Innovation – UH3 Trial Intervention Years 
 
 This pragmatic clinical trial will advance the nation’s progress toward what the IOM calls a “learning 
healthcare system” - one that both generates and uses evidence to guide clinical decision-making. It will 
[ADDRESS_1019966] to ensure that other quality improvement projects adopted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_745708]’s effect. The first trial to do 
this was our previous cluster-randomized trial of chlorhexidine bathing in ICU areas. The ABATE Infection Trial 
will assess potential new initiatives on a frequent basis and will proactively request that all participants report 
any new initiatives under consideration so that investigators may determine if a conflict exists. 
We will also generate sharable computer programs related to both trial process and analysis. This 
programming code, employing parallel commercial and open-source code, will be made publicly available.

(74 ICUs) in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745715] - the same healthcare system partner in this 
proposal. The three arms included: 1) screening and isolation (standard of care) : nasal screening for MRSA 
followed by [CONTACT_745917], 2) targeted decolonization : screening, followed, if positive, by [CONTACT_745918][INVESTIGATOR_554881] 5 days, and 3) universal decolonization : 
cessation of screening, universal application of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554881] 5 days, and daily chlorhexidine baths. Its primary 
outcome was MRSA clinical cultures with a secondary outcome of all pathogen ICU-associated infection (see 
Section 6.10.2). 
The REDUCE MRSA recruitment, design, implementation tools, data capture methods, and analytic 
processes are highly relevant for this trial of decolonization in non-critical care settings. In addition, the genesis 
of the REDUCE-MRSA trial was based upon extensive, long-term collaboration between the CDC public health 
experts, academic investigators, and HCA clinical leaders.  
Project CLEAR is an ongoing chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745716]+ 
patients upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745717]. Its primary outcomes are MRSA 
infection and readmission and its implementation tools will also be translatable to the ABATE Infection Trial. 
 
5.0.3 Health Care System (HCS) Partners 
Our healthcare system partner is Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554863] (HCA) and its three regional U.S. 
Groups. As one of the largest providers of healthcare in the U.S., HCA provides 5% of all major acute care 
services in the U.S. though its 160+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. HCA has conducted several successful infection prevention 
campaigns at the Group and Corporate level, including MRSA screening of high risk patients, antibiotic 
stewardship, and prevention bundles for central line associated infections. HCA has also actively engaged in 
several research studies, especially those in the arena of HAI. They have been the healthcare system partner 
for multi-center studies on reducing central line-associated bloodstream infections and surgical site infections, 
in addition to the REDUCE MRSA Trial. Key highlights of the HCA system include: 
 
 Corporate Structure for Infection Prevention/Quality  
Our HCA co-investigators are the corporate leaders of Quality, Performance Improvement, and Infection 
Prevention who lead all regional and system-wide initiatives in this arena. HCA will contribute the highly 
experienced services of [CONTACT_745977] (HCA site principal investigator, Medical Director of Infection 
Prevention and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]), Jason Hickok, MBA RN (Associate Vice President, Patient Safety and 
Infection Prevention), and Julia Moody, MS (Clinical Director of Infection Prevention and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]) to 
pursue this second major cluster-randomized trial with study investigators. This group has previously 
provided key collaborative coordination and implementation support for the REDUCE MRSA Trial. 
 
 Corporate/Group/Divisional Structure for Recruitment  
HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745718], Central Group, and the Southwest Group. The Groups 
consist of 50+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745719] a Group President and Chief Financial Officer. New quality 
improvement initiatives are determined and implemented at the Group level. In the ABATE Infection Trial, 
we will leverage the leadership from all three Groups to ensure adequate and rapid recruitment.  
 
 Corporate Data Warehouse  
HCA has established a corporate data warehouse that includes highly standardized hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745720], patient demographic data, admission and discharge information, billable charges, 
including coded diagnostic and procedure codes from each admission, and supply chain data. In addition, 
laboratory and microbiology data are also stored in the HCA data warehouse. Data flow continuously from 
each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745721], retrieve, 
standardize, and analyze clinical data as needed for this proposal and other needs.  
 
 Corporate Information Technology and Services (IT&S) 
HCA’s IT&S sector consists of 3,605 employees nationwide. Corporate IT&S is located in Nashville, TN 
where decision support programmer and analytic teams build and maintain HCA’s clinical documentation 
system and data warehouse. HCA’s IT&S sector has previously provided key elements for research trial 
needs, including computer based training modules, pharmacy logic to target products to participating units, 
nursing queries for daily documentation of trial protocols, and patient-level data for analysis. 
 
 
16 
  Corporate Supply Chain  
HCA Supply Chain Services (SCS) coordinates products and supplies to its facilities. For trial purposes, 
HCA’s SCS is able to channel products and divert products that may be incompatible with trial products. 
They also assess product volume needs in real time and ensure proper garnering of necessary supplies.  
 
 Corporate Regulatory/Compliance for Trial Assistance  
HCA’s corporate regulatory affairs and risk management office (David Vulcano MBA, Associate Vice  
President for Clinical Research) will work closely with a lead investigator IRB to provide coordinated central 
IRB approval for participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. This office is familiar with the regulatory process of clinical trials 
and has facilitated FWA, IRB, and required research training necessary for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745722]-randomized trials.  
 
 Corporate Financial Services Group 
HCA’s Financial Services Group handles conducts value analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses on the 
Group and corporate level and will be a valuable resource for this proposal.   
 
HCA provides an ideal test bed for a cluster-randomized trial of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745723]. Its community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745724] U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745725]. Importantly, HCA has pursued initiatives to ensure best 
practice standards so that this trial would evaluate improvement strategies over current gold standard care.  
 
5.10.0 Aim 1: Recruit hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272822] a cluster-randomized trial of 1) routine daily bathing with 
chlorhexidine for all patients plus 2) routine nasal decolonization with mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745726]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) in general medical and surgical units to reduce 
infection and readmissions. 
 
It is important to improve the speed and efficiency of clinical trials to address urgent needs for 
evidence-based practice. The ABATE Infection trial will use a novel, efficient process to recruit hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745727]-randomized trial. We will focus on recruiting community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], to increase the 
relevance of our research to the U.S. healthcare system.  
 
5.10.1 Preliminary Data 
 As mentioned above, we recently completed a 43-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 16-state cluster-randomized trial of 
decolonization in ICUs. Recruitment for that study was accomplished within 6 weeks. Recruitment activities 
leveraged HCA’s managerial leadership and communications systems to inform hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745728] 
(chief executive officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, ICU directors) about the trial and to 
advocate for participation. The trial also used corporate survey systems to assess eligibility.  
Specifically, HCA’s 3 regional Groups supported recruitment. Each Group governs quality improvement 
initiatives for its 50+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Requests for participation were endorsed by [CONTACT_745919]. Each 
respondent was given a survey to confirm inclusion criteria were met, including minimal use of decolonization 
products. Participation was confirmed by a signed letter of participation from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98166].  
 
5.10.[ADDRESS_1019977], we will use 
email and provide webinars through HCA’s webhosting system to introduce the trial and the process for 
participation. Second, solicitations for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745729] 160 HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745730] (see letter of support). Third, our HCA co-
investigators, who are the system-wide leaders of quality, performance improvement, and infection prevention, 
will provide direct-to-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341077]. Finally, we will directly reach out to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745731]. Recruitment announcements will utilize usual corporate and regional HCA communication 
channels and will be directed at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187094] (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Chief 
Nursing Officer) and infection prevention program directors.  
 
5.10.3 Criteria and Survey for Eligibility 
 Enrollment criteria for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745732] a) being a licensed acute care U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745733], and b) willingness to be randomized at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-level to either usual 
bathing care or decolonization. Within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], units that were eligible for participation included a) 
participating adult units of the following types: adult step-down (transitional care after leaving an ICU), medical, 
surgical, medical/surgical, and oncology non-critical care units, b) minimal current use of routine daily 
chlorhexidine bathing in these units (<30% of patients), c) less than 30% of unit patients undergoing cardiac or 
17 
 arthroplastic surgery, and d) average length of stay of at least [ADDRESS_1019978] confirm that they will avoid other discretionary 
infection prevention and quality initiatives for the duration of the trial, both the 1-year baseline and 18-month 
intervention period, (NOTE: intervention was extended to a 21-month trial in June 2015). The baseline period 
begins in the planning year and extends into the first half of the UH3 trial phase. Further details of the trial 
design, including rationale for the baseline observation period and timeline are found in UH3 Aim 3, Section 
6.10.4. 
We will exclude pediatric and specialty units, including psychiatry, obstetrics/post-partum, bone marrow 
transplant, and rehabilitation/skilled nursing units. Adult units that occasionally have children <12 are 
permissible, but children <12 admitted to participating units will not be included in the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745734]. 
 For each potential hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745735], enrollment criteria will be assessed by [CONTACT_745920]’s champi[INVESTIGATOR_745736]. The survey will additionally request contact [CONTACT_745921], bathing practices, and use of chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]. As done previously, 
surveys will be administered through HCA’s usual survey channels and results will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_745737] a database format. An example survey from our previous REDUCE MRSA trial is provided in 
Appendix A . 
 
5.10.4 Limitations and Planned Solutions 
 The main limitation of this recruitment aim is the potential failure to recruit 50 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. While we 
believe this is unlikely due to our previous trial of 43 HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], should enrollment be less than 50, we will 
pursue an elongation of the 18-month trial, (NOTE: intervention was extended to a 21-month trial in June 
2015).  
 
5.10.[ADDRESS_1019979] quarter of the UH2 planning year. A full description of UH2 milestones 
and timeline is found below in Section 5.60.0. 
 
5.20.0 Aim 2: Obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the cluster-randomized trial and 
maximize efficiency by [CONTACT_745901][INVESTIGATOR_745663] a central IRB.  
 
The current standard of engaging institutional review board (IRB) processes at each participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] a substantial hurdle for multi-center studies, particularly those involving dozens of sites, as this 
proposed study does.  In fact, even minor modifications required by [CONTACT_745922] a trial, without measurable improvements to patient safety.202 203 In 
addition, requiring institution-specific IRB review for multi-center trials has been associated with lower 
participation rates and highly redundant effort.204  Additionally, smaller and community-based hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745738], expertise and infrastructure to maintain local IRB committees. Outsourcing to commercial 
IRBs is a costly option that may deter facilities from participating in worthwhile research opportunities. These 
factors contribute to slower, smaller, less representative trials.  
 
5.20.1 Preliminary Data – Experience with Centralized IRB Coordination 
 We have relevant experience of IRB coordination from our REDUCE MRSA cluster-randomized trial. 
The Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_192334] (HPHC) IRB, in conjunction with HCA’s corporate regulatory affairs liaison, 
coordinated the IRB approval of [ADDRESS_1019980] be familiar with the 
18 
 intersection of research inquiry and routine healthcare improvement processes, and with the national guidance 
related to a waiver of documented informed consent.117 118  
 For the REDUCE MRSA trial, the HPHC IRB determined that a decolonization initiative for ICU patients 
was minimal risk. It further waived documentation of informed consent based upon regulatory criteria under 45 
CFR 46.116(d), 117(c) (2) and 56.109(c) (1).(38). Posted notices describing the trial and arm-specific details 
were required in all patient rooms (see Appendix B ). The HPHC IRB also required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745739].  
 
5.20.2 Centralized IRB Coordination for the ABATE Infection Trial 
 We will employ a similar centralized IRB process for the ABATE Infection Trial. The HPHC IRB, in 
conjunction with HCA’s corporate regulatory affairs and risk management office (David Vulcano MBA, 
Associate Vice President for Clinical Research), will provide central oversight for this trial and will facilitate 
delegation of IRB governance from participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745740] a 
custom-tailored “Human Subjects Protection Training for ABATE Site Research Liaisons” that was co-
developed by [CONTACT_745923].  This training will be offered via the centralized HCA HealthStream training 
module, which allows for real-time facility/individual completion tracking. Since the ABATE Infection Trial 
involves a similar decolonization intervention to the REDUCE MRSA Trial, except in a lower risk non-critical 
care population, we anticipate that this trial will also have documentation of informed consent waived based 
upon regulatory criteria under 45 CFR 46.116(d), 117(c) (2) and 56.109(c) (1).(38) since 1) trial activities meet 
minimal risk criteria, 2) the trial randomizes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], not patients, 3) all assigned activities will be performed 
under standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341083], and 4) some US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745741]. We will collect attestations 
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745742].  
 While we have optimized ceding and delegation procedures for this study, we believe the foundational 
work that we and our IRB have done has general utility.117 We would be very willing to share our experience 
and materials with other UH2/UH3 programs and with Collaboratory leadership. 
 
5.20.3 Limitations and Planned Solutions 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_745743], 
it will be the prerogative of participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745744]. For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745745], we 
will coordinate standardized IRB protocols and all subsequent modifications during the trial.  
 
5.20.4 Milestones and Timeline 
IRB approval for all participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745746]2 planning year. A 
full description of UH2 milestones and timeline is found below in Section 5.60.0. 
 
5.30 Aim 3: Develop trial educational materials and routine electronic nursing queries for daily bathing 
and decolonization in general medical and surgical inpatient areas. 
 
In the planning year, we will develop all trial materials for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745747], as well as 
compliance assessment tools and processes for the phase-in and intervention periods.  
 
5.30.[ADDRESS_1019981] previously developed materials for two chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745748] (see 
description in Section 5.0.2). The REDUCE MRSA Trial produced materials for ICU staff and Project CLEAR 
produced materials for patients following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. These materials contribute to the proposed 
protocol since our ICU materials involved educating staff for decolonizing sedated patients, and our post-
discharge materials involved direct-to-patient education for decolonization at home. The ABATE Infection Trial 
will need materials for staff whose patients are awake, and often ambulatory.  
Relevant materials from the REDUCE MRSA Trial are found in Appendix C , and include a 1) 
PowerPoint presentation introducing the trial to participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745749], 2) 
computer based training modules for frontline staff, 3) a nursing decolonization protocol, 4) “Just in Time” 
training materials for registry (temporary/float) nurses, 5) frequently asked questions by [CONTACT_3655], 6) talking points 
for staff to patients, 7) adverse event forms and training documents, and 8) a brief daily electronic nursing 
documentation module for assessing chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745750], as well as 
documenting reasons for non-use ( Appendix C ); this was incorporated into HCA’s centralized system for daily 
[ADDRESS_1019982] CLEAR Trial include 1) bathing and 
showering instructions for patients, 2) frequently asked questions by [CONTACT_1962], 3) adverse events information, 
and 4) a quick reference guide ( Appendix D ). 
In addition, during the REDUCE MRSA trial, we collected MRSA isolates from all participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
To do this, we created laboratory toolkits ( Appendix E ), which included 1) detailed instructions, 2) a Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet, 3) collection log sheets, 4) deidentified study ID labels, and 5) a quick reference 
wall chart ( Appendix F ) providing a streamlined diagram of the key elements for collection. Details were 
reviewed in laboratory-specific coaching calls ( Appendix G ). 
 
5.30.[ADDRESS_1019983] CLEAR Trials. Here, we describe the materials that will be created in the planning year. The manner in 
which these materials will be used is described in detail in UH3 Aim 1 (see Section 6.10.8 and 6.10.9).  
Study arm-specific binders will be developed for distribution after randomization (see Section 6.10.5). 
These will be distributed to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s leadership, infection prevention program liaisons, and the nurse 
educator, nurse manager, and medical director of participating units. We anticipate 50 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745751] 4 participating units each, for a total of 14 binders per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or 700 total binders (350 per arm). 
Binder contents are detailed in Table 3. In addition to distributing paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_745752], we will 
also use HCA’s intranet (Atlas) to post these trial-specific materials. Similar to our prior trial, study arm-specific 
intranet sites will be created; each site will have access only to material about its assigned treatment regimen.

HCA routinely uses computer based training (CBT) modules to ensure completion of required health 
learning activities. The system (HealthStream) allows selective assignment to specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], units, and job 
types throughout HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. We will develop arm-specific CBT modules to be completed by [CONTACT_745925]. The CBTs will focus on the rationale behind the trial, review protocol 
details related to the assigned treatment arm, and make clear that the assigned treatment is routine practice 
for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745753]. Compliance will be tracked locally and centrally by [CONTACT_745926]’s Director of 
Clinical Education Development, who will provide detailed reports to HCA co-investigators.  
 
5.30.3 Development of Electronic Nursing Documentation Modules 
 HCA uses a centralized system (MEDITECH) for documentation of nursing care. We will create arm-
specific electronic MEDITECH documentation screens that will require nurses to answer questions each 
daytime and evening shift about whether each of their patients was bathed with chlorhexidine and whether 
nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745754]. In the Usual Care Arm, if a chlorhexidine bath or shower was provided 
(non-compliance with protocol), it will require one of the following reasons (e.g. pre-operative bathing, 
physician order, or free-text response). In contrast, in the Decolonization Arm, if chlorhexidine is not given 
(non-compliance with protocol), it will similarly require one of a different set of reasons (e.g. patient allergic, 
patient refused, physician refused, or free-text response). An example from our prior trial is found in Appendix 
C. These responses will be tracked for monthly compliance assessments in both arms.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_1019984], batch, and send bacterial isolates on a monthly basis using the same protocol regardless of arm. Full 
details are provided in UH3 Aim 2, but the development of materials is described here. 
We will create a PowerPoint presentation for an introductory webinar to participating laboratories at the 
beginning of strain collection. This presentation will introduce laboratory staff to study staff and detail the entire 
process for de-identified strain collection. This will be followed by [CONTACT_745927] (see example from 
prior trial, Appendix E ), which will include 1) a Step-by-Step instruction sheet, 2) a Frequently Asked 
Questions (FAQ) sheet, 3) collection log sheets with a clipboard, 4) de-identified study ID labels, 5) FedEx 
mailing instruction sheets, 6) a shipment packing list, 7) a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_173574], and 8) a quick reference wall 
chart with a streamlined diagram of key elements for collection (see example from prior trial, Appendix F ).  
In order to ensure that the volume of MRSA+ and gram-negative rod (GNR) isolates that are collected 
during the baseline period are sufficient to support analysis around whether or not study agents engendered 
resistance, it will be crucial to obtain a full 12-months worth of isolates.  It is anticipated that participating 
ABATE Infection Study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745755] 3/01/2013 and continue collection through 2/28/2014 in order to support this activity.  Collected 
isolates will include MRSA+ and the following eight select GNR organisms.  Isolates will have already been 
collected as part of a patient’s routine medical care. 
E. coli  P. aeruginosa   
K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca   A. baumannii   
P. mirabilis   S. maltophilia   
S. marcescens   Burkholderia spp.   
 
Once full IRB approval is obtained (either via ceding to the HPHC IRB or pursuing individual review) at 
each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745756] (see Section 5.20.0), isolates may then be shipped to the 
central study laboratory at Rush University, Chicago for analysis and storage.   
 
5.30.[ADDRESS_1019985] half of the planning year, prior to initiating 
baseline collection of isolates. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745757].   
A full description of UH2 milestones and timeline is found below in Section 5.60.0. 
 
5.40.0 Aim 4: Obtain baseline data on HAI infection rates for participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745758]. These will be obtained using corporate data warehouse capabilities of 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554863] (HCA).  
 
During the planning year, we will work with the NIH Collaboratory to develop and validate our electronic 
methods and tools for data sampling. We will extract data from the centralized data warehouses of HCA and 
develop adequate control measures to ensure high quality data extraction and cleaning methods. 
 
5.40.[ADDRESS_1019986] had extensive experience with data from HCA’s centralized data warehouse through our 
previous trial. The REDUCE MRSA Trial evaluated similar outcomes (clinical cultures and all-cause 
bloodstream events) in ICU locations. Data streams familiar to this investigative group include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745759], 
microbiology, pharmacy, supply chain, MEDITECH documentation, and administrative data.  
 
 
 
21 
 5.40.2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745760] (Table 4) will be requested from HCA’s Information Technology team to 
sample patient descriptors and baseline primary outcomes and ensure adequate processes for high quality 
data pulls. For details about trial design, outcomes, and analysis, see UH3 Aim 1 (Section 6.10).

5.40.3 Data Access – Virtual Machine 
To maximally protect the large volume of protected health information required for the ABATE Infection 
Trial, HCA will establish a mechanism similar to our previous trial where our programmer analysts gain access 
to HCA data behind the HCA firewall. Programmer analysts will receive remote access to a virtual machine 
where requested data will be placed after extraction by [CONTACT_745926]’s information technologists. This extraction 
process will involve replacement of names and medical record numbers with coded identifiers. Programmers 
will access this virtual machine to clean and analyze data, and to generate summary level output for review 
with our statistician. All data cleaning and analysis will be performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC). 
 
5.40.[ADDRESS_1019987] two days in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5120] (CDC criteria).206 We will describe their age, gender, 
and comorbidity characteristics based upon ICD-9 diagnostic codes. We will compare these characteristics 
across units and across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745764]. Data discrepancies will result in 
discussions with HCA co-investigators and information technologists for repeat data pulls and examination of 
data for errors in coding or variations in data storage. 
We will evaluate primary outcomes in the baseline period by [CONTACT_745929] a gram-positive 
multi-drug resistant organism (MRSA or VRE) from a clinical culture among the patients who meet eligibility 
criteria. Secondary outcomes derived from the HCA data warehouse will include isolation of a gram-negative 
multi-drug resistant organism from a clinical culture, all-cause bloodstream infection, blood culture 
contaminants, urinary tract infection (with an a priori expectation of greater impact in men than women due to 
endogenous infection), C. difficile  infection, 30-day infectious readmissions and all-cause readmissions, and 
emergence of chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745765]. 
Using CDC criteria, blood cultures due to skin commensals will require at least two cultures within [ADDRESS_1019988] 50,000 colony 
counts. Outcomes will be calculated as events per 10,000 patient days, and similar evaluations for data 
discrepancies or missing data will be performed. 
5.40.41 Data Standardization 
 Currently, microbiology data from HCA facilities is found in a single system (Meditech). However, 
Meditech allows for four methods of reporting microbiology results, including a form of free text. In response to 
excessive data cleaning requirements to standardize across facilities, the investigative team and the HCA 
corporate laboratory services leadership instituted the standardization of reported microbiology results across 
the ABATE facilities. This decision was driven in large part by [CONTACT_745930]. ABATE Trial facilities are considered a pi[INVESTIGATOR_745766] a corporate-wide 
microbiology laboratory standardization campaign. 
22 
  Microbiology laboratories serving facilities in the ABATE Infection Trial were notified of the requirement 
to report microbiology results via a single acceptable reporting mechanism in March 2013, one month prior to 
the start of baseline data collection. The selected mechanism allows for maximal electronic parsing of data into 
required elements for determining microbiologic outcomes. As of March 2013, only 30% of participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745767]. By [CONTACT_11713] 2013, half of participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745768], and by [CONTACT_745931] 2013, 91% (50/54) of facilities had 
converted. Previously used methods of robust data cleaning and standardization will be required from the start 
of the baseline period until complete adoption for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745769]-versed in this process. 
5.40.42 Data Creation 
Since tracking of patient bathing is not routinely done in U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], a single nursing query was 
created to be completed once daily asking if a bath/shower was completed in the past 24 hours and whether 
the bath/shower involved chlorhexidine. If a bath/shower was not provided (regardless of use of chlorhexidine), 
the prompt requires a reason by [CONTACT_745932]. This bathing query 
was activated in March 2013 and is in use at all participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
 
5.40.5 Limitations and Planned Solutions 
Should data barriers fail to be resolved for specific hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], we will evaluate the possibility of obtaining 
needed data variables directly from the facility rather than the data warehouse. If missing or insufficient data 
cannot be resolved, we will note the time period and exclude the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745770]. 
We note that this has not been the case for previous trial evaluations using HCA data. 
 
5.40.6 Milestones and Timeline 
During the planning year, HCA data will be extracted for 4-months of the baseline period.  A full 
description of UH2 milestones and timeline is found below in Section 5.60.0. 
 
5.50.0 Collaboratory Work Groups  
 
 Throughout the planning and intervention phases, we will work closely with the NIH Collaboratory 
Coordinating Center to align study design, implementation processes, data extraction and quality control plans, 
and confirmation of study outcomes. Our lead investigators will actively participate in the HCS Research 
Collaboratory Steering Committee, and members of our investigative team will actively participate in HCS 
Research Collaboratory Work Groups established by [CONTACT_745933]:

 Together, these milestones will perform five critical functions to enable the launch of the trial in the UH3 
intervention phase. First, we will identify and finalize the [ADDRESS_1019989], we will initiate the baseline period, 
which will include collection of baseline bacterial strains from all participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745773]/showering frequencies in all units. Fourth, we will develop all main trial materials and toolkits in 
preparation for intervention launch. Fifth, we will demonstrate the ability to pull a sample of baseline data and 
outcomes. This will enable us to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our data processes, identify data 
cleaning and quality control routines, and confirm power estimates for the study using actual baseline data. 
The achievement of these milestones will enable a smooth transition into the UC3 trial phase, which includes 
the second part of the baseline period plus the phase-in and intervention periods. 
 
5.70.0 UH2 Planning Phase Summary 
This UH2 proposal provides the foundation for a critically needed trial to reduce the majority of 
healthcare-associated infections which are occurring outside of ICU settings. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_745774] (HAIs), these gains have not translated to reductions in 
the greater number of non-critical care units in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. This trial will enable the testing of a decolonization 
protocol that can be applied during routine bathing and showering processes to assess its ability to reduce 
HAIs for the vast majority of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. 
 
6.0 Approach – UH3 Trial Intervention Phase 
 
 
6.0.[ADDRESS_1019990] 
HAIs remain a top 10 cause of death in the U.S. despi[INVESTIGATOR_745775]. The 
ABATE Infection Trial ( Addressing Bioburden while Admitted To Eliminate Infection) seeks to further national 
gains by [CONTACT_745934]-ICU medical, surgical, and oncology units each year, 
including readmissions due to HAI occurring shortly after discharge.[ADDRESS_1019991] practice for 
preventing infection among 40 million patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745776], and would substantially reduce the $6.[ADDRESS_1019992] healthcare costs associated with HAIs in the U.S. alone.  
 
6.0.2 Hypothesis 
We hypothesize that daily bathing and showering of non-critical care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745777]-associated gram positive multi-drug resistant bacteria 
(MRSA and VRE). We further hypothesize that it will also reduce other healthcare associated events such as 
gram negative multi-drug resistant pathogens, all cause bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection, C difficile 
infection, blood culture contamination, and readmissions. This intervention strategy will be compared to routine 
bathing and showering care in 50 community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].   
24 
  
6.10 Aim 1: Conduct a 50+-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745667]-randomized controlled trial of routine chlorhexidine bathing 
and selective MRSA decolonization versus standard-of-care practices for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745778]-critical care adult medical, surgical, and oncology units. The primary outcome will be clinical 
burden of gram-positive multi-drug resistant organisms. Secondary outcomes will include clinical 
burden of gram-negative  multi-drug resistant organisms, bloodstream infections, and readmissions 
caused by [CONTACT_80601] . 
 
This aim describes the study design, implementation, and analysis of a large cluster-randomized trial to 
assess whether universal chlorhexidine bathing plus selective MRSA decolonization will significantly reduce 
sterile site infections and infectious readmissions in patients on non-critical care units. This study will illustrate 
the efficiency of cluster randomization in a network environment for evaluating the effectiveness of decreasing 
bioburden for HAI reduction. Salient features include minimizing the burden of implementation and evaluation, 
ensuring advocacy by [CONTACT_745935], streamlining multi-site policy implementation, using existing quality 
improvement personnel and methods, using information about processes of care and outcomes obtained as 
part of routine medical care, and leveraging informatics capabilities that allow centralized access to these data. 
The use of an existing infrastructure is maximized by [CONTACT_745936][INVESTIGATOR_600], so that all participating units 
in each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745779], supply chain, and compliance and reporting procedures. 
 
6.10.1 Preliminary Data – A Multi-center Cluster-Randomized Trial of Decolonization in ICU Patients  
 We highlight additional features of the REDUCE ( Randomized Evaluation of Decolonization vs 
Universal Clearance to Eliminate) MRSA Trial (see initial description in Section 5.0.2),19 125 a recently 
completed 43-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745667]-randomized trial by [CONTACT_745937]. Use of similar features will enable 
efficient implementation of the ABATE Infection Trial. Features include: 
 Robust health system infrastructure for corporate communications, decision-making and 
coordination of activities at the regional and corporate levels, and information technology support.   
 Efficient recruitment and IRB clearance  have already been described in UH2 Aims 1 and 2. 
 Easy accessibility  to trial staff in multiple sites through a real-time collaborative e-mail platform – 
enabling multi-user simultaneous editing for categorizing and prioritizing email inquiries, assigning them 
to specific responders, and streamlining workflow processing – and toll-free number enabling excellent 
coverage across time zones. Over 5,[ADDRESS_1019993] email inquiries were fielded, as well as over 200 
phone calls originating from unit champi[INVESTIGATOR_745780].  
 Division of labor  by [CONTACT_745938] 5,000+ specimens by [ADDRESS_1019994] that laboratories generally work early shifts 
from 6am-2pm. Conversely, since bathing of ICU patients was generally performed on the evening/ 
night shift, the west coast trial staff fielded all coordination questions related to protocol implementation. 
 Readily available training and trial materials  were provided to unit champi[INVESTIGATOR_745781], including study binders (see Preliminary Data section 5.30.1), computer-based 
training modules posted to participating unit staff, 55 site visits for chlorhexidine cloth bathing 
instruction and training as well as ad hoc requests for additional site visits.  
 Centralized product distribution  by [CONTACT_745926]’s corporate central supply and pharmacy systems enabled 
tracking of usage to ensure adequate supply. It also allowed diversion of product when demands 
exceeded planned supply. Importantly, central supply chain prevented distribution of incompatible 
products and facilitated substitutions. Specialized pharmacy routines were also used to ensure trial 
product delivery to participating units. 
 Routine mechanisms for compliance were leveraged, including electronic nursing queries inserted in 
the usual framework of nursing documentation, and associated electronic reports of these queries 
which were retrievable by [CONTACT_745939][INVESTIGATOR_5458]. In addition, periodic observed bathing events (3 per quarter 
per unit) were performed by [CONTACT_745940][INVESTIGATOR_745782].  
 Arm-specific coaching calls were used to build camaraderie and engagement. They occurred weekly 
in intervention arms and every other week for standard-of-care arms for the first several months of the 
initial trial period before converting to monthly calls. A total of 48 coaching calls were provided during 
the REDUCE MRSA Trial. They were used to allow same-arm hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745783]. In addition, coaching calls enabled investigators to review 
compliance performance across participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and inquire about the presence of new 
initiatives and adverse events. Roll call was taken at all calls. Special topic coaching calls and podcasts 
25 
 were also provided to give expert review of the literature and allow expanded question and answer 
sessions for common questions from frontline staff (e.g. safe use of chlorhexidine on wounds).  
 Trial-specific coordinating calls  were held regularly, including weekly investigator group calls and 
monthly steering committee calls during the intervention period, followed by [CONTACT_745941]-intervention and post-intervention period. 
The investigator and steering committees played the important role of adjudicating whether new or 
upcoming hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745784]. In the REDUCE MRSA Trial, a total of [ADDRESS_1019995] with the trial. One hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745785] a conflicting initiative. 
 Detailed logs were maintained related to contact [CONTACT_745942][INVESTIGATOR_745786], adverse event logs, new initiative requests, and the determination of whether they 
conflicted with the trial. All calls and emails were cataloged into major groups and documented with 
various study staff in charge of specific types of inquiries. 
 
6.10.2 Preliminary Data – Results of REDUCE MRSA Trial of Decolonization in ICUs  
The REDUCE MRSA Trial was an 18-month 3-arm cluster-randomized trial involving 74 adult ICUs in 
43 community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600],205 with the goals of reducing clinical isolates of MRSA and bloodstream infections due 
to all pathogens. All ICUs in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745787]. Study arms were: 1) screening and 
isolation (pre-trial standard of care) : nasal screening for MRSA followed by [CONTACT_745917], 2) targeted 
decolonization : screening, followed, if positive, by [CONTACT_745943][INVESTIGATOR_554881] 5 days, and 3) universal decolonization : cessation of screening, universal application of 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_554881] 5 days, and daily chlorhexidine baths. Proportional hazards models with shared frailty were used 
to assess differences in infection reductions across the arms while accounting for clustering by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
We randomized 43 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64572] 16 states. There were 74 adult ICUs with 48,390 admissions in the 
baseline period and 74,256 in the intervention period. There were significant differences between arms in the 
relative hazards for intervention vs. baseline for both clinical isolates of MRSA and bloodstream infections 
caused by [CONTACT_745944] (Table). In each case, universal decolonization produced a significantly greater 
reduction than screening and isolation. Targeted decolonization was not significantly different from screening 
and isolation alone. Adjusted analyses yielded similar results (Table). 
 
Universal decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745788] a 37% reduction in 
MRSA clinical cultures and a 44% reduction in bloodstream infections due to all pathogens. The targeted 
decolonization arm was not significantly different from screening and isolation alone. Universal decolonization 
also eliminates the need to obtain surveillance cultures and reduces need for isolation.  
 
6.10.3 Preliminary Data - HAI Rates in Non-Critical Care Units in Health Care System Partner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745789]-ICU data from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745790], we estimated the baseline 
rates of bacteremia due to all pathogens as well as due to MRSA alone ( Table 7). These data reflect non-ICU 
data from only the 13 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (104,852 admissions) in the universal decolonization arm of the REDUCE 
MRSA Trial. We use this arm to provide conservative estimates since this arm had non-significant reductions in 
post-ICU sterile site infections due to all pathogens.  
 
 Table 7. Estimates of HAI Rates in Non-ICU Areas Targeted by [CONTACT_745945]-ICU Estimate  Events/1 0,000 Patients  
MRSA Bloodstream  Infection  62/104,852 5.9 
All Pathogen Bloodstream  Infection  894/104,852 85.3 
 

26 
 These data include all patients in non-ICU areas excepting areas that would be excluded in this trial 
(pediatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics, rehabilitation/skilled nursing, bone marrow transplant units).  
 
Readmission Rates due to Infections in Health Care System Partner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745791], but restricting to those discharged during the study period (N=103,874), 
we calculated a 0.038 rate of readmission due to infectious diagnoses within 30 days of discharge. Admissions 
were deemed to be due to infections if ICD-9 infectious diagnoses were found in the primary or secondary 
diagnosis position. Infectious diagnoses were limited to those likely to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745792] (mainly bacterial). 
These data will be used for power calculations for the ABATE Infection Trial (Section 6.10.12). 
 
 
6.10.4 Trial Design and Study Population 
The ABATE Infection Trial will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial of 54 HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], evaluating 2 
regimens to reduce HAIs in general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745793] ( Figure 1 ).  
Our intent is to move forward with [ADDRESS_1019996] multiple simultaneous campaigns ongoing to improve patient care. For 
the ABATE Trial, we require monthly confirmation of either no interventions/ new campaigns at their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] 
a reporting to the Steering Committee of what campaigns or interventions are in consideration or being 
launched. Should the Steering Committee identify a conflict, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745794]. Given that conflicts are likely to arise and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745795], we will proceed with the 
[ADDRESS_1019997] 50 will remain in the trial for the full duration. 
The ABATE Infection Trial will employ a 12-month baseline period from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 
2014, a 2-month phase in period from April 1 to May 31, 2014and an 18-month intervention period from June 
1, 2014 to November 30, 2015, (NOTE: intervention was extended to a 21-month trial in June 2015, ending 
February 29, 2016). The unit of randomization will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with all participating units within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745796]. This preserves the usual structure for quality improvement and avoids confusion of 
having similar units, often with shared patients and staff, assigned to different protocols. 
Since 2007, current practice across all HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745797]: patients transferred from other facilities (including other acute care 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], rehabilitation centers, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living centers), ICU patients, hemodialysis 
patients, and patients undergoing cardiac, orthopedic, and open spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]. Screening compliance has 
been >90% on serial HCA internal surveys. MRSA+ patients are placed into isolation precautions, which 
involve assignment to a single room plus gown and glove use by [CONTACT_131459]. 
 
 
Figure 1 : Two study arms of the 
ABATE Infection Trial 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745798]. Both arms will continue to conduct routine 
MRSA screening for high risk patients and will place MRSA+ patients in isolation precautions. The first arm will 
continue the routine policy of offering assisted or unassisted daily showers/bed baths with regular soap, and 
will agree not to institute components of the other arm for the duration of the study. In the second arm, all 
patients will be encouraged to shower or have a bed bath daily with chlorhexidine products. In addition, 
patients known to be MRSA+ will receive nasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745799] a day for 5 days. We anticipate an 
average of 4 adult non-critical care units per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], for a total of 200+ units across the 54 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
For full recruitment details, see UH2 Aim 1. Participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745800]-critical care units participate in the trial. These are defined as step-down, medical, surgical, 
medical/surgical, and oncology units. Children <12 admitted to participating units will not receive the mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745801]. Arm 1: Usual Care  (N = 25+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600])

A summary of the overall study design is found in Table 8. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_745802]-scale nature of this 
cluster-randomized trial, The ABATE Infection Trial will take precautions to adjust for imbalance in confounders 
or outcomes across the 54 participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. As described further below, imbalance in the numbers of 
patients and baseline outcomes will be minimized by a randomization strategy that stratifies by [CONTACT_745946]-drug resistant organisms from a clinical or screening culture (primary outcome) 
across participating populations in trial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Residual imbalance in baseline outcomes will be further 
addressed by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a 1-year baseline period and comparing the changes between intervention and 
baseline periods between the two arms of the trial (see Analysis Section 6.10.11). As mentioned in UH2 Aim 4, 
complete data for the baseline period will be obtained from electronic health records and can be obtained after 
recruitment and after the trial is completed.

6.10.[ADDRESS_1020002] cluster-randomized trials of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], simple randomization of 54 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554897], and without blocking could even result in 
unequal numbers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341086]. For example, with a naïve randomization, there would be a 9% 
chance of a 22-33 split, or worse. Thus, randomization will be stratified, with strata constructed to maximize the 
chance of balance for both baseline admission volume and the primary outcome, MRSA and VRE clinical 
cultures attributable to participating units. In addition, we will evaluate the possibility of constructing strata that 
balance additional variables, such as the mean comorbidity index (Romano score) of all patients in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
participating units, the percent of patients bathing daily, and the baseline use of chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190].  
Achieving balance on key features of the randomization units (in this case, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) is a critical task in 
cluster-randomized trials, but little literature on it exists. Unlike individually-randomized trials, information about 
the clusters is often known in advance, but the number of clusters to be randomized can be relatively small. 
The existence of a priori data can mitigate the small numbers and help to obtain adequate balance through 
stratification. One attractive approach is to establish tuplets—matched sets (pairs, for a two-arm trial) – in 
which one member of each tuplet is assigned to each arm. Schemes for constructing tuplets need not be 
guided by [CONTACT_75780]. A formal approach would be to calculate the Mahalanobis distance between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745810]. In this approach, we could 
[ADDRESS_1020003] classes of balance on a key 
variable and making pairs within these strata based on lower-priority variables. However, there is no “best” 
method of tuplet construction, only sets that come closer to meeting the varied needs of each trial.  
We will enhance methods to inform the choice of tuplet-construction scheme which we developed in the 
REDUCE MRSA trial,125 205 and share them (see software sharing plan). One example method is to establish 
the pairs under several plausible tuplet-construction schemes, and use graphical methods to compare all 
possible realizations for balance between the arms under each scheme. For example, if two variables must be 
balanced, we could tentatively divide the sample into two groups under a tuplet construction scheme and then 
generate a scatterplot showing the between-arm absolute value of the mean difference for one variable on the 
x-axis and the second on the y-axis for each possible result of the randomization. We would then divide the 
groups again under the same scheme, and find another point on the scatterplot. Repeating many times would 
show the typi[INVESTIGATOR_341088] a scheme. Comparing the resulting scatterplots from each 
tuplet-construction scheme can reveal the relative risks of imbalance and benefits for balance accruing to each 
randomization scheme, in a practical sense. One tuplet construction method may result in generally close 
balance on one key characteristic and very variable balance on the other, while a competing scheme has good 
median balance on both characteristics, but where each has a long tail implying a few bad-luck assignments 
with poor balance. We presented an early version of this work at the April [ADDRESS_1020004] is not 
confounded—confounding requires that the confounder be out of balance between the arms.  We will examine 
whether the gain in power is strong enough, and the loss of balance slight enough, to pursue the strata of four 
in place of tuplets.

6.10.7 Baseline Period Activities 
 The 1 year trial baseline period begins in the UH2 Planning Phase and ends in the UH3 Trial 
Intervention Phase. It serves two major purposes. Its primary function is to provide baseline outcome data for 
both arms (see Analysis Section 6.10.11). Second, it enables the collection of baseline bacterial strains which 
will be used to assess if antibiotic resistance is differentially engendered between the study arms (see strain 
collection details in UH3 Aim 2, Section 6.20. These activities will occur during the Planning Phase, when we 
will perform recruitment, develop educational materials and computer based training modules, and program 
electronic nursing prompts and compliance reports for the intervention protocol (UH2 Aim 3, Section 5.30).  
 
6.10.8 Phase-In Period Activities  
There will be a 2-month phase-in period after the baseline period. During this period, which will not 
contribute to either the baseline or intervention periods, we will disseminate campaign products and materials 
to the Decolonization Arm. Since our intervention utilizes usual care processes, including standardized nursing 
protocols (for chlorhexidine, a non-prescription product) and standardized order sets (for mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], a 
prescription drug FDA approved for this use), these processes need to undergo usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745811], and medical executive or quality standards boards. All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745812]. After 
randomization, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745813]-in period. This was achieved in <30 days in our prior trial.   
Following randomization, frontline staff will be required to complete trial-specific and arm-specific 
computer based training modules (see Trial Materials, Section 5.30.2). CBTs will be assigned to specific units 
and frontline staff and, for the decolonization arm, will include a bathing video on bathing technique. CBT 
training can and will begin prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745814] 21-days to complete it. 
In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745815]-specific coaching calls. Calls will occur every other week 
during the phase-in period. All coaching calls will be webinars and led by [CONTACT_745948], including active 
attendance and support by [CONTACT_745949]. A PowerPoint slide set will be reviewed with a question and 
answer session, and a set of key questions will be posed to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745816]. All 
coaching calls will be recorded and placed on arm-specific ABATE Infection Trial sites on the HCA intranet for 
continued access by [CONTACT_341151]. Common questions posed to Decolonization Arm 
participants during this phase will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745817], CBT training status, product 
stocking, removal/replacement of products incompatible with chlorhexidine and posting of wall clings providing 
bathing instruction, (see description of trial materials in Section 5.30.2, and wall cling examples from a prior 
trial in Appendix B, H ). Participants will be highly encouraged to share concerns and solutions with one 
another.  
In both Decolonization and Usual Care Arm coaching calls, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745818] (or report the initiative to trial investigators for 
determination of trial conflict). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745819] a phone call from HCA trial liaisons. In our previous trial, we found that sharing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-specific 
status reports in PowerPoint presentations, and rapid follow-up for non-response resulted in very high rates of 
31 
 participation from all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745820]. Between calls, core staff will follow up on any ongoing issues and 
document resolution. 
 As described in UH2 Aim 2, IRB approval will be obtained for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745821]; 
we most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745822] a central IRB for approval. In the phase-in period, once trial protocols 
are further approved by [CONTACT_745950][INVESTIGATOR_745823], intervention activities will be put into place ( Table 11 ). 
Decolonization Arm hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745824] 4% liquid chlorhexidine solution in all showers in 
participating units. Mesh sponges will be provided for shower use since they substantially enhance product 
lathering. In addition, 2% no-rinse chlorhexidine cloths for bed baths (contributed by [CONTACT_745951], Inc – see letter of 
support) will be stocked for routine bed baths by [CONTACT_745952]. Unit nurse educators will be 
engaged and all nurses and bathing staff will be trained to encourage daily bathing or showering. In addition, 
the phase-in period will include compliance assessments that routinely accompany HCA quality improvement 
initiatives. A summary of activities is found in Table 11  and is detailed in UH2 Aim 3 (Section 5.30.2).

6.10.9 Intervention Period Activities  
 Intervention period activities will be identical to phase-in period activities. As mentioned in Table 11 , 
compliance feedback will be shared monthly during coaching calls based upon nursing queries embedded in 
usual e-documentation (see UH2 Aim 3 and Table 11  above) that will require a response each shift about 
whether a bath or shower had occurred and, if so, with what product. For the Decolonization Arm, a negative 
response will require a reason from a drop down menu. E-reports will be used for chlorhexidine since it is not a 
prescription drug. Pharmacy records will be used to track dispensing of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190]. 
In addition to on-site bathing training provided to all intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745834]-in period, we will 
perform site visits to participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745835], concerns about 
intervention protocols, or evidence of low compliance. For the usual care arm, evidence of decolonization 
would constitute “low compliance.” Site visits would be comparable to those used by [CONTACT_745958]. In addition, HCA leadership (specifically, the quality performance and 
infection prevention team that are co-investigators on this proposal) performs routine site visits to all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745836] a rotating basis and will incorporate encouragement, inquiries, and process assessments related to trial 
activities and microbiology laboratory submission of isolates (see UH3 Aim 2) during visits to trial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
Special coaching calls and podcasts on trial rationale will be provided to both arms. As in our previous 
trial, wound care nurses from HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745837].   
 Investigators will continue to have weekly calls during the intervention phase, as well as active 
participation in the NIH HCS Research Collaboratory Steering Committee and Collaboratory Work Groups. All 
activities will be conducted in concert with the HCS Research Collaboratory Coordinating Center (CCC).  
 
6.10.10 Data Acquisition  
 The Data and Analytics Team will include lead investigators, HCA co-investigators, trial programmer 
analysts, statisticians, and HCA information technologists. Data pulls will be based upon detailed specifications 
and will be accompanied by [CONTACT_745959]. Data will be pulled from census, microbiology, pharmacy, supply 
chain, nursing query reports, and administrative data from HCA corporate data warehouses as described in 
UH2 Aim 4 (Section 5.40). Numerators for most outcome data will be derived from microbiology final result files 
limited to sterile site specimens from participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Denominators will be derived from unit-specific 
census data. We will also provide descriptive data including demographic and comorbidity data from 
administrative claims data, compliance data from nursing queries, and product use from pharmacy and supply 
chain data, and data on use of hand hygiene products, glove, and gown use across arms.  
33 
  
 
 
 
6.10.11 Statistical Analysis 
 All outcomes will be assessed similarly. Here, we use the example of the primary outcome: clinical 
cultures with MRSA or VRE (first per patient). MRSA and VRE clinical cultures will be attributed to participating 
units if the collection date occurred >2 days after admission to that unit through two days after discharge from 
that unit. This attribution is consistent with CDC guidance for surveillance of nosocomial infections.208 
 Main trial results will be based upon as-randomized, unadjusted analyses using proportional hazards 
models to account for patients’ variable tenure in the unit. This is necessary for the usual reasons: 
dichotomizing patients into those with vs. without infections would require us to define a fixed time-frame 
(within first x days of eligibility, ignoring some infections and omitting patients with shorter stays) or to ignore 
exposed time (counting infection during unit stay regardless of different length of stay). In addition, power is 
greater for proportional hazards models than for logistic regression models.209 210 211 212 
As discussed with the Statistical Core Working Group of the Collaboratory, clustering within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745838]. The frailties are added model terms that allow unique hazards ratios for 
each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and are necessary to account for clustered randomization.213 Model terms will include individual-
level data on arm, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], outcome events, trial period (baseline vs. intervention) and an interaction term 
between trial period and arm. The assessment of trial success will be determined by [CONTACT_745960], which assesses whether the difference in hazard between the baseline and intervention 
period differs significantly between the two arms. We can write a simple version of the model symbolically as:  
𝜆௜௝(𝑡)=𝜆଴(𝑡)𝑒ఉభ஺௥௠೔ೕାఉమ௉௘௥௜௢ௗ ೔ೕାఉయ஺௥௠೔ೕ∗௉௘௥௜௢ௗ ೔ೕାఊ೔ 
where 𝑖 is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 𝑗 is a person within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 𝐴𝑟𝑚 and 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 are indicator variables and are = [ADDRESS_1020009] rate over time for person 𝑖𝑗 is defined as 𝜆௜௝(𝑡), a function of the baseline hazard 𝜆଴(𝑡), which is similar 
to the intercept in a linear model, times the proportionality for that subject, which is defined by [CONTACT_745961] 
𝐴𝑟𝑚௜௝ and 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 ௜௝ and the associated parameters, as well as the frailty, γi. The frailties are closely analogous 
to the random effect in generalized linear mixed models, and account for the clustering (similarity of hazard) 
within a given hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The ultimate effect of the intervention is assessed through 𝛽ଷ: as parameterized, if it is 
negative and has p-value < .05 (or 95% CI excluding 0) then the intervention reduces the risk of infection. We 
plan to assess the need for different frailties by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_745839] (instead of just by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307]), as well as 
additional clustering by [CONTACT_745962][INVESTIGATOR_307]. In addition, we will investigate the need to adjust for the stratified 
randomization scheme described above in Section 6.10.53 
 Subsequent analyses will include as-treated and covariate-adjusted models. Adjusted models will 
account for individual characteristics such as age, gender, comorbidities based upon ICD-9 codes, and receipt 
of intervention products. We will also account for unit type (step down, medical, surgical, etc.) and baseline 
bathing frequency if this is not balanced after randomization. All analyses will be performed using current 
versions of SAS (9.4, as of writing, SAS Institute, Cary NC) and/or R (3.0.2, as of writing).[ADDRESS_1020010], this trial 
meets the requirements of a minimal risk study. The study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_19166]/decolonization therapy 
necessitates neither interim analyses nor stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_745840]. Second, the collection time plus the lag in obtaining data and the relatively sparse power 
suggest that it is highly unlikely that an early look would result in a stoppage of the trial for either futility or 
success. Third, the addition of an interim analysis would affect power estimates in such a way to create an 
elongation of the trial beyond the time period that is acceptable to our health system partner. As described in 
detail above, participation in the trial requires a continuous assertion that other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745841]. This restriction to the usual tendency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745842] a critical consideration in 
designing the length and size of this trial. With regard to assessment of adverse events, we have built in a 
reporting system for both mild and severe side effects, defining study-related events that show no signs of 
improvement within [ADDRESS_1020011] as serious events. The study-related events monitoring and 
reporting system is described in detail in our Data Safety Monitoring Plan and in our Decolonization 
Educational Materials.  
34 
 6.10.12 Power (Updated June 2015, following reassessment of power) 
In many settings, an analytic approach to power is possible: given the assumptions of the model (e.g., 
logistic regression) are met, a relatively simple closed-form solution exists. However, generating the expected 
values to plug in may be difficult. In addition, some settings are complex enough that closed-form solutions 
may be difficult to generate. Many cluster-randomized designs fall into this class. In cluster-randomized 
problems, it is also difficult to obtain reliable estimates of the additional parameters that are required, most 
notably the between-cluster variance or, equivalently, the intra-class correlation coefficient. Further additional 
complications are introduced for time-to-event outcomes such as those needed in the ABATE Infection Trial. 
In a previous trial, we used the logistic regression analogue to proportional hazards regression models 
and simulation to estimate power.210 Now, however, we propose an interesting and, to our knowledge, novel 
approach to power calculation, which we dub “bootstrap power calculation.” This method is described below 
and in an article published since the trial was planned.[ADDRESS_1020012] that we possess a large quantity of baseline 
data already. Loosely put, we (1) bootstrap a sample of observations from our observed baseline data to serve 
as the baseline sample in the power calculations. Then we (2) bootstrap another sample from the baseline 
data to serve as the intervention period data. Next, (3) we implement the randomization scheme in the 
bootstrapped sample. Then (4), for a randomly selected subset of the outcomes (e.g., bloodstream infections) 
observed in the bootstrapped intervention period sample in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745843], we 
artificially change the outcome from infection to no infection. This represents the effect of the intervention, 
which we control by [CONTACT_745963]. Simultaneously (5), for this 
subset we change the date of the event from the date of infection to the date of discharge, transfer to a non-
eligible unit, or death—i.e., the date of censoring, had no infection been observed. Finally (6), we fit the 
planned frailty model described in Section 6.10.[ADDRESS_1020013] size. A confidence limit on this estimated power can be generated. 
In the table below, we show the power for removing the outcome from 0, 10, 20, and 30% of the subjects in the 
intervention arm in the intervention period. Removing 0% of the outcomes is a test of the technique: since we 
are not reducing the infection rate, the null is true, and rejections should occur only about 5% of the time.  
In the initial planning of the trial, we used the available 4-month baseline sample of patients from our 
participating trial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745844] 12-month baseline and 4.5 
bootstrap samples to represent the 18-month intervention period. This resulted in the power shown in Table 
13.

** Gram-negative multi-drug resistant organism clinical cultures 
 
The above power estimates ( Table 13 ) show that the technique has the desirable characteristic of 
rejecting the null only 5% of the time when it is true. We also see that power for MRSA or VRE clinical culture 
is ample, even if we prevent only 20% of the infections. For both selected secondary outcomes, the power is 
less, but still quite acceptable if the intervention prevents 30% of the infections. The primary strengths of the 
bootstrap power approach are that it allows us to avoid using literature estimates for the parameters when 
such estimates may not apply to the trial population, and it also avoids unrealistic assumptions about regularity 
(equal cluster sizes) or distribution (logistic instead of frailty models). The main weakness in this case is that 
correlation within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745845]. In addition, we 
have not received all desired randomization stratification data by [CONTACT_745964]. Thus, 
stratification in the bootstrap process is limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745846]. We 
believe that these are relatively benign issues: the correlation structure is unlikely to change importantly from 
[ADDRESS_1020015] the 
power, but mainly by [CONTACT_745965]. 
After the baseline period, we were able to re-estimate the power, using the data collected in the full 
baseline period.  We used the bootstrap process outlined above, except that we used the observed 12-month 
data for the baseline. We assessed the power for the original proposal of an 18-month intervention and for a 
slightly extended 21-month intervention period, oversampling the observed 12-month baseline data as needed 
in each case ( see Table 14 ). This updated power assessment was considered to be more accurate in that it 
used approximately three times as much real data—12 months vs. four months—compared to the original 
estimate. Furthermore, additional cleaning steps were applied to the [ADDRESS_1020016] of 20%. The power for the primary outcome was 99.9% 
(95% CI: 99.4-99.99%) with 18 or 21 months of follow-up.  For all pathogen bacteremia, the power was 85% 
(95% CI: 83-87%) with 18 months follow-up and 89% (87-90%) with 21 months follow-up.  The steering 
committee decided to use 21 months of follow up to ensure greater power with less common secondary 
outcomes and account for lessened effects at sites that may drop out of the trial.

believe this is possible due to our previous trial of 43 HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], should enrollment drop unexpectedly to 
less than 50, we will pursue an elongation of the 18-month trial, (NOTE: intervention was extended to a 21-
month trial in June 2015). Secondly, if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745847], we will 
expand the phase-in period to a total of [ADDRESS_1020018] and broadly generalizable means to examine many of the 
priority topi[INVESTIGATOR_295228]. In addition, this study design does not allow for blinded 
assignment or implementation. Nevertheless, this reflects the pragmatic nature of our intervention and directly 
mirrors the design and implementation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745848]. 
 
6.10.14  Dissemination Plan  
  We will disseminate trial results through presentations at national meetings, and publication in peer-
reviewed journals, and press releases. We will also use our contacts at the CDC, membership on the national 
advisory committee that recommends infection prevention strategies (HICPAC – the Healthcare Infection 
Control Practices Advisory Committee), membership on the Institute of Medicine Roundtable on Value & 
Science-Driven Health’s Innovation Collaborative on Clinical Effectiveness, participation in national societies 
such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_341136] (SHEA), and contacts with state departments of public health to disseminate trial results.  
  Through the Collaboratory’s website and dissemination mechanisms, we will also make our 
decolonization toolkit publicly available. This toolkit includes information about healthcare-associated 
infections, mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745849], chlorhexidine bathing protocols (for showering and bed bathing), extensive 
product compatibility guidance, frequently asked questions guides, wall charts for patient bathing instruction, 
audio podcasts and special coaching calls.

6.20 Aim 2: Assess whether universal chlorhexidine bathing and selective MRSA decolonization result 
in increased resistance to chlorhexidine or mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745850]. 
 
In order to assess whether routine use of chlorhexidine for bathing and selective use of mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745851], we will 
collect bacterial strains from participating units during the baseline and intervention periods in each study arm.  
 
6.20.1 Preliminary Data (Confidential, do not cite or distribute) 
 We collected 4,321 MRSA isolates during the REDUCE MRSA trial, a trial of decolonization with 
chlorhexidine and mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745852]. 993 strains in the baseline period 
and 3,328 in the 18-month intervention period were collected from microbiology laboratories in 43 HCA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554869] 3 arms. Strains were assessed for the presence of chlorhexidine resistance and high-level 
mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745853], which has been associated with decolonization failure.55 68 217  
Chlorhexidine resistance was essentially non-existent: there was a single chlorhexidine resistant isolate  
which occurred in the usual care arm during the intervention period. No formal analyses were pursued. 
At baseline, high-level mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745854] 6.7% (67/993). There were no significantly 
different increases across the arms between baseline and intervention periods. In the targeted decolonization 
arm of the REDUCE MRSA Trial, which most resembles the proposed intervention in the ABATE Infection 
Trial, high-level mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745855] 5.9% in the baseline period and 5.4% in the intervention period.  
 Processes and materials used in the collection of bacterial isolates during the REDUCE MRSA trial will 
be replicated by [CONTACT_745966]. 
 
6.20.[ADDRESS_1020019] 2 days after admission based 
upon unit location and admission date, which are available during usual specimen processing. Similar to our 
prior trial, the toolkit will include a Step-by-Step instruction guide, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet, 
FedEx mailing instruction sheet, deidentified study ID labels, collection log sheets with clipboard, shipment 
packing list, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_173574] (see example from prior trial, Appendix E, G ). In addition, a quick 
reference wall cling will be sent that provides a streamlined diagram of the key elements for collection (see 
example from prior trial, Appendix F ). Details will be reviewed in laboratory-specific coaching calls.  
Chocolate agar slants and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_702981] (STP-250MD, Saf-T-Pak Inc.) will be sent to each laboratory on 
a regular basis for monthly batch shipment of strains. Initially, trial staff will contact [CONTACT_745967]. Trial staff will contact [CONTACT_745968]. 
Trial staff will receive faxed log sheets that include the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], unit, collection date, specimen source, 
and coded ID. A separate fully-identified log sheet will be sent internally to HCA co-investigators who will use 
identifiers to subsequently link coded specimen study IDs to coded individual-level trial data during the analysis 
phase. In the event that resistance is found to be engendered by [CONTACT_745969], this linkage will allow further 
exploration regarding patient exposure to study products prior to specimen collection. 
 
6.20.3 Strain Processing  
For the collection of MRSA and gram negative bacterial isolates (performed by [CONTACT_745970]) at 
participating HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745856], log sheets that identify the patients from whom 
the isolates arise will be provided to HCA corporate study investigators and retained for the duration of the 
study period. Direct patient identifiers will not be shared external to HCA. All information transferred to Rush 
University, the isolate colletion core and the research analytic core at the Department of Population Medicine 
(DPM) at Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_192334], will be stripped of direct identifiers and replaced by a coded identifier. 
Isolates will be shipped to [CONTACT_745979] in the Division of Clinical Microbiology, our Co-Investigator at the 
[ADDRESS_1020020] method (bioMérieux, Durham, NC). Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745857].[ADDRESS_1020021] susceptibility to chlorhexidine determined by a microtiter method using 
20% aqueous chlorhexidine digluconate (Sigma-Aldrich LLC, St. Louis, MO) diluted in broth medium 
appropriate for the microbe tested.[ADDRESS_1020022] for chlorhexidine resistance, we 
will define resistance as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chlorhexidine that is outside of the 
reported wildtype distribution for each microbial species. Based upon recent literature, we will use a resistance 
breakpoint of >8mcg/ml for MRSA,17 >32 mcg/ml for klebsiella, pseudomonas, and serratia,216-217 and >64 
mcg/ml for burkholderia, proteus, and stenotrophomonas.215-217 These species were chosen because of their 
relatively high chlorhexidine MICs compared to other bacterial species and/or their association with outbreaks 
linked to contaminated commercial chlorhexidine products (burkholderia). In addition to assessing MIC 
breakpoints, we will evaluate the proportion of strains with a high MIC within the susceptible range between 
baseline and intervention strains. Decreased susceptibility to chlorhexidine has been associated with the 
presence of various multidrug efflux pumps.223 224 225 If chlorhexidine resistant (or nearly resistant) isolates are 
identified, we will use polymerase chain reaction methods to evaluate isolates for the presence of efflux pump 
genes.  If efflux pump genes are found, additional characterization of resistance may be done including assays 
to quantify expression of efflux pumps and to measure the effect of inhibition of efflux on chlorhexidine MICs.   
6.20.[ADDRESS_1020023] differences between arms in resistance by [CONTACT_6486] a 
generalized linear mixed logistic regression model with arm, baseline vs. intervention period, and their  
interaction as predictors. The interaction term assesses whether the difference in the probability of resistance 
between the baseline and intervention periods is significantly different between arms.  
 
6.20.5 Power and Sample Size 
 Based upon our recent trial data, we assume high level mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745858] 0.07 of MRSA isolates 
at baseline. We estimate collection of 2,400 isolates (600 per arm in the each of the intervention and baseline 
periods).  As in UH3 Aim 1, power is based on a post-only comparison of [ADDRESS_1020024] 80% power to detect 0.12 high level mupi[INVESTIGATOR_745859], assuming that resistance remains at 0.07 in the usual care arm.  
For both MRSA and gram negative bacteria, we will calculate the proportion of isolates resistant to 
chlorhexidine. If the proportion of MRSA that is resistant is truly as large as 0.1%, we will have at least a 90% 
probability of detecting >1 resistant strain among 2400 isolates, 70% among the [ADDRESS_1020025]-period isolates, and 
45% among [ADDRESS_1020026] period in the intervention arm. If the resistance rate increases to 0.5%, we 
have a 95% chance of observing at least one case in the 600 intervention isolates from the follow-up period. 
 
6.20.6 Limitations and Planned Solutions 
 If decolonization is successful, it is conceivable that isolation of MRSA and other bacterial pathogens 
may be substantially reduced, resulting in inadequate collection. In the event that this occurs, we will broaden 
the time window for isolate collection. Since our baseline period is 12-months and our intervention period is 18-
months, (NOTE: intervention was extended to a 21-month trial in June 2015), the current plans to collect 
isolates for 9-months in each period still allows for additional collection time should it be necessary. We will 
monitor collection progress continually so that the collection period can be extended seamlessly, if this is 
needed. 
 
6.30 Aim 3: Estimate the costs associated with the intervention (chlorhexidine + selective MRSA 
decolonization) and the attributable medical costs of healthcare associated infections in adult general 
inpatient units and infectious readmissions, in order to evaluate the potential for cost savings 
associated with the strategy of reducing bioburden to prevent infection. 
 
Costs of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) have been studied mainly in academic medical 
centers.10 226 227 228 229 230 Estimates of HAI costs in community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745860] U.S., and costs may differ from academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].231 232 233 In 
addition, the cluster-randomized design affords an important and unique opportunity to assess the economic 
value of decolonization across a large number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In particular, case mix differences between 
38 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745861]: 1) control group of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745862], 2) baseline data from each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 3) availability of individual patient adjustors 
from electronic health records and administrative data. In this aim, we will estimate the incremental hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745863].  We will then estimate the net cost of medical care for the 
intervention and the control groups, adjusting for key health factors. 
 
6.30.[ADDRESS_1020027] of disposable 
chlorhexidine-impregnated bathing cloths (as used in this trial) compared to disposable bathing cloths. Second, 
we will assume all bed baths are performed using basin baths and will calculate the incremental costs of 
adding generic liquid chlorhexidine to basins compared to routine soap and water basin baths. Finally, we will 
assess differences in the amount of unit-specific gown and glove use based upon supply chain data between 
arms and between baseline and intervention periods. This will account for potential cost-savings due to 
decreased transmission from the intervention. 
 
6.30.[ADDRESS_1020028] data are typi[INVESTIGATOR_745864], data 
transformation may be required to assure adequate fit of the outcome distribution. Models will be chosen to fit 
the distribution: negative binomial models, or possibly, normal distributions after log transformation, for 
example. Either approach reduces the impact of large outliers typi[INVESTIGATOR_745865]. Model terms will include 
arm, trial period (baseline vs intervention), their interaction, unit type (step down, medical, surgical, etc.), and 
demographic and comorbidity variables. The assessment of whether outcomes in one arm are significantly 
different from the other will be determined by [CONTACT_745971], which assesses whether 
the mean cost difference between the baseline and intervention period differs significantly between the two 
arms. If significant, we will calculate the mean cost savings per case averted. 
 We will additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to account for potential mortality effects on total 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051]. To do this, we will assign a large fixed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745866]. 
 
6.30.[ADDRESS_1020029]. However, cluster randomization is a major asset for distributing 
both known and unknown confounders. The availability of data from the baseline period is an additional 
strength, since each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s patient population additionally serves as its own control.  
 
6.40 Overall ABATE Infection Trial Summary 
 
 Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) continue to produce high morbidity, mortality, and over $[ADDRESS_1020030] 
from those effective in ICU settings are needed to reduce the >[ADDRESS_1020031] of pragmatic clinical trials during usual medical care.

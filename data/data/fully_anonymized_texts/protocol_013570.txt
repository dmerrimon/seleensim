27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41286] that 
aberrant activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway occurs in 
more than 60% of BC indicates the importance of these 
pathways in biliary carcinogenesis and highlights potential new 
strategies in the treatment of this disease.  Further more anti -
angiogenic agents such as the VEGF- antagonist bevacizumab, 
and the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib have been tested in BC in 
the first line setting with modest  activity.  
Regorafenib is  an oral multi-kinase in hibitor that targe ts both 
recep tor tyrosine kinases (R TKs), as we ll as the tu mor cell 
proliferat ion/survival signa ling pa thway kinases 
(RAS/R AF/MEK/ERK ). In addition, regorafenib inhibits VEGFR-
2/3, TIE-2, c-KIT , and PDG FR-ß receptor phosphor ylation.  
Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_39659], the Ras/R af/MAPK pathway, and 
PDGFR- ß in biliary cancer biology, evaluation of the regorafenib  
in the second line setting represents a rational approach.  
Indication  Patients with advanced biliary tumor who have failed at least one 
prior line of systemic therapy.  
Diagnosis and main 
criteria for inclusion • Patients must have histologically or cytologically 
documented carcinoma primary to the intra- or extra-
hepatic biliary system or gall bladder with clinical and/or 
radiologic evidence of unresectable locally advanc ed or 
metastatic disease. Patients with ampullary carcinoma 
are not eligible.  
• Patients must have failed no mor e than 2 prior line of 
systemic chemotherapy for advanced biliary cancer. 
Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and had 
evidence of disease recurrence within 6 months of 
completion of the adjuvant treatment are also eligible. If 
patient received adjuvant treatment and had disease 
recurrence after 6 months, patients will only be eligible 
after failing one line of systemic chemotherapy used to 
treat the disease recurrence.  
 
• Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by 
[CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria.  
• Patients must not have been treated with any VEGF 
inhibitors.  
Study design  This is a multi -institutional phase II single  arm single -stage 
design trial  using regorafenib as a single agent.  
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  5 of 59 
 
Type of control  Patients will receive regorafenib 160 mg QD (21 days on and 7 
days off). After 2 cycles (1cycle= 28 days),  response and 
progression will be evaluated using the new international  criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_39695] (RECIST)  guidelines (version 1.1) . 
Number of subjects  39 
Plan for statistical 
analysis Overall survival ( OS) will be defined as the time from starting on 
trial to date of death due to any cause. The final analysis will be 
conducted after the follow -time of the last patient exceeds 6 
months . OS  at 6 months  is the primary endpoint of the trial and 
will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method. The two-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) for median OS w ill be computed 
using log -log transformation. The sample size was determined 
based on the Simon’s two- stage minimax design. With one- sided 
10% of type I error rate and 90% power, a sample of evaluable 
39 patients will be evaluated; [ADDRESS_41287] good activity if ≥16 out of 39 
patients survive 6 months or more.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Biliary cancer (BC) typi[INVESTIGATOR_39661].  In the [LOCATION_002], an estimated 2600 intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas were diagnosed in 2010. [1],[2] In addition, about 10,[ADDRESS_41293] cancer are diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002], two- thirds of 
which are gallbladder cancers. [1] Unfortunately, most patients have advanced disease at 
presentation and relapse despi[INVESTIGATOR_39662]. [3] 
Data regarding chemotherapy have historically been disappointing in advanced BC, but 
new combinations show promise. ABC -02, a randomized phase III study recently 
published by [CONTACT_39696], enrolled more than 300 patients and compared gemcitabine plus cisplatin with gemcitabine alone. [4] The median overall survival (OS) and progression- free 
survival (PFS) were greater for gemcitabine plus cisplatin than for gemcitabine alone without significantly increased toxicity (OS: 11.7 v 8.2 months; log -rank P = .002; PFS: 8.5 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  10 of 59 
 
v 6.5 months;  P = .003). This drug combination set a new international standard of care 
for advanced biliary tract cancers. However, the survival for advanced BCs still rarely 
exceeds one year. This has led to a search for molecular targets for therapy. However, 
advances have been slow in part because of the tumor heterogeneity of BCs. [5] 
 
VEGF Pa thway 
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
signaling pathway plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_39663], survival, and invasion, resulting in neovascularization, tumor growth, and metastasis. [6] 
VEGF has been found to be overexpressed in biliary tr act cancers and has thus been 
suggested as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target. [7, 8] VEGF express ion 
in biliary tract cancer has also been found to be an independent negative predictive 
marker. [9] Increased VEGF expression has been reported to be associated with 
significant vascularization of human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_39697]. In comparison, hypovascularity of cholangiocarcinoma may be 
related to a downregulation of VEGF together with an upregulation of the angiogenesis 
inhibitor thrombospondin- 1.[10] Interestingly, VEGF -A expression was more frequently 
encountered in peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (69 vs 25%, p < 0.0001) and correl ated 
with increased vascular density. [11] This could suggest a potential benefit for 
antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39664].  
Based on the pre-cl inical data, VEGF inhibitors have been studied in bile duct cancers. 
Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF, has been used in combination with 
gemcitabine/oxaliplatin or erlotinib and has shown promising results. [12, 13] The 
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin with the addition of bevacizumab for first line 
treatment showed impressive overall survival of 12.7 months and progression free survival 
of 7.0 months. [12] Bevacizumab has also been studied in combination with erlotinib as a 
second line treatment. [14] The results were modest with response rate of 13% and overall 
survival of 4 months.    
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of VEGF have also been tested in advanced biliary tract 
tumors. Sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of several protein kinases including VEGFR  
has been studied as first line treatment in biliary cancers. So far there have been 2 studies 
using sorafenib in advanced biliary cancers. [15, 16] The results were moderately effective 
but with a high rate of toxicity.  
Raf-MEK-ERK Pathway  
The Raf -MEK -ERK signaling pathway controls fundamental cellular processes including 
proliferation, differentiation and survival. [17] T his pathway is an impor tant mediator of  
response to growth signals and ang iogenic factors, and is  ofte n aberrantly activated in 
huma n tumors  due to the presence of activate d RAS, mu tant BRAF , or overe xpression of  
growth factor recep tors.[18] Activated RAS triggers the phosphorylation and activation of 
the RAF kinase, which then phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on two serine residues. [19] 
Because this pathway is frequently dysregulated in human cancers, intense efforts are under way to develop selective inhibitors of the ERK pathway as anticancer  drugs. In 
preclinical data, MEK inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in mice with KRAS mutant BC . [20] However,  the frequency of RAS and RAF mutations  in biliary cancer is still 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  11 of 59 
 
unclear.  In one study evaluating 69 patients wit h BC, 31 (45%) patients had KRAS 
mutations. [21] Other studies have shown RAS mutation in BC ranging from 3- 54% [22, 23]  
Incidence of BRAF mutation in BC is unclear as well. In one study, BRAF  mutations were 
identified in 22% of human cholangiocarcinoma samples. Si gnificantly, these mutations 
were mutually exclusive of KRAS alterations, which occurred in 45% of tumors within the 
same series. [21] BRAF  mutations are frequently associated enhanced sensitivity to MEK 
inhibition and may constitute a key survival mechanism for those cells. [24, 25] A better 
understanding of the frequency and impact of BRAF mutations in cholangiocarcinoma is 
needed since other studies have found no BRAF mutations in BC. [26] 
Downstream of BRAF, the MAPK pathway appears active in 75% of BC, as evidenced by P-MAPK immunostaining. [27] Expression profiling across a panel of seven human BC cell 
lines demonstrated expression of a number of RAS/MAPK pathway components and have demonstrated sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. [28]  
The PDGFR pathway also appears to be a potential target in BC. It has been hypothesized that PDGFR activation mediates resistance apoptosis. Data in human cells has shown increased sensitivity to apoptotic agents once the PDGFR - ß /c-kit pat hway 
was targeted.[ 29] 
 
1.[ADDRESS_41294] that aberrant activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway occurs in more than 60% of BC indicates the importance of these pathways in biliary carcinogenesis and highlights potential new strategies in the treatment of this disease. [30]  Furthermore anti -angiogenic 
agents such as the VEGF- antagonist bevacizumab, and the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib 
have been tested in BC in the first line setting with modest  activity.  
Regorafenib is  an oral multi-kinase in hibitor that targe ts both r ecep tor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs), as we ll as the tu mor cell pro liferat ion/survival signa ling pathway kinases 
(RAS/R AF/MEK/ERK ). In addition, regorafenib inhibits VEGFR- 2/3, TIE-2, c-KIT , and 
PDG FR-ß receptor phosphor ylation.  Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_39659], the Ras/Raf/MAPK 
pathway, and PDGFR- ß in biliary cancer biology, evaluation of the regorafenib in the 
second line setting represents a rational approach.

Regorafenib is 
 a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane- bound and intrac ellular 
kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41296] xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in microvessel area, reduced Ki -67 
staining, and reduced pERK1/2 staining in tissue sections from tumor xenografts, and dose- dependent inhibition of growth in multiple xenograft models (breast, colon, renal, 
NSCLC, melanoma,  pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian). [31]  Immunohist ochemical ex -vivo 
studies with a phospho –specific monoclonocal anti- ERK 1 / [ADDRESS_41297] five days after treatment with regorafenib in 2 of 3 tumor models examined (MDA -MB 231 and BxPC -3), but not in NSCLC  (H460).  
In addition, all tested human tumor xenografts (MDA -MB-231, H460, BxPC -3 and Colo-
205) demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by [CONTACT_39698] a murine CD31 antibody. [31] These data suggest that 
regorafenib can target the tumor cell MAPK pathway (tumor cell survival) and tumor vasculature in some but not all tumors.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_41298] (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with re
gorafenib or placebo 
after failure of standard therapy)  trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, placebo- controlled study that enrolled [ADDRESS_41299] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. [32]Metastatic colorectal cancer patients 
were randomized to regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC. 
Treatment cycles consisted of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching placebo) once daily for three weeks on / one week off plus BSC. The primary endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression- free survival, objective tumor 
response rate and disease control rate. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups were also compared.  
 At a preplanned second interim analysis, there was a statistically significant survival benefit for regorafenib. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.773 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.635 to 0.941; 1- sided p = .0051). Patients treated with 
regorafenib had a median overall survival of 6.4 months, compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% increase in survival. In addition to improved overall survival, 
progression- free survival was  superior; median progression- free survival was 1.9 months 
(95% CI, 1.88 to 2.17) for regorafenib and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated hazard ratio for progression- free survival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.418 to 
0.581; 1- sided p< .000001). There was a substantial difference in disease control rate in 
the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 15%; p<.000001).  Regorafenib 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41300] frequent grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were hand– foot skin 
reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), hyperbilirubinemia (8%), and hypertension 
(7%).  The efficacy and safety from the CORRECT study supported FDA approval in 
September 2012.  
The efficacy and safety of regorafenib were examined in the P hase III GRID trial in 
patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had exhausted all other treatment options. The study involved 199 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant to imatinib and sunitinib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily on a 3 weeks on/1 week off cycle) or placebo, plus best supportive care.  
The results showed that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically significant 3.9-month improvement in progression- free survival (PFS),  compared with placebo (4.8 
months vs. 0.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27;  p <.0001). Overall survival was 
statistically similar between groups as expected due to a trial design that allowed 
crossover to regorafenib for disease progression.  The median survival period without tumor growth among patients on regorafenib was 4.[ADDRESS_41301] 12 weeks was 53% with regorafenib compared with 9% in the control group. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand- foot skin reaction (56.1%), hypertension (48.5%), 
and diarrhea (40.9%).   GRID study data is currently under FDA review.

The study drug must be exclusively used for the investigation specified in this protocol and it will only be accessible to authorized staff.  
5.1.2 Dosage and administration: 
Regorafenib tablets for oral administration are formulated as light pi[INVESTIGATOR_39667] “BAYER” on one side and “40” on the other.  Each tablet contains 40 mg of regorafenib in the anhydrous state, which corresponds to 41.49 mg of regor afenib 
monohydrate, and the following inactive ingredients: cellulose microcrystalline, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, povidone, and colloidal silicon dioxide.   The film –coating contains the following inactive ingredients: ferric oxide red, ferric oxide 
yellow, lecithin (soy), polyethylene glycol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide.  
5.1.3 Study Treatment  
Regorafenib is administered as  monotherapy during the study, 160 mg qd will be 
administered for 3 weeks on /1 week off.   One cycle is 28 days.  
 Four 40- mg regorafenib tables should be taken in the morning with approximately 8 fluid 
ounces (240 mL) of water after a low -fat (<30% fat) breakfast.   Some examples of low fat 
breakfasts are:  
• Two slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low- fat margarine and 1 tablespoon 
of jelly and 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk (approximately 319 calories and 8.2 g of fat).  
• One cup of cereal ( i.e. Special K), 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk, one pi[INVESTIGATOR_39668] (no butter or marmalade), apple juice, and one cup of coffee or tea (2 g fat, 17 g protein, 93 g of carbohydrate, 520 calories.  
5.1.4 Dose Modification for management of adverse events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reduction Levels 
The starting dose of regorafenib is 160 mg once daily.  Study medication will be 
administered on a 3 weeks on/1week off schedule [3 weeks out of every 4] . 
Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities that are related to protocol therapy according to the guidelines shown in the Dose Delays/Dose Modifications table that follows.  Dose modifications will 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  21 of 59 
 
follow predefined dose levels . Dose adjustments for hematologic toxicity are based on the 
blood counts obtained in preparation for the day of treatment.  
The modifications of regorafenib will follow the following predefined dose levels:

Recommended prevention/management strategies for skin toxicities consistent with HFSR 
are summarized below:  
Control of calluses 
Before initiating treatment with regorafenib:  
• Check condition of hands and feet . 
• Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when indicated. 
• Recommend pumice stone use for callus or ‘rough spot’ remov al. 
During regor afenib treatment: 
• Avoid pressure points . 
• Avoid items that rub, pi[INVESTIGATOR_39670]. 
Use of creams 
• Non-urea based creams may be applied liberally . 
• Keratolytic creams (e.g. urea- based creams, salicylic acid 6%) may be used 
sparingly and only to affected (hyperkeratotic) areas.  
• Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHA) based creams may be applied liberally 2 times a day.  
Approximately 5% to 8% provides gentle chemical exfoliation.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39671] (e.g. lidocaine 2%) are to be considered for pain cont rol. 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39672] 0.05% should be considered for subjects 
with Grade 2 or 3 HFSR.  Avoid systemic steroids.  
Tender areas should be protected as follows:  
• Use socks/gloves to cover moisturizing creams  
• Wear well -padded footwear  
• Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon, gel)  
• Foot soaks with tepid water and Epson salts

v4.0) , then the subject must contact [CONTACT_3462].  The management of hypertension, 
including the choice of antihypertensive medication, will be performed according to local standards and to the usual practice of the investigator.  Every effort should be made to control blood pressure by [CONTACT_39702].  If necessary, Table 6.4 outlines suggested dose reductions.

  Liver Function Abnormalities  
For patients with observed worsening of serum liver tests considered related to 
regorafenib (i.e. where no alternative cause is evident, such as post -hepatic cholestasis or 
disease progression), the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table 6- [ADDRESS_41321] (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may  
occur in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome.  
  Alanine or aspartate aminotransferase (AST/ALT): for any grade increase in AST or ALT, the investigator needs to ensure that it is not due to biliary obstruction or the introduction of new drugs. Biliary obstruction should be ruled out by [CONTACT_39703]. If the elevation of AST or ALT is due to biliary obstruction, and the biliary obstruction is treated, the study drug may be restarted at the same dose level upon return of the AST and ALT to baseline or grade 2.  
 For any grade increase in bilirubin, the investigator needs to ensure that it is not due to biliary obstruction or the introduction of new drugs. Biliary obstruction should be ruled out by [CONTACT_39703]. If the elevation of bilirubin is due to biliary obstruction, and the biliary obstruction is treated, the study drug may be restarted at the same dose level upon return of the bilirubin to baseline or Grade 1.

[IP_ADDRESS] Prevention/management strategies for diarrhea 
Diarrhea can be a common side effect of regorafenib.   The same dose- modification 
algorithm used for skin toxicities can be used to address these toxicities.  However, the 
preventive/management strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with local standards (e.g., anti -diarrheals and optimized hydration status).  
Anti-diarrhea medications may be introduced if symptoms occur.  Previous trials have 
shown that the diarrhea could be managed with loperamide.  The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_41332] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea- free 
for 12 hours.

[ADDRESS_41335]’s welfare, and which is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the investigator.   All medications (including contrast media) taken within [ADDRESS_41336]’s  
source documentation and in the CRF (including start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication).  Specific caution should be taken when considering or administering a concomitant medication that is metabolized by [CONTACT_39705]2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.  Such concomitant medication should be avoided, if possible.  
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 mg dose of 
Stivarga decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib, increased the mean exposure of the active metabolite M -5, and resulted in no change in the mean exposure of the active 
metabolite M -2.  Avoid concomitant use of Stivarga with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort)  
Co administration of a strongCYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160mg dose of 
Stivarga increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and decreased the mean exposure of the active metabolites M -2 and M -5.  Avoide concomitant use of Stivarga with strong  
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazadone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole).  
 
Permitted concomitant therapy includes:

• Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) and other hematopoietic growth 
factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as febrile 
neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the investigator’s discretion. However, they may not be substituted for a required dose reduction.  Subjects are permitted 
to take chronic erythropoietin.  
• Treatment with nonconventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as acupuncture), and 
vitamin/mineral supplements are permitted provided that they do not interfere with the study endpoints, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
• Bisph osphonates  
• Subjects who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin 
will be allowed to participate provided that their medication dose and INR/PTT are stable.  Close monitoring (day5 of cycle 1 and day 1 of each cycle) is mandator y.  
If either of these values are above the therapeutic range, the doses should be modified and the assessments should be repeated weekly until they are stable.  
The following are not permitted:  
• Other investigational treatment during or within 21 days before starting study 
treatment  
• Systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal transduction 
inhibitors, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy  
• Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue 
• Subjects taking narrow therapeutic index medications should be monitored 
proactively (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Phenobarbital, cyclosporine, and digoxin).  Warfarin is metabolized by [CONTACT_39706]2C9 and it’s levels may be especially affect ed by [CONTACT_39707]

6.[ADDRESS_41342] one dose of study treatment will be valid for the safety analysis.  
All observations pertinent to the safety of the study treatment will be recorded and included in the final report.  
Safety variables include the following: AEs, laboratory changes (complete blood counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), changes in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) and ECG and, in some instances, changes in 
chest x -ray images, as produced at the investigator’s discretion ( e.g., for evaluation for 
pneumonia).  
All AEs whether considered drug -related or not, will be reported with following information:  
start/stop dates, action taken, whether treatment was discontinued, any corrective measures taken, outcome, and other possible causes.  For all events, the relationship to treatment and the intensity of the event will be determined by [CONTACT_093].  
This trial will use the NCI -CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_41343] to toxicity grade.  
6.2.1 Adverse events 
Investigators should refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for  
regorafenib,  including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected 
side effects of, regorafenib.  As with any agent, there is always the potential for 
unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are obtained.  
Therapeutic monitoring should be performed following dose selection or modification of regorafenib,  in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care.  In general, 
subjects should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications regardless of the path of drug elimination.  
All concomitant medications must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41344] be carefully monitored for AEs.  This monitoring also includes clinical 
laboratory tests.  Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and relationship to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions 
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any unfavorable 
and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of  a medicinal (investigational) product.  
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_39708] (however, the condition for which the surgery is  
required may be an AE  if worse ns compared to baseline).  
 
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are recorded 
as medical history ( e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms 
or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , 
are recorded as medical history  (e.g. allergic pollinosis) . 
• Conditions  that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a – f): 
a. Results in death. 
b. Is life -threat ening . 
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41345] one of the following exceptions is met:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours . 
- The admission is pre- planned.  
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
- The admission is not associated with an AE.  
(e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity . 
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect . 
f. Is another  medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications for adverse event assessment  
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_39709].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_41346] be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.  Grade refers to the 
severity (intensity) of the AE:  
CTCAEv4 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; 
limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instr umental 
ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc) . 
CTCAEv4 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39676]; disabling; 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  37 of 59 
 
limiting to self care ADL (self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indi cated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 5: death due to an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information. 
 The causality assessment should be done separately for each study treatment . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no” . 
An assessment of “no” would include:  
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.  
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g. the subject is struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_39677].  
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on drug re- introduction 
(re-challenge):  
- Subject’s response after de- challenge or subjects response after re- challenge should 
be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question.  
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  38 of 59 
 
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of 
the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered.  
[Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)]  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was  a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to protocol- required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no” . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed below.  
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment . 
 ־Drug withdrawn 
 ־Drug interrupted 
 ־Dose reduced 
 ־Dose not changed 
 ־Dose increased 
 ־Not applicable 
 ־Unknown 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events 
 ־None 
 ־Remedial drug therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Outcome 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
 ־Recovered/resolved 
 ־Recovering/resolving  
 ־Recovered/resolved with sequelae 
 ־Not recovered/not resolved 
 ־Fatal  
 ־Unknown 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41347] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_41348] x -ray, by ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_41349] or MRI scans, or ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_41350] be recorded in decimal fractions of centimeters (or millimeters).  
 
The defined measurability of lesions on CT scan is bas ed on 
the assumption that CT slice thickness is 0.[ADDRESS_41351] slice thickness greater than 0.5 cm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.   
 2. Malignant lymph nodes
 are to be considered pathologicall y 
enlarged and measurable if it measures ≥ 1.5 cm in SHORT 
AXIS (greatest diameter perpendicular to the long axis of the 
lymph node) when assessed by [CONTACT_39710] (CT scan slice recommended being no greater than 0.5 cm).  
 b.    Non-measurable disease
:  All other l esions (or sites of disease), 
including small lesions (longest diameter < 1.0 cm or pathologic lymph nodes with ≥ 1.0 cm to < 1.5 cm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial eff usions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered non- measurable as are previously 
radiated lesions that have not progressed.  
 c. 
Notes on measurability  
 
1. For CT and MRIs, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should by [CONTACT_39711]- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 2. PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or att enuation correction 
CT portion of a PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic 
CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT, 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT.  
 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  40 of 59 
 
3. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion 
size and should not be used as a method of measurement.  
 4. Cystic lesion s that meet the criteria for radiographically 
defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_39712].  
 
5. If a target lesion becomes very small some radiologists indicate that it is too small to measure.  If the lesion is 
actually still present, a default measurement of 0.[ADDRESS_41352] believes the lesion has gone, a default measurement of 0.0cm should be   
 
7.2 Objective Status at Each Disease Evaluation   
Objective Status is to be recorded at each evaluation. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target
 lesions 
at baseline. All other l esions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_41353] be noted for non- target 
measurable and non- measurable disease.   
 For studies that use disease progression as an endpoint, whole body 
scanning at specific intervals is necessary to determine that progression is NOT present outside of the “target” areas. Therefore, in these studies it is not acceptable to image only the “target” areas of the body in follow -up 
scans. For study -specific imaging requirements, see the Study Calendar in 
Section 9.0.   
 a.  Complete Response (CR):
  Complete disappearance of all target 
and non- target lesions (with the exception of lymph nodes 
mentioned below).  No new lesions.  No disease related symptoms.   Any lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to < 1.[ADDRESS_41354] be assessed using the same technique as baseline.  
 b. Partial Response (PR):
 Applies only to patients with at least one 
measurable lesion. Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions.  No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease.  No new lesions.  All target measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  
 c.  Stable:
 Does not qualify for CR, PR, Progression or Symptomatic 
Deterioration.  All target measurable lesions must be ass essed 
using the same techniques as baseline.  
 d.  Progression
: One or more of the following must occur:  20% 
increase in the sum of appropriate diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline, as well as 
an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm.  Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021] (an 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41355] be provided).  Appearance of any new lesion/site.  
Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression 
and without symptomatic deterioration (see Section 10.2e).  
  Notes regarding new lesions:  FDG -PET imaging can complement 
regular scans in identifying new lesions according to the following algorithm.  
 
1. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is a sign of progression based on a new lesion.  
2. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponding to a potential new site of disease must have a confi rmation by [CONTACT_39713] (e.g. CT, 
MRI, x -ray) as new site of disease to be considered 
progressive disease.  In such a case, the date of progressive disease will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET.   
e.   Symptomatic deterioration
:  Global  deterioration of health status 
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.  Efforts should be made to obtain objective evidence of progression after discontinuation.  
 f.  Assessment inadequate, objective status unknow n
.  
Progression or symptomatic deterioration has not been documented, and one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed or inconsistent assessment methods were used.  
 g.  Objective status notes:  
 
1.  Non-measurable and non- target measurable disease do not 
affect Objective Status  in determination of CR (must be absent --a patient who otherwise has a CR, but who has non-
measurable or non- target measurable disease present or not 
assessed, will be classified as having a PR). However, non-measurable and non- target lesions are included in 
determination of progression (if new sites of disease develop or if unequivocal progression occurs in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]).  
 2.   An objective status of PR or stable cannot follow one of CR.  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that tumor 
increases too little to qualify as progression, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds.  
 3.    In cases for which initial flare reaction is possible (hypercalcemia, increased bone pain, erythema of skin 
lesions), objective status is not progression unless either symptoms persist beyond [ADDRESS_41356] or MRI would constitute pr ogression.  
 6.   Appearance of new pleural effusions does not constitute unequivocal progression unless cytologically proven of neoplastic origin, since some effusions are a toxicity related 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41357] Response 
 
This is calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.  
 
a. CR:  Two or more objective statuses of CR a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progres sion or symptomatic 
deterioration.  
 b.  PR: Two or more objective statuses of PR or better a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration, but not qualifying as CR.  
 c.  Unconfirmed CR:  One objective status of CR documented before 
progression or symptomatic deterioration but not qualifying as CR or PR. 
 d.  Unconfirmed PR:  One objective status of PR documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration but not qualifying as CR, PR or unconfirmed CR.  
 
e.  Stable/no response:  At least one objective status of stable/no 
response documented at least 6 weeks after registration and before progression or symptomatic deterioration, but not qualifying as anything else above.  
 f. Increasing disease:  Objective status of pr ogression within 12 
weeks of registration, not qualifying as anything else above.   
 g. Symptomatic deterioration: Objective status of symptomatic deterioration within 12 weeks of registration, not qualifying as anything else above.   
 h. Inadequate assessment, response unknown:  Progression or symptomatic deterioration greater than 12 weeks after registration and no other response category applies.  
 
 
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size 
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
Overall Survival (OS) at 6 month is the primary  endpoint on this study. OS is defined in 
section 8.2. Dropouts/screen failures defined in section 4.2.[ADDRESS_41358] 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41359] the null 
hypothesis of ≤30% of OS at [ADDRESS_41360] the alternative of ≥50% of OS at 6 month 
(HR = 0. 578 under exponential model ). The sample size was determined, based on the 
Simon’s two -stage minimax design. With one- sided 10% of type I error rate and 90% 
statistical power, a sample of evaluable 39 will be evaluated: [ADDRESS_41361] good activity if ≥[ADDRESS_41362] 
to accrue 2 or more patients per month among 6- 7 participating institutions  and will follow 
up patients 6 months or more.   
Dropouts/screen failures defined in section 4.2.[ADDRESS_41363] follow -up prior to 6 
months from starting on trial except death, disease and severe  toxicity are not evaluable for the 
primary endpoint, and they will be replaced by [CONTACT_39714]  
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis 
 
Overall survival ( OS) is defined as the time from starting on trial to date of death due to 
any cause and progression- free survival ( PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start 
of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever comes first.  The final analysis will 
be conducted after the follow -time of the last patient exceeds [ADDRESS_41364] good activity if ≥16 out of 39 evaluable patients survive 6 months or more.  OS will be 
estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
for median OS will be computed using log -log transformation.  
The secondary endpoints in this study include the disease control response (DCR) defined 
as (CR + PR+ SD), toxicity, and PFS. DCR rate will be reported with 95% CI computed by 
[CONTACT_39715] -Pearson method. The frequency and severity of adverse events and 
tolerability of the regimen will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  PFS with 95% CI 
will be estimated. As exploratory objective, the association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes (DCR rate, OS and PFS) will be examined using multiple logistic regression and the multivariable Cox regression model. A p- value of <0.[ADDRESS_41365] of monitoring and recording all adverse events and 
serious adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters and regular physical examinations. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the study. Safety and tolerability will be assess ed according to the 
NIH/NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) that is available at:  
http://ev s.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html
 
 
The PMC monitors its assigned ongoing research protocols for: adverse event reporting, 
data and safety monitoring, and internal audit findings.  The PMC, upon review of any 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  44 of 59 
 
agenda item, may approve the study for  continuation, require revisions, suspend or close 
a protocol.  
Investigators of studies, which are designated to be reviewed by [CONTACT_39716], shall provide a statistical report of  the study’s progress and summary of 
adverse events and dev iations  based on the phase of the study and the associated risk of 
the study or  
more often if applicable. The external DSMB (if applicable) shall  forward its report for high-
risk studies designated for external review at  least annually or more often if applicable.  
 
Internal Monitoring Plan  Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database.  Regulatory documents 
and case report forms will be reviewed routinely according to Moffitt’s Monitoring Policies.  
9.[ADDRESS_41366] or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the patient at each visit 
during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_24479], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (grade 1- 4, or mild/moderate/severe)  
• Its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected)  
• Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
• Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non- drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
• Whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)  
  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.   
  Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure or will be communicated between Investigator Brochure updates in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.

9.2 Serious adverse events 
  
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless

• is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
  Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. To ensure patient safety, each serious adverse event must be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_39679].  Moffitt Cancer Center and all participating sites will report SAEs by 
[CONTACT_39717], the electronic data capture system and a Medwatch Form online at  http://www.fda.gov/medwatch
 The SAE must be reported by 
[CONTACT_6968] ( [EMAIL_771]) to the MCRN within 2 working days.  
9.3 Reporting of serious adverse events 
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by [CONTACT_39718]. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assigned grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE; unless the investigator assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria.   
 When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities.   
 All serious adverse events should be reported to Bayer within [ADDRESS_41367] for reporting procedures.  
 
The Investigator may report serious adverse events (SAEs) as described below.

As with any new chemical entity, there is always potential for unexpected adverse events, 
including hypersensitivity reactions.  
Based on data from phase I/II studies with regorafenib and from current knowledge of the pharmacological properties of other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this drug class, as soon as there is reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_39681], the investigator should immediately notify the sponsor as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
These events are:  
• Acute renal failure (NCI -CTCAE version 4.0 ≥ grade 3) or severe proteinuria (NCI -
CTCAE version 4.0 ≥ grade 3)  
• Interstitial lung disease 
• Acute cardiac failure 
• Clinically significant bleeding (NCI -CTCA E version 4.0 ≥ grade 3)  
• Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme 
• Hepatic failure

9.6 Further safety  
Progressive disease 
If progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for an SAE 
(i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death, or important medical event), the signs and symptoms 
should be reported as an SAE and not the underlying progressive disease.  
Death 
If any subject dies during the trial or within [ADDRESS_41371] the cause of death in detail (using the SAE Form) 
within 24 hours.  
10.  Premature termination of the study  
• If risk-benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,  
o Safety  findings from this study ( e.g. SAEs)  
o Results of any interim analysis  
o Results of parallel clinical studies  
o Results of parallel animal studies  
(on e.g.  toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity).  
• If the study conduct ( e.g. recruitment rate; drop- out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame.  
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies:  
• Closure s should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected institutions ( e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority (ies); study center ; 
head of study center ) must be informed as applicable according to local law.  
• In case of  a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study 
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 4.2.1.

12.[ADDRESS_41379] / legal representative or proxy consenter will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.  
Only if the subject / legal representative or proxy consenter voluntarily agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done so, may he/she enter the study.  Additionally, the investigator and other information provider (if any) will personally sign and date the form.  The subject / legal representative or proxy consenter will receive a copy of the signed and dated form.  
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locally required, in the patient’s note/file of the medical inst itution.  
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are performed, the study record or subject’s clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures.  
1. If the patient is not capable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can also be given in the presence of an impartial witness (independent of Bayer and the investigator).  This is to be documented by a signature [CONTACT_39733] a signature [CONTACT_23686].  
2. For minors or adults under legal protection, consent shall be given by [CONTACT_23666](s).  The consent of a minor or adult under legal protection shall also be requested where such a person is able to express his/her own will.  His/her refusal or the withdrawal of his/her consent may not be disregarded.  
3. In emergency situations, when prior consent of the patient is not possible, the consent of the patient’s legal representative(s) or proxy consenter, if present, should be requested.  The patient should be informed about the study as soon as possible and his/her consent to continue the study should be requested.

13.2 
Details on Potenti al Biomarker Studies by [CONTACT_39727]: The Duke Molecular Reference Laboratory at Duke University Medical 
Center is one of several core facilities for CALGB. It acts as a molecular profiling laboratory 
for blood- based biomarkers of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly targeted anti -angiogenic 
agents.  Drs. Andrew Nixon and Herbert Hurwitz serve as co- directors of the facility and 
direct the overall research of the laboratory.  The laboratory has qual ity control procedures 
in place to address many of the issues involved in clinical trials research including sample quantity, sample integrity, and sample heterogeneity. The services provided align with our programmatic focus around the interrogation of bl ood and urine samples by [CONTACT_39728].  Each study utilizes unique combinations of cancer therapeutics, affecting multiple signaling pathways.  The optimal design for this study addresses the specific drug targets of the study as well as attempting to capture the relevant 
co- and counter -regulated proteins.  Based on our experience, we have chosen important 
pathway components, identified the appropriate assay, built multiplex panels, and established QA/QC parameters regarding these assays.  
 
In the past, the gold standard for detection of growth factors and cytokines in blood was the 
use of ELISAs; however, multiplex technology offers an attractive alternative approach for cytokine and growth factor analysis. This novel technology allows for the measurement of multiple analytes simultaneously from a single sample.  The advantages of multiplex technology compared to traditional ELISA assays are conservation of patient sample, increased sensitivity, and significant savings in cost, time and labor.  Furthermore, all plate designs are validated in order to 1) limit cross -reactivity of the antibodies 2) optimize 
sensitivity and specificity and 3) maximize the linearity of the assay’s dynamic range.  
 
Several systems exist, the plate- based platforms being the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) 
multiplex system and the SearchLight system, produced by [CONTACT_39729] (formerly of 
ThermoFisher Scientific). The assay design in both cases is similar to a sandwich ELISA, 
   
27  January  2015 Version:  REGORAFENIB ISS Template  Page:  [ADDRESS_41384] ELISA assays are also included to evaluate soluble TGF RIII 
and IGF- [ADDRESS_41385] been validated in order to limit cross -reactivity of the 
antibodies, optimized for sensitivity and specificity, and maximize the linearity of the assay’s dynamic range. The CVs of the multiplex arrays are approximately 15- 20%, depending on 
the particular assay. Any study samples that fall outside the linear portion of the standard curve are retested. Samples that read below the limit of detection are retested, if possible.  
Samples that read above the linear portion of the standard curve are serially diluted and retested to obtain accurate measurements.  Any analyte that does not meet the aforementioned criteria will result in the sample being re- evaluated. Analytes of inter est that 
are not available in our multiplex plates can be evaluated using commercial ELISA kits or “home- brew” ELISAs.

flow sheets and/or sample labels are resolved upon receipt of the sample i n the lab.  All 
sample and data handling procedures will be fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). We have sample handling protocols that provide step- by-step details for sample isolation, sample handling, and sample 
receipt/shipment.  Samples are housed in ultra low temperature freezers ( -80°C).  The 
freezers are monitored daily and are equipped with an alarm system designed to alert laboratory personnel upon freezer malfunction. Additionally, we have implemented a secondary, independent alarm system on all ultra low freezers currently used to store all patient samples.  Use of these redundant systems greatly reduces the chance of freezer failure, which could potentially result in the loss of irreplaceable samples from hundreds of clinical trial patients.

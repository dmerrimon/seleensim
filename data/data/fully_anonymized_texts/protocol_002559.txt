of varying FiO [ADDRESS_823403] large- bore cannulae. The flow 
rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_619481] a patient’s normal spontaneous ins pi[INVESTIGATOR_619480].  
HVNI systems must maintain adequate heating and humidification of the delivered gas to protect 
the nasal tissues from d ryness and provide patient comfort.   
 
Non -Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV): Breathing assist where a mask is strapped tightly to a 
patient’s face and bi -level positive airway pressure is administered at an established frequency to support 
patient ventilation.  
 
Intubation: The placement of an endotracheal tube to facilitate respi[INVESTIGATOR_619482].  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064]: The inability to maintain sufficient arterial blood oxygen saturation and/or retention of 
carbon dioxide levels during unassisted spontaneous breathing. 
 
Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Exercise regimen for patients with compromised cardio- pulmonary function 
designed to improve pulmonary parameters. 
 
Pulse Oximetry Reading (SpO 2):  Indirect measure of a patient’s arterial blood oxygen saturation using pulse 
oximetry technology that utilizes oxygen/hemoglobin concentrations. 
 
Resting SpO 2:  SpO [ADDRESS_823404] oxygen saturation. 
 
Desaturation SpO
2: The SpO 2 value considered to be the point of desaturation where the value drops below a 
specified threshold.  This value is based on the desaturation requirement for reimbursement of oxygen therapy.  
 
Ventilatory Work Effort / Work of Breathing (WOB):  The physical, physiologic muscular demands of 
breathing manifested through signs and symptoms of increased physical exertion, manifested through 
pulmonary changes leading to the use of accessory muscles for inspi[INVESTIGATOR_619483].  
 
Fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] ( FiO

Blood Pressure (BP): as measured by [CONTACT_619502], measured for this study in mmHg.  
 
Heart Rate (HR): The number of heart beats per minute (beats·min-1). 
 
Modified Borg Scale (Borg): Dyspnea is an important measure of patient respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] & pulmonary 
functional status. The rate of perceived dyspnea (RPD)is determined by [CONTACT_619503], on a scale of 0 (no dyspne a) to 10 (unbearable dyspnea). The modified Borg scale is 
additionally used for rating the subjective perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise, while at the same 
workload.  
 
Standard of Care (SOC): Site standard practices for the medical care of patients presenting with specific 
symptoms.  
 Case Report Form (CRF): The form used to record pertinent patient data to address the study aim.  CRFs do 
not contain patient names or medical record numbers; rather they will be coded with a patient number and 
the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_619485] r will maintain the key.  The CRFs are the property of Vapotherm.  
 Transcutaneous CO
2 (TcPCO2): This non -invasive method of measuring circulating CO 2 transdermally, 
indicating trends for arterial carbon dioxide levels using a locally heated electrochemical sensor applied to 
the skin, can be used to assess a patient’s adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

hypoxia. Often times this therapy is delivered via various devices that provide pressure (mechanical 
ventilation [MV], non -invasive positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV]) and flow -based ( high -velocity nasal 
insufflation [HVNI] and high flow nasal cannula [HFNC]) modalities to support oxygenation and ventilation, 
and in many cases, NIPPV & HVNI have been demonstrated to provide comparable support. 2-[ADDRESS_823406] be described by [CONTACT_619504]:  alveolar ventilation

6,8  Based on mathematical 
modeling, physiologic studies and clinical observations, a flow rate of 4 to 8 L·min-1 through Vapotherm’s 
neonatal cannulae, or 25 to 40 L·min-1 through Vapotherm’s adult cannulae, would purge the anatomical 
reservoir of the upper airway in the window of time between breaths. 9-12  
 
Vapotherm’s humidification system is specifically designed to tolerate a high back pressure in the

Rev 1. [ADDRESS_823410] ventilation and related physiological responses relative to the conventional legacy cannula 
design, with which there are published clinical outcomes d ata.  
 
The hypothesis : The next generation nasal cannula designs (Prosoft and Unicorn) will be comparable at 
relieving patient dyspnea while on HVNI, when compared to the conventional legacy cannula.  
 To test this hypothesis, the study will be conducted with the following specific aims:  
 
Aim #1: Primary Outcome. The primary endpoint is the patient’s targeted relief of dyspnea, as measured by 
[CONTACT_619506] (rated perceived dyspnea [RPD]) for each cannula design  tested.  
 
Aim #2: Secondary Outcomes. The secondary endpoints evaluate the patient vital signs (heart rate [HR], 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR], blood pressure [BP]), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), and arterial CO2 as measured 
by a transcutaneous CO2 device (TcPCO2).  These measurements will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_619488].  
 
Aim #3: Tertiary Outcomes.  The tertiary endpoints evaluate both patient and clinician perception 
assessment scores. For patient perception/satisfaction these endpoints include: (1) relief of symptoms, and (2) comfort/tolerance. For  clinician perceptions these endpoints include: (1) technical/clinical difficulties, 
(2) patient comfort & tolerance, (3) ease of use, (4) monitoring & support for therapy, and (5) 
expected/perceived patient outcomes.  
 
These endpoints  will establish equivalence of outcomes between the legacy cannula and the new cannula 
designs (both Unicorn and Prosoft) in terms of the ability to relieve dyspnea in adult hypercapnic patients experiencing dyspnea.

This will be an efficacy study, performed as a prospective, order -randomized crossover design trial to 
evaluate the ability of next generation HVNI nasal cannula designs (Unicorn and Prosoft) to effect ventilation 
and related physiological responses relati ve to the conventional legacy cannula design. Patients deemed to fit 
the criteria for inclusion will perform the study procedures for both arms of the crossover design. 
Completing both arms will compare the next generation cannula designs to the commonly used legacy design 
for comfort, comparative therapeutic response, and outcomes per the study aims.  Patients are expected to 
complete the study in one session, with appropriate pauses between each nasal cannula design testing procedures. After each of the study arms, the clinicians will complete perception score assessments. The 
clinical management will otherwise remain unchanged based on site standard of care practice.  
 
Each phase of the study will correspond to a different cannula design. Patients will be enrolled and initially entered into the control/baseline phase with the conventional legacy cannula (control), then will be order 
randomized to either of the next gener ation cannula designs (Test: Unicorn, or Prosoft).

- Phase 3 –Next generation cannula design (Test#2) (order randomized)   
 
 
This study design will focus on four distinct segments for each phase: (1) baseline characterization, (2) 
therapy acclimatization, (3) therapeutic characterization, and (4) VAS for both patient and clinician assessment scores. The baseline characterization for Phase 1 will provide patient background, history, and 
initial cl inical evaluation. For Phases 2 and 3, baseline characterization will only include the initial clinical 
evaluation, as no further initial evaluation is warranted. The acclimatization period will provide patients time to become accustomed to the HVNI therapy and both designs of nasal cannula design. Titration of 
therapy (Flow/FiO2) is only expected during Phase 1 (or in the event the patient decompensates and needs 
adjustment) , the legacy cannula, as this study is a comparison of cannula efficacy. For the therapeutic 
characterization, final patient data for the cannula design will be recorded. Following this, the clinician and the patient will complete the cannula design’s VAS perception scores. Primary and secondary outcomes will 
be completed upon the conclusion of all study phases. Tertiary outcomes will be completed at the end of each 
individual phase.  
 This study will be conducted in an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619490].  All respi[INVESTIGATOR_619491].  
 
V. Subject Enrollment   
Subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_619510] (Aims 1 -3). Once 
consented, the participants and investigators will complete data collection in all Aims during the course of 
the cannula trial period.  
 Sample Size:  
To provide a sufficiently powered sample dataset, we will enroll up to 32 subjects to complete this study on nasal cannula designs, with a calculated sample size of N=26 plus a 20% failure/fallout rate. This will provide sufficient data to adequately infor m on the study objectives.  
 
This sample size was estimated through use of references that (1) approximated minimal clinical important 
difference of dyspnea (modified Borg scale) and (2) approximated expected standard deviation of prior datasets measuring dyspnea.
15-[ADDRESS_823412] deviation of 3, using a desired power 
of 90% with alpha=0.05, the sample size is estimated at [ADDRESS_823413] any difference.

VI. Study Procedures  
This study is non -blinded by [CONTACT_100827], since the difference in cannulas can be perceived by [CONTACT_619511]. Patients may not know the difference between legacy and next generation cannulae, except in 
case of the Unicorn cannula design (as it employs a single -nasal prong). The next generation cannulae will be 
order -randomized after the conventional legacy cannula is used during the control evaluation. The study is a 
crossover design trial that will measure the ventilatory and comfort perform ance of nasal cannula design, 
specifically the effect on relief of dyspnea as demonstrated by [CONTACT_619512], and measurement by [CONTACT_619513]2 
device. In addition, patient physiologic outcomes (e.g. HR, RR, BP, SpO2), and patient & clinician assessment 
scores wil l be assessed and documented. Figure 1 illustrates a flowchart of overall study procedures.  
 
Screening, Enrollment, & Management  
Upon screening, subjects will be asked to participate in this study, and if so, they will provide informed 
consent prior to enrollment. During screening, patient will be evaluated for nostril aperture areas, which will 
accommodate the various cannula designs without occluding greater than 50% of the aperture area of a 
nostril by [CONTACT_619514] (per inclusion criteria #2). Subjects are instructed that if at any time during the 
study that they wish to discontinue the study, they are free to stop the test and discontinue study 
participation. All study procedures will be explained to the subject.   
 
Upon enrollment, appropriate study data will be collected (see below under Data Collection), including 
patient demographics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, race), anthropometrics (e.g. weight, height, BMI, and 
applicable medical history including a detailed focus on the patient’s current respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219] (LTOT user, positive -airway pressure therapy user, current respi[INVESTIGATOR_135733]). Subjects will be managed by [CONTACT_619515] (Table 1).  All decision  making for patient 
participation will be made per standard practice at the trial site, relying on the judgment of the medical staff. 
Using cards coded to trial patient number, the two next generation test cannulae will be order -randomized 
and that randomization will be determined by [CONTACT_619516]. T ime required from screening to the end of the study, is 
estimated to be two hours and fifteen minutes.

designated by a different cannula design, with ‘Test’ symbolizing the order -randomized new cannula 
designs (i.e. Unicorn and Prosoft).  
  Phase 1 – Conventional Legacy cannula design (Control)  
This test session is represented by [CONTACT_7609] [ADDRESS_823414] segments: (1) 
baseline characterization, (2) therapy acclimatization, (3) therapeutic characterization, (4) patient and clinician assessment scores. After Phase [ADDRESS_823415] will be able to 
start, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
Baseline Characterization will be performed just prior to the therapy acclimatization segment of this Phase. 
If there is a reason the clinician does not deem the patient appropriate for the study, per inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may stop procedures during baseline characterization. The inpatient may be sitting or lying 
down in a comfortable environment. The patient will be set up and prepared for the cannula testing with appropriate data recording devices. While subject is at rest, the following data  will be collected (see Table 1): 
RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). For the RPD, the clinician will record patient 
scores. The patient may or may not be on HVNI therapy at this time. The Phase 1, baseline characterization 
will include recording data while the patient is in an uncompromised state (e.g. ON current oxygen therapy, 
if applicable).   
 
Therapy acclimatization (5 – 10 minutes)  will be performed immediately after the baseline characterization 
segment is complete, and in accordance with site standard of care practices to maintain patient safety. The patient will be fitted with appropriately sized nasal cannula from the convention al legacy design (not to 
exceed 50% occlusion of the nares). Patients will be notified of best practice for the therapy, and  clinicians 
will record whether  patients prefer to keep their mouths open or closed. The acclimatization segment is the 
interval during which HVNI is to be titrated to provide the patient the appropriate settings for effective HVNI therapy. After the final FiO2/Flow settings are implemented and the patient is acclimatized the following 
data will be collected (see Table 1): RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). For the 
RPD, the clinician will record patient scores. Effective flow is recorded. 
 
HVNI will be initiated per the initial settings identified below , after which settings will be titrated per 
standard practice for optimal effect.  When patients are placed, the HVNI initial settings will be the 
following:  FiO 2 = level approximating the patient’s prior prescription (e.g. if by [CONTACT_21294] [NC], 
1LPM NC = 24%, 2LPM NC = 28%, 3LPM NC = 32%, etc.), Flow = 15 L/min, and Temperature = 35 -
37°C. Patients will be fit with a Vapotherm adult nasal cannula that will be applied by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_619492]. The flowrate can be decreased or increased as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_619493]. Targets should be to provide relief of perceived dyspnea at an HVNI flow rate between 20 to 35 
L/min (up to 40L/min).  Starting temper ature will be between 35 to 37°C; if patients find the gas 
temperature to be uncomfortable, it can be lowered as necessary down to 33 ℃ to enhance tolerance. 
The FiO
2 will be set initially to approximate the likely previous dosage (see above) to initially to 
assure adequate oxygenation, but this should be adjusted to maintain a SpO 2 > 88%.  
 
Therapeutic Characterization  will be performed [ADDRESS_823416], the following data will be collected (see Table 1): RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). 
For the RPD, the clinician will record patient scores.   
Patient & Clinician Perception Assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_619517][INVESTIGATOR_619494]’s testing procedures. Immediately following the completion of this phase, as soon as possible, the continuous Visual Acuity Scale (VAS) will be completed for each of the five endpoints f or clinician 
assessment and the two endpoints for patient assessment. The patient perception/satisfaction assessments 
include: (1) relief of symptoms, and (2) comfort/tolerance. The clinician perception assessment s include: (1) 
technical/clinical difficulties, (2) patient comfort & tolerance, (3) ease of use, (4) monitoring & support for therapy, and (5) expected/perceived patient outcomes.  
 
Upon completion of this phase , the testing will pause for [ADDRESS_823417]. During this pause the patient will not 
perform known to worsen dyspnea. During the pause the patient will resume on their current oxygen therapy.  
 
Phase 2 – Test #1 (randomized)  
This test session is represented by [CONTACT_7609] [ADDRESS_823418] segments: (1) baseline 
characterization, (2) therapy acclimatization, (3) therapeutic characterization, (4) patient and clinician 
assessment scores.  
 
Baseline Characterization will be performed just prior to the therapy acclimatization segment of this Phase. 
If there is a reason the clinician does not deem the patient appropriate for the study, per inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may stop procedures during baseline characterization. Sitting down in a comfortable environment, the patient will be setup and prepared for the cannula testing with appropriate data recording devices. The patient will be ON current/home oxygen therapy at this time. While subject is at rest, the 
following data will be collected (see Table 1): RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). 
For the RPD, the clinician will record patient scores. 
 
Therapy acclimatization (5 – 10 minutes)  will be performed after the baseline characterization segment is 
complete, and in accordance to site SOC to maintain patient safety. The patient will be fitted with appropriately sized nasal cannula (not to exceed 50% occlusion of the nares).

reference for the Therapeutic Settings.  
 After the designated FiO2/Flow settings are implemented and the patient is acclimatized, the following data 
will be collected (see Table 1): RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). For the RPD, 
the clinician will record patient scores. Patient perception assessment will also be evaluated at this time.

dyspnea , then after recording the data stated above, proceed to increase titration of the flow until relief 
of symptoms, with attention to TcPCO2. At this time, the therapy acclimatization segment should be 
repeated, and data will be appropriately recorded to account for this ‘settings’ adjustment. This is to 
understand any difference in cannula efficacy between legacy design and next generation cannula , 
designs.  
 
Therapeutic Characterization  will be performed [ADDRESS_823419], the 
following data will be collected (see Table 1): RR, HR, BP, SpO2, TcPCO2 and RPD (Modified Borg scale 0 -10). 
For the RPD, the clinician will record patient scores.  
 
Patient & Clinician Perception Assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_619517][INVESTIGATOR_619494]’s testing procedures. Immediately following the completion of this phase, as soon as possible, the continuous Visual Acuity Scale (VAS) will be completed for each of the five endpoints f or clinician 
assessment and the two endpoints for the patient assessment. For the patient perception these include: (1) 
relief of symptoms, and (2) comfort/tolerance. For the clinician perception  these include: (1)  
technical/clinical difficulties, (2) patient comfort & tolerance, (3) ease of use, (4) monitoring & support for therapy, and (5) expected/perceived patient outcomes.  
 
Upon completion of this phase , the testing will pause for [ADDRESS_823420]. During this pause the patient will not 
perform known to worsen dyspnea. During the pause the patient will continue with their current oxygen 
therapy.  
 
Phase 3 – Test #2 (randomized)  
 
For Phase 3, go back and repeat all procedures from Phase 2 with the difference 
of testing the second randomized cannula (Prosoft or Unicorn).  
 
Upon completion of this phase , the study testing procedures will be deemed completed, and any final study 
data will be finished at this time. At this time, the patient may resume current/home oxygen therapy.  
 Other Medical Care All other medical treatment will remain the purview of the attending physician and will be administered in accordance with clinic standards.  This study is designed to evaluate only the patients’ ventilatory 
performance, oxygenation, and physiologic parameters while on HVNI with current and next generation 
cannula designs. It is assumed that the ancillary interventions will adhere to common clinical practice guidelines and conventions.  All treatments given to subjects will be documented on their CRFs.

VIII. Statistical Analysis  
The data analysis will be “per protocol.” Baseline patient demographics and characteristics will be 
summarized, compared, and appropriate statistical testing will be performed for the continuous and 
categorical variables. Assuming a non -normal data distrib ution for this crossover order -randomized study 
design, the non -parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum test will be performed with significance interval of 
0.05 on all applicable variables. Parametric analytical analogues (e.g. t -test) will be use if the meas urements 
present a normal distribution. Otherwise, for the categorical variables, the Fisher’s Exact test will be performed. Data will be compared and graphed accordingly for a visual comparison with accompanied statistical notations.  
 
IX. Risks and Discomfo rts 
This study does not present significant risk to patients, as supplemental oxygen is routinely provided to 
patients as a means of standard/routine practice in the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] 
18. Use of high flow nasal cannula 
therapy has no known risks and has been used in the clinical setting for approximately [ADDRESS_823422] with their nose, face or around their ears; patients may also experience runny nose from the humidity contained in the gas flow.  
 
X. Potential Benefits  
Subjects may or may not receive any direct health benefit from participation. Due to the short duration of the 
exposure, it is not likely that the patients enrolled in the HVNI cannula study will themselves benefit from 
participation in this study. The trial may result in scientific knowledge that leads to improvements in the 
quality of patient care, patient experience, and the effect cannula designs have on patient dyspnea relief.

The clinical trial site will be monitored in accordance with policies at Vapotherm and federal regulations that 
pertain to clinical research, namely 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 and 812 and others as applicable.  Monitoring will occur at regular frequency by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], such as to allow ongoing review of data collected, site qualifications and compliance with the protocol.  All investigators will be appropriately trained to ensure 
compliance with the protocol. Audits of the study CRF’s will be regularly conducted by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
XII. Protocol Deviations  
Any deviations from the Data Collection plan identified during monitoring or through other means will be 
documented on case report forms. These include, but are not limited to items such as the following:  
• Deviation from the procedural sequencing, per the protocol  
• Failure to complete the Baseline characterization  
• Failure to complete all sections of the Study Phases  
• Failure to capture time and place in trial of any device failure  
• Failure to capture/record data included in the protocol  
• Subject inability to complete both the control and test study arms  
If the study site demonstrates a pattern of consistent and frequent deviations, the sponsor will undertake 
appropriate activities (e.g. re -training) to attempt to bring the site into compliance with the protocol. A 
pattern of repeated serious deviations fr om the protocol may result in site termination from the study.  
 
XIII. Adverse Event Reporting  
During the course of the subjects’ participation in the study, the investigator will determine whether any 
adverse events have occurred.  For the purposes of this protocol, an adverse event is defined as any 
undesirable event experienced by a subject, that  is or is not attributed to the device or procedure required by 
[CONTACT_3181].  If any adverse event occurs, whether anticipated or unanticipated, the investigators will 
immediately contact [CONTACT_10386] (site monitor) indicated on page 1. 
 
XIV. Confidentiality  
Rigorous procedures will be followed to maintain confidentiality of subject identification and test -related 
information and to adhere to government regulations concerning privacy.  Methods to protect the privacy of 
subjects and clinical information are emp loyed and built into the trial.  A unique identification number 
designed to protect the identity of subjects will be used to identify the subject on case report forms, recruitment logs, data forms or other reports. 
 
This unique identification number will not be linked to identifiable data; no personal or identifiable patient 
data will be collected.  The Vapotherm clinical research staff member managing the study will be the only 
person to have knowledge pertaining to the link between the unique identifiable number and the subject.  All 
other Vapotherm representatives involved in this study  will only have access to the patients’ unique 
identification number.  The linked data will be maintained by [CONTACT_619518].

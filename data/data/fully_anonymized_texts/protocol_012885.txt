Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia following local administration of HTX -[ADDRESS_1161478] 72  hours following unilateral simple bunionectomy.  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -[ADDRESS_1161479] 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To compare the effect of HTX -[ADDRESS_1161480] 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -[ADDRESS_1161481] udy population.  
 To further establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836623] -011 in this study population.  
Methodology: This is a Phase  3, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, 
multicenter study i n subjects undergoing  unilateral simple bunionectomy.  
Subjects will be screened within 2 8 days prior to surgery. Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility 
criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to surgery. On th e day 
of surgery (Day  1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will undergo a unilateral simple 
bunionectomy under regional anesthesia  with no more than 20 mL of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_836624] a Mayo block . Epi[INVESTIGATOR_836625] s pi[INVESTIGATOR_836626]. During surgery, the use  of 
intravenous ( IV) fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted  for intraoperative pain control . Intraoperative 
administration of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_836627]  (including ketamine) , local anesthetics,  or 
anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by [CONTACT_760]) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an 
adverse event  (AE) that occurs after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) , for pretreatment prior to a 
needle placement , or to decrea se venous irritation (eg, caused by [CONTACT_39955] , in which case no more than a 
single administration of lidocaine 1% 20 mg IV may be administered) .  
Near the completion of surgery  and after irrigation and suction have been completed , a single dose of 
study drug (HTX -011, saline placebo, or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861]) will be given 
intraoperatively via local administration into the surgical site.  
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the 
postanesthes ia care unit (PACU). Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/research facility for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_1161482] been completed, subjects may be disc harged. Subjects will return to the study

site on Days  10 and 28  to complete follow -up assessments. In addition, subjects will return for a Safety 
Follow -Up on Day 42.  
Treatment Groups  
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment group s in a 3:3:2 ratio:  
 HTX -011, 60 mg/1 .8 mg (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/meloxicam doses), 2.1 mL, via instillation into the surgical 
site ( 150 subjects)  
 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] 0.5%, 50  mg (10 mL), via injection into the surgical site 
(150 subjec ts) 
 Saline placebo, 2.1  mL, via instillation into the surgical site (100 subjects)  
Blinding  
The study will use a double -blind design . The site’s pharmacy staff and surgical staff will not be blinded 
to the treatment assignments because HTX -[ADDRESS_1161484] 1 postoperative pain score assessed, then a Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS -R) followed by a n NRS  score with activity (NRS -A) must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consis t of oral (PO) immediate -release oxycodone ( no more than  
10 mg within a 4 -hour period as needed) , IV morphine ( no more than 10 mg  within a 2 -hour period  as 
needed ), and/or oral acetaminophen (no more than 1 gram [1000 mg] in a 6 -hour window). For subjects 
administered any acetaminophen -containing product, the total combined daily dose must not exceed 
4 grams (4000 mg) as severe liver damage may occur . No other analgesic agents , including nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , are permitted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period.  
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours  may receive the same rescue medication 
as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge.  
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours , oral acetaminophen (no more than 
1000  mg every 6  hours  as needed ) should  be recommended for postoperative pain.  If a subject received 
[ADDRESS_1161485] should be pr ovided with a 
prescription for o xycodone  (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed) . Subjects will complete a daily diary to 
record if they take an opi[INVESTIGATOR_836628] 72 hours and Day  28. 
Number of Planned Subjects: Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized and dosed.

Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary estimand to address the efficacy objectives is the mean AUC of NRS -A pain intensity scores 
through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) adjusted for use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_836631] ( wWOCF ), comparing the estimated treatment difference between HTX -011 and saline 
placebo using analysi s of variance ( ANOVA ) with missing data imputed via last observation carried 
forward ( LOCF ) for interval censored pain intensity  scores and worst observation carried forward 
(WOCF) for right -censored pain intensity scores in the Intent -to-Treat Population.  
The primary analysis of AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1161498], comparing HTX -011 with saline placebo at a significance level

To account for multiple hypothesis testing on the primary endpoint and on each of the [ADDRESS_1161500] testing hierarchy  will be applied to control study -wise alpha level at 0.05 . If the primary 
endpoint is  statistically significant  (p≤0.05) , then the first key secondary endpoint will be tested. If the 
first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the second key secondary endpoint will be 
tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner down the key secondary endpoint list until an 
endpoint fails to meet statistical significance, after which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be 
considered exploratory.  If the primary endpoint i s not statistically significant, then all key secondary 
endpoints will be considered exploratory.

1.1. Background Information and Study Rationale 
Up to 70% of patients have moderate to severe pain after surgery, and the most severe pain 
occurs within the first 72 hours (Lynch, 1997;  Svensson, 2000;  Apfelbaum, 2003;  Gan, 2014 ;  
Misiolek, 2014 ;  Singla, 2014;  Meissner, 2015) . Administering a local anesthetic (eg, 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], or levobupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) is a relatively simple and safe means of providing 
postoperative pain relief. A major limitation of current local anesthetics is their short duration of 
effect (6 to 12 hours following surgery) (Kehlet, 2011) . Consequently, many patients are given 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_200596].  The requirement for opi[INVESTIGATOR_608022] a serious 
manifestation of ineffective pain relief. Exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_608023]-related adverse 
events (ORAEs) resulting in worse patient outcomes and increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680] (Coley, 2002 ;  
Wheeler, 2002;  Stephens, 2003;  Cashman, 2004 ;  Shirakami, 2005;  Jarzyna, 2011;  
Ramachandran, 2011;  Chan, 2013;  Kessler, 2013;  Oderda, 2013;  Lee, 2015;  Lee, 2016) . 
Furthermore, transition from acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_836637]. A recent review 
of a random sample of records from patients who had at least [ADDRESS_1161515] day 
supplied and rises rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836638] (Shah, 2017) . The [LOCATION_002] (US) is facing a national 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_836639] a public health epi[INVESTIGATOR_836640]. 
In 2015, 2 million Americans had a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers, 
a
nd over 20,000 accidental overdose deaths were related to prescription pain relievers (Bose, 
2016 ;  Rudd, 2016) . Reduced exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_836641] (Barnett, 2017) . Therefore, there is a medical need for clinical 
a
lternatives to prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_836642]. The development 
of an extended-release local anesthetic applicable for a broad range of surgeries that could 
significantly reduce both pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_836643] a 
favorable safety profile would address an important public health need. 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Heron) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_39880]-[ADDRESS_1161516] that contains 2 active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836644]-active ingredient and 
low-dose meloxicam to enhance the effectiveness of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], incorporated in a proprietary 
bioerodible polymer (termed Biochronomer®). When HTX-011 is administered, the polymer 
undergoes controlled hydrolysis in the tissue resulting in the extended release of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836645] 3 days. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836646]-type, long-acting, immediate-release,  local 
anesthetic and meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both have been 
approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) and in many countries outside the US 
and have a long history of clinical use. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836647] a solution for injection and is 
approved for surgical anesthesia and for acute pain management (nerve block) in adults and

tablet for oral use and approved for short-term symptomatic treatment of exacerbations of 
osteoarthrosis and long-term symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing

Confidential 23 spondylitis in adults. The extended release is achieved using a proprietary vehicle formulation 
consisting of the novel tri[ethylene glycol]-based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) in 
combination with different excipi[INVESTIGATOR_39882] (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol 
triacetate [triacetin], and maleic acid). 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, saline placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing unilateral simple bunionectomy to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, 
safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 administered via local administration into the 
surgical site.

.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups 
Bunionectomy is an accepted model of postoperative pain. Bunionectomy produces generally 
reliable and persistent pain symptoms for a period typi[INVESTIGATOR_137526] 72 hours from the 
surgery, which allows for analysis of acute analgesia over an extended period of time. 
The study will compare HTX-011 via local administration into the surgical site with 2 controls: a 
saline placebo control and an active control, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861]. The study 
will employ a randomized and double-blind design to minimize potential bias in subject selection 
as well as efficacy and safety assessments. The site’s pharmacy staff and surgical staff  will not 
be blinded to the treatment assignments because HTX-[ADDRESS_1161517] is transferred to the 
postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Investigator and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock. 
One dose level of HTX-011 will be evaluated in this study, 60 mg/1.8 mg 
(bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/meloxicam doses) administered via instillation. The d ose and administration 
technique were select ed based on a previous Phase 2,  dose-finding study in bunionectomy 
(Study 208). In Study 208,  HTX-011  doses ranging from 30 mg/0.9 mg to 200  mg/6 mg 
administered via different local administration techniques (injection, injection using a Mayo 
block, instillation) were evaluated.  The 60 mg/1.8 mg dose was determined to be the minimally 
effective dose for producing postoperative analgesia through 72 hours. An evaluation of pain 
intensity scores by [CONTACT_836683] 011 60 mg/1.8 mg demonstrated a 
significant reduction in mean pain intensity over 72 hours when HTX-011 was administered via 
instillation compared with saline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974].  HTX-011  60 mg/1.8 mg had a 
favorable safety profile . No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed for this dose.  Based on 
these findings, 60 mg/1.8 mg administered via instillation was selected for this Phase 3 study. 
The primary endpoint for this study, mean area under the curve (AUC) of the Numeric Rating 
Scale of pain intensity scores with activity (NRS-A) through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) for HTX-011 
compared with saline placebo, was selected based on FDA and Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidances as well as regulatory precedent. Draft FDA 
Guidance for Industry on Analgesic Indications: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_366287]  
(February 2014) states that “p a in intensity is the fundamental measure that defines the efficacy of 
an analgesic drug .” In addition, the FDA agreed to a primary endpoint of AUC of the NRS pain 
intensity scores over t he first 24-hour period in a bony model (bunionectomy) for EXPAREL® 
(EXPAREL USPI, 2016 ). The timepoint of 72  hours selected for this study is considered

Confidential [ADDRESS_1161518] 72 hours after surgery (Lynch 1997;  Svensson 2000;  Apfelbaum 2003;  Gan 
2014 ;  Misiolek 2014;  Singla 2014;  Meissner 2015) . NRS-A was selected for the primary 
endpoint because activity is known to be a more sensitive measure of pain control (Breivik, 
2008 ), and the prescribed activity reflects a simple daily activity for patients (sitting with the

3.1. Description of the Study Design 
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, saline placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK of HTX-011  administered via local 
administration into the surgical site in subjects undergoing unilateral simple bunionectomy. 
All subjects will be screened within 2 8 days prior to surgery. Subjects who meet the Screening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to 
the day of surgery. On the day of surgery (Day 1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria will undergo a unilateral simple bunionectomy under regional anesthesia with no more 
than 20 m
L of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_836659] a Mayo block. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_836660]. During surgery, the use of intravenous (IV) fentanyl up to 
4 μg/kg  will be permitted for intraoperative pain control. Intraoperative administration of other 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_265399], local anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by 
[CONTACT_760]) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an adverse event (AE) that occurs after signing 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF),  for pretreatment prior to a needle placement, or to decrease 
venous irritation (eg, caused by [CONTACT_39955],  in which case no more than a single administration of 
lidocaine 1% 2 0 mg IV may be administered). 
Near the completion of surgery and after irrigation and suction have been completed, a single 
dose of study drug (HTX-011, saline placebo, or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861]) will be 
given intraoperatively via local administration into the surgical site, as described in Section 5.5. 
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the 
PACU. Subjects will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/research facility for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1161527] been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subjects will return to the study 
site on Days 10 and 28 to complete follow-up assessments. In addition, subjects will return for a 
Safety Follow-Up on Day 42. 
3.1.2.  Treatment Groups 
Approximately 400  subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3  treatment groups in a 
3:3:2 ratio: 
 HTX-011, 60 mg/1.8 mg (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/meloxicam doses), 2.1 mL, via instillation into 
the surgical site (1 50 subjects) 
 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] 0.5%, 50 mg (10  mL), via injection into the 
surgical site (150 subjects)  
 Saline placebo, 2.1 mL, via instillation into the surgical site (100 subjects)

assessed, then a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS-R) followed by a Numeric 
Rating Scale score with activity (NRS-A) pain score must be obtained. 
Postoperative rescue medication will consist of oral (PO) immediate-release oxycodone (no more 
than 10 mg within a 4-hour period as needed),  IV morphine (no more than 10  mg within a 2-hour 
period as needed),  and/or oral acetaminophen (no more than 1 gram [1000 mg] in a 6-hour 
window). For subjects administered any acetaminophen-containing product, the total combined 
daily dose must not exceed 4 grams (4000 mg) as severe liver damage may occur. No other 
analgesic agen ts, including NSAIDs,  are permitted during the 72-hour postoperative observation 
period.  
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue 
medication as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge. 
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge at 72 hours,  oral acetaminophen (no more 
than 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain. If a 
subject received [ADDRESS_1161529] 
shoul
d be provided with a prescription for oxycodone (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed).  See 
Appendix G for instructions on  postoperative pain management for subjects medically ready for 
discharge. 
Subjects will complete a daily diary to record if they take an opi[INVESTIGATOR_39857] 72 hours 
and Day 28.  
3.1.4.  Postoperative Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity scores using NRS-R and NRS-A, use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_84737],  discharge readiness as assessed by [CONTACT_836685] (MPADSS) , and Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control. 
Safety assessments will include AE recording, local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) 
assessments, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), hematology and 
serum chemistry, wound healing, and bone healing (X-ray) assessment s. 
PK assessments will include the collection of blood samples for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836661].  See Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1161530].

(control), or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39861] (active control). 
HTX-[ADDRESS_1161544]. For 
administration of study drug, the formulation in the vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile 
syringes. 
5.2. Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling 
HTX-011  will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Study drug will be packaged and labeled by [CONTACT_608126][INVESTIGATOR_39910]. Study drug labeling will comply with 
all applicable national and local laws and regulations.  
5.3. Storage 
At the study site, HTX-011 should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 20 to 25°C 
(with excursions permitted from 15 to 30°C). The room should be locked with restricted access. 
A temperature log must be maintained to monitor the room’s  temperature. 
Saline placebo and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_829671]. 
5.4. Preparation 
Study drug will be prepared at the study site. HTX-011 and saline placebo will be prepared in a 
group of syringes without a needle. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836662] a group of syringes 
with a needle. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on study drug preparation.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration 
Study drug will be given via local administration in to t he surgical wound prior to wound closure, 
after irrigation and suction of each layer are complete.  “Infiltration ” is a regulatory term for 
product labels to describe local administration via instillation or injection. 
5.5.1.  Instillation: HTX-011 and Saline Placebo 
HTX-011 and saline placebo will be administered via instillation using a Luer-lock applicator 
supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Following irrigation and suction of each fascial layer, study drug will be administered evenly so 
that all tissues receive adequate coverage. Care should be taken to ensure adequate exposure of 
the proximal and distal ends (ie, beyond the bony incision) of the wound to study drug. Study 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 38 drug should form  rings of anesthetic around both the proximal and distal aspects of the 
metatarsal. To ensure adequate saturation of all exposed tissues in the surgical field, study drug 
may be administered in layers.  Note that the shallow subdermal layer is to be avoided and that all 
study drug should be utilized (ie, there should be no residual study drug left). Thereafter, skin 
c
losure will commence to complete the surgical procedure (ie, there should be no betadine wash 
unti
l after skin closure at the end of the case). 
5.5.2.  Injection: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836663]. Study drug should be administered 
throughout the tissue planes to ensure equal distribution across the surgical field. The medication 
should form rings of anesthetic around both the proximal and distal aspects of the metatarsal. An 
appropriate way of doing this is as follows: 
 Start proximal to the bony incision and administer half the contents of the syringe 
distally past the bony incision (blue arrows in photo below). 
 Repeat the procedure with the rest of the syringe but now start distally and inject 
proximally (red arrows in photo below). 
 Ensure adequate saturation of all exposed tissues in the surgical field. 
 Thereafter, commence skin closure to complete the surgical procedure (ie, there 
should be no betadine wash until after skin closure at the end of the case).

medications received during this period must have a start time recorded, except for IV fluids and 
oxygen during surgery, which do not need to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE. 
After the 72-hour period until the Safety Follow-Up on Day [ADDRESS_1161548]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator’s in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] w ith the standard of medical care. 
Antiemetic medications may be given to treat nausea and/or vomiting, but should not be 
administered prophylactically (ie, as a routine preventative in the absence of signs or symptoms 
of nausea or vomiting). 
During surgery, the use of IV fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permitted  for intraoperative pain control.  
As the prescribing information for fentanyl citrate (Fentanyl Citrate USPI, 2012 ) specifies that 
for intraoperative use a “moderate dose” of 2 to 20  μg/kg IV is necessary in order to allow the 
anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the surgical stress is increasing or anesthesia 
lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost portion of that range and therefore not 
interfere with assessment of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_39851]. As clinically appropriate, the minimum 
possible fentanyl dose should be used.

6.3. Efficacy Assessments 
6.3.1.  Pain Intensity Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints after surgery. 
Subjects will receive training by [CONTACT_39976]. 
Pain intensity scores will be assessed using an 11-point NRS (0 –10) where 0 represents “no 
pain” and 10 repres e nts “worst pain imaginable” (Breivik 2008) . NRS scores will be recorded 
first at rest (NRS-R) and then with activity (N RS-A).  
For NRS-R assessments, subjects should be seated/recumbent with the surgically attended leg 
elevated or lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Measurements should be obtained after the subject is in the resting 
position for at least 5 minutes. 
For NRS- A assessments, subjects should be seated with the plantar surface of the ball of the 
surgically attended foot touching the floor (no weight-bearing; see photo below).

When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint, it is recommended that 
they be performed in this order: 
 NRS-R pain intensity assessment  (subjects should be seated/recumbent with the 
surgically attended leg elevated or lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; measurements should be obtained 
after the subject is in the resting position for at least 5 minutes) 
 PGA of pain control assessment 
 Vital signs

 NRS-A pain intensity assessment (subjects should be seated with the plantar surface 
of the ball of the surgically attended foot touching the floor [no weight bearing]) 
 LAST assessment 
 Blood sample collection 
 Physical examination 
 Wound healing assessment 
 Bone healing assessment (X-ray) 
7.1. Screening Period 
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study. Screening procedures must be 
performed within [ADDRESS_1161556]’s medical 
history and the results of all Screening assessments to determine study eligibility before the 
subject is randomized.  
Screening procedures and assessments will include the following: 
 Urine drug screen 
 Urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child-bearing potential only) 
 Medical history 
 Demographic recording 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential 47  Physical examination (including weight, height, and BMI calculation) 
 Vital signs measurements 
 12-lead ECG (in triplicate) 
 Blood sample collection for the hematology and serum chemistry 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments 
 AE recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF) 
 Prior and concomitant medication recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF) 
The urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test should be performed first, and the results should 
be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments. A subject who fails the 
drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects with a positive drug 
screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive 
drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_39865]) may be eligible for participation in the study. Any other 
screening laboratory test result that do es not meet the eligibility criteria may not be repeated 
without the Sponsor's approval. 
All subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may 
be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery. Subjects do not need to be present for 
randomization to occur. 
7.2. Treatment and Postoperative Observation Period 
7.2.1.  Day of Surgery (Day 1) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior to Surgery 
On Day 1, subjects will be reassessed for study eligibility. This includes a urine drug screen test 
(all subjects) and urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child-bearing potential only).  Results 
should be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments. 
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria can continue on study and will be admitted 
to the surgical unit.  The following additional study procedures and assessments will be 
performed before surgery: 
 Vital signs measurements 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments (refresher training) 
 AE recording  
 Prior and concomitant medication assessment 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Surgery and Study Drug Administration 
Subjects will undergo a unilateral simple bunionectomy under regional anesthesia (no more than 
20 mL of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_836659] a Mayo block; epi[INVESTIGATOR_836668]). Sites should follow intraoperative safety monitoring in accordance

for minimal monitoring during Anaesthesia and Recovery (for review in 2018) (EBA UEMS, 
2016 ). The start and stop time of surgery and additional surgical details (including the length of 
the sur
gical incision) should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Subjects will be administered study drug unless they experience a clinically significant event 
during surgery (eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject 
medically unstable or complicate their postoperative course. Study drug will be administered via 
local administration into the surgical site at the end of the surgical procedure, but prior to wound 
closure. See Section 5.5 for complete details on the study drug administration technique. 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet,  which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical notes and will become part of the source document. Note:  The start of study drug 
administration will be considered as Time [ADDRESS_1161557] suture will be considered the end of surgery.  
Concomitant medications used during surgery will be recorded (note that IV fluids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE).  AEs will also be recorded. 
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU.

humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value, 
vital sign result, or ECG or X-ray findings deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], 
regardless of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE. LAST signs or symptoms, abnormal 
physical examination findings and wound healing abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs.  
A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be 
recorded (eg, anemia rather than low hemoglobin value). 
Examples of AEs include the following: 
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study. 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding). 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, 
unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur). 
 The following abnormal laboratory results: 
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a 
worsening of a pre-existing condition. 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have investigational 
product interrupted or discontinued.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment 
for the lab abnormality.

visits.  
 Any laboratory abnormality requiring further diagnostic investigation. 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s ) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen . 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a 
greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to 
occur as a long-acting local anesthetic wears off). 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 A life-threatening AE (ie, presented an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.) 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE: h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_39939] a pre-existing condition that does not worsen from baseline, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deterioration in condition, social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],

According to 21 CFR 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
8.1.3.  Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
8.1.4.  Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.1.5.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems 
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the research 
protocol and informed consent document approved by [CONTACT_20601] (EC; 
includes Institutional Review Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], 
and Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being studied. 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]). 
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Events 
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Event s 
The Investigator will assess the severity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categories:  
 Mild: Event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities.

therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
 Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening 
or incapacitating. 
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment. The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
doc
umentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study drug 
must always be suspect.  The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to the following guidelines: 
 Possibly r elated: The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonabl e 
possi
bility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study drug and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
 Unlikely related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
stud
y drug caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study drug 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The Investigator may change his or 
her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable. 
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up 
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring 
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through the Safety Follow-Up on Day 42. Note: the AE start time, as well as the date, 
must be recorded during the 72-hour postoperative period. After this period, only the start date 
must be recorded. 
For subjects who received study drug, if an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs 
after the subject’s study participation and the Investigator considers the event to be possibly 
related to the study drug, the Investigator needs to report the SAE to the Sponsor a s described in 
Section 8.4.1 .

Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential [ADDRESS_1161562]’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_39980].  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by [CONTACT_39981] (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent). 
The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories: 
 Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae. An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions. Examples include stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both. Such sequelae are 
usually limited to SAEs. Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop 
(foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in 
paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct 
and loss of renal function. 
 Not resolved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown. 
Examples include headache, low-grade fever, or nausea. 
 Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow-up,  and the status of the event is unknown. 
 Death 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves (ie, when the event no longer meets any of the 
seriousness criteria), the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by [CONTACT_39982] (unless the subject is lost to follow-up or 
withdraws consent). The Investigator will ensure that follow-u p information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both. New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section 8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures 
8.4.1.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug, he/she

Confidential [ADDRESS_1161563] also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter. 
Email Address:  [EMAIL_11570]  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible: 
 AE record 
 Medical history 
 Prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
EDC is the primary method for notification of SAE information. In rare circumstances and in the 
absence of email capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy of the SAE 
reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338]. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need 
for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined. 
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event. The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_829694] [ADDRESS_1161564]. 
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem, he/she must notify the Sponsor by [CONTACT_608139] 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
p
roblem .

0.2. Determination of Sample Size 
Based on a previous Phase 2 study of HTX-011 in subjects undergoing unilateral simple 
bunionectomy, estimates of the relevant parameters for each of the primary and key secondary 
endpoints are as follows: 
Parameter  Saline 
Placebo  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_836670] -011  
60 mg/1.8  mg 
Pain intensity AUC 0-72: Mean (SD)  425 (175)  425 (175)  325 (175)  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (mg): Mean (SD)  30 (25)  30 (25)  20 (20)  
Proportion of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free subjects  5% 10% 25% 
Assuming these estimates and using Satterthwaite’s t -test with α = 0.05, 2 -sided for the 
continuous endpoints and Fisher’s exact test with α = 0.05, [ADDRESS_1161568] 90% power to detect a 
statis
tically significant difference between the HTX-011 group and each of the control groups for 
each of the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
10.3. Analysis Populations 
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population: All subjects who are randomized and receive study drug will be 
included in the ITT Population. This population will be used as the primary analysis population 
for all efficacy endpoints. The randomized treatment assignment will be used for analysis in this 
population. 
Per Protocol Population: All subjects in the ITT Population who do not receive a prohibited 
rescue medication prior to [ADDRESS_1161569] no important protocol violations prior to 
72 hours will be included in the Per Protocol Population. This population will be used for 
sensitivity analyses on the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Safety Population: All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population. 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data.  The actual treatment received will 
be used for analysis in this population.

be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, age category, sex,  race, ethnicity, 
height, weight, and BMI. 
10.4.2. Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary estimand to address the efficacy objectives is the mean AUC of NRS-A pain 
intensity scores through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) adjusted for use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_836671] (wWOCF), comparing the estimated treatment 
difference between HTX-011 and saline placebo using analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with 
missing data imputed via last observation carried forward (LOCF) for interval censored pain 
intensity scores and worst observation carried forward (WOCF) for right-censored pain intensity 
scores in the ITT Population. 
The primary analysis of AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1161571], comparing HTX-011 with saline placebo at a 
significance level of 5%. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and SDs, least-squares mean 
differences (LSMD) and SEs with associated 95% CIs, and p-values. To account for the duration 
effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], the wWOCF method will be implemented as the primary 
analysis method for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores.  In this method, pain intensity 
scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of effect) of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_836672] (highest) postdose nonmissing NRS pain intensity 
score observed prior to the rescue medication window, with the following exception: if the NRS 
pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the worst pre-window score, then 
it will not be replaced . Sensitivity analyses for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores 
will analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39859]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Key secondary endpoints involving AUC of NRS-A will be analyzed similarly to the methods 
described for the primary endpoint.  
Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_338358] [ADDRESS_1161572] is statistically 
significant (ie, p ≤0.05) then the assumption of normality is violated and the total postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_836673]. 
Results will be expressed as median (range) and p-values. However, if assumption of normality 
holds (ie, Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk p-value >0.05), then the total postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_836674]: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential [ADDRESS_1161573]. Results will be expressed as means, SDs, and LSMD and SE with associated 95% 
CI, and p-values. 
The proportion of subjects who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-free through 72 hours will be analyzed using Fisher’s 
exact test. Results will be expressed as the number and percentage of subjects meeting the 
relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95% CIs, and p-values.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study-Wise Type I Error Control 
To account for multiple hypothesis testing on  the primary endpoint and on each of the [ADDRESS_1161574] testing hierarchy will be applied to control study-wise alpha level at 
0.05. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant (p ≤0.05) , then the first key secondary 
endpoint will be tested. If the first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the 
second key secondary endpoint will be tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner 
down the key secondary endpoint list until an endpoint fails to meet statistical significance, after 
which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory. If the primary 
endpoint is not statistically significant, then all key secondary endpoints will be considered 
exploratory. 
  
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Handling of Missing Data 
Due to the required 72-hour inpatient postoperative observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed through [ADDRESS_1161575] (highest) NRS pain intensity score observed prior to 
withdrawal will be used for post-withdrawal values through [ADDRESS_1161576] of opi[INVESTIGATOR_39946]/WOCF (ie, 
perform LOCF/WOCF first, then apply wWOCF). The number and percentage of missing NRS 
pain intensity scores will be summarized.

13.1. Clinical Monitoring 
The Sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study. This 
includes ensuring the subject s’ rights and well-being are protect ed, the conduct of the study is 
within compliance of an approved protocol and GCPs, and the integrity of the data are accurate, 
complete and verifiable from source documentation. At regular intervals during the study, the 
Sponsor’s study m onitors will contact [CONTACT_40000], telephone calls, emails, and 
letters in order to review study progress and the eCRF completion and to address any concerns or 
questions regarding the study conduct. During monitoring visits, the following aspects of study 
conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent documents, subject recruitment 
procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source -data verification, drug 
accountability (unblinded monitor only), use of concomitant therapy by [CONTACT_1766], AE and SAE 
documentation and reporting, and the quality of data. 
13.2. Source Documents and Record Retention 
Each  study site will maintain study documents and records as specified in ICH E6, Section 8 
(Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) and as required by [CONTACT_40001]. These include, but are not limited to,  the following: the study 
protocol, eCRF, delegation of authority log, pharmacy dispensing records, drug accountability 
logs, AE reports, subject source data (original or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), correspondence with health 
authorities and ECs, ICFs, monitoring visit logs, laboratory certification or quality control 
procedures, and laboratory reference rang es. Access to study documents and records will be 
strictly controlled (see Section 12.5). 
Study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_1161581] to study subjects. 
Protocol deviations fall into 2 categories: those with approval prior to the event (protocol 
exemptions) and those occurring during the course of the study without prior approval (protocol 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 70 violations). If an exemption from the protocol design (eg, a missed study visit or an unmet 
inclusion or exclusion criterion) is desired for an individual subject, other than those to eliminate 
immediate hazard, the Investigator must request an exemption from the Sponsor or designee. The 
Investigator will notify the EC of exemptions and deviations, as required by [CONTACT_829698]. Exemptions (with rationale) will be documented at the site and in the Sponsor 
files. For any protocol violation, the site will document the protocol violation in the subject’s 
source documents. In the event of a significant violation, the site will notify the Sponsor or 
designee. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessments. The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the regulatory authorities, if required. 
13.4. Financial Disclosure 
Investigators are required to inform the Sponsor of all disclosable financial interests or 
arrangements (including those of their spouse and dependent children), prior to study initiation at 
the site, at study completion,  and [ADDRESS_1161582] promptly notify the Sponsor if 
ther
e are any reportable changes that occur during the above described period.  
Disclosable financial interests or arrangements, or the absence thereof will be recorded on the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form. 
Any Investigator(s) added as investigational staff to the FDA [ADDRESS_1161583] complete the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form at the start of his/her participation in the 
study. The Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form for any Investigator(s) leaving

Enrollment will be suspended if the Sponsor discovers the occurrence of either of the following: 
 Any death for which a clear alternative cause (unrelated to study drug) is not readily 
apparent. 
 Three (3) non-fatal SAEs that are considered by [CONTACT_836691], and that are either unexpected or for which a clear alternative cause is not 
readily apparent. 
13.5.2. Termination of Study or Investigational Site 
If the Sponsor, Investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that a study site should be closed, 
this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator(s). 
Reasons for terminating the study early or closing a site include, but are not limited to, the

Body Mass Index = Weight in kilograms / (height in meters)2 
Meters = inches × 0.0254 
Kilograms = pounds × 0.45 
 
Example: 
For a man who weighs 165 pounds and is 71 inches tall: 
165 lbs. × 0.45 = 74.25  kg 
71 in. × 0.0254  = 1.8 m

discharge: 
You have completed the initial part of the study which required you to stay at the facility. You 
are now being discharged to go home. You will come back here again for check-up visits on 
Day 10 (approximately 1 week from now),  Day 28 (approximately 3½ weeks from now), and for 
a Safety Follow-Up on Day 42 (approximately 5½ weeks from now). 
While you are at home, if you experience any pain from your operation, please take up to 
2 over-the-counter extra-strength (500 mg) acetaminophen tablets (eg, Tylenol) every 6 hours as 
needed. Do not take more than 8 tablets (4000 mg) in a 24-hour period. If this does not control 
your pain, please call <<insert name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031]>> so that we can talk about 
providing you with a prescription for something stronger, if needed. 
Do not take other acetaminophen-containing products that are available over the counter 
without first checking with your doctor. As an example, cold medicine over the counter may 
contain acetaminophen and may result in exceeding the daily dose limit of acetaminophen and 
can cause liver damage. 
NOTE: If a subject required [ADDRESS_1161592] should be provided with a prescription for o xycodone up to 10 mg PO q4h, #15, as

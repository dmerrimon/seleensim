1 Introduction  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes all planned analyses for the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR) of study CBGJ398X2201, a multi- center, open label, phase II  study of BGJ398 for the 
treatment of patients  with recurrent GBM and/or other glioma subtype s, whose tumors harbor 
FGFR1 -TACC1, FGFR3 -TACC3 fusion and/or activating mutation in FGFR1, FGFR2, or 
FGFR3 gene . 
The content of this SAP is based on protocol CBGJ398X2201 Amendment version 2. All 
decisions regarding final analysis, as defined in the SAP document, have been made prior to database lock  of the study data. Detailed tables, figures and listings can be found in TFL shells 
version 1.0. 
 
1.1 Study design 
The study is planned to enroll patients with recurrent GBM in two groups. Non Surgery Group 
enroll s patients who are not candidates for surgery. Patients in Non Surgery Group receive 
BGJ398 on a three weeks on, one week off schedule. Surgery Group enrolls patients who are 
surgical candidates. Patients in Surgery Group receive BGJ398 for 5- 10 days prior to surgery. 
After recovery of surgery  (a minimum of two weeks and no more than six weeks following 
surgery) , patients in Surgery Group  receive BGJ398 on a three weeks on, one week off 
schedule. Patients from both Non Surgery Group and Surgery Group are evaluated for tumor 
response and progression by [CONTACT_246665] -enhanced MRI every 8 weeks until disease 
progression/discontinuation from study using RANO criteria. 
The study plans to enroll 34 adult patients with histologically confir med recurrent GBM and/or 
other glioma subtypes with FGFR1- TACC1, FGFR3 -TACC3 fusion and/or activating mutation 
in FGFR1, 2, or 3.

2 Statistical methods  
2.1 Data analysis general information 
The final  analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_270413]. SAS® version 9.4 will be us ed to 
perform all data analyses  and to generate tables, figures and listings.  
Data included in the analys is 
The study data will be analyzed and reported  (in a primary CSR if final DBL has not occurred)  
based on all patient’s data when all patients have completed at least [ADDRESS_329666] discontinued the study or at the end of the study (end of survival follow  up period) 
which is one year after the last patient’s last dose of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 11  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
General analysis conventions 
Pooling of center s: Unless specified otherwise, data from all participating centers will be 
combined for the analysis, so that an adequate number of patients will be available for analysis.  
Due to expected small number of patients enrolled at centers, no center effect will be assessed.  
Qualitative data (e.g., gender, race, etc.) will be summarized by [CONTACT_270414], 
a missing category will be included as applicable. Percentages will be calculated using the number of patients in the relevant population or subgroup as the denominator. Quantit ative data (e.g., age, body weight, etc.) will be summarized by [CONTACT_270415] (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  
 
2.1.1  General d efinition s  
Investigational  drug and study treatment  
Investigational drug  refers to  the BGJ398 only.  
Study treatment  = investigational drug. 
Date of first administration of investigational  drug  
The date of first administration of investigational drug is defined as the first date when a non-
zero dose of investigational drug BGJ398 is administered and recorded on the Dosage 
Administration Record (DAR ) (e)CRF . The date of first administration of investigational drug 
will also be referred as the start date of investigational drug. Date of last administration of investigational  drug  
The date of last administration of investigational drug is defined as is the last date when a 
nonzero dose of investigational drug is administered and recorded on DAR (e) CRF.  The date 
of last administration of investigational drug will also be referred as the last date  of 
investigational drug.  
Study day  
The study day, describes the day of the event or assessment date, relative to the reference start 
date.  
The study day is defined as: 
 •   The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, asse ssment date etc.)  − 
reference start date + 1 if event is on or after the reference start dat e; 
• The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) − 
reference start date if event precedes the reference start dat e. 
The reference date for all assessments (safety, efficacy,  etc) is the start date of study 
treatment.  
The study day will be displayed in the data listings.  If an event  starts  before  the reference start 
date,  the stud y day displayed on the listing will be negative.  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 12  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
Time unit  
A year length is defined as 365.25 days. A month length is 30.4375 days (365.25/12). If duration 
is reporte d in months, duration in days will be  divided by 30.4375.  If duration is  reported in 
years, duration in days will be divided by 365.25. A week length is [ADDRESS_329667] treatment administration if a pre -dose 
assessment/value is available (e.g., ECG, ). 
If time is recorded for the first treatment dose and for a specific assessment performed the day of first dose, this assessment will be considered as bas eline only if it is  actually  performed 
before the first dose, as checked using both times. 
If time is not recorded, a specific assessment performed the day of first dose administration will 
be considered as baseline if, according to CSP , it should be performed before the first treatment 
administration . 
Patients with no data on a particular parameter before the first treatment administration will have a missing baseline for this parameter.  
The baseline ECG interval value will be obtained by [CONTACT_270416]398 up to [ADDRESS_329668] dose of investigational drug. 
For efficacy assessments , Baseline  is defined as :   
Non Surgery Group : baseline scan must occur within 28 days after the initiation of study 
treatment.  
Surgery Group : an MRI scan, performed within [ADDRESS_329669] be performed within 7 days of starting 
BGJ398. 
On-treatment assessment/event  and observation periods   
For adverse event reporting t he overall observation period will be divided into three mutually 
exclusive segments:  
1. pre-treatment period : from day of patie nt’s informed consent to the day before first 
administration of study treatment  
2. on-treatment period : from date of first administration of study treatment to [ADDRESS_329670]- treatment period : starting at day 30+[ADDRESS_329671] -treatment period cannot 
be made, then the respective data will be assigned to the on-treatment period.   

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 13  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
Safety summaries (tables, figures) include only data from the on- treatment period with the 
exception of baseline data which will also be summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from 
baseline summaries). In addition, a separate summary for death including on treatment and post treatment deaths will be provided.  In particular, summary tables for adverse events (AEs)  will 
summarize only on- treatment events , with a start date during the on- treatment period 
(treatment -emergent  AEs ).   
 
Windows for multiple ass essments  
In order to summarize ECOG performance status ,  vital sign s, and other data collected over 
time (including unscheduled visits), the assessments will be time slotted. The following general 
rule will be applied in creating the assessment windows : If more  than one assessment  is done 
within  the same time window, the assessment  performed closest  to the target  date will be used. 
If [ADDRESS_329672] case  
will be used. Data from all assessments (scheduled and unscheduled), including multiple assessments, will be listed.

2.2 Analysis sets  
Treatment group will be named as: Non Surg BGJ398 125 mg and Surg BGJ398 125 mg. If 
there are no patients in the surgery group, only Non Surg BGJ398 125 mg will be presented . 
Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all patients who received at least one dose of BGJ398. The FAS will be used for all listings of raw data. Unless otherwise specified the FAS will be the default analysis set used for all analyses.  
Per protocol set (PPS)   
The Per -Protocol Set (PPS) will consist of a subset of patients in the FAS (with FGFR1 -TACC1, 
FGFR3 -TACC3 and/or activating mutations in FGFR1, 2 or 3) who are compliant with 
requirements of the CSP . The PPS wi ll include patients who have a n adequate tumor assessment 
at baseline, a follow -up tumor assessment >[ADDRESS_329675]- baseline safety assessment.   

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 15  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
The statement that a patient had no AE (on the AE (e)CRF) constitutes a valid safety 
assessment.  
The treatment received is defined as:  
• The treatment assigned if it was received at least once, or  
• The first treatment received when starting therapy with study treatment if the assigned 
treatment was never received.

2.3 Patient disposition, demographics, disease history and medical 
history 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used for all baseline and demographic summaries and 
listings unless otherwise specified . No inferential statistics will be provided.  
Basic demographic an d background data  
All demographic and baseline disease characteristics data will be summarized and listed. Categorical data, e.g. gender, age groups: < 65 and ≥ 65 years, race, ECOG  performance status,  
FGFR status (FGFR1/2/3 Amplified/Mutated/Translocated) , will be summarized by f requency 
counts and percentages ; the number and percentage of patients with missing data will be 
provided. Continuous data , e.g. age, weight, height, body mass index , will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9086] (N,  mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum ). BMI 
(kg/m2) will be calculated as weight[kg] / (height[m]2) using weight at Baseline.    
Diagnosis and extent of cancer (disease history)  
Diagnosis and extent  of cancer  will be tabulated for  primar y site of cancer,  details of tumor 
histology/cytology and histological grade.  
Medical history  
Medical history and ongoing conditions, including cancer -related conditions and symptoms 
entered on (e)CRF will be summarized and listed. Separate summaries will be presented for 
ongoing and historical medical conditions.  The summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_92869] (SOC)  and preferred  term (PT). Medical history and current medical conditions will 
be coded using the M edical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.  The 
MedDRA version 20.1used for reporting will be specified in the CSR and as a footnote in the applicable tables/listings.  
 
2.3.1  Patient disposition 
The following patient disposition information will be summarized for patients in the FAS:  
• Enrolled patients who remained on treatment or discontinued treatment, based on the end 
of treatment (e) CRF  (note that patients remained on treatment if the last kno wn date the 
patient took study drug is later than the cut- off date)  
• Primary reasons for end of treatment (EOT).  
• Number (%) of patient s who are discontinued and have entered the 30 day safety  follow-
up (based on the ‘End of Treatment Phase Completion ’ page) ; 
• Number (%) of patient s who have entered the survival follow-up (based on the ‘End of 
Treatment Phase Completion’ page). 
• Primary reasons for end of study 
A listing of EOT details will be produced. Patients enrolled but not treated will be listed along with the reason for discontinuing from the study.  Additionally, a listing of screen failure

SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
patients, with reason for screen failure will be produced. Since screening failures are not part 
of any analysis sets, they will not be included in any of the summary tables.  
Protocol de viations  
The number (%) of patients in the FAS with any protocol deviation will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_10600] (as specified in the study Data Handling Plan ). Protocol deviations leading 
to exclusion from analysis set s will be tabulated separately. All protocol deviations will be 
listed.  
Analysis sets  
The number (%) of patients in each analysis set (defined in Section 2.2) will be summarized.  
2.4 Treatments (study treatment, rescue medication, concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], compliance) 
2.4.1  Study treatment / compliance  
Duration of exposure, actual dose intensity  (ADI) and relative dose intensity  (RDI)  will be 
summarized . The number  (%) of subject s who have dose reductions or interruptions, and the 
reasons, will be summarized.  
Subject level l istings  of all doses administered on treatment  along with dose change reasons 
will be produced.   The safety  set will be used for all summaries and listings of study treatment .  
Duration of exposure to study treatment  
The duration of exposure i s calculated as detailed below.  
For patients who discontinued permanently from the stud y as of the data cut -off date:  
Duration of exposure (days) = (end date of study drug + X ) – (start date of study drug) + 1, 
where study drug is BGJ398 and X is the numbe r of days from last administered dose to the 
next planned dose  taking into account the minimal allowed dosing interval. If the last dose of a 
cycle was taken later than the scheduled cycle length (28 days), X will be set to [ADDRESS_329676] dose is less than 21 days; otherwise, X equals 
to (28 – cycle day of the last dose).  
For patients who are still on -treatment  as of data cut -off date:  
Duration of exposure (days) = data cut-off date – ( start date of study drug ) + 1.  
Summary of duration of exposure of study treatment in weeks  will include categorical 
summaries and continuous summaries (i.e. mean, standard deviation etc. ). Duration of exposure  
will be categorized into time intervals  (i.e. < 4 weeks, 4 - < 8 week s, 8 - < 12 weeks, 12 - < 16 
weeks, 16 - < 24 weeks, 24 - < 32 weeks and >= 32 weeks); frequency counts and percentages 
will be presented for the number (%) of subject s in each interval .

Cumulative dose 
Cumulative dose of a study treatment is defined as the total dose given during the study 
treatment exposure and will be summarized for each of the study treatment components .  
The planned cumulative dose  for a study treatment component refers to the total planned dose 
as per the protocol up to the last date of investigational drug administration.  
The planned cumulative dose is not summarized/listed. It is used for relative dose intensity 
calculations.   
The actual  cumulative dose refers to the total actual dose administered, over the duration for 
which the subject is on the study treatment as documented in the DAR ( e)CRF.   
For patients who did not take any drug the cumulative dose is by [CONTACT_64211]. 
Relative dose inten sity 
Actual dose intensity  (ADI) for patients with non- zero duration of exposure is  defined as 
follows:  ADI (mg / day ) = Actual Cumulative dose ( mg) / Duration of exposure to study treatment ( day). 
For patients who did not take any drug the ADI is by [CONTACT_64211].  Planned dose intensity (PDI)  is defined as follows: 
PDI ( mg / day)  = Planned Cumulative dose ( mg) / Duration of exposure ( day). 
Relative dose intensity  (RDI)  is defined as follows:  
RDI = ADI (mg / day )  / PDI ( mg / day ).   
 
Dose reductions, interruptions or permanent discontinuations  
The number of subject s who have dose reductions , dose interruptions, or dose  permanent 
discontinuations, and the reasons, will be summarized. ‘Dose Changed’, ‘Dose interrupted’, and 
‘Dose permanently discontinued’ fields from the DAR (e)CRF  will be used to determine the 
dose reductions, dose interruptions, and permanent discontinuations, respectively. Note : 
planned 1 week off in dosing schedule will not be collected or counted as dose interruption. The 
corresponding field ‘Reason’ for dose change d, dose interrupted, and dose permanently 
discontinued will be used to summarize the reasons.  
A dose reduction is  defined as a decrease in total daily dose from the protocol planned dose , 
and a decrease from the previous non- zero dose, even if this decrease has been directly preceded 
by [CONTACT_270420], and the dose change flag is checked .  For example, in the sequence 125 mg 
– 0 mg – 100 mg, the 100  mg dose will be counted as a reduction. 
A dose interruption is defined as an instance that no study drug (0 mg) is taken when the 
protocol planned dose is non-zero. For example, in the sequence 125 mg – 0 mg – 100 mg, the 
0 mg dose will be  counted as an interruption.

Separat e listings  will be produced for prior anti-neoplastic medications,  radiotherapy, and 
surgery.  
The above analyses will be performed using the FAS.  
Concomitant medications  
Concomitant therapy is defined as all interventions (therapeutic treatments and procedures) 
other than the study treatment administered to a patient  coinciding with the study treatment 
period. Concomitant therapy include s medications (other than study drugs) starting on or after 
the start date of study treatment or medications starting prior to the start date of study treatment and continuing after the start date of study treatment.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference Listing  (DRL)  dictionary  that  employs  the  WHO  Anatomical  Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classification system and summarized by [CONTACT_270421]. Surgical and medical procedures will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_9315].  These summaries will includ e: 
1. Medications starting on or after the start of study treatment  but no later than [ADDRESS_329678] date of study treatment 
will be flagged in the listin g. The  safety se t will be used for all concomitant medication tables 
and listings.  
2.5 Analysis of the primary objective 
The primary objective of the study is to assess the anti -tumor activity of BGJ398 for patients 
with GBM and/or other glioma subtypes with FGFR1- TACC1, FGFR3 -TACC3 fusion and/or 
activating mutation in FGFR1, 2 or 3.

PFS rate at 6 months (PFS6) as defined by [CONTACT_270422].  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 20  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
Non Surgery Group : PFS is defined as the number of days from the first day of treatment to 
the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first.   
Surgery Group : PFS is defined as the number of days from the first day of treatment after 
surgery to the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever 
occurs first.  
2.5.[ADDRESS_329679] rate. The probability density function is given by f(x) = υλx^(υ -1)exp( -
λx^ υ)  where υ is a shape parameter  and λ a scale parameter . Prior distributions will be 
placed on both parameters to carry out the analysis. For the scale parameter, a normal (mean = 
0, standard deviation = 2.236 ) distribution will be used on the log of the parameter. For the shape parameter, an exponential with rate 1 will be used. These priors correspond to a prior 
probability of unacceptable efficacy (PFS6 <16%) of 65 %, and clinically relevant efficacy (PFS6 > 40%) of 25% (see Figure 2-1 below).  
Figure 2 -1 PFS6 prior distribution 
 
The posterior distributions will be updated with all the data available at the time of the ana lyses 
from the patients in the PPS who are evaluable for the primary analysis . Once updated, the 
posterior probability that the true PFS6 rate at the dose of BGJ398 used in the study lies in the following categories will be summarized: 
[0, 16%) unacceptable efficacy  
[16%, 25%) limited efficacy [25%, 40%) moder ate efficacy  
[40%, 100%] clinically relevant efficacy 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 21  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
Data from both the treatment groups will be pooled together for this analysis, since we expect 
to observe similar 6 -month  PFS rates for these two groups. The study will be considered a 
success at the final analysis if  
• there is at least 50% confidence that BGJ398 has clinically relevant efficacy (that is, Post Prob(PFS6>=40%) > 50%), and 
• there is at least 80% confidence that BGJ398 has either moderate efficacy or clinically relevant efficacy (Post Prob(PF S6>=25%) > 80%). 
 
2.5.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Patients who discontinue the study and are lost to follow -up without a known date of 
progression or death due to any cause on or before the cut -off date will be censored in the 
primary analysis at the date of their last available tumor assessment.  
2.5.4  Supportive analyses  
As a supportive analysis, Kaplan- Meier estimates of the PFS rate at 4, 6 ,12, 16, 18 and 24  
months , 25
th/75th percentile and median PFS will be derived together with 95% confidence 
intervals.  PFS will also be presented descriptively using Kaplan Meier plots. This analysis will 
be done with  all patients in both the treatment groups pooled together.  
2.6 Analysis of the key secondary objective  
Not applicable.  
2.7 A nalysis of secondary efficacy objective (s) 
The secondary objectives of the study is to assess the anti -tumor activity of BGJ398 based on 
objective response rate and overall  survival using RANO criteria .  
Each patient will be evaluated for all potential sites of tumor lesions at Screening and every [ADDRESS_329680] a ± [ADDRESS_329681] -baseline tumor 
assessment and for confirmatory scans (4 weeks +7 day window only). The first post -baseline 
tumor assessment should be performed on day 1 of cycle 3 (+7 day window permitted) after starting treatment.  There will be a tumor assessment at the End of Treatment (+ 7 days) if the patient discontinues for any reason other than disease progression and the last tumor assessment 
has been performed > 28 days prior to this day. 
2.7.1  Objective Response Rate 
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as per the RANO criteria.  
The ORR analysis will include patients from the FAS who have measurable disease (as per RANO) at their baseline scan. ORR will be reported with 95% confidence interval and response will be listed.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 22  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
This analysis will be done for all patients in the PPS as well as the FAS  in both treatment groups 
pooled together. 
2.7.2  Overall Survival  
Non-Surgery Group : overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of start of 
treatment to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) 
at the date of data cutoff.  
Surgery Group : OS is defined as the number of days from the first day of treatment after 
surgery to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last  contact (censored observation) 
at the date of data cutoff.  If the patient does  not receive at least one post -surgical dose of BGJ398 
(i.e., C1D1), the patient will be excluded fro m the overall survival analysis.  
The survival time for patients without documentation of death prior to analysis data cutoff, will be censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive prior to the cutoff date. Survival time for patients with no post -baseline survival information will be censored on the date of start 
of treatment.  
OS will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method. Survival rate at 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 
months and median OS will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals.  
This analysis will be done for all patients in the PPS as well as the FAS in both treatment groups 
pooled together.  
 
2.8 Safety analyses  
A secondary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of BGJ398. The assessment of safety is based on the frequency  and severity  of AE s and SAEs, changes in 
hematology and chemistry values, specifically those associated with calcium/phosphate 
homeostasis and renal function, and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre -
determined ranges  (CTCAE v 4.03 grading limits or normal ranges as appropr iate). Other safety 
(e.g., ECGs , vital signs and special tests, e.g. pregnancy test ) analyses will be considered as 
appropriate. 
All safety analyses will be based on the safety set.  
The safety summary tables will include only on- treatment assessments. All safety assessments 
will be listed, and those collected later than 30 days after study treatment discontinuation will 
be flagged. 
2.8.1  Adverse events (AEs)  
AE summaries  
AEs will be  coded using MedDRA terminology , the latest version which will be  available at 
the time of analysis .  
AE summaries will include all AEs occurring during on treatment period. All AEs collected in 
the AE (e)CRF page will be listed along with the information collected on those AEs e.g. AE 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 23  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
relationship to study drug, AE outcome etc. AEs with start date outside of on- treatment period 
will be flagged in the listings.  
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_64226], having 
at least one AE in each primary system organ class  (SOC) and for each preferred term  (PT) 
using MedDRA coding. A subject with multiple occurrences of an AE will be counted only once in the respective AE category. A subject with multiple CTCAE grades for the same preferred term will be summarized under the maximum CTCAE grade  recorded for the event. 
AE with missing CTCAE grade will be included in the ‘All grades’ column of the summary tables.  
In AE summaries , the primary system organ class will be presented alphabetically and the 
preferred terms will be sorted within primary S OC in descending frequency. The sort order for 
the preferred term w ill be based on their frequency. 
The following adverse event summaries will be produced: 
• Overview of adverse events and deaths (number and % of subjects who died, with any AE, 
any SAE, any dose reductions/interruptions, AE leading to discontinuation) ;  
• AEs by [CONTACT_3592], summarized by [CONTACT_2073] (all AEs and AEs related to study treatment) ; 
• Seriousness (SAEs and non- SAEs) ;  
• Leading to treatment discontinuation;  
The following listings will be produced: 
• All adverse events (safety set)  
• Adverse events among subjects who were not treated (all screened subjects)  
Deaths  
• Summaries for on -treatment and all deaths (including post -treatment death)  will be 
produced by [CONTACT_103467].  
• All deaths will be listed for the safety set, post treatment deaths will be flagged. A separate 
listing of deaths prior to starting treatment will be provided for all screened subjects.  
EudraCT and clinicaltrials.gov requirements for AEs and Deaths  summar ies For the legal 
requirements of clinicaltrials.gov and EudraCT, two required tables on treatment -emergent 
adverse events which are not serious adverse events with an incidence greater than 5% and on treatment emergent SAEs and SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_270423]. 
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study treatment causality, 
seriousness and severity) occurred with the same SOC and PT:  
• a single occurrence will be counted if there is  ≤ 1 day gap between the end date of the preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE 
• more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > 1 day gap between the end date of the preceding AE and the start date of t he consecutive AE  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 24  
SAP 16-Sep-2019 (11:32)  BGJ398/CBGJ398X2201  
 
For occurrence, the presence of at least one SAE / SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE's in a ≤ [ADDRESS_329682] one SAE is occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.  
2.8.2  Laboratory data  
On analyzing laboratory, data from all sources (central and local laboratories ) will be combined. 
The summaries will include all assessments available for the lab parameter collected no later than 30 days after the las t study t reatment administration . 
The following summaries will be produced for hematology and biochemistry laboratory data (by [CONTACT_270424] ): 
• Shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst on- treatment  value  
• For laboratory tests where CTC grades are not defined, shift tables using the low/normal/high/(low and high) classification to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment  value. 
The following listings will be produced for the laboratory data: 
• Listing  of all  CTC gra de 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities

5 Appendix  
5.1 Imputation rules 
5.1.1  Study drug  
The following rule should be used for the imputation of the dose end date for a given study treatment component: 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 29

Scenario 1 : If the dose end date is completely missing and there is no EOT page and no death 
date, the patient is considered as on -going:  
The p atient should be treated as on-going and the cut- off date should be used as the dose end 
date.  
Scenario [ADDRESS_329688] EOT page complete 
before the Database lock for Final CSR   
Scenario 2 : If the dose end date is completely or partially missing and the EOT page  is 
available:  
Please note that date of assessment on EOT CRT might be very different from last date of 
dose.  
Case 1: The dose end date is completely missing , and the EOT completion date is complete, 
then this latter date should be used.   
Case 2: Only Year (yyyy) of the dose end date is a vailable and yyyy < the year of EOT date:   
            Use Dec31yyyy 
Case 3: Only Year (yyyy) of the dose end date is a vailable and yyyy  = the year of EOT date:   
            Use EOT date  
Case 4: Both Year (yyyy)  and Month (mm) are available for dose end date, and yyyy  = the 
year of EOT date and mm < the mo nth of  EOT date:  
            Use last day of the Month (mm)  
After imputation, compare the imputed date with start date of treatment, if the imputed date is 
< start date of treatment:   
Use the treatment start date  
Patients  with missing start dates are to be considered missing for all study treatment component 
related calculations and no imputation will be made.  If start date is missing then end -date should 
not be imputed.

All investigation dates (e.g. MRI scan, CT scan ) must be completed with day, month and year. 
If one or more assessment dates are incomplete but other investigation dates are available, 
this/these incomplete date(s) are not considered for calculation of the  assessment date and 
assessment date is calculated as the latest of all investigation dates (e.g. MRI scan,  CT scan ) if 
the overall response at that assessment is CR/PR/SD/UNK. Otherwise – if overall response is 
progression – the assessment date is calculated as the earliest date of all investigation dates at 
that evaluation number.  If all measurement dates have no day recorded, the [ADDRESS_329689] -cut-off date and will be 
excluded from analysis .

Prior anti -neoplastic therapy  
No imputation of therapy start  or end date will be done. 
5.2 AEs coding/grading 
Adverse events are coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) 
terminology . 
AEs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. 
The CTCAE represents a comprehensive grading system for reporting the acute and late effects 
of cancer treatments. CTCAE grading is by [CONTACT_108] a 5 -point scale generally corresponding 
to mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, and death. This grading system inherently places a value on the importance of an event, although there is not necessarily proportionality among grades (a grade 2 is not necessarily twice as bad as a grade 1).

Grade categorization of lab values will be assigned programmatically as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The calculation of CTCAE 
grades will be based on the observed laboratory values  only , clinical assessments will not be 
taken into account. The criteria to assign CTCAE grades are given in  [COMPANY_001] internal criteria 
for CTCAE grading of laboratory parameters. The latest available version of the document based on the underlying CTCAE version 4.03 at the time of a nalysis will be used. For laboratory 
tests where grades are not defined by [CONTACT_3989]  v4.03, results will be graded by [CONTACT_15060]/normal/high  (or other project -specific ranges, if more suitable)  classifications based on 
laboratory normal ranges.  
A severity grade o f 0 will be assigned for all non- missing lab values not graded as 1 or higher. 
Grade 5 will not be used. For laboratory tests that are graded for both low and high values, summaries will be done separately and labelled  by [CONTACT_61098], e.g., sodium will be summarized 
as hyponatremia and hypernatremia.  
 
Imputation Rules   
CTC grading for blood differentials is based on absolute values. However, this data may not be 
reported as absolute counts but rather as percentage of WBC.  
If laboratory values are provided a s ‘<X’ (i.e. below limit of detection) or ‘>X’ , prior to 
conversion of laboratory values to SI unit , these numeric values are set to X.   
The following rules will be applied to derive the WBC differential counts when only 
percentages are available  for a xxx differential  
xxx count = (WBC count) * (xxx %value / 100)

Further derivation of laboratory parameters might be required for CTCAE grading. For 
instance, corrected calcium can be derived using the reported total calcium value and albumin 
at the same ass essment using the following formula: 
Corrected Calcium (mg/dL) = Calcium (mg/dL) – 0.8 [Albumin (g/dL)-4] 
In order to apply the above formula, albumin values in g/L will be converted to g/dL by  
[CONTACT_195914] 0.1), calcium values in mmol/L will be converted to mg/dL by [CONTACT_45322] 0.2495. For calculation of laboratory CTC grades  0 and 1, the normal range for derived 
corrected calcium is set to the same limits (in mg/dL) as for calcium.  
CTC grades for the derived absolute WBC differential counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes) and corrected calcium will be assigned as described  above for grading

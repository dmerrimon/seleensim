1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Based on clinical experience, there is a group of patients who, independent from the 
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, at some point in time, develop a progressive fibrosing phenotype. In this group of patients, the natural history appears to follow a course similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], lung function, quality of life (QoL) and functional s tatus, as well as ear ly mortality despi[INVESTIGATOR_230801]-approved immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The proposed terminology for describing this group is progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD).
Based on expert consensus, the main fibrosing ILDs in which progressive behaviour is 
present include:
∀Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs): mainly IPF, idiopathic non-specific 
interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP) and unclassifiable IIP
∀Chronic fibrosing hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP)
∀Autoimmune ILDs: connective tissue disease- ILD (CTD-ILD) (mainly rheumatoid 
arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD) and systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD)) 
and idiopathic pneumonia with autoimmune features
∀Environmental/occupational fibrosing lung disease
The scientific working hypothesis is that the response to lung injury in these ILDs includes 
the development of fibrosis which becomes progressive, self-sustaining and independent of the original clinical association or trigger. It is postulated that, at this stage, targeted antifibrotic therapy is required to slow the progression of the disease.
Based on the similarity in both, the biologic and clinical behaviours i.e. self-sustaining 
fibrosis and progressive decline in lung function and early mortality, it is considered justified to group patients with PF- ILDs together regardless of their original ILD diagnosis.
Nintedanib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of IPF, which has been shown to 
slow the progression of IPF. The rationale for development of nintedanib in PF-ILD is supported by [CONTACT_7416]-clinical data indicating that nintedanib impacts fundamental processes of lung fibrosis and that the anti-fibrotic activity of nintedanib is independent of the cause of the fibrosing lung disease ( P14-[ZIP_CODE] , P14-[ZIP_CODE] , P15-[ZIP_CODE] , P15-[ZIP_CODE] ). Based on the 
similarity in both the underlying pathophysiology and clinical course of PF-ILD and IPF, it is 
anticipated that nintedanib will elicit similar effects in PF-ILD as it demonstrated in IPF. 
The efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD was investigated in the 
INBUILD®trial (BI trial 1199.247; EudraCT no. 2015-003360-37 ), the parent trial to this 
extension trial. Patients remained in the parent trial on blinded treatment (part B) until unblinded data were available from the first database lock (after last randomised patient reached the 52-week time point) of the parent trial. If further exposure was justified by [CONTACT_230816]
®, the patients were offered to participate in this extension trial 
without treatment interruption.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_277924]-03 (15 0) / Saved on: 30 Nov 2017Based on the INBUILD®results, nintedanib offers a long term antifibrotic maintenance 
treatment option for patients with PF-ILD, a medical indication with high unmet medical need. The current trial is aimed to establish the tolerability and safety of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD over a longer duration of treatment.
1.[ADDRESS_277925] spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor), and Src family kinases (Src, Lck and Lyn belonging to a family of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinases).
All of these growth factor pathways and their down-stream signal cascades have been 
demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodelling.
Nintedanib inhibited the proliferation and migration of human lung fibroblasts from patients 
with IPF. It demonstrated anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in three animal models of lung fibrosis and in more specific models of SSc-ILD and RA-ILD. Although the initiation of the fibrotic lung pathology in these model systems is different, progressive fibrotic lung pathology with proliferation, migration and transformation of fibroblasts to the pathogenic myofibroblast is the final common pathway. These similarities and the mode of action of nintedanib directed against the proliferation, migration and transformation of fibroblasts strongly support the rationale for the use of nintedanib in the treatment of patients with PF-ILD ( U06-1451 , U06-1479 , U12-2437-01 , U12-2066-01 , n00239669 , n00247887 ).
Pharmacokinetics
A soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in humans. Maximum plasma 
concentrations occur between [ADDRESS_277926] reached within one week of dosing. After food intake, a trend towards an increased systemic exposure (around 20%) and a delayed absorption was observed compared to administration under fasted conditions. Nintedanib is prefere ntially distributed in plasma with a blood to 
plasma ratio of 0.87 and the terminal half-life is in the range of 7 to 19 hours. The absolute bioavailability of nintedanib was slightly below 5%.
Nintedanib is mainly eliminated via faeces.Co-administration of nintedanib with the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor ketoconazole 
increased exposure to nintedanib by 60-70% based on area under the curve (AUC) and by 80% based on a maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma (Cmax) in a 
dedicated drug-drug interaction (DDI) trial. 
In a DDI trial with the P-gp inducer rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% 
based on AUC and to 60. 3% based on Cmax upon coadministration with rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_230802]. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, age and body weight were correlated 
with nintedanib exposure. However, their effects on exposure are not sufficient to warrant an a priori dose adjustment. There was no influence of sex or mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 30 mL/min) on the exposure of nintedanib. In a dedicated single dose phase I study and compared to healthy subjects, exposure to nintedanib was approximately 2-fold higher in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A)

The Residual Effect Period (REP) of nintedanib is [ADDRESS_277928] 
dose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects still likely to be present.
Data from clinical studies
Nintedanib (trade name: [CONTACT_230834]) is approved for the treatment of IPF and for the treatment of 
SSc-ILD in the US, EU, Japan and a large number of additional countries. Nintedanib is recently also approved in the US, EU, Japan, Canada and a number of other countries for the treatment of (chronic) fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype.
Summary of clinical efficacy results in IPF: The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been 
studied in over 1400 patients with IPF in one phase II dose finding trial (TOMORROW) 
including four different doses of nintedanib, and two replicate phase III trials (INPULSIS®1 
and 2). These were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing treatment with nintedanib twice daily to placebo for 52 weeks. A statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) (in mL) was demonstrated in patients receiving nintedanib 150 mg twice daily (bid) compared to patients receiving placebo. The treatment effect of nintedanib compared to placebo on FVC was consistent in all 3 studies, i.e. a relative reduction of decline of approximately 50%. Supporting the effect of nintedanib on slowing disease progression, nintedanib [ADDRESS_277929] acute exacerbation compared with placebo in INPULSIS
®-2 and in the 
TOMORROW trial and  reduced the risk of acute exacerbations (adjudicated) by 68% in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of  pooled data from the INPULSIS
®trials ( P14-[ZIP_CODE] ; 
P11-[ZIP_CODE] ).
Summary of clinical safety results in IPF: The safety profile of nintedanib in patients with 
IPF has been investigated comprehensively in clinical Phase II/III trials. The most commonly 
reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders. Of those, the most frequent events were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Most of these events were of mild or moderate intensity, reported as non-serious, and were managed by [CONTACT_230817]/or temporary interruption and/or reduction of the nintedanib dose. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting may lead to dehydration and/or electrolyte disturbances. Weight decreased and appetite decrease are also considered adverse drug reactions of nintedanib treatment.
Administration of nintedanib was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, 
ALK, GGT). Administration of nintedanib was also associated with elevations of bilirubin.The dosing regimen, that includes dose reduction and dosing interruptions, was effective in the management of liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations (see section 4.2.1 ). Cases of drug-
induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with nintedanib treatment. In the post-
marketing period, non-serious and serious cases of drug-induced liver injury, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of treatment.
Based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing and supported by [CONTACT_230818], patients with low body weight (<65 kg), Asian and female patients have a higher risk of liver enzyme elevations with nintedanib treatment.
Patients at known risk for bleeding or who required fibrinolysis, full-dose therapeutic 
anticoagulation, or high dose antiplatelet therapy were excluded from participation in the

Summary of clinical efficacy in patients with progressive fibrosing ILD: (INBUILD
®study 
[c26471552] )
The INBUILD®study was a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 
III clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing ILDs over [ADDRESS_277932] fibrotic pattern: ‘UIP-like pattern only’ (412 patients) or ‘Other fibrotic patterns’ (251 patients). Treatment with nintedanib reduced the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC by 106.96 mL/year (95% CI 65.42, 148.50; p < 0.0001) in the overall population and by 128.20 mL/year (95% CI 70.81, 185.59; p < 0.0001) in patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern compared with placebo. Consistent results were observed in the complementary population of patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns (adjusted difference 75.28 mL/year; 95% CI 15.54, 135.01). The treatment effect was independent of HRCT pattern (interaction p-value 0.2268).
Secondary and further lung function endpoints (such as categorical changes in relative FVC 
% predicted and absolute change from baseline in FVC % predicted) supported the primary endpoint. Time-to-event endpoints further evidenced the treatment benefit of nintedanib vs. placebo and suggested that the reduction in FVC decline translated into a reduction of clinically meaningful outcome events. Over the whole trial (Part A+B), treatment with nintedanib reduced the risk of first ILD exacerbation or death by 33% compared with

Summary of clinical safety results in patients with PF-ILD (INBUILD
®study [ c26471552 ])
In the overall population over 52 weeks, adverse events in the SOC 'gastrointestinal disorders' 
were the most common AEs and were reported more frequently in the nintedanib group (80.7%) than in the placebo group (45.0%). The difference was mainly driven by [CONTACT_230820] (nintedanib: 66.9%, placebo: 23.9%), nausea (28.9% vs. 9.4%), vomiting (18.4% vs. 5.1%), and abdominal pain (10.2% vs. 2.4%). Almost all of these events were non-serious and of mild or moderate intensity; they led to premature treatment discontinuation in less than 10% of patients. In line with the findings for gastrointestinal disorders, the proportions of patients with decreased appetite reported as AE and weight loss reported as AE or measured as body weight were higher for nintedanib than for placebo. 
Elevations of hepatic enzymes are a known side effect of nintedanib treatment. The 
frequencies of patients with AEs in the safety topic 'hepatic enzyme increased' were about four times higher in the nintedanib group (22.6%) than in the placebo group (5.7%). Most of the liver laboratory AEs were non-serious. In the pooled INPULSIS
®trials, the frequencies of 
patients with AEs related to liver enzyme elevations were about five times higher in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group [ U13-2683-01/ c02153150-02 ]. In trial 1199.247, 
all patients with serious hepatobiliary or liver laboratory AEs in the nintedanib group, except 
for [ADDRESS_277934] cases after drug withdrawal or dose reduction. Clinical liver failure in terms of hepatic decompensation was not reported. The reported hepatic laboratory changes were in line with the observed liver laboratory AEs.
In the INBUILD
®trial, the incidence of hypertension, a labelled side effect of nintedanib in 
IPF, was comparable in both treatment groups. Serious and non-serious cardiovascular AEs were reported with similar frequencies in both treatment groups. No imbalances were observed for fatal or non-fatal MACE. AEs in the safety topic 'myocardial infarction' were reported for 0.9% of patients in both treatment groups.
The proportion of patients with AEs in the safety topic 'bleeding' was similar in the 
nintedanib group (11.1%) and in the placebo group (12.7%). Like in the INPULSIS
®trials 
the majority of bleeding events in trial 1199.[ADDRESS_277935] frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders, in particular diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Common AEs were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. In addition, treatment with nintedanib was associated with elevations in liver enzymes. The large majority of liver enzyme elevations normalised upon treatment interruption, dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, or spontaneously with continued treatment. There were no new or unexpected safety concerns identified in this trial. Overall, a positive benefit-risk profile for nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing ILD was shown.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
This trial is an extension trial of the 1199.247 parent trial, INBUILD®All patients still 
receiving blinded treatment at the end of part B of the parent trial had the possibility to 
receive open label nintedanib in this extension trial.
The aim of this extension trial is to evaluate long term tolerability and safety of nintedanib in 
patients with PF-ILD. 
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
In the group of patients with PF-ILD the natural history of the disease appears to follow a 
course similar to IPF with worsening of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], lung function, quality of life (QoL) and functional status, as well as early mortality. With the exception of nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], which were available for patients with IPF, there was no approved therapy for PF-ILD at the start of this trial.
Based on the efficacy and safety shown in IPF patients, and considering the similarity of the 
pharmacological rationale between IPF and PF-ILD, the same dose regimen of 150 mg nintedanib bid is considered appropriate.
This extension trial only started recruiting when the results from the initial database lock (i.e. 
the efficacy and safety results after 52 weeks of treatment) of the INBUILD
®trial had been 
reviewed and justified the start of this extension study. This meant that the nintedanib-treated 
patients showed a lesser decline in lung function compared to the placebo-treated group, and that the safety and tolerability was acceptable with no new relevant safety issues identified that influenced the existing benefit-risk assessment. The first day of this extension trial wason the same day as the last visit of the parent trial to allow continuous treatment. 
All patients receive active treatment in this trial.The risks of treatment with nintedanib have been well delineated in patients with the fibrotic 
lung disease IPF. These risks are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), and are usually managed with supportive therapy and with temporary or permanent dose reduction to 100 mg bid. In some cases, temporary interruption or permanent drug discontinuation is necessary. A reduction in appetite and weight decrease has also been reported in patients treated with nintedanib. 
The potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_230821]. Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with nintedanib treatment. The majority of patients presented with mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation, which was in most cases transient upon dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. However, severe DILI with fatal outcome has also been reported. Therefore, this trial requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety. Nintedanib must be dose-reduced, orinterrupted in the event of hepatic toxicity and further treatment withheld until recovery of the abnormal laboratory parameters (see also section [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].4 ).

Potential risks of nintedanib treatment also include gastrointestinal perforations and
thromboembolism. Hypertension, thrombocytopenia and bleeding are considered side effects 
of nintedanib treatment in IPF. Therefore, the use of full dose therapeutic anticoagulation, fibrinolysis or high-dose antiplatelet therapy is not recommended during the trial, and patients requiring such a treatment should only be treated with nintedanib if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risks.
The mode of action of nintedanib indicates a high potential for teratogenicity and 
embryotoxicity, including fetotoxicity and lethality. In women of childbearing potential receiving nintedanib, contraceptive measures must be employed [ADDRESS_277938] management

Cautionary notes are included in the protocol (section [IP_ADDRESS] ) with regard to such 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_230805].
Safety will be closely monitored at site visits, including physical examinations, safety 
laboratory and specific monitoring procedures, to follow-up potential hepatic enzyme elevation and exclusion of pregnancy. In addition, safety laboratory results will be monitored at intermediate lab visits in the first year. In patients who develop severe symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity not amenable to symptomatic treatment with standard measures or severe liver enzyme elevations or other severe adverse events as specified in section 3.3.[ADDRESS_277939]-marketing 
data there is no indication that treatment with nintedanib may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 or for worsening the disease course of COVID-19. It is currently unknown whether PF-ILD conveys a higher risk for adverse outcomes in case of COVID-19.
The trial related risk to the COVID-19 pandemic situation is the general risk of travelling to 
site and being at site for assessments with increased infection risk for lung function testing. Risk mitigation and possible modifications are described in Section 6.1and in Appendix 10.3
In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical 
development.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_277941]-03 (15 0) / Saved on: 30 Nov [ZIP_CODE]. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multi-centre, multi-national, prospective, open label extension clinical trial. It is 
estimated that approximately 480 patients with PF-ILD will complete the INBUILD®trial 
1199.247 (part A and part B) on blinded treatment. These patients will be eligible for 
enrolment in this extension trial. Patients who withdrew treatment prematurely in the 
INBUILD®trial will not be eligible for the open label extension trial (INBUILD®-ON).
At the time point when the data from the INBUILD®trial for patients with PF-ILD are 
available, and justify the start of the extension trial, all patients on blinded treatment at the end of the parent trial can be offered participation in the current rollover study. 
After signing Informed Consent, and if all eligibility criteria are met, patients will initiate 
treatment with nintedanib (Visit 1) (refer to section 4.1.3 ). Patients will receive active drug at 
a dose of [ADDRESS_277942] long-term safety data in patients with PF-ILD, all patients will be requested 
to stay in the trial for 96 weeks (until visit 12). At week 96, patients who can be treated with nintedanib outside the clinical trial will have their EOT visit. The remaining patients will continue in the trial until nintedanib can be made available to them outside the clinical trial. Treatment will be stopped if a reason for withdrawal is met (refer to section 3.3.4 ). Overall, 
the trial is estimated to last a total of approximately 36 months.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The trial will be conducted as a prospective, open-label trial. This design is appropriate for 
assessing the long-term tolerability and safety of nintedanib in patients with PF-ILD.All patients eligible for this extension study will have completed the parent trial, i.e. were treated with blinded study drug (nintedanib or placebo) for at least 52 weeks and did not prematurely discontinue blinded treatment. All patients in the extension study will receive active treatment as prolonged use of placebo would not be appropriate.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is anticipated that approximately 480 patients, from approximately 160 sites in about 15 
countries, will complete the INBUILD
®trial and will consent to participate (and thus receive 
treatment) in this extension trial. At the start of the open label extension trial it is not known which treatment the patients have received in INBUILD
®. Patients previously on active 
treatment will continue treatment with nintedanib, patients who received placebo will initiate treatment with nintedanib for the first time at Visit 1 of the extension trial.

the patient an unreliable trial participant or unlikely to complete the trial.
6. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.
3.3.4 Withdrawal of patients from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”); please see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] below.
The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the 
reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If the reason for discontinuation isdeath, this should be reported on the SAE form as well, regardless of causal relationship.  These data will be included in the trial database and will be reported.
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatmentAn individual patient will permanently discontinue trial treatment if:
∀The patient experiences signs of hepatic injury, defined in section [IP_ADDRESS].4
∀In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient experiences unacceptable adverse events 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_21599].
∀The patient has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or 
able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future.
∀The patient needs to take prohibited concomitant medication as defined in section 4.2.2
“Restrictions”.
∀The patient can no longer receive nintedanib for medical reasons 
∀Pregnancy: if a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, nintedanib needs to be stopped 
and the patient should be followed up until birth or otherwise termination of the 
pregnancy.  The data of the patient will be collected and reported in the clinical trial report (CTR) until patient’s last visit and any events thereafter will be reported in the BI drug safety database.  Refer to section [IP_ADDRESS].4 for detailed information on event 
reporting in case of pregnancy.
In the following cases discontinuation of nintedanib is highly recommended. Only in special 
circumstances, the investigator, upon thorough assessment of all available clinical data and taking into consideration the potential risks associated with administration of nintedanib, may decide not to withdraw the trial medication, even though one or more of the below mentioned criteria are fulfilled. In such a case, continuation of treatment with trial medication should be discussed with the patient, and the decision and reasoning documented in the source data.
∀Major surgery, including any abdominal or intestinal surgery.
∀Anti-coagulation. Patients who require full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. vitamin 
K antagonists, heparin, hirudin, direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors etc.), or high-dose antiplatelet therapy. (Prophylactic low dose heparin or heparin flush as needed for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 I.U. s.c. per day), as well as prophylactic use of antiplatelet therapy (e.g. acetyl salicylic acid up to

In case of a temporary interruption, trial treatment should be restarted if medically justified, 
please see section 4.2.1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of consent to trial participation
Patients may withdraw their consent to trial participation at any time without the need to 
justify the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the options for continued follow up outside of the trial after trial discontinuation, please see section [IP_ADDRESS] above.
Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for trial 
discontinuation and follow up (if applicable) as outlined in the Flowchart and section 6.2.3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of the trial by [CONTACT_35949] a particular trial
site at any time for the following reasons:
1. Emergence of any efficacy/safety information invalidating the earlier positive benefit-
risk-assessment that could significantly affect the continuation of the trial.
2. Patients have alternative access to nintedanib, for example via an alternative clinical trial, 
marketed product, an expanded access program, named patient use program, compassionate use protocol or other means based on local regulation.
3. Violation of GCP, the trial protocol, or the contract impairing the appropriate conduct of 
the trial.
The investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

4.1 INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENTS
4.1.1 Identity of the Investigational Medicinal Products
All patients will be treated with nintedanib in this trial; there is no active comparator or 
placebo.
Substance: Nintedanib
Pharmaceutical formulation: Soft gelatine capsule
Source: BI Pharma GmbH & Co. KG
Unit strength: 150mg, 100mg
Posology: Bid
Route of administration: Oral (swallowed)
4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial and dose modifications
Based on the efficacy, safety and dose-finding from trials investigating nintedanib in IPF, a 
dose of 150 mg bid is selected for the PF-ILD program. With 150 mg bid, acceptable tolerability in PF-ILD patients is expected based on the risk profile seen in IPF patients.  However to manage adverse events, the dose may be reduced to 100 mg bid temporarily or permanently (see section 4.2.1 and section 6.2.2 ).
The objective of INBUILD®was to assess the efficacy and safety of a dose of 150 mg bid 
compared to placebo. Patients were randomised either to blinded nintedanib or to blinded placebo 150 mg bid.  
Patients taking 150 mg bid blinded study medication (active drug or placebo) at the end of 
INBUILD
®will start treatment with nintedanib 150 mg bid in the current extension trial.
Patients taking 100 mg bid blinded study medication (active drug or placebo) at the end of INBUILD
®will start treatment with nintedanib in the current extension trial either at 100 mg 
bid or at an increased dose of 150mg bid at the discretion of the investigator.
For patients who receive nintedanib 100 mg bid in the extension study, at the time of 
unblinding (final database lock) of the INBUILD®trial, it is allowed to increase the dose to 
150 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator, based on the unblinding information.  In this situation, dose increase will need to be assigned through IRT, and an additional visit might be required (refer to section 6.2.2 ).
Nintedanib can be interrupted or reduced without prior interruption, i.e., immediately 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_230806] 150 mg bid to 100 mg bid at the discretion of the investigator to manage adverse events.  Dose adjustments might require a special trial visit according to the procedures in section 6.2.2 .

All patients will receive treatment with nintedanib.  Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
will be used to assign medication numbers to eligible patients. Distribution of nintedanib to sites will be triggered by [CONTACT_12067]. Details on the IRT system are provided in the ISF.
4.1.[ADDRESS_277950] of 1 capsule twice daily throughout the trial.  Wallets covering
30 days + 5 days reserve treatment will be dispensed to the patient:
∀1 wallet at Day 1 (Visit 1) (30 days plus 5 days reserve)
∀2 wallets at Visit 3 (60 days plus 10 days reserve)
∀3 wallets at Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8 and Visit X (90 days plus 15 days reserve)
Nintedanib will be administered orally on a twice daily basis (bid).  The patients should 
swallow the trial medication unchewed together with a glass of water (~250mL), and should observe a dose interval of 12 hours.  Nintedanib needs to be taken at the same times every day (between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and between 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening).  Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it is recommended to take the trial medication with food.
A forgotten dose should be skipped if the time window to the next dose is less than 8 hours.  
The next dose should be taken as scheduled.
Nintedanib should only be dispensed to participating patients according to the protocol by 
[CONTACT_230822] “Trial Staff List”.
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
In this open-label trial, treatment allocation will not be concealed throughout the trial. The 
CRF will contain information on actual treatment.
The previous treatment received in INBUILD
®(active drug or placebo) will remain unknown 
to the investigator and patient until after the final database lock of INBUILD®. No individual 
unblinding regarding treatment received in INBUILD®should occur prior to this time.

4.2.2 Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Investigational therapy is not allowed during the entire study period of this open label 
extension trial. 
There are no further restrictions for treatment of the underlying disease or other treatments 
for the ILD, thus allowing the underlying disease to be managed according to current standard practice (see cautionary notes below).
[IP_ADDRESS] Cautionary notesAs nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4, concomitant use of 
P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin) with nintedanib may increase exposure to nintedanib. Patients taking potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin or ciclosporine) should be monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib.  Management of adverse events may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib.
Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, 
and St. John’s wort) with nintedanib may decrease exposure to nintedanib and should be avoided.
As the most common side effects known for nintedanib are GI effects, the concomitant use of 
medication with an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_230813] (e.g. methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) should be carefully considered.
Nintedanib is associated with increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. If in addition to the 
trial medication, a treatment is introduced that is known to induce AST/ALT elevations (e.g. methotrexate, bosentan), additional measurements of liver enzymes (ALT and AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and eosinophils) are recommended every 2 weeks for approximately 6 weeks, by [CONTACT_230824] (a-visit) trial lab kit.
The concomitant use of full dose therapeutic anticoagulation or high dose antiplatelet therapy 
(e.g. acetyl salicylic acid >325 mg/day, or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] >75 mg/day, or equivalent doses of other antiplatelet therapy) is not recommended (see note section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

5.2.1 Physical examination
A complete physical examination, including body weight, will be performed at the time 
points specified in the Flowchart . It includes at a minimum general appearance, neck, lungs, 
cardiovascular system, abdomen, extremities, and skin. 
Measurement of height will be performed at Visit 1. All abnormal findings at baseline (Visit 1) in the extension trial will be recorded on the 
Baseline Condition eCRF page.  New abnormal findings or worsening of baseline conditions in the extension trial detected at subsequent physical examinations, if judged clinically relevant, will be recorded as adverse events on the appropriate eCRF page.
5.2.2 Vital signs
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at the time points 
specified in the Flowchart, ideally prior to blood sampling and with the patient seated after having rested.  All abnormal findings at baseline (Visit 1) in the extension trial will be recorded on the Baseline Condition eCRF page.  New abnormal findings or worsening of baseline conditions in the extension trial detected at subsequent physical examinations, if judged clinically relevant, will be recorded as adverse events on the appropriate eCRF page.
5.2.3 Safety laboratory parameters
Safety laboratory parameters to be assessed are listed in Table 5.2.3:[ADDRESS_277973] to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety laboratory. Venous 
whole blood will be collected in appropriate syringes provided by [CONTACT_230825]. Details regarding centrifuge, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be determined by [CONTACT_230826]. The Investigators will be informed and instructed by [CONTACT_230827] (Laboratory Manual) will be included in the ISF.

The laboratory samples taken at intermediate ‘a’ visits (Visits 5a, 6a and 7a) and any samples 
taken for additional safety monitoring (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ) may be collected at the office of a 
local doctor using trial specific lab kits that will be sent to a central laboratory for analyses.  
These kits will be provided to patients at study visits as applicable.
Creatinine clearance will be calculated based on serum creatinine according to Cockcroft and 
Gault ( R96-0690 ), Appendix 10.2).  
If laboratory values indicate abnormality, adequate and more frequent blood sampling may be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator. Dependent on concomitant treatments, additional safety monitoring should be considered at the discretion of the investigator.  
In case of liver function value elevations, close monitoring must be ensured by [CONTACT_3786]. Refer to section [IP_ADDRESS] for monitoring elevations and section 3.3.4 for 
withdrawal criteria.
5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
Resting 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be conducted during the trial with site’s own 
equipment.  The 12-lead ECGs must be administered by a qualified technologist and results will be recorded as scheduled in the Flowchart . The investigator or a designee will evaluate 
whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and assess clinical relevance. ECGs may be repeated 
for quality reasons and a repeated recording used for analysis. 
Additional ECGs may be recorded for safety reasons. Dated and signed printouts of ECG 
with findings should be documented in patient’s medical record.
Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported either as baseline condition (if 
identified at Visit 1) or otherwise as AEs and will be followed up and/or treated as medically appropriate.

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_277980] a 
causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable
according to the criteria in section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, including adverse events that 
started during the parent trial, INBUILD®, and that are still ongoing at the time of Visit 1 of 
the extension trial, they will be considered as baseline conditions and should be collected on the Baseline Condition eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],- requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23236]. 
For Japan only:
The following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason”. AEs which 
possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAEs.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_277981]-03 (15 0) / Saved on: 30 Nov [ZIP_CODE].[IP_ADDRESS] AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in [IP_ADDRESS] , subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines” .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the electronic data capture (eDC) 
system. A copy of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request.These events should always be reported as SAEs as described above.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_277982] (AES I) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
Adverse events relating to gastrointestinal perforation and hepatic injury will be considered
AESIs.
Hepatic injury
In this trial protocol, signs of hepatic injury are defined as:
∀ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_277983]
∀ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_277984] and total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_277985]* 
∀ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_277986] and unexplained INR > 1,5*

∀ALT and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_277988] and appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper abdominal quadrant pain or tenderness, fever and/or rash
* in the same blood draw sample.These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to immediately stop the trial medication and need to be followed up according to the “drug-induced liver injury (DILI) checklist” provided in the ISF.In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results

[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_277991] that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by [CONTACT_23320].
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239]-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned).
∀Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

Those AEs should however not be reported in the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_277994] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours ) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flowchart . Some flexibility 
is allowed in scheduling the visits according to visit time windows as specified in the 
Flowchart. The trial medication kits contain sufficient medication to allow for these time windows. If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule (calculated from Visit 1). All deviations from the planned visit schedule will be documented.  In case of a missed visit, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_230828], these will be addressed on a case by [CONTACT_413].
All patients that complete the INBUILD
®trial and did not prematurely discontinue blinded 
treatment may be eligible for this trial. After giving informed consent (at the latest before any procedure related to this study 1199-0248 is performed), and if all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met, patients enter the trial on the same day as the EOT
Bvisit in 
the parent trial, INBUILD®.
Patients will be requested to stay in the trial for 96 weeks (until visit 12). At week 96, patients 
who can be treated with nintedanib outside the clinical trial will have their EOT visit. The remaining patients will continue in the trial until nintedanib can be made available to them outside the clinical trial. Treatment will be stopped if a reason for withdrawal is met (refer to section 3.3.4 ). 
In exceptional circumstances, when it is impossible to conduct study visits at the study site, 
study visits may be performed at the patient’s home or remotely (via telephone and/or 
internet based means of communication). The visit may also be performed as a hybrid of 
home and remote visit. All home/remote visits need to be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_456]’s trial team. Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country still apply. The trial team’s decision will be based on a thorough benefit-risk evaluation.
The procedures performed during a home/remote visit may be adjusted as compared to a 
regular visit, as detailed in Appendix 10.3.
If blood sampling for central lab at the trial site is not possible, safety lab analyses can be 
performed at a local lab. The results of the lab tests must be transferred to the investigator who ensures medical review and proper documentation in the eCRF. Minimum required safety lab parameters are AST, ALT, GGT, ALK and Total bilirubin.  For patients who have been in the trial for at least 36 weeks, the maximum interval between two lab measurements for these parameters is 16 weeks.  If the interval is more than 16 weeks, trial treatment should be interrupted (refer to section 4.2.1 ).  These measures relating to lab sampling were not 
possible early in the trial when frequent monitoring was mandatory.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
The investigations and assessments will be performed as outlined in the Flowchart and as
per the descriptions listed below.

Visit 1 will be conducted on the same day as EOT Bof the parent trial, INBUILD®so that 
there is no interruption of treatment. The trial will be explained to all patients who completed INBUILD
®(who didn’t discontinue treatment) and are willing to continue or start treatment 
with nintedanib.  This may be done prior to Visit 1, however no trial related procedure or data 
collection should be performed until the patient has signed the Informed Consent for the 
extension trial at Visit 1.  
Upon obtaining informed consent, the investigator will register the patient in the IRT system 
and the patient will receive a trial identification card.
Assessments conducted as part of EOT B of the INBUILD®trial do not need to be repeated for 
Visit 1 of this extension trial.  
If the patient has been determined eligible by [CONTACT_230829] (refer to 
section 3.3), medication will be assigned to the patient via the IRT system (refer to section
4.1.3 ).  First dose of nintedanib within INBUILD®-ON will be administered in the clinic at 
Visit 1. Data from the EOT Bassessments will be transferred to INBUILD®-ON as baseline 
data.  All AEs ongoing at the EOT Bvisit of INBUILD®will be recorded as baseline 
conditions in INBUILD®-ON.
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of treatment 
(Visits 2- 8).  After the first 48 weeks of treatment (Visit 8), complete clinic visits will be scheduled every [ADDRESS_278001] Week 96 (Visit 12) and thereafter until the patient’s end of trial.  
Intermediate lab tests (‘a’ visits) will be performed if needed at 18, 30 and 42 weeks (Visits 
5a, 6a and 7a) at the discretion of the investigator.  The laboratory samples taken at thesevisits and any samples taken for additional safety monitoring (see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 5.2.3 )
may be collected at the office of a local doctor using trial specific lab kits that will be sent to 
a central laboratory for analyses.  These kits will be provided to patients at study visits as applicable.
If possible, ECG should be performed prior to blood draw.  For detailed description of the trial procedures at each visit and dispensing schedule, please 
refer to section 5 and the Flowchart .
Dose Modification Visit
If the dose is reduced or increased (refer to section 4.1.3 ) patients may need to come to the 
investigational site for a dose modification visit where the following will be performed:

descriptive statistics will be used. Some limitations due to the nature of the extension trial should be considered when interpreting the data (bias in the selection of the population, no comparative arm). Further endpoints are considered as exploratory only.
This statistical paragraph deals with the analyses to be performed on the extension trial only. 
Although data of the parent trial will not be described in the scope of these analyses, they will be taken into account for adverse events analyses, as well as other evaluations.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
All analyses in this trial are descriptive and exploratory in nature. No formal statistical 
inferences are foreseen.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
All evaluations will be based on the treated set (TS), unless otherwise stated. The TS will 
consist of all patients who are documented to have received and taken at least one dose of open-label trial medication.
The definition of important protocol violations (IPV) will be specified in the trial statistical 
analysis plan (TSAP). These IPV defin itions will include consideration of important 
violations of entry criteria, treatment non-compliance, restricted medications and inadequate follow-up of hepatic events.
Patients will be analysed according to their randomised treatment group in the previous trial 
(INBUILD
®) and overall.
Values collected at Visit 1 will be considered as the baseline, for this extension trial.The main statistical analyses as described below will be performed based on all data collected 
during the on treatment period.

The primary objective of the study is to assess the tolerability and safety of nintedanib, so 
please refer to section 7.3.4 . Number of patients and % will be presented over the extension 
trial by [CONTACT_230830].
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
Not applicable.
7.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of [ADDRESS_278007] drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_195912] (MedDRA) at database lock.
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant 
abnormal values.

INITIAL MODIFIED or ADDED 
Face-to-face patient visit performed 
by a physician/under the responsibility of a physician on site.Remote or home visit performed by [CONTACT_230832]/under the responsibility of the 
investigational site physician to ensure the wellbeing of a patient and to collect at least: Adverse Events / 
Concomitant Treatments and Drug Interruption 
Regular on-site safety lab test using 
central lab kits:
∀Haematology, Biochemistry, 
Electrolytes, Coagulation, 
Urinalysis every 12 weeks; 
additional liver enzyme 
monitoring optional in between
∀Pregnancy every 4-6 weeks 
(possible at home)∀Under treatment with nintedanib, regular liver enzyme monitoring is required and needs to be ensured by [CONTACT_68569], but can be done at a local lab / local doctor.  The investigator has to ensure medical review 
and proper documentation in the eCRF.  Minimum required safety lab parameters are AST, ALT, GGT, ALK and Total bilirubin.
∀Urine pregnancy tests (for women of childbearing potential only) are regularly required and may be done at 
local lab / local doctor, or at home. 
∀For patients who have been in the trial for at least 36 weeks, the maximum interval between two lab 
measurements for these parameters is 16 weeks.  If the interval is more than 16 weeks, trial treatment should 
be interrupted.  These measures relating to lab sampling were not possible early in the trial when frequent monitoring was mandatory.  Decision whether to continue nintedanib treatment should be made based on an 
individual risk assessment for that individual patient and weigh up the benefits of an extended lab interval to 
maximum 16 weeks versus an interruption of treatment.
∀Medical decision has to be documented in patient’s source notes.
If remote patient visits and/or local liver enzyme monitoring cannot be performed, nintedanib treatment needs to 
be interrupted.
If liver function tests are out of the range, the per protocol rules apply => dose reductionIf the patient cannot come to site to receive new dose treatment and/ or patient safety and follow up safety lab 
testing cannot be guaranteed, treatment needs to be interrupted.
Dispensation of study treatment on site∀Site / depot to patient IMP shipments
∀Patients must consent to providing contact [CONTACT_230833][INVESTIGATOR_24069] 
∀Patients should retain all unused IMP and packaging, and return it when they are able to return to the site.

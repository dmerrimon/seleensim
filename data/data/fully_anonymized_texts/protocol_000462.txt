PRÉCIS 
Background : 
• Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002], 
claiming more than 40,000 lives each year . 
• Incidence nearly equals mortality with just 6% of participants living five years beyond 
their diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, but even patients 
with early stage disease have a long-term survival of less than 20%.  
• Cholangiocarci noma is a rare disease and just 3,[ADDRESS_1201434] of care treatment is less than 1 year.  
• Expression of mesothelin  (MSLN)  in pancr eatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has 
been examined in several published studies and ranges from 86 to 100%.  Similar 
incidence of expression has been observed in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.  
• In addition to pancreatobiliary tumors , many other  solid tumo r types also express 
MSLN such as  mesothelioma, colorectal, lung adenocarcinomas, epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], 
gastric and triple negative breast cancers, as well as some tumors of squamous cell 
origin.  
• LMB -[ADDRESS_1201435] been studied 
in previous Phase 1 clinical studies for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.  
• Results from these studies showed that almost all  patients formed anti -drug-antibodies 
(ADAs) that  neutralized subsequent injection of the product making it ineffective.  
• Tofacitinib is an oral Janus Kinase -1 and -3 (JAK) inhibitor approved by [CONTACT_861844].  
• Pre-clinical studies have shown that  tofacitinib can prevent the formation of ADAs 
against an immunotoxin closely related to LMB -100 
• Co-administration of tofacitinib with immunotoxin i ncrease d immunotoxin serum  half-
life in mice  and enhance d anti-tumor efficacy  
• This clinical trial will inves tigate whether co-administration of tofacitinib with  LMB -
100 can prevent  or delay  the formation of ADAs and thus allow patients to receive 
additional  effective cycles  of LMB -100. 
Objectives:  
• The primary objective of the dose escalation phase of this study  is to assess the safety 
and tolerability of LMB -100 given in combination with tofacitinib  to patients with 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other mesothelin -
positive solid tumors   
• The primary objective of the expansion p hase of this study is to determine whether co -
administration of tofacitinib delays formation of neutralizing anti -LMB -100 ADAs

through  cycle 2 of treatment (as measured by [CONTACT_195119] -100 serum drug levels)  in patients 
with pancreatobiliary cancers.  
Eligibility:  
• Age ≥ 18 years  
• Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy for which no curative therapy exists  
• Participants must have received at least one prior systemic treatment  regimen for their 
disease  OR be ineligible to receive available standard treatments for their disease  OR 
refused first -line standard systemic treatments  but have been treated with other anti -
cancer agents . 
Design:  
• This is a Phase I study which will accrue up to 45 subjects total, accounting for screen 
failure.  
• Participants  will be co-treated for [ADDRESS_1201436] 10 
days of each 21 day cycle , and LMB -100 given on days 4, 6 and 8. 
• A 3+3 dose escalation schema will be used . Two dose levels are planned. One minus 
dose level could be utilized if  dose de-escalation is necessary.   
• Following identification of an optimal dose and schedule, an expansion phase of [ADDRESS_1201437] pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
• Participant s on the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Arms who appear to be 
obtaining clinical benefit from LMB -100/tofacitinib after [ADDRESS_1201438] to receive addit ional cycles of therapy at the discretion of the PI .

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective s 
• For dose escalation cohort: To assess the safety and tolerability of LMB -100 with 
tofacitinib  in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma,  extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
and other mesothelin -positive solid tumors   
• For dose expansion cohort: To determine whether co -administration of t ofacitinib delays 
the formation of neutralizing anti -LMB -100 ADAs through  cycle 2 of treatment (as 
measured by [CONTACT_195119] -100 serum drug levels)  in patients with pancreatobiliary cancers.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objective s 
• For the dose escalation cohort: To determine whether co -administration of tofacitinib 
delays formation of neutralizing anti -LMB -100 ADAs through cycle 2 of treatment (as 
measured by [CONTACT_195119] -100 serum drug levels)  
• For the expansion cohort: To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination in 
patients with pancreatobiliary cancer  
• For both cohorts: To define the effect of  tofacitinib  on the pharmacokinetic characteristics 
of LMB -100  
• For both cohorts: To determine the percentage of patients who have delayed  formation of 
neutralizing anti -LMB -100 ADAs through cycle 3 of treatment (as measured by [CONTACT_195119] -100 
serum drug levels) when co -administered tofacitinib  
1.1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• To obtain preliminary assessment of activity including change in appropriate serum tumor 
markers with treatment,  objective response rate (ORR) , disease control rate after 3 cycles 
(~9 weeks) of treatment (DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  
• Evaluate association between anti -LMB -100 antibody titer and peak seru m drug level  
• To examine the relationship between MSLN expression and response to treatment   
• To evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment fo llowing treatment with LMB -100 
plus tofacitinib  
• To assess changes in circulating immune cell and cytokine levels  caused by [CONTACT_8235]  
• For treatment ex tension : To determine whether tofacitinib can continue to prevent ADA 
formation beyond 3 cycles of treatment regardless of whether patients had another 
intervening therapy or not .

five years beyond their diagnosis. Most patients  are diagnosed at an advanced stage, but even 
patients  with early stage disease have a long term survival of less than 20% .(1) Combination 
chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX provides the greatest survival advantage for patients  who have 
advanced disease, but the median overall survival (OS) for this regimen does not reach one year 
and m ost pancreatic cancer patients  are not fit enough to tolerate it .(2) Gemcitabine with NAB -
paclitaxel is an alternativ e regimen and extends median overall survival to 8.5 months from 6.7 
months with gemcitabine alone. The response rate (RR) to this regimen in the first -line is 23% 
with less than 1% of patients  achieving a complete response (CR) .(3) Prospective and retrospective 
cohort studies  have estimated a 17% RR to this regimen when given in second -line to good 
performance status patients following FOLFIRINOX .(4,5) Single agent gemcitabine remains the 
recommended treatment for patients  with poor performance status. Erlotinib is the only targeted 
therapy with efficacy against this disease and extends median OS by [CONTACT_3450] 10 days when 
added to gemcitabine at the e xpense of significant toxicity .(6) Median survival of patients  able to 
receive second line therapy is approximately 3 -6 months .(7) New paradigms for the effective 
treatment of pancreatic cancer are sorely needed.   
Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer type which  originates in the biliary tract. Extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma refers to biliary tract tumors that arise in the bile ducts outside the gallbladder 
and the liver parenchyma. For the purposes of this study, this includes patients with hilar and 
periampullary carcinoma. Approximately 3 ,000 cases of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are 
diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002] each year. (1) Patients with advanced disease are treated with 
combination chemotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin. The Phase III randomized ABC -02 
trial demonstrated a median OS of 11.7 months for patients treated with the c ombination as 
compared to 8.1 months for gemcitabine alone. The rate of tumor control (objective response and 
stable disease for 24 weeks) was 81.4% for the combination. (8) Based upon Phase II data, 
combination 5 -FU based chemotherapy r egimens may also be administered . Improved treatment 
options for this disease would be advantageous to patients.  
1.2.2 Mesothelin (MSLN) as a therapeutic target  
MSLN is a cell surface glycoprotein that is a differentiation antigen for mesothelial cells; 
expression in normal tissues is confined to the pleura, pericardium and peritoneum. The normal 
function of MSLN is unknown. Strong and frequent e xpression of MSLN has been noted in many 
solid tumors, but is especially notable in mesothel ioma, pancreatic, ovarian, lung and biliary tract 
malignancies as shown in Table 1 (adapted from (9)). MSLN expression is also associated with 
more aggressive disease in pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, lung, ovarian and breast 
cancers (10-14). In pancreatic cancer cell lines, overexpression of MSLN increases proliferation, 
motility  and invasion and decreases survival of mice bearing tumors grown from these cells (15). 
Similar effects have been seen with other tumor cell types (16-18). These properties make MSLN 
an attractive target for anti -neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and more than fi ve anti -MSLN agents are 
currently undergoing clinical testing.

1.2.3 Recombinant Immunotoxins (RITs) that target MSLN  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanism and structure of RITs  
RITs are antibody -based therapeutics that carry a toxin payload. RITs that target MSLN contain a 
genetically engineered va riant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) in which the native cell -binding 
domain of PE is replaced by [CONTACT_861845] -binding antibody fragment. In this way, the RIT binds 
specifically to MSLN on the cell surface and gets internalized through endocytic processes. In the 
cytosol, PE catalyzes an irreversible, inactivating modification of eukaryotic elongation Factor -2 
(eEF -2). This prevents the elongation step of protein synthesis halting production of new cellular 
proteins, a stressor that triggers apoptosis. This mec hanism of action results in cytotoxicity to both 
proliferating and non -dividing cells, therefore proper targeting is critical to the safety profile (19). 
SS1P was the first MSLN -targeted RIT tested in patients. Phase I studies established a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of 45 mcg/kg given every other day for three total doses per cycle. Dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) were pleuritis, an exp ected on -target off -tumor toxicity caused by [CONTACT_195120]1P -
induced inflammation of the normal pleura, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737] (CLS). Clinical trials 
have demonstrated that efficacy of SS1P is limited by [CONTACT_195121]. Anti -RIT neutralizing

antibodies (Nabs ) form after one cycle in ~90% of patients preventing effective drug exposure in 
subsequent cycles (20). When SS1P was administered with a lymphocyte -depleting conditioning 
regimen of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, this delayed the development of anti -RIT 
antibodies in most patients. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], three of ten patients with chemotherapy refractory 
mesothelioma achieved durable major responses with this regimen (21). These results provid e a 
proof of principle that RITs can have meaningful clinical efficacy in patients with advanced solid 
tumors.

1.2.4 Rationale for the d evelopment of LMB -100 
LMB -100 (previously R O6927005 and RG7787) i s a next generation anti -MSLN RIT developed 
in NCI’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in collaboration with [COMPANY_002]  (         Figure  1). The anti -
MSLN targeting region of LMB -[ADDRESS_1201442] 
models (22-25). The new PE contains modifications specifically designed to reduce 
immunogenicity of the molecule. This includes deletion of a [ADDRESS_1201443] antigenic T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] (26,27).  
1.2.5 Nonclinical Studies of LMB -100  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Nonclinical Pharmacology  
In vitro  LMB -100 inhibited viability of a variety of mesothelin -positive cancer cell lines at 
effective concentra tions typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 14 pM (~1 ng/mL). The cytotoxic potency of LMB -100 
varied between 0.35 ng/mL in primary mesothelioma cells (RH21) and 15.7 ng/mL in an adeno -

10 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
squamous lung carcinoma cell line (H596). Binding studies showed that while the Fab fragment  
did not bind to mouse or rat mesothelin, the binding affinities to cynomolgus and human 
mesothelin were identical. In agreement with this, LMB -100 induced apoptosis in mesothelin -
positive primary cynomolgus pericardial cells and significantly impaired via bility of HEK293 cells 
transfected with human mesothelin, but not of rat mesothelin transfected or un -transfected 
HEK293 cells. In addition, control experiments showed that free PE24 was 100−1000 fold less 
potent on mesothelin -positive target cell lines, c onfirming low cytotoxic potential of PE24 lacking 
a targeting moiety.  
Animal studies demonstrated that a single cycle of LMB -100 treatment given at an optimal dose 
of approximately 2 mg/kg, 3 × per week, every other day (QOD) achieved tumor regressions in  
subcutaneous xenografts of adeno -squamous lung carcinoma (H596) in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice. Three consecutive treatment cycles, given with 1 week 
breaks in between, led to massive shrinkage of large tumors with an average initial volume of 600 
mm3. Tumor regressions in monotherapy were also achieved when treating subcutaneous 
xenografts of mesothelioma (NCI -H226), gastric (MKN -28), and triple negative breast (HCC70) 
cancer cell lines in athymic nude mice. Highly synergistic  antitumor efficacy was observed in 
combination therapy with paclitaxel when treating subcutaneous xenografts of the recombinant 
high mesothelin expressing A431H9 cell line or the pancreatic cancer cell line KLM1. These 
results support evidence that LMB -100 may provide clinical benefit to participants with cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics in Animals  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LMB -100 were tested in cynomolgus monkeys following single IV 
administration at doses ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg. Two different enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent -based formats were used for analyzing plasma levels of LMB -100; free and total 
drug assay (where the total drug assay was the sum of free LMB -100 and LMB -100 complexed 
distribution at steady -state similar to the plasma volume ). Within the dose range tested, non -linear 
PK was observed for free drug with an extended half -life at higher doses (mean terminal half -life 
approximately 0.6 hours at 0.3 mg/kg compared to 0.3 hours at 0.03 mg/kg) suggesting saturation 
of MSLN -mediated clea rance pathways. Clearance of total drug was consistently lower than that 
for free drug implying the presence of soluble binding partners such as soluble mesothelin and 
ADAs. Induction of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) responses was frequently detectable in all  dose 
groups tested. Overall, given the limited predictive value of immunogenicity reactions in animals 
to human, a risk for immunogenicity in humans cannot be excluded. Toxicokinetics after repeated 
IV dosing in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated an increase  in total exposure in a dose 
proportional manner between 0.1 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg. No accumulation was observed over 5 
consecutive days of treatment or over two dosing cycles with 3 × per week dosing. Almost all 
monkeys developed ADAs upon treatment, while induction of high ADA levels impaired the 
exposure of free drug. In some cases, the induction of ADAs may have induced a slight increase 
in exposure  
The relationship between systemic drug exposure and anti -tumor activity of LMB -100 was 
investigated on hum an lung cancer NCI -H596 xenograft growth in female SCID beige mice. Free 
and total drug profiles were similar in mice. Modeling estimated a plasma concentration of 6800 
ng/mL (± 36%) to trigger a half maximal rate of tumor regression. Concentrations of LMB -100 
above this level resulted in potent tumor regression after dosing. Normalized for exposure, SS1P 
was found to be ~3 -fold more potent than LMB -100 in terms of tumor growth inhibition.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology and Safety Pharmacology  
The toxicological profile of LM B-100 was assessed after repeated intravenous administration to 
cynomolgus monkeys, the only relevant species, for a maximum of 5 daily doses for one week or 
2 cycles with QOD × 3 dosing, separated by a 9-day dosing free period. Four daily doses of 3 
mg/kg  exceeded the maximum tolerated dose with animals being found in moribund condition, 
indicated by [CONTACT_195126], hunched posture, ataxia, and tremors. There were no 
histopathological changes to account specifically for the deteriorating ph ysical condition of these 
animals.  Histopathological findings such as kidney tubular degeneration/regeneration and changes 
at serosal -lining tissues were observed at lower doses as well. In general, administration of LMB -
100 resulted in both on - and off -target toxicities.  
On-target effects were observed on serosal -lining tissues, consistent with high expression of 
mesothelin. Mesothelium hypertrophy accompanied by [CONTACT_861846]  ≥ 1 mg/kg. Mesothelium hypertrophy also 
occurred in heart (epi[INVESTIGATOR_120685]), spleen, and stomach. Off -target or non -specific toxicity included 
degeneration/regeneration of kidney tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_195090] ≥ 0.3 mg/kg. Local 
inflammatory findin gs at the injection sites were observed after administration of LMB -100 in 
several studies. Clinically, reddening of the skin, swelling, and skin being warm to touch or flaky 
injection sites were reported. In the 2 -cycle GLP study (3 intermittent doses ove r a 5-day period, 
9-days apart), impaired movement of animals from all dose groups was likely related to injection 
site findings and an overall inflammatory profile. One female at 1 mg/kg was sacrificed early on 
Day [ADDRESS_1201444] likely attributed to inflammatory changes at 
injection sites , resulting in moribundity of the animal. Clinically , inflammatory changes correlated 
with histopathological changes such as hemorrhages and/or acute inflammation at the injection 
sites and clinical pathology changes consistent with an overall inflammatory profile (increases in 
monocytes, neutrophils, CRP, and haptoglobin)  were observed . Microscopic changes reversed 
completely after the [ADDRESS_1201445] Non-Severely  
Toxic Dose  (HNSTD)  in this study was 0.3 mg/kg, which resulted in a mea n AUC for total drug 
of 16.0 mcg/ h/mL (study day 1, preliminary data). In a subsequent 1 cycle GLP study (QOD × 3 
dosing), markedly reduced injection site findings  were observed after administration of a batch 
with reduced levels of product related modifications of LMB -100. In this study, the HNSTD was 
1 mg/kg, resulting in an AUC for  total drug of 27.4 and 23.6 mcg/ h/mL after the first and third 
dose (preliminary d ata).  
The potential of LMB -[ADDRESS_1201446] dose of 1 mg/kg. No appreciable accumulation of pleural fluid was observed at necropsy.  
In vitro  evaluation of LMB -100 in human whole blood assay indicated a low risk for cytokine -
mediated infusion related reaction (IRR)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS) upon first 
administrations. LMB -[ADDRESS_1201447] concentrations of 0.5 mg/L.

1.2.6 Rationale for starting dose  of LMB -100:  
In prior Phase I study, the MTD of LMB -100 was determined to be 140 mcg/kg given as a 30 -
minute infusion every other day x3. For this combination study, we will decrease the d ose of LMB -
100 to 100 mcg/kg for initial combination testing . Rationale for limitation to 3 cycles of treatment 
for Dose Escalation (Arm 1) and Expansion (Arm 2)  
Infusion -related reaction (IRR) upon LMB -100 administration is associated with the presence o f 
ADAs. For participant safety, treatment will be limited to 3 cycles to lower risk of IRR if tofacitinib 
co-treatment is unsuccessful at limiting or delaying ADA development.  
1.2.7 Rationale for starting dose and schedule of tofacitinib  
Tofacitinib is FDA app roved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis at a dose of 10 mg (immediate 
release formulation) given orally twice daily on a continuous schedule. Tofacitinib will be given 
at the same dose on this protocol, which is the highest dosage approved by [CONTACT_861847]. 
For our purpose - diminishing ADA formation - we anticipate that immunosuppression by 
[CONTACT_861848] -100. Therefore , tofacitinib will not be given continuously. Instead, dosing will be limited to 
days [ADDRESS_1201448] administration of LMB -100 for 
the cycle while the drug is eliminated from the body. Intermittent dosing is anticipated to reduce 
the risk of infection caused by [CONTACT_6027] -mediated immune suppression and hypothetical risk of 
inhibiting anti -tumor immune response.  
1.2.8 Clinical testing of LMB -100 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Previous [COMPANY_002] study  
Initial clinical testing of LMB -[ADDRESS_1201449] in 
human trial (NCT 02317419). The primary objective of the Phase I study was to define the safety 
and tolerability (including the MTD) and pharmacokinetics of the drug in participants with MSLN -
expressing metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors for whom no standard thera py was 
available. Secondary objectives included determination of the RP2D and schedule, exploration of 
preliminary anti -tumor activity by [CONTACT_195130] (ORR) and disease control 
rate (DCR), and assessment of pharmacodynamic effects.  
A total of 15 participants were enrolled onto the study before termination. Median age of 
participants was 60.8 years and 53.3% were female. All participants had received prior anti -cancer 
therapy for their tumors. Enrolled participants had advanced mesothel ioma (7), ovarian cancer (3),

[IP_ADDRESS].1  LMB -100 Adverse Events  
Overall, 14 participants (93.3%) experienced at least one AE. The most common AEs were 
hypoalbuminemia (60.0%), fatigue (53.3%), peripheral edema (53.3%), nausea (46.7%), pyrexia 
(40.0%), decreased appetite (33.3%), dyspnea (33.3%), and myalgia (33.3%). SAEs included 
vascular leak syndrome, pyrexia, atrial flutter, infusion related reaction, arthritis, 
glomerulonephritis mi nimal lesion and dyspnea. No participants experienced an AE that led to 
withdrawal of study treatment. Four participants experienced a total of 8 infusion -related reactions 
that were independent of drug dose level. All of these AEs were non -serious and res olved within 
approximately 1 hour of onset. Pre -medication for infusion reaction was administered to these 
participants prior to subsequent doses of LMB -100. Two suspected Type III hypersensitivity 
reactions were observed. These consisted of arthritis (1) and rash with fever (1), both of which 
were fully reversible. When other AEs attributed to the study drug are presented by [CONTACT_271592], it becomes clear that toxicity was strongly associated with the 250 mcg/kg dose level at 
which DLT was reached (s ee Table 3 and Table 4) which are adapted from [COMPANY_002] Final Study 
Report, “Summary of Adverse Events Related to Study Medication, Safety -Evaluable Patients 
Protocol: BP29387”). Two of four patients treated at 250 mc g/kg experienced serious VLS which 
manifested with hypotension, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], serosal membrane reaction and 
hyponatremia as well as the hypoalbuminemia and edema that can be seen with mild VLS. Other 
symptoms associated with the DLT dose were fat igue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite and 
mild elevation of transaminases. In summary, safety and tolerability of LMB -100 were as 
expected.

[IP_ADDRESS].3  Comparison of toxicity and immunogenicity of LMB -100 to SS1P  
In the [COMPANY_002] Phase 1 trial, LMB -100 was safely administered to four patients at 170 mcg/kg 
without DLT. This is nearly four times the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SS1P. Most patients 
without pre-existing ADAs were able to achieve effective drug levels of LMB -100 for 2 cycles, 
unlike what has been seen previously with SS1P (see  Figure 3).

[IP_ADDRESS]  NCI trials of LMB -100 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Mesothelioma, short infusion  
Single agent LMB -100 has been  tested in two additional ongoing Phase I studies. A 30 -minute 
infusion given on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day cycle was given to 10 mesothelioma patients 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . At 170 mcg/kg, multiple patients experienced reversible acute kidney 
dysfunction which prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For this reason,  single agent MTD of 140 mcg/kg 
was established . Toxicities and peak drug levels were similar to the [COMPANY_002] study  (manuscript in 
preparation) .   
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Combination of LMB -100 with nab -paclitaxel  
The LMB -100 has also been tested in both mesothelioma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and pancreatic cancer 
patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  in combination with nab -paclitaxel. In mesothelioma patients, nab -
paclitaxel was given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8. MTD of LMB -100 w as found to be 
100 mcg/kg/day given over 30 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 21 -day cycle. In pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma patients, nab -paclitaxel was given at a dose of 125 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8. At 
100 mcg/kg, DLT of grade 3 myalgia was observed in 2/6 p atients. A reduced dose of 65 
mcg/kg/day was subsequently tested. DLT of grade 3 edema associated with vascular leak was 
observed in 1/6 evaluable patients making this the MTD of LMB -100 for the combination.  At the 
MTD, 1/ [ADDRESS_1201455] response  following the maximum 
2 cycles of treatment. Grade 4 vascular leak associated with ventricular dysfunction was observed 
in one patient and the study was closed to further accrual. ADA development is shown in Table

Since some pre-clinical studies suggested that duration of exposure to LMB -100 may be more 
important to anti -tumor activity than peak drug levels ( data not shown ), a new study was initiated 
to investigate the safety and efficacy of LMB -100 given in a long infusion fo rmat to patients with 
pancreatic cancer and other mesothelin -positive solid tumor malignancies ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . As of 
19 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201458] 2018, 15 participants were  enrolled on this study (12 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 1 
with ampullary cancer, 1 with pleural mesothelioma, 1 with rectal cancer).  For this study, patients 
received only two cycles of study drug by [CONTACT_8345]. Neither toxicity nor efficacy were observed in 
the 3 patients treated at the initial dose level of 65 mcg/kg/day given over [ADDRESS_1201459] ug, or due to presence of pre -existing 
anti-PE antibodies that acted as a drug sink in some patients. In subsequent dose levels, participants 
were treated with an initial 40 mcg/kg loading dose over 30 minutes prior to the start of the long 
infusion. Singl e agent MTD of 100 mcg/kg/day x48hrs preceded by 40 mcg/kg loading dose 
was established. DLT of grade 3 proteinuria was noted in 1/6 patients treated at this dose level. 
3/6 patients at this dose level developed non -dose-limiting VLS that included weight g ain >5kg, 
as well as hypotension (grade 2). The dose escalation was halted at this point to consider a more 
tolerable alternative schedule. Subsequently, a dose of 100 mcg/kg/day x24hrs preceded by 40 
mcg/kg loading dose given on days [ADDRESS_1201460] experienced IRR, 
suggesting that the long infusion reduces the incidence of t hese reactions . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1201461] demonstrated a s erum  half-life of 61 minutes  for LMB -
100 as compared to 466 minutes for SS1P (20). It is not kno wn what factors contribute to the 
longer half -life in circulation of SS1P.  In NCI -sponsored studies both with and without nab -
paclitaxel, C1 Cmax at 65 mcg/kg, 100 mcg/kg, 140 mcg/kg, and 170 mcg/kg were found to be 
similar to the values reported during th e original [COMPANY_002] Phase I study  (Figure 4).

1.2.9 Administration of tofacitinib  for the Prevention of Anti -Drug Antibodies (ADAs)  
The development of ADAs against LMB -[ADDRESS_1201462] all patients . The pentostatin + cyclophosph amide (P+C) 
conditioning regimen represents one clinically validated means to suppress anti -RIT antibody 
formation, but this strategy has some drawbacks. First, treatment with P+C  produces a numeric 
depletion of lymphocytes that frequently requires months to reverse. This renders patients 
ineligible for future immunotherapy trials and requires prolonged treatment with prophylactic 
antibiotics while lymphocyte populations recover. Secondly, nausea and renal dysfunction caused 
by P+C can reduce patient fitnes s to tolerate immunotoxin . Thirdly, ADA prevention by [CONTACT_3252] -
administration of P+C allows for administration of only one additional effective cycle in most 
patients (21). Therefore, consideration of other ADA -prevention strategies is warranted.  
Tofacitinib is an oral inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs) with  FDA approved indication s for the 
treatmen t of rheumatoid arthritis (28), psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis  (29). JAKs are non -
receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by [CONTACT_861851]. Activated 
JAKs phosphorylate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) transcription 
factors inducing STAT translocati on to the nucleus and initiation of new transcriptional programs. 
Tofacitinib binds and inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with nanomolar affinity resulting in 
suppression of lymphocyte signaling (30,31). This immunosuppression is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_861817]. The most common side effect 
of tofacitinib is increased risk of viral infection resulting higher incidences of rhinosinusitis and 
headache  and increased cholesterol, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_861818] 8 weeks of continuous treatment  
(28,29). 
Preclinical  data from the LMB immunotoxin group  has demonstrated that tofacitinib can prevent 
anti-SS1P antibody formation in mice repeatedly immunized with this immunotoxin  (32). 
Specifically, continuous administration of tofacitinib to immune -competent mice by [CONTACT_861852] (25 ug/h for 28 days) minimized  the development of ADAs to repeat immunization with 
SS1P  [Figure  5, copi[CONTACT_50587]  (32)]. These data support the hypothesis that  tofacitinib could 
suppress  development  of ADAs in patients treated with LMB -100, allowing patient to receive an 
increased number of effective cycles of iTox treatment.

Further studies in mice  demonstrated that co -adminis tration of tofacitinib increased  delivery of 
fluorescently -labeled immunotoxin to tumor cells ( Figure 7) and altered  immunotoxin 
pharmacokinetics to prolong serum half -life and increase immunotoxin  exposure ( Figure  8). The 
mechanism responsible for these changes is under investigation.

by [CONTACT_69506] -term administration of tofacitinib does not enhance tumor growth.

1.2.12  Tofacitinib may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and overall 
mortality  
Post-marketing studies examining long -term effects of chronic daily tofacitinib use in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and ulcerative colitis patients have suggested that hig her dose tofacitinib (10 mg, 
BID) may increase the risk of VTE. A study of 50,865 patients in the [LOCATION_002] observed a 
trend towards increased incidence of VTE in RA patients taking tofacitinib compared to those 
taking TNFα inhibitors that was not stat istically significant (33). A similar European study (still 
ongoing and not yet published) which included [ADDRESS_1201467] the use of tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis patients at increased risk for VTE, like 
cancer patients.  
Pancreatic cancer is a highly pro -thrombotic malignancy. Guidelines from AS CO (American 
Society of Clinical Oncology) and the International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer now 
recommend routine prophylaxis against VTE in all patients with pancreatic cancer receiving 
systemic therapy who have low risk of bleeding (34,35). Prophylactic antic oagulation may also be 
recommended to cancer patients with other histologies who are receiving systemic therapy if their 
Khorana score predicting risk for chemotherapy -associated VTE in the ambulatory setting is ≥ 2  
(See Table 7).

1.2.[ADDRESS_1201468] cycle . Tofacitinib 
is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of several autoimmune disorders . Based on the 
preclinical data on the combination of LMB -100 and tofacitinib described in Section 1.2.10 , we 
hypothesize that co -administration of tofacit inib with LMB -100 will prevent or delay the 
formation of high titer ADAs to LMB -100, such that more than 2 effective c ycles of immunotoxin 
can be administered to patients. The goal of this clinical trial is to  assess the  combination for  1) 
safety and tolerability and 2) immunogenicity . 
1.2.14  Rationale for use of mesothelin testing (NSR  device)  
To be eligible for treatment on study, participants  with tumor types other than pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and epi[INVESTIGATOR_861819] , defined as at least 2 0% 
of tumor cells expressing  mesothelin . Mesothelin expression testing is not FDA approved for this 
purpose; however, it is being used as an in-vitro  diagnostic device. According to 21 CFR 812.3(m), 
a significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety and welfare of a 
subject and meets the significant risk criteria listed in the table below along with the sponsor’s 
conclusions with regard to the applicability of these criteria to the current study. The device has 
been assessed by [CONTACT_861856] -significant risk per the below.

3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
Schema  
• This is a Phase I study which will accrue up to 45 participants .  
• Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for LMB -100 administration.   
• For the dose escalation phase, a  3+3 dose escalation will be used. T wo dose levels are 
planned. A minus dose level could be utilized if de -escalation is necessary.  
• Follo wing identification of an optimal dose and schedule, an expansion phase of [ADDRESS_1201484] pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
• Participants on the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Arms will be treated for a 
maximum of 3 cycles  with the exception described in the next bullet   
• Participants on the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Arms who appear to be deriving 
clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment beyond 3 cycles as indicated  in Section

• Toxicities and adverse events will be monitored continuously during treatment and for [ADDRESS_1201485] cycle 
of treatment (21 days) , the DLT evaluation period . Toxicities determined to be unequivocally 
related to disease progression or intercurrent illness will no t be regarded as DLTs.  The following 
will be considered DLTs:  
• Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes  
• Transaminitis that meets criteria for Hy’s Law: grade ≥[ADDRESS_1201486] or ALT with 
simultaneous elevation of total bil irubin to ≥ 2x ULN while alkaline phosphatase remains 
< 2x ULN.  
Hematological toxicities:  
• Grade 4  neutropenia (i.e. absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  <0.5 x 103 cells/ µL for a 
minimum duration of 7 days ) 
• Grade 3 and 4 febrile neutropenia (i.e. ANC < 1.0 x103 cells/ µL with a single temperature 
of >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one hour ; or life -
threatening consequences with urgent intervention indicated ) 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (≤25.0 x103 cells/ µL) 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associat ed with bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
• Grade 4 anemia  
Grade ≥ 3 non -hematological toxicity with the exception of:  
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting lasting <48 hours occurring in the absence of appropriate 
anti-emetic treatment  
• Grade 3 diarrhea lasting for ≤ 2 days with no fever or dehydration  
• Infusion -related reactions up to and including Grade 3 . IRRs are not considered to be 
DLTs since, based on experience with monoclonal antibodies, they are idiosyncratic and 
not dose -related events. Precautions will be taken if IRRs Grade ≥2 occur (see Section  
3.3).  
•  Asymptomatic grade [ADDRESS_1201487], GGT, bilirubin or alkaline 
phosphatase attributable to study drug that persists for less than 7 days  if not violating 
Hy’s Law . (Please note that all gra de 4 elevations in these parameters should be 
considered a DLT)  
•  Asymptomatic laboratory values (other than ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase or creatinine) of Grade 3 that are judged not clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275].  
•  Isolated  Grade 3 fever (without signs and/or symptoms of an infection)  
occurring within 48 hours after LMB -100 infusion and resolving within 48 hours to ≤ 
Grade 2 and fully resolved within  1 week .

3.1.3 Treatment Extension  
Participants who complete 3 cycles of therapy with LMB -100/tofacitinib and appear to be deriving 
clinical benefit as evidenced by [CONTACT_861859] (in patients with serum tumor marker that has historically fo llowed their disease trend) 
may continue to receive additional cycles of treatment at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_861823] , or PI’s decision to discontinue treatment. 
If a participant is offe red treatment extension  but refuses, he/she will be removed from protocol 
therapy. Participants offered treatment extension  may defer immediate treatment with study drugs 
to take a treatment holiday or to receive other intervening treatments (including investigati onal 
treatments). If a participant chooses to defer treatment extension  beyond [ADDRESS_1201493] a 
different intervening therapy, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_861824] -100/tofacitinib and will require w ashout periods and criteria consistent 
with those described in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] . Safety monitoring while receiving

regimen . 
3.2.1 Tofacitinib  
Tofaciti nib will be administered orally twice daily  on days 1 -10 of each cycle by [CONTACT_861860]. A diary  (see 
Appendix C - Patient Medication Diary ) will be kept to document dose , date  and time of day the 
drug was dosed. If a participant vomits after taking tofacitinib, then no action is required; the 
participant should simply take the next dose of tofacitinib as scheduled. If a participant omits/ 
skips a dose, the participant should take the dose as soon as possible and contact [CONTACT_861861].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  VTE prophylaxis for patients receiving tofacitinib  
VTE prophylaxis will be provided to all patients on stud y who are not already on treatment with 
appropriate anticoagulant (note that Vitamin K inhibitors are NOT considered appropriate therapy 
in this patient population) as per criteria below:  
Patients with Khorana Score < [ADDRESS_1201494] dose of tofacitinib for each cycle (Day 11 unless 
tofacitinib is discontinued early). Patients with contraindication  to enoxaparin (e.g. prior history 
of heparin -induced thrombocytopenia or inability to perform subcutaneous injection) may instead 
receive another regimen (see Table 10). 
Patients with Khorana Score ≥ 2 (including all pancreatic cancer and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma patients) will be initiated on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy throughout 
treatment (from Cycle [ADDRESS_1201495] dose of the study medications tofacitinib

emergency resuscitation facilities should be immediately available , and participant s should be 
under close supervision of the investigator or delegate at all times.  For this study, participants will 
be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for LMB -100 administration . 
The compatibility and stability of the active ingredient was t ested under simulated 
preparation/administration conditions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Instructions  
1. LMB -[ADDRESS_1201498] should be inspected visually for particulates prior to 
administration.  
2. Do not use the solution if there is particulate matter or if it is discolored.  
3. Do not shake or freeze the vial contents.  
4. Ensure the drug vial content is protected from lig ht during preparation and administration 
(ambient light conditions are acceptable but avoid exposure to direct sunlight).  
5. LMB -[ADDRESS_1201499] into 0.9% saline bags should be performed.  
8. Do not administer as IV push or bolus.  
9. Other drugs that require parenteral co -administration (if applicable) should be  delivered 
via separate infusion lines and at separate infusion sites and should not be mixed with the 
study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specific Instructions  
LMB -100 is diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP ( 0.9%  NaCl ) in-line immediately 
prior to administration (see Figure 10 below).  
The undiluted LMB -[ADDRESS_1201500] (DP) is administered by [CONTACT_861862] a 
disposable syringe and syringe driver pump. So as not to compromise drug product physico -
chemical  stability , dilution with 0.9%  NaCl will be done in-line, immediately prior to 
administration of the neat DP.  
In order to allow in-line dilution (1:10) immediately prior  to administration of neat drug product, 
a side flow with 0.9%  NaCl must be applied (as illustrated in  Figure 10).   
The pump used to administer 0.9%  NaCl  will be programmed at 9 -times the hourly rate of LMB -
100 in order to deliver LMB -100 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. An IV infusion pump and 
syringe driver should be used to control the infusion rate s for 0.9%  NaCl solution and LMB -100, 
respectively.   
LMB -100 is administered either peripherally or centrally t hrough a patient’s vascular access 
device. If there is no pre -existing central vascular access device and peripheral access is 
inadequate, a central access device will be installed.

Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201501] vials to a syringe a volume of LMB -100 appropriate for 
a patient’s dose PLUS 3 mL excess volume to prime  the extension tubing and filter set that 
will be attached to the syringe  (see step 3). 
3. Attach to the syringe (first) an extension tubing  set (e.g., medex REF MX448HL60) and 
(second) a filter set with pore size within the range of 0 .2- to 0.22 -μm (e.g., medex REF 
MX448HF). The syringe with extension set and filter set attached is “the syring e 
assembly”.  
4. Prime the syringe assembly tubing with LMB -100 from the syringe and cap it with a 
closing cone/stopper  (e.g., Spi[INVESTIGATOR_861826]® connector or comparable closed system 
transfer device cap) . 
5. The syringe assembly should be stored under refrigeratio n (2°– 8°C; 35.6° – 46.4°F)  until it 
is used.  
6. Chemical and physical in -use stability for LMB -[ADDRESS_1201502] in syringes has been 
demonstrated for 24 hours at 2° –8°C and 24 hours at ambient temperature (not >25°C; 77°F). 
The LMB -[ADDRESS_1201503] does not contain antimicrobial preservatives; LMB -100 solution 
will be transferred to syringes under appropriate aseptic conditions and should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately, total in -use storage times of prepared syringes for 
infusion should not exceed 24 hours when stored under refrigeration.  
7. Attach (spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]) the 0.9% NaCl container (bag) with an  administration set. Attach the distal 
end of the administration set to the most distal port on a [ADDRESS_1201504] stopcock (or two [ADDRESS_1201505] 
stopcocks connected end -to-end), and  prime the tubing and stopcock  with 0.9%  NaCl . 
8. Attach the stopcock to the patient’s vascular access device.  
9. Undiluted LMB -100 will be filtered  during administration  before it is diluted  in-line with 
0.9%  NaCl  (see Figure 10). Place the syringe containing LMB -100 in the pre -programmed 
syringe driver, remove any caps or closures  from the end of the syringe assembly and attach 
the syringe assembly tubing  to the stopcock/manifold at the port closest to a patient’s 
vascular access device . 
10. Start the pump driver for 0.9%  NaCl to establish line patency and unimpeded flow 
BEFORE starting to administer LMB -100 with the syringe pump.  
11. When 0.9%  NaCl flow is established, start the syringe pump to administer LMB -100. 
12. The end of infusion is defined as the time point at which the syringe driver finishes 
administering the total volume of LMB -100 to be infused.  
13. In case of any adverse events related to the infusion, please refer to the specif ic 
recommendation described in Section  3.3.1 .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring  
Vital signs (including, if possible, supi[INVESTIGATOR_861827], pulse rate, and 
temperature) must be monitored pre -infusion, every 15 minutes (± 5  minutes) until the end of the 
infusion, and at 30, 60 and 120  minutes (±1 5 minutes) from  the end of the infusion  (EOI) . Vital 
signs pre-infusion, EOI, and [ADDRESS_1201507] be captured in the eCRF. Other vital signs 
measurements  are not required to be captured in the eCRF unless ab normalities are observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Standard Pre -medication for Participants Receiving LMB -100 
Due to the prevalence of infusion related reac tions (IRRs) seen in previous stud ies of LMB -100, 
all patients will be pre -medicated prior to each LMB -100 administration wit h the following 
medications:  
o Diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg PO or IV  
o Ranitidine 1 50 mg PO  
o Acetaminophen 650 mg PO  
Dexamethasone 8 mg IV PRN  (when necessary)  should be physically available in the infusion unit 
in case of severe IRR during LMB -100 administration.   
Note: An alternative histamine H2 antagonist may be substituted for PO ranitidine  such as IV 
ranitidine or famotidine 20 mg PO or IV if the preferred pre -medication is unavailable.  
Pre-medication should be given 30 -60 mi nutes prior to LMB -100 infusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1201508] pre -mediation should  also receive:  
o Dexamethasone 8 mg IV , or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid as clinically 
indicated  
(See Section 3.3.1  for complete instructions on response  to IRRs)  
Participants who experienced an IRR of Grade 3 or 4 where dexamethasone or another steroid was 
pre-administered should not receive further LMB -100 and will be discontinued from study therapy.

Event  Action to Be Taken  
IRR/hypersensitivity  reaction  
during administration  of LMB -100  
 If an IRR/hypersensitivity develops, the infusion of LMB -100 
should be temporarily interrupted. The participant should be  
monitored until complete resolution of the symptoms and treated  as 
clinically indicated. Treatment or concomitant medication  may 
include IV saline, oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids,  and 
vasopressors depending on the symptoms.  
 
If the infusion is interrupted:  
• In the event of IRR CTCAE Grade1 , upon resolution of 
symptoms, the infusion will resume at the rate being used at  the 
time that the IRR occurred  
• In the event of IRR Grade 2 or 3, upon resolution of symptoms, 
the infusion will resume at one -half the  previous rate.  
• In the event of IRR CTC AE Grade 3 or Grade 4 (which may 
include pulmonary or cardiac events) or an  anaphylactic reaction, 
the infusion should not be restarted , and the participant should

5.1.3 Cytokines and circulating endothe lial cells (CECs) for identif ication  of a mechanism 
for PE -mediated capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737] (CLS)  
PE-based RITs cause dose -limiting CLS. At low doses CLS manifests as mild and transient weight 
gain, hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral or facial edema. At highe r doses it can cause life -
threatening cardiopulmonary compromise. Previous studies in rats have indicated that pathological 
changes indicative of CLS onset occur within just two hours of toxin administration and even when 
the PE fragment lacks a targeting domain (36). In vitro  studies with cultured endothelial cells have 
demonstrated that super -physiologic doses of PE -based RITs cannot induce endothelial cell 
toxicity unless the cells express the RIT target (37). Together these data suggest the hypothesis 
that PE-based RITs cause CLS by [CONTACT_861864] . To test this hypothesis, 
we will collect additional blood  from participants. Levels of a panel of cytokines known to affect 
the vasculature wi ll be assessed. Change in cytokine levels from baseline will be compared.

In addition, circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEP) and mature circulating endothelial cells 
(CEC) will be collected to assess endothelial cell dynamics  (see S ection 5.2 for specific time 
points).  These cells will be assessed by [CONTACT_83549]. Cells will be analyzed for 
forward and side scatter, and cells expressing hematopoietic markers will be excluded.  Endothelial 
cells will be identified using co -expression of markers, such as CD31 and CD146 for CEC, and 
CD31 and CD133 for CEP. The cell populations will also be analyzed for viability using scatter 
profiles and a vital stain, such as Hoechs t [ZIP_CODE]. Percentages of stained cells will be determined 
and compared with appro priate negative controls. Multi parameter flow cytometric analysis will be 
performed with a Miltenyi Quant equipped with FlowJo software, using a minimum of 100,000 
events per a nalysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specimen collection - cytokine analysis  
Plasma and serum  will be collected  from  participants  on the days and time  points shown in 
Sections  5.2.

Note:  Timed samples scheduled for EOI must be drawn within 5 minutes of this reference point. 
Those scheduled within 4hrs of EOI  should be collected within +/ - 20 minutes of indic ated time . 
5.3 SAMPLE  STORAGE,  TRACKING  AND  DISPOSITION  
Samples will be ordered in CRIS  and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  Samples 
will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required .  
5.3.1 Clinic al Pharmacology Program  
Upon arrival in the Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP), OCD, CCR, NCI, all samples are 
barcoded, with data entered and stored in Labmatrix , the system utilized by [CONTACT_195149]. This is a 
secure program, with access to the Labmatrix  system limited to defined CPP personnel, who are 
issued individual user accounts. Labmatrix  creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and 
sample box, which cannot be traced back to patients without Labmatrix  access. The data recorded 
for each sample include s the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle, time 
point, dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location. There are patient demographics that 
can be obtained to correlate with the samples through Labmatrix . For each sampl e, there are notes 
associated with processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, 
etc.) 
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20°C or -80°C 
according to stability requirements. These fr eezers are located onsite in the CPP and offsite at NCI 
Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Samples will be stored until requested 
by [CONTACT_271616]. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix . 
All rese archers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples 
must be returned to the CPP.  
Following completion of this study, sa mples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the 
rights to use the material.  
5.3.2 Leidos Biomedical, Inc. Lab  
Blood and tissue collected during the course  of this study will follow storage, handling and labeling 
procedures to ensure that security, confidentiality and sample integrity are maintained. All samples 
(blood or tissue) are tracked by [CONTACT_195150] a unique patient ide ntifier 
and date of specimen collection. Thus, samples will be de -identified of personal data, with access 
to personal data restricted to the study investigators.

All cryopreserved samples are tracked for freezer location and storage criteria. All Sample s are 
stored in a locked freezer at -70C according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located 
offsite at NCI -Frederick, at the Leidos Biomedical, Inc. Lab in Frederick, MD.  Samples will be 
stored until requested by a researcher named on the p rotocol.  All use and requests for use will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_477335], Inc. Lab.  Any unused samples must be returned.  
Some samples as indicated below may be stored in monitored freezers/refrigerators in the 
investigator’s laboratory at specifie d temperatures with alarm systems in place.  
At the termination of this protocol, samples will remain in storage as detailed above.  If additional 
studies are to be performed on any samples retaining patient identifiers, obtained during the 
conduct of this  trial, a Request to Conduct Research for Stored Human Samples Specimens, or 
Data Collected in a Terminated NCI -IRB Protocol will be submitted.  Otherwise, access to these 
samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, grant ing the rights 
to use the material. If specimens are to be discarded at any point, they will be disposed of in 
accordance with the environmental protection laws, regulations and guidelines of the Federal 
Government and the State of Maryland.  
If, at any tim e, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested) . The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_861833] 7.2. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1201534] 
be approved. SOPs ensure tha t any changes in informed consent made by a patient and relayed to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_271567]. All laboratory personnel will be trained to adhere to SOPs and will be monitored for 
high-quality performance.  
5.3.4 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described above. The 
study will remain open as long as sample or data analysis continues.  Samples from consenting 
subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or until a subject withdraws 
consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed. Once primary research 
objectives for the protocol are achieved , intramural researchers can request access to remaining

be per the requirements of Section 7.2. 
5.3.5 NCI Laboratory of Pathology  
Tissues designated for clinical diagnostics are transported to the Laborato ry of Pathology (LP) 
where they are examined grossly , and relevant portions are fixed, embedded in paraffin and 
sectioned and stained for diagnostic interpretation. Unutilized excess tissue that is not placed in 
paraffin blocks is stored in formalin for up to three months, in accordance with College of 
Ameri can Pathologists/Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 
(CAP/JCAHO) guidelines, and then discarded. Following completion of the diagnostic workup, 
the slides and tissue blocks are stored indefinitely in the LP’s clinical archives. Al l specimens are 
catalogued and retrieved utilizing the clinical laboratory information systems, in accordance with 
CAP/JCAHO regulations. The use of any stored specimens for research purposes is only allowed 
when the appropriate IRB approval has been obtai ned. In some cases, this approval has been 
obtained via the original protocol on which the patient was enrolled.

electronic system  (C3D and Labmatrix databases ) and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
data manager will assist with the data management efforts.  All data obtained during the conduct 
of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply 
with NIH security standards. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research 
data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.  
All adverse events , including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.   
Document AEs from the f irst study intervention, Study Day 1, through  the end of the treatment. 
After 30 days, only adverse events which are serious and related to the study intervention need to 
be recorded.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as  an AE only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or anothe r serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_52374]

• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken wit h respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS , FDA regulations , and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach  in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in Section 7.2.1 .

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every  6 weeks. In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained no less than 4 weeks 
following initial document ation of objective response.  
58 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) .(38) Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
For pleural mesothelioma, modified RECIST for MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma) (39) 
should be used as described in Section 6.3.9 .  
6.3.1 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as :  
• By [CONTACT_13190] x-ray: >20 mm ;  
• By [CONTACT_3610]:  
o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under : as >10 mm 
o Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the slice thickness   
• With  calipers on clinical exam:  >[ADDRESS_1201537] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be >[ADDRESS_1201538] scan (CT scan slice  thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or path ological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_29286], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are pre ferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseli ne.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case  that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
59 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to  
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
6.3.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the t reatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_764010] n(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed  using c alipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin les ions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  Howeve r, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI :  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1201539] sli ce thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, a nd temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is perf ormed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions s hould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and th e image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed 
with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined P ET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately

Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201540] introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound :  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independe nt review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], con firmation by [CONTACT_118582].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  Howeve r, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers al one cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and  
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published .(40-42)  In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_1201541] -line trials in ovarian cancer .(43) 
Cytology, Histology :  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and co mplete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treat ment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response as sessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identif ied according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
addit ional follow -up CT scans  are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of  
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosi s or 
scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described 
61 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201542] be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false posit ive CR 
due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
6.3.3 Response Criter ia 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum  of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseli ne sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Disease  (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in com plete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  
of exis ting non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase .     
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exce ptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Best Overall Response  
The best overall respon se is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will  depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

6.3.4 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recor ded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measur ed from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

6.3.6 Objective Response Rate  
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with partial response or

6.3.8 Overall Survival  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the length of time from start of treatment until death from any 
cause . 
6.3.9 Pleural Mesothelioma  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) lesions are difficult to measure reliably .(39) Therefore, 
modified criteria were defined in 2004 adjusting target lesion measurements to the specific needs 
of this disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Modified  RECIST Criteria for MPM  
Target lesion:  
Measurable at baseline and defined as tumor thickness measurements perpendicular to the chest 
wall or mediastinum in two positions at three separate levels on transverse cuts of CT scan. The 
sum of those [ADDRESS_1201544] 
criteria. All unidimensional measurements were added to obtain total tumor measurement.  
Evaluation of target lesions  
• Complete Response  (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions with no evidence of tumor 
elsewhere.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the total tumor measurement  
• Confirmed response (PR and CR): require a repeat scan at least 4 weeks apart  
• Progressive Diseas e (PD): At least a 20% increase in the total tumor measurement, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression ).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation  of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best res ponse recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration” .  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of com plete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to 
confirm the complete response status.

7.4 NIH  REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITO RING PLAN 
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet on a weekly  basis when patients are being actively treated on 
the trial to discuss ea ch patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable wi ll be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in Section 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1201549] or supervise the 
investigation and provide appropriate delegation of responsibilit ies to other members of the 
research staff.  
7.4.2 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
This protocol will protocol will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_861869] (SMC).  Initial review will occur as soon as possible after the annual NIH Intramural 
IRB continuing review date.  
Subsequently, each protocol will be reviewed every 6 months  as the quarterly meeting schedule 
permits or more frequently as may be requi red by [CONTACT_861870]

Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201550] of the clinical trial.  
Written outcome letters w ill be generated in response to the monitoring activities and submitted to 
the Principal investig ator and Clinical Director or Deputy Clinical Director, CCR, NCI.  
7.4.3 Independent Monitoring Committee  (IMC)  
The protocol will also have an Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC), consisting of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_861834], qualified investigators who are outside of the 
Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) branch and are not involved in the study. The committee 
will meet  after the first [ADDRESS_1201551] been treated and completed the DLT evaluation window. 
The IMC will review adverse events and other associated safety data  (this review may occur prior 
to the first annual continuing review date). The committee will be respon sible for deciding whe ther 
treatment  can proceed  under the current protocol, whether protocol modifications are required for 
study continuation, or whether the protocol should be closed to further accrual due to toxicity of 
the study agents. The IMC may be  convened for an ad hoc evaluation of protocol safety by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_861835].  
The minutes of the IMC m eetings will be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review, 
unless an issue arises that requires prompt reporting to the IRB  and then results will be submitted 
more expeditiously .

treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign  (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product (ICH E6 (R2).  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event (see  Section  8.1.3 ) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
68 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105] -medical re asons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138707]) is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o Emergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The reaso n for seeking 
medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medica l events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
8.1.3 Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places th e patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32) . 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1201553] assessed using the terms:  related or not 
related.   
• Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adve rse 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study product and the adverse event.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the eve nt.

Following the assessment of the SAE by [CONTACT_62554], o ther supporting documentation of the event may 
be requested by [CONTACT_138774].  
8.4 REPORTING PREGNANCY  
8.4.1 Maternal exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course o f the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor  no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it . The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when th e outcome of the Pregnancy become known,  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital  abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria ( see Section 8.1.2 ) should be reported as 
SAEs .  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and  documented.

Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201557] dose of study drugs . 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_1201558]  and the adverse event.  CCR will notify 
FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing 
drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious 
risks from clinical  trials or any other source, as soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_1201559] annually in a summary format.  
9 CLINICAL MONITORING   
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the  CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and h uman subjects protection. This is done through independent 
verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessm ent. 
The monitoring program also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR  contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_861871]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct .

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS  
10.1.1  Primary Endpoints   
The primary endpoint of the dose escalation  phase  is to identify the MTD and the desirable dose 
of LMB -100 with tofacitinib .  
The primary endpoint of the expansion phase is to  determine the number of participants that meet 
a threshold serum drug concentration during cycle 2  of treatment . The threshold drug level has 
been set at >600 ng/mL as measured at EOI for any LMB -[ADDRESS_1201560].  
10.1.2  Secondary  Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for both the dose expansion and dose escalation cohorts are the LMB -
100 peak serum level, half -life and AUC during cycle 1 , and the percentage  of participants with 
EOI LMB -100 serum drug concentration that meets threshold during cycle 3. For the dose 
escalation cohort , the percentage  of participants with EOI LMB -100 serum drug concentration that 
meets threshold during cycle 2 of treatment  will also be measured. For the dose expansion cohort, 
the number and description of adverse events by [CONTACT_861872].  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
The primary endpo ints of this trial are to 1) identify the MTD and the desirable dose of the 
tofacitinib  + LMB -100 combination format and 2) to determine whether the combination  result s 
in 80% of patients  achiev ing threshold drug levels during cycle 2 of LMB -100.  The MTD is 
defined as the maximum dose at which less than 33% of patients experience a DLT. Th e desirable 
dose will be selected from among the dose levels at or below the MTD. A lower dose than the 
MTD might be assessed in the expansion phase if chronic toxicity o f LMB -[ADDRESS_1201561] 3+3 design, if 0 of 3 or <[ADDRESS_1201562] a DLT, then dose escalation will proceed to dose level 2. Alternatively, if 2 or more 
patients in level 1 experience DLT, then dose will be de -escalated to dose level -1.  
Based on t wo dose levels, the theoretical maximum number of subjects that can enroll on  the dose 
escalation would be 12 (6 patients per lev el x2  dose levels).  
Following completion of the dose escalation, enrollment of an additional 15 patients with 
pancreatic cancer or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will be undertaken to better assess the a) 
safety  of the optimal dose in the target populati on, and b) ability of tofacitinib  to delay 
development of ADAs against LMB -100 and result in serum LMB -100 drug levels  reaching 
threshold  in cycle 2  and beyond . Participants on the dose escalation arm who are treated at MTD 
and meet eligibility requirement s for the dose expansion phase can be counted towards the 15 
patients needed to accrue to the expansion phase. We estimate that as many as 50% of patients 
72 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
who start treatment will develop progressive disease by [CONTACT_861873] 2 cycles and would 
therefore be uninformative for assessing the longer -term immunogenicity endpoint. Thus, 
additional patients may be needed to complete the evaluation of toxicity and possible efficacy at 
the escalating dose levels.  
This evaluation in 15 patients of either histology ( but at least [ADDRESS_1201563] pancreatic adenocarcinoma) will be undertaken using the following guidelines: The 
objective will be to determine if the fraction of patients who are able to achieve threshold  levels 
of LMB -100 in cycle 2 is consistent with 80% and greater than 50%. If 15 evaluable patients are 
enrolled, and if 11 or more patients meet threshold  drug levels in cycle 2, then the probability of 
this occurring is 5.9% if the true probability of ac hieving threshold  drug levels in cycle 2 were 
50% and the probability of this occurring is 83.6% if the true probability of achieving threshold 
drug levels in cycle 2 were 80%. Thus, the expansion phase would be considered to have a positive 
outcome if 11 or more of 15 patients in the expansion phase achieve  threshold  drug levels. In 
practice, after the trial has ended accrual, the fraction of  evaluable  patients assessed during the 
expansion phase that achieve  threshold  drug levels in cycle 2 will be determ ined and reported 
along with two -sided 80% and 95% confidence intervals to aid in interpretation of the results.  The 
fraction of patients who achieve  threshold  drug levels in cycle 3 will also be reported along with a 
95% confidence interval, but this may  be a small fraction and will be interpreted as being an 
exploratory evaluation.  
As an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], if after the first [ADDRESS_1201564]: 1) receive all doses of 
study dru gs, 2) be followed for study drug toxicity for at least [ADDRESS_1201565] PD before C2, 
but if more than 5 patients progress before C2, then no further patients will be accrued as soon as 
this can be determined.  
73

Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
10.3.2  Evaluable for objective response:  
Only those patients who have measurable  disease present at baseline, have received at least one 
cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (N ote: 
Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)  Responses or progressions noted in patients  receiving treatm ent ex tension  
will be recorded in the study database but will not be reported in the aggre gate objective response 
rate, which only corresponds to assessments taken prior to the start of a 4th cycle.  
10.3.3  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response:   
Patients who have lesions or tumor marker present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet 
the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had 
their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progress ion of the lesions  or increase 
in tumor marker .  
10.[ADDRESS_1201566] 
achieved threshold  drug levels in cycle 2 will be reported.  
10.4.2  Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
The DLTs among patients enrolled during the dose escalation phase will be determined and 
reported at each dose level.  
In the expansion phase, th e fraction  of evaluable patients who meet the endpoint drug level 
threshold in cycle 2 will be reported along with  two-sided 80% and 95% confidence intervals to 
aid in interpretation of the results.  
10.4.3  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The secondary endpoints are the number and description of adverse events by [CONTACT_861874] . For both dose escalation and expansion cohorts secondary endpoints include:  
the LMB -[ADDRESS_1201567] ug concentration during cycle 2 and 
cycle 3.  
10.4.4  Safety Analyses  
Safety will be evaluated during the dose escalation phase and will include reporting toxicities by 
[CONTACT_861875].  
74 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /20 
 
During the 15 -patient expansion cohort, the following rule will be used: Within the initial 6 
patients, no more than 1 patient in 6 is permitted to experience a DLT  attributable to study agents. 
After the initial 6 patients, safety will be monitored continuously per the following rule: if the 
cumulative fraction of patients enrolled who experience a DLT  attributable to study agents is 1/[ADDRESS_1201568] been treated, 0 of the 5 meet 
threshold  drug levels in cycle 2, then no further patients will be accrued since this is inconsistent 
with the goal of having 11 or more of 15 meeting threshold  drug levels. Accrual will not be halted 
while awaiting the determination of drug levels in cycle 2 based  on 5 patients; thus, additional 
patients may begin treatment while this determination is being made.  
10.4.7  Sub-Group Analyses  
In the expansion cohort, the fraction of patients meeting threshold  drug levels in cycle 2 will be 
analyzed as an exploratory endpoint according to pancreatic adenocarcinoma vs. extra -hepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma history.  
10.4.8  Tabulation of individual Participant Data  
None will be provided  
10.4.9  Exploratory Analyses  
The following are the intended exploratory analyses focusing on the patients in the ex pansion 
cohort:  
Disease control rate (DCR) at 9  weeks will be estimated along with a 95% confidence interval.  
PFS and OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method, along with 95% confidence intervals.  
Changes in appropriate tumor markers with treatment (if applicable to patient’s tumor type) will 
be determined and tested for change from baseline using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Titer of free 
anti-LMB -100 antibodies at the start of each cycle and following completion of treatment will be 
obtai ned and results reported descriptively ; the relationship of these values with peak serum drug 
levels of LMB -[ADDRESS_1201569] or Fisher’s exact test.  Changes in circulating 
endothelial cells following immunotoxin treatment, changes in serum cytokines following 
immunotoxin treatment, and changes in tumor microenv ironment following immunotoxin 
treatment will be reported descriptively, with statistical testing of changes as appropriate. Any 
statistical tests performed on the exploratory endpoints will have results presented without formal 
adjustment but interpreted in the context of the  number of tests performed.  In patients receiving  
treatment extension , the anti -drug antibodies and peak plasma LMB -100 drug levels will be 
obtained at each cycle after cycle 3 and reported with descriptive statistics. The lev els of these

Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201570] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861836]. There is an unmet need to identify impr oved and less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861837].  Given the overall poor prognosis of these patients , particularly after 
progression of tumor on or after initial treatment regimen(s) , the potential to directly benefit from 
treatment outweighs the  risks of participating in the study.  
All patients meeting the criteria listed in Section 2.1 are eligible for enrollment.  
11.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
There are no dosing or adverse event data currently available on the use of LMB -100 with 
tofacitinib  in patients <18 years of age; therefore, children are excluded from this study.  
11.[ADDRESS_1201571] benefit from 
research participation , all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes 
for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for 
Health Care and Medical Research Par ticipation” form so that another person can make decisions  
about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during 
the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_251684] (ACAT) for evaluation as needed for the following: an independent assessment of whether 
an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an 
appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capac ity to appoint a surrogate. 
For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre -determined substitute decision 
maker, the procedures described in NIH HRPP SOP 14E for appointing a surrogate decision maker 
for adult subjects who are (a) decisio nally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or 
durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks from Study Drugs  
Patient safety will be managed by [CONTACT_861876] y to exclude 
patients at risk from study treatment due to their pre -existing conditions. During the study, safety 
of patients will be proactively managed by [CONTACT_990] -mandated physical examinations, vital signs 
76 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201572] X -rays, ECGs, clinical labo ratory assessments, and collection of adverse events 
and their assessment.  
The risks of the study include those associated with study agent as discussed in Section  12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Collection  
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Image Guided Biopsy Collection  
The risks of the research biopsies collected at screening, at cycle 1 day 1 , and on day 3 of cycle 2  
include pain, bleeding and infection at the biopsy site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks of exposure to ionizing radiation  
This research involves up to 6 CT C/A/P scans, up to [ADDRESS_1201573] -guide biopsies  
per year . Subjects will be exposed to up to approximately 9.18 rem. This level of exposure is 
associated with an increased risk of cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MR Imaging  
MRI is a standard of care test for some patients with pancreatic  and cholangiocarcinoma . The risks 
of MR imaging  are relatively small.  
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings that administration of gadolinium 
(updated September 9, 2010), the MRI contrast imaging agent used in this protocol, has been 
associated with development of a disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) . The 
syndrome is rare (approximately 600 cases reported worldwide as of September 2010, out of 
several million administrations of gadolinium), but disabling and in some cases , fatal. All cases to 
date have occurred in patients with severe renal disease, including patients on dialysis. NSF has 
been nearly eradicated secondary to careful screening of renal function and avoiding use of 
gadolinium in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/ 1.[ADDRESS_1201574] agents at lower doses. This protocol excludes patients with renal insufficiency 
(eGFR < 50 ml/min). The FDA has issued warnings in [ADDRESS_1201575] not been reported 
to date. In accordance with the FDA Drug Safety Communication of 05/16/2018,  the Medication 
Guide for gadobutrol (or other macrocyclic gadolinium contrast agent if applicable) will be made 
available to all subjects with scans that will involve gadolinium -based contrast agent 
administration . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Central Line Insertion  
Patients without a mediport in whom peripheral access cannot be obtained can have a central line 
placed for treatment administration . The risks of this procedure include catheter contamination, 
pneumothorax, arrhythmia and air embolus. All care will be taken to minimize co mplications of 
central insertion during the procedure.  
11.4.[ADDRESS_1201576]  are in continuous n eed of 
improved therapy options, particularly patients with pancreatic and biliary adenocarcinomas, the 
77 
Abbreviated Title: LMB100 + tofacitinib in PDA  
Version Date: 08/19 /[ADDRESS_1201577] LMB -
100. Therefore, LMB -100 + tofacitinib  may improve clinical outcome of patients with mesotheli n-
expressing tumors . Several  clinically appropriate strategies to minimize risk to patients have been 
built into the protocol through the means of inclusion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, and 
management guidelines.  
11.5 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The informed consent document will be provided to the participant or consent designee(s) (e.g., 
legally authorized representative [LAR] if participant is an adult unable to consent) for review 
prior to consenting.  A designated study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests 
involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize 
potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be given, including an 
opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions 
of any designated study investigator. A  signed informed consent document will be obtained prior 
to entry onto the study.  
The initial consent process as well as re -consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms) per discre tion of the 
designated study investigator and with the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  
Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting 
investigators (and participant/consent designee, when in person ) will be located in a private area 
(e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee 
will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a 
more private setting if n eeded . 
12 PHARMACEUTICAL AND INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE INFORMATION   
12.1 LMB -100  (IND  # 123332 ) 
12.1.1  Source   
LMB -100 was transferred to the NIH CC Pharmacy by [CONTACT_721311] , the drug manufacturer.  
For this trial, the drug will be supplied by [CONTACT_148425].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanism of action  
LMB -100 is a novel  recombinant  anti-mesothelin  targeted  cytolytic fusion  protein (cFP)  
developed  for the treatment  of patients with  solid  tumor s that  express the  mesothelin  protein. 
Mesothelin is a  suitable candidate  for targeted  therapy due  to its very limited  expression in 
normal/non -malignant tissue  and its high  expression in several  tumor  entities including 
mesothelioma,  ovarian cancer,  pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.  
To target mesothelin,  a humanized  Fab fragment  of the anti-mesothelin antibody  SS1 is linked  to 
a truncated and de -immunized recombinant 24  kD fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin  (PE24 ). 
After binding  to mesothelin,  the complex is  internalized  by [CONTACT_861877] 2  (eEF2), leading  to arrest of protein synthesis and  secondarily  
triggering  cell death by [CONTACT_195159].

Exotoxin  A moiety and  one variable  light change  held together by a disulfide  bond.  
12.1.2  Toxicity   
Information  in this section  is based  on preclinical  studies  with LMB -100, and clinical  studies  of the 
cytolytic  fusion  protein  SS1-P. Participants  should  receive  a full dose of LMB -100 unless  a DLT  
and/or  a treatment  limiting  toxicity  is observed.  In case of DLT  and/or  treatment  limiting  toxicities,  
treatment  with LMB -100 will be stopped  until resolution  of toxicity  to NCI CTCAE  Grade   2 
hematological  toxicities  or Grade   1 non-hematological  toxicities.  A delay  of LMB -100 
administration  for up to two weeks  of the planned  schedule  will be acceptable  to allow  for 
resolution  of toxicity  to NCI CTCAE  Grade   2 hematological  toxicities  or Grade   1 non-

toxicities  or Grade   1 non-hematological  toxicities  and the participant  is unable  to resume  
treatment  with LMB -100 after this time,  no additional  doses  will be administered , and the 
participant  will be withdrawn  from  study  treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity  Including  Anaphylaxis  
LMB -100 administration  may cause  infusion -associated  symptoms  such as fever,  chills,  
hypotension,  shortness  of breath,  skin rash,  headache,  nausea,  and/or  vomiting.  Such  reactions  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_861838].  Participants  may also develop  IgE-mediated  
hypersensitivity  reactions  to LMB -100. IRRs  may be indistinguisha ble from  an anaphylactic  
reaction.  Participants  should  receive  full supportive  care to treat IRRs  or anaphylaxis  according  to 
institutional  practice.  If infusion -associated  signs  or symptoms  occur,  participants  should  be 
monitored  until complete  resolution.

to S ection s 1.2.8  and 3.3.1  for details ). Past experience  with monoclonal  antibodies  that 
demonstrated  a risk in the whole  blood  assay  has shown  that this risk could  be effectively  managed  
in the clinic  with appropriate  risk-minimization  measures.  The release  of pro-inflammatory  
cytokines  is believed  to be partially  responsible  for the occurrence  of IRRs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk of Immunogenicity  and Potential Safety  Impact  
LMB -[ADDRESS_1201579]  led to the development  of neutralizing  ADAs  in 75% and 88% of participants  
after 1 cycle  of therapy,  in the IV bolus  and continuous  infusion  trials  respectively .(20)  
Participants  will be monitored  at regular  intervals  for the development  of ADAs  and cytokines.  In 
particular,  any clinical  signs  and symptoms  suggestive  of a hypersensitivity  reaction  and/or  an 
immune  complex -mediated  reaction  possibly  due to ADA  formation  will be carefully  investigated.

symptomatic  treatments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk of Renal Toxicity  
LMB -100 administration  may cause  renal  toxicity  characterized  by [CONTACT_195157],  BUN,  and 
proteinuria.  In preclinical  cynomolgus  monkey  studies,  LMB -100 has shown  increases  in 
creatinine  and histological  changes  including  regenerative  and degenerative  changes  to the tubular  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  Hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  has been  reported  for other  cytolytic  fusion  antibodies  in 
development.  
Participants  should  be monitored  with renal  laboratory  assessments  including  creatinine,  BUN,  and 
urinalysis.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk of Cardiac Toxicity  
There may be a risk for cardiac immune -related adverse events, specifically  myocarditis , as a rare 
but serio us complication after treatment with LMB -100. During clinical trial 19C0128, a patient 
with history of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arising out of primary sclerosing cholangitis, 
initiated C1 tofacitinib + api[INVESTIGATOR_861840] 1 and LMB -100 on Day 4. The patient began 
experiencing fatigue and pleuritic pain symptoms on Day 5. A cardiac MRI was performed that 
suggested a component of inflammatory myocarditis in addition to capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Injection Site Reactions  
LMB -100 administration  may cause adverse  reactions  at the infusion  site characterized  by [CONTACT_77368],  
swelling,  induration,  and nodules.  In preclinical  NHP  studies  for both SS1P  and LMB -100 
reddening  and swelling  of the infusion  site were  noted.  Participants  who develop  symptoms  of 
infusion  site reactions  can be administered  pain relieving  medication  (analgesic)  as required,  and 
rotation  of infusion  sites is recommended.

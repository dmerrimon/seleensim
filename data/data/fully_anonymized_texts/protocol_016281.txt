Objectives:   The primary objective of the study is as follows:  
• To determine if TD -9855 has an acute  (Part s A and B)  and sustained (Part C) pressor 
response and  improves symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in subjects with nOH due to 
MSA, PAF , or Parkinson’s disease.  
The secondary objective(s) of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with nOH. 
• To evaluate the PK  and PD  (NE and DH PG) of TD -9855 after single and  multiple doses 
in subjects with nOH.  
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, 3 part, single -blind  (Part A) , double- blind (Part B), and 
open- label multiple dose extension (Part C)  study  of TD -[ADDRESS_567098] the option to receive open- label TD -9855 b y tablet daily for up to 
  
Study P
rocedures:  
Part A – Dose Escalation 
On Da y -2 of Part A, e ligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center ( CRC) , 
where they will remain during the entire dose escalation period.  On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of placebo in a single -blind manner  (ie, subject  remai ns blinded) .  This 
will be followed by [CONTACT_446017] -blind dose escalations, beginning with of TD -[ADDRESS_567099] s will receive a single escalating dose of TD -9855

• A determination from the Investigator (in collaboration with the Sponsor) that 
administration of the subsequent dose may pose a safety co ncern  
• SBP ≥ 180 mm or DBP ≥ 110 mm in the sitting position replicated 2 more times over 
an hour  
• Intolerable  side effects  as determined by [CONTACT_737]  
• Received maximum dose of study medication specified by [CONTACT_446018], no further dose escalation will be 
performed .  However, based on the daily evaluation of tolerability, the Investigator 
(in collaboration with the Sponsor), may decide to not escalate the dose, but rather 
re-administer the previous dose from the prior day.  Once the decision has been made to 
not escalate the dose, the subject may remain at the current dose through Day  [ADDRESS_567101]  based on 
Investigator determination (in collaboration with the Sponsor) , or who discontinue study drug 
prior to reaching the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] , should have disch arge procedures completed, but will 
not continue to study Part C. 
Washout Period 
Following the completion of Part A, eligible subjects will be discharged from the CRC and 
undergo a washout period (   On a daily basis during  the first [ADDRESS_567102]’s health status.  Any adverse events report ed by [CONTACT_446019].  Under the direction of the 
Investigator , subjects will manage  their nOH symptoms using  fludrocortisone  as prescribed.  
Part B – Randomized , Double- blind, Parallel Design 
Beginning with Amendment 2 of this protocol, Part B of the study has been discontinued.  
Refer to prior versions of this protocol for specific details regarding Part B.  
Part C – Open Label Extension  
In Part C , subjects who demonstrate a pressor effect in Part A , who complete Part  A and 
remain otherwise eligible will have the option to participate in Part C and receive open- label 
TD-[ADDRESS_567103] tolerated 
dose level (rounded- up to the nearest 1  mg) administered during Part  A for that subject (or a 
lower dose at the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_445986]). Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 2, and continue at the same 
dose level as Day [ADDRESS_567104]’s dose level at their discretion, if in their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_445987], and can tolerate, a higher dose level. After Day 29, 
dose increases will need to be discussed with the Sponsor.  It is recommended that the subject receives at least 7 daily doses of TD -9855 at any single dose level before escalation 
to a highe r dose to allow  TD-9855 exposure to reach steady state  at the lower  dose .

event s suggesting intolerability , the dose can be  withheld for 3 days and resumed at a dose 
level 50% (rounded up to the nearest 1  mg) of the prior dose level.  If supi[INVESTIGATOR_445988], dosing in that subject 
should be discontinued and appropriate alternative  therapy and care provided to the subject 
as determined by [CONTACT_458].  
In Part C, s ubjects  will enter the research center on Day -2 and remain resident in the 
research facility  to undergo safety, PD, PK and diseases assessments  through  the morning 
of Day 2 of Part C, after which they will be discharged home.  Subjects w ill return on an 
outpatient basis and undergo safety, PK /PD and disease assessments as described in the 
schedul e of assessments . In addition, telephone assessments  for safety and disease 
assessment will be performed  on a weekly ( during Month 1) and monthly basis (Months 
2 through 5) where no clinic visit is scheduled.   In such a case that the dose is reduced, the 
subject should be scheduled for a clinic visit to occur within  approximately  2 week s of the 
dose reduction. Following completion of the  dosi
ng period, or in the case of early 
disconti
nuation from the study , subjects will return 2 and 4 weeks after the final dose for 
follow -up visit s to undergo safety, PK /PD and diseases assessments  and end of study 
procedures . In cases where the subject is unable to return to the clinic due to significant 
physical or geographic limitations, or at the Investigator’s disc retion, a nurse may be sent to 
the subject’s home and the study visit procedures performed in the subject’s home, except 
for the day [ADDRESS_567106] be done within the research center . 
Adverse ev
ents will be assessed throughout the study  duration in each Part  and will be 
recorded in the case report form when reported.  
Study procedures  are further described in Table 1  for Part A and Table 2  for Part C and in 
Section  6. 
Duration of Study  Participation:    
The duration of study involvement for each subject will be up to approximately 36 days for 
Part A (including up to 30 days for screening) , and 169 days for Part C .

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Possible risks to subjects participating in this study include adverse events associated with 
other SNRIs, such as nausea, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, syncope, seizures, constipation, hyponatremia, hyperhidrosis, 
urinary retention, and decrease appetite. 
Furthermore, subjects may experience adverse effects as a result of study procedures, such 
as repeated blood sampling and associated procedures.  
To help ensure subject safety, subjects will be closely monitored during this study.  The 
study will be conducted in the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Centers (CTSAs) of the respective participating institutions comprising the Autonomic Disorders Consortium whenever possible. When a CTSA is not available, study visits will be conducted in the 
Investigator’s autonomic disorders clinic or appropriately  qualified research facility.  The 
schedule of procedures conducted during the open- label out -patient extension requires 
subjects to return to the clinic on a regular basis during the dosing and follow up periods and participate in telephone based evaluations on a weekly basis.  If subjects are unable to 
return to the clinic as indicated by [CONTACT_446024], home visits will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_990] -trained nurses.  If any participant should incur any unexpected and untoward 
event during the testing procedure, the emergency caregivers (cardiologists, anesthesiologists, social workers, and psychologists) would become available on an immediate basis to provide necessary emergent management.  
A summary of known and potential risks to human subjects is provided in the IB in the Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  2 OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of  the study is as follows:  
• To determine if TD -9855 has an acute  (Part s A and B) and sustained (Part C)  
pressor response and improves symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in subjects  with 
nOH due to MSA, PAF , or Parkinson’s disease.   
The secondary objective(s) of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with nOH. 
• To evaluate the PK and PD (NE and DHPG) of TD -9855 after single and multiple 
doses in subjects with nOH.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  3.2 Rationale for  Study Design  
This study is designed to evaluate the  acute  (Part A and B) and sustained (Part C)  efficacy 
and safety of TD -[ADDRESS_567143] s with 
nOH.  The study should provide important information between BP, orthostatic symptom 
relief and the potential correlation with changes in NE and dihydroxyphenylglycol ( DHPG ) 
release. The information to be learned could be useful in optimizing diagnosis and clinical management.   Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study treatment period 
via laboratory measurements (eg, hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and monitoring of AEs. 
3.3 Selection of Doses and Regimen  
This study  aims to evaluate the effects of single and multiple doses of TD- 9855 on systolic 
blood pressure, symptoms associated with nOH, safety, and tolerability.  The current doses of TD 9855 for this trial were chosen using pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynami c 
(PD) modeling to achieve a range of NET inhibition and to determine a minimum dose required to yield an increase in sitting systolic blood pressure.  An ascending dose design was chosen in Part A to allow the subjects to start at a low dose because of the intrinsic hyper adrenergic responsiveness in these patients. The maximum dose levels (  single dose or  multiple doses QD) were selected to provide maximal steady state NET 
inhibition in all subjects despi[INVESTIGATOR_366162] -individual PK variability.  A single dose of  and 
multiple doses QD of  are below  or equal to  doses examined and tolerated in single 
and multiple dose studies in healthy volunteers  respectively . The maximum dose in Part C 
 QD) is equal to the well -tolerated  dose tha t was studied in two Phase 2 trials 
in patients with ADHD and FM where  was administered over 6 to 8 weeks.  
3.4 Study Endpoints  
3.4.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
For Part  A, the primary study endpoint is the change from time-matched placebo in seated 
systolic blood pressure at 6 to 8 hours after drug administration. For Part C, the primary 
endpoint is the improvement from baseline in the Likert scale “dizziness, lightheadedness, 
feeling faint, or feeling like you might black out” (OHSA, question 1) at week 4. 
 

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 30  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  The secondary endpoints for Part A include:  
• Improvement in the Likert scale for “dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or 
feeling like you might black out” (OHSA, question 1). 
• The composite OHSA score.  
• Change from time-matched placebo in standi ng SBP  
• Change from time-matched placebo in seated SBP (area under the curve for 
0-12 hours following drug administration).  
• Duration of standing during the orthostatic standing test 
The secondary endpoints for Part C include: 
• The composite OHSA and OHDAS s core.  
• Change from time-matched placebo in standing SBP  
• Change from time-matched placebo in seated SBP (area under the curve for 
0-12 hours following drug administration).  
• Duration of standing during the orthostatic standing test 
3.4.2 Safety Endpoints 
For all Parts of the study, safety and tolerability assessments will include adverse events, 
laboratory abnormalities, ECGs, and vital sign measurements including supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204]. Exploratory PK and PD assessments will also be made in all parts of the study as 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
3.5 Minimization of Bias  
Bias will be minimized through the use of randomization and blinding.  
3.5.1 Blinding  
In Part A, study subjects will be blinded to dose levels and escalation. Pre-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_446000].   For Part B , which has been discontinued, refer to 
previous versions of this protocol.  Part C will be an open- label extension study and therefore 
blinding considerations are not applicable. 
3.5.2 Treatment Assignment  
Subjects in Part A will begin by [CONTACT_446026] a single- blind manner (ie, subject  
remains blinded). This will be followed by [CONTACT_446027], beginning with  of 
TD-9855 on Day 2. On each subsequent day, subjects will receive a single escalating dose 
of TD -9855  until Day 5 or until reaching the preset stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_446001] 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 31  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  (Section 5.2). However, based on the daily evaluation of tolerability, the Investigator 
(in collaboration with the Sponsor), may decide to not escalate the dose, but rather 
re-administer the previous dose from the prior day.  Once the decision has been made to 
not escalate the dose, the subject should remain at the current  dose  through Day  5 of 
dosing.  
The dose level administered on Day 1 in Part C will be equal to 50% of the  highest tolerated 
dose level (rounded up to the nearest 1 mg) administered during Part A for that subject (or a 
lower dose at the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_445986]). Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day [ADDRESS_567144]’s dose level  at their discretion,  if in their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_445987], and can tolerate, a higher dose level.  After Day 29, 
dose increases will need to be discussed with the Sponsor.  It is recommended that the

in the footnote, where applicable.   Further information related to each study procedure type 
are described in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_567161] study drug administration is designated as Day 1; subsequent 
calendar days are Days 2, 3, etc.  Note that each parts of the study (Parts A and C) has 
their own unique numbering of calendar days.  
Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific 
procedures. After providing full informed consent, subjects will undergo a medical screen to determine their eligibility for participation based on the criteria outlined in this protocol. Part C, which is an optional long -term extension study will require subjects to si gn a 
separate informed consent form from that in Part A.  
The site should make every effort to perform procedures at the scheduled times, and the actual time should be recorded in the source documents and on the case report forms.   
Acceptable deviations fr om the timing of assessments are as follows:  
• Day 8 through Day 29: ± 3 days  
• Day 57 through Day 169: ± 7 days  
Additional safety tests, such as vital signs (BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature), physical exams, ECGs, and laboratory safety tests, may be obtained during 
the course of the study on the basis of newly available data to ensure appropriate safety 
monitoring.   
In Part C, i n cases where the subject is unable to return to the clinic for a clinic visit for 
reasons due to significant physical or geographic limitations, or at the Investigator’s 
discretion, a protocol -trained nurse may be sent to the subject’s home and the study visit

Section 7.[ADDRESS_567183] a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)  product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal (investigational)  product.  
7.2 Adverse Event Definition for the Purposes of This Study 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs will be defined as follows:  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who has signed an informed consent form and is participating in a clinical investigation. An AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, whether or not considered related to the study drug (investigational product ). 
Pre-existing events that increase in frequency or severity or change in nature during or as a 
consequence of participation  in clinical studies will also be considered as adverse events . 
An AE may also include pre- or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of a 
protocol -mandated procedure (such as a biopsy).  
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory  abnormality with an onset date prior 
to the time the subject signed the informed consent form is considered to be preexisting and should be documented in the medical history CRF, if applicable for the study . 
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  

Protocol 0145,  Version 1.0, 08NOV2017  
TD-9855 Page 50  
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  An AE does not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event  
• Preexisting diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an informed consent form that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277022]/or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms, unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
7.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_446039], including 
the dates of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action 
taken with study medication.  
Clinical severity should be recorded and graded using  mild, moderate or severe as 
described below.  
Mild = Aware ness  of sign s or symptom s, but easily tolerated  
Moderate = Discomfort sufficient  to cause interference with usual activities  
Severe = Incapacitati on with inability to work or perform usual activities  
The relationship to study drug therapy should be assessed using the following definitions:  
• Not Related:   Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the 
study drug (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
• Possibly/Probably Related:  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset 
and administration of the study drug. It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_446011] . In case 
of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon 
rechallenge . It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should no t be considered 
as causally related in the context of adverse event reporting.  
These criteria in addition to good clinical judgment should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment . If it is felt that the event is not related to study drug 
therapy, then an alternative explanation should be provided.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.4 Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other 
serious events)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such events are as follows : 
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events 
• Death is an outcome of an adverse event and not an adverse event in itself . In reports of 
death due to disease progression, where no other information is provided, the death will 
be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the 
study drug(s).  
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs while the subject is participating in the study.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the time of the event ; dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily before  the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  
• “Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had 
occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176] . If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325], for any length of time . This may or may not be overnight . It does not 
include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
• The Investigator  should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms , and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  7.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (such as clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (such as electrocardiograms [ECGs], X -rays, or vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and/or symptoms  or are considered clinically significant in the 
judgment of the Investigator must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if  they meet the definition of 
an adverse event or serious adverse event, as described in Sections  7.[ADDRESS_567184] signs an informed consent form  through the follow -up 
visit (or at the time a subject is determined to be ineligible for the study or who does  not 
enroll in the study), regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the Sponsor  within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event . To report an SAE, complete and fax 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the following:

For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, 
and other documents when requested. Additional information may be requested from the 
Investigator to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
An SAE may qualify for reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is possibly attributable 
to the study drug and is unexpected/unlisted based on the current  Investigator’s Brochure . 
In this case, all Investigators will receive notification of the event . The Investigator  is 
responsible f or notify ing the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee and 
documenting the notification, as required by [CONTACT_98215].

Patient Instructions:  
 
We are interested in measuring the symptoms that occur because of your problem with low bl ood 
pressure (orthostatic hypotension) and the degree that those symptoms may interfere with your daily activity.  It is important that we measure the symptoms that are due ONLY to your low blood pressure, and not something else (like diabetes or Parkinson’s disease). Many people know which of their 
symptoms are due to low blood pressure.  Some people who have recently developed problems with 
low blood pressure may not easily distinguish symptoms of low blood pressure from symptoms caused by [CONTACT_145037].  In general, symptoms of your low blood pressure problem will appear either upon standing or after you have been standing for some time, and will usually improve if you sit down or lie down.  Some patients even have symptoms when they are sitting which might improve after laying down. Some people have symptoms that improve only after sitting or lying down for quite 
some time.

Patient Instructions:  
 
We are interested in measuring the symptoms that occur because of your problem with low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) and the degree that those symptoms may interfere with your 
daily activity.  It is important that we measure the symptoms that are due ONLY to your low blood 
pressure, and not something else (like diabetes or Parkinson’s disease). Many people know which of their symptoms are due to low blood pressure.  Some people who have recently developed problems with low blood pressure may not easily distinguish symptoms of low blood pressure from symptoms caused by [CONTACT_145037].  In general, symptoms of your low blood pressure problem will appear either upon standing or after you have been standing for some time, and will usually 
improve if you sit down or lie down.  Some patients even have symptoms when they are sitting 
which might improve after laying down. Some people have symptoms that improve only after sitting or lying down for quite some time.  
 
Please answer the questions on the following pages keepi[INVESTIGATOR_446016].

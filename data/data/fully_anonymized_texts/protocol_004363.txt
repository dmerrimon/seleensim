 The purpose of the study is to determine if opi[INVESTIGATOR_905796].  
 We hypothesize that patients are frequently prescribed more 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_905797], resulting in excess 
medications that are at risk for misuse, diversion and contribution 
to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1271570] of quality patient care. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_905798], with the 
[LOCATION_002] writing over 250 million prescriptions for painkillers per year [1]. 
Increased usage has led to unintended negative consequences for individuals and 
society. It is estimated that 46 people die each day from an overdose of 
prescription painkillers, and individual use can lead to the development of 
tolerance and worse treatment o utcomes [1, 2]. Further issues arise when opi[INVESTIGATOR_905799], it is estimated that n ontherapeutic use has increased three fold in 
recent years [3]. In the [LOCATION_002] alone in [ADDRESS_1271571] of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_79521] $53.4 billion, of which $[ADDRESS_1271572] productivity, $8.[ADDRESS_1271573] and the remainder drug 
abuse treatment and medical complications [4]. The federal government has 
recognized this epi[INVESTIGATOR_79522] a call for clinicians to more responsibly 
prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_323528] [5]. 
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_79524], from 2000 -2010 the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905800] 11.3% to 19.6% whereas there was no 
change in the prescribing of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_79526]. Further, when 
specifically looking at new musculoskeletal pain visits, one half resulted in 
pharm acologic treatment, with the prescribing of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_905801] 38%  to 29% from 2000 to 2010, respectively [6]. The clinical use 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79528] -operative pain control has also been linked to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_79529] [7]. Legitimate opi[INVESTIGATOR_905802] a 33% increased risk  of future misuse 
after high school [8]. 
 
It has been estimated that orthopedic surgeons prescribe 7.7% of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_905803] [9].Special attention needs to be paid to the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905804], 
there is considerable variability amo ng surgeon and procedure in regards to the 
amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905805] [10].An analysis of 250 patients undergoing outpatient upper extremity 
surgery found that on average patients consumed 10 opi[INVESTIGATOR_79534], with 19 pi[INVESTIGATOR_905806] a total of 4,639 pi[INVESTIGATOR_79536] [10]. Leftover 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_905807][11]. Further studies are needed to quantify the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905808]:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 5 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  for specific orthopedic procedures to limit excess narcotic use, misuse, diversion 
and contribution to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].

7.0 Study Timelines  
This study will be observational in nature. Patient will fill out a 
preoperative questionnaire related to specific risk factors for opi[INVESTIGATOR_896876]/abuse. Following their operation a phone call will be placed  at [ADDRESS_1271574] -
surgery.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 6 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/[ADDRESS_1271575] collected 
data for 60 patients for each  arm in order to sufficiently power the subsequent 
analysis  as a level 1 prospective study . 
 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
This study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_905809] -
inferiority in opi[INVESTIGATOR_905810].  
 
Eligible patients will be identified in clinic by [CONTACT_136446]. Patients will subsequently be approached by [CONTACT_905816]. In the event that a patient determines that they wish to pursue 
surgery and this is discussed by [CONTACT_905817].  
 
All patients will fill out a preoperative questionnaire asking them the 
questions below related to specific risk factors for opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]/abuse.  
 
 Age 
 Sex 
 BMI  
 Do you actively smoke cigarettes?  
 If no, have you ever consistently smoked cigarettes (daily for > 1 month)?  
 What is your employment status?  
 Is this injury part of a workers ’ compensation claim?  
 Are you actively participating in organized sporting activities? If so, at 
what level (i .e. professional, college, recreational) ? 
 Are you currently using narcotic pain medications?  
 Do you have a personal history  of substance abuse  (ex. prescription or 
illicit drugs, alcohol) ? 
 Do you have a family history of substance a buse (ex. prescription or illicit 
drugs, alcohol) ? 
 What is the highest level of education you attained?  
 What is your average yearly household income?  
 
Additionally, the patients undergoing knee arthroscopy will be 
randomized into two groups prior to surger y by [CONTACT_16133].  The 
surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the 
appropriate medications.  
 
 Group 1:  Will have all of their post -operative prescriptions sent 
down to the pharmacy on the day of surgery to be collected.  
 Group 2:  Will have all prescriptions sent to pharmacy with the 
exception of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_544604]. Instead, they will be handed a 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 7 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  physical paper prescription. They will be instructed to only fill the 
prescription if absolutely needed.  
 
The patients under going ACL reconstruction surgery will be randomized 
into two groups prior to surgery by [CONTACT_16133]. The surgeons’ 
physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the appropriate 
medications.  
 Group 1:  Will be prescribed [ADDRESS_1271576] -operative pain medication regimens.  
 Group 2:  Will be prescribed [ADDRESS_1271577] -operative pain medication regimens.  
 
In order to limit potential variability in sample size, block randomiz ation 
will be utilized with the following parameters: 18 blocks with 5 patients in 
each block. The blocks will be as follows  (Block #/#/#) : 
 
Block (1/7/13 ) 
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block  (2/8/14 ) 
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block  (3/9/15 )

Block  (4/10/16 )

Block  (5/11/17 ) 
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Block  (6/12/18 ) 
[ADDRESS_1271578] a block number. Once a block is 
selected patients will be enrolled in the order listed in the block. For 
example, if block 6 is selected initially Patient 1 will be enrolled in Group 
2, Patient  2 will be enrolled in group 2, Patient 3 will be enrolled in group 
1, etc. After every 5th patient is randomized to a group a new block will be 
randomly selected.  
 
The surgeons’ physician assistants will be responsible for prescribing the 
appropriate med ications.  To clarify, we do not electronically prescribe C2 
medications as a routine part of practice and do not intend to as part of the 
study . 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction RCT study  
 Page 8 of 14 Version Date: 01/29/2020  All patients will be provided the same counseling regardless of the amount 
of narcotics they are prescribed. In the event that a patient requires 
additional narcotics on top of the original prescription the treating surgeon 
will need to be notified in order to accurately a ssess the amount already 
consumed and appropriately prescribe additional medications.  
 
Please note that there is considerable variability in opi[INVESTIGATOR_905811]. Patient's that undergo ACL reconstruction typi[INVESTIGATOR_905812] [ADDRESS_1271579] that the majority of patients prescribed 
60 tablets do not take greater than 50% of what they are prescribed. We 
are interested in determining the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905813] d if the amount prescribed affects the total amount 
consumed.  
 
Following their operation, all patients will have Pain -Numeric Pain 
Rating Scale (NPRS) assessed at [ADDRESS_1271580]-anesthesia care unit (PACU) .  
 
Additionally, a phone call will be placed at 24 hours, 48 hours and 
between 7 -14 days after surgery and asked  a Numeric Pain Rating Score 
(NPRS) , how many opi[INVESTIGATOR_905814], how many are left 
over and when the date they stopped taking them.  
NPRS scores can be performed verbally. The following statement will be 
provided to patients:  
The 11 -point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme 
(e.g. “no pain”) to '10' repre senting the other pain extreme (e.g. “pain as 
bad as you can imagine” or “worst pain imaginable”), please rate your 
pain on a scale of 0 -10. 
If they are still taking pain medications at that point, an additional follow -
up call will be placed at 21 days  (+1-3 days)  after surgery asking the same 
questions.  We will allow 4 total phone calls (24 hours, 48 hours, 7 -14 
days, and 21 (+ 1 to 3) days post -surgery. If patients continue to take 
narcotics 21 days after surgery they will be listed as >3 weeks of narcoti c 
use) 
 
Refill requests will also be recorded.  
 
Maximum total length of the study will be [ADDRESS_1271581] -surgery.

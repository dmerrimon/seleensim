Low -Dose Tamoxifen  to Reduce High Background Parenchymal Uptake on 
Molecular Breast Imaging  
 
Protocol version: 3 Revision date: September 13, [ADDRESS_1120657]  
Approximately 40 -50% of women presenting for screening mammography have 
mammographically dense breasts, a factor that severely limits sensitivity of the test. 
Molecular breast imaging (MBI) is one option offered for supplemental  screening of dense 
breasts. As MBI is a functional imaging technique that relies on differences in preferential uptake of Tc -99m sestamibi in metabolically -active cells, it is able to reveal cancers hidden 
among dense fibroglandular tissue on a mammogram. Performing MBI after a negative mammogram in women with dense breasts detects an additional 7.[ADDRESS_1120658] cancers per 1000 women screened [1 -3].  
 MBI is a nuclear medicine test that uses a high -resolution, semiconductor -based gamma 
camera to image the uptake of a radiotracer , typi[INVESTIGATOR_810222] -99m sestamibi,  in the breast.  
Mayo Clinic investigators have pi[INVESTIGATOR_810223] a low -
radiation -dose MBI  protocol  for clinical use  [4, 5] . Recently, MBI has been implemented 
across  the multi- site Mayo Clinic practice.  
 
1.2 Background Parenchymal Uptake (BPU) on M BI  
In addition to detecting breast cancer, MBI also depi[INVESTIGATOR_810224] -99m sestamibi 
uptake in non- cancerous fibroglandular tissue, termed background parenchymal uptake 
(BPU). BPU is subjectively assessed according to a validated lexicon as one of fo ur 
categories (photopenic, minimal to mild, moderate, and marked) that describe the relative intensity of uptake in fibroglandular tissue [6]. A quantitative measure of BPU is also 
currently under development by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hruska’s team (R21 CA197752). BPU varies among 
women with similar -levels of mammographic density and is associated with hormonal 
factors such as menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy  (Fig. 1) [7] . 
Importantly, we recently  showed BPU  associated with breast cancer risk; women with 
moderate or marked BPU have 3.4 to 4.8- fold increased risk compared to women with 
photopenic or minimal -mild BPU  [8].  
 The exact mechanism of uptake of Tc -99m sestamibi in breast tissue is not entirely 
understood, but has been correlated with blood flow, tissue viability, mitochondrial 
activity, and mitotic activity in breast cancers. In an  effort to understand histological 
characteristics that may account for variability in BPU, a nalysis has been performed on 
core biopsy specimens from [ADDRESS_1120659] one of the extreme BPU categories of either photopenic BPU (N = 28) or marked BPU (N 
= 20) on MBI (unpublished data). BPU was associated wit h differences in tissue 
composition: specimens with marked BPU comprised a higher proportion of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] 
(22% vs. 2.8%, p<0.0001) and a lower proportion of stroma (47% vs. 75%, p = 0.005).  
  BPU was inversely correlated with lobular involution status and associated with Ki -67 
positivity (8.6% positive in marked BPU vs. 2.6% positive in photopenic BPU, p = 0.006). These associations with histologic features further support a relationship between BPU and breast cancer risk.  
 We hypothesize that BPU is positioned to serve as a functional imaging biomarker to identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at greatest  breast cancer  risk and 
most likely to benefit from tailored  screening or preventive options. However, more study 
is needed to understand BPU as a marker of risk. I t is yet unclear how BPU changes over 
the course of a woman’s lifetime and whether these changes are related to changes in breast cancer risk.  Further, it is unknown whether chemo preventive options such as tamoxifen 
would decrease BPU  and whether these changes could serve as a surrogate marker  for 
decrease in risk .

1.3 Low -dose Tamoxifen  
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks the effects of 
estrogen on breast tissue. T amoxifen is FDA -approved as a chemopreventive option for 
both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that preventive 
tamoxifen, when taken daily for five years, can reduce risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_810225]- third. Results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project 
showed that in women considered at increased risk for breast cancer , preventive tamoxifen 
reduced breast cancer risk by [CONTACT_278260]- half [9]. However, a t the standard clinical 
dose of 20 mg  per day , tamoxifen can produce  side effects such as menopausal  symptoms, 
and also carries  a small risk (<1% of participants) of serious  adverse events , including  
uterine cancer and  blood clots in legs or lungs. Concerns about the  risk of these advers e 
events account s for overall low utilization  of tamoxifen  for chemoprevention. In patients 
who do start tamoxifen, side effects of the drug can lead to non- compliance with long -term 
use.  
 
Because of these concerns, multiple investigations have been done to determine efficacy of  
tamoxifen at lower doses. Tamoxifen taken at [ADDRESS_1120661] disease (including mammographic density), and reduced breast cancer risk while potentially mitigating  the 
adverse events and side effects seen at the 20 mg/day dose [10- 12]. Other studies  have 
evaluated efficacy of tamoxifen at 10 mg/day [13- 15]. In one study conducted among  
women being treated for  breast  cancer , tamoxifen at 10 mg per day over a short period of 
14 days resulted in clinically and statistically meaningful declines in molecular markers of estrogen recep tor positivity, progesterone receptor positivity and Ki -67 (a marker of 
cellular proliferation) [15] . 
 
1.4 Study Purpose  
In this study, we aim to determine whether short -term intervention with low -dose 
tamoxifen can induce a decline in BPU. Results from this study will provide critical knowledge on factors that influence changes in BPU and inform future study of BPU as a modifiable risk factor.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
To assess changes in background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on MBI before and after low -
dose tamoxifen intervention (5 mg per day for 30 days  or 10 mg per day for 30 days ), 
among women with a history of high BPU. It is hypothesized that both subjective  
categorical  and quantitative measures of BPU will decline with  low-dose tamoxifen 
intervention. 
 
[ADDRESS_1120662] performed at Mayo Clinic. In this study, women with high 
BPU on MBI will be invited to  participate in a short -term intervention of low -dose 
tamoxif en (5 mg per day for 30 days  or 10 mg per day for 30 days ). MBI will be repeated 
at the end of the intervention. Change in BPU before and after the intervention will be 
assessed with both subjective and quantitative measures.  
 
[ADDRESS_1120663] previously had an MBI showing high BPU.

5 STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Schedule of Evaluations  
Potential participants will be screened for eligibility  and undergo informed written consent 
with the study coordinator at the time of enrollment. At Study Visit 1, the participant will be asked to complete a study questionnaire and undergo MBI (after a negative pregnancy 
test as necessary).  Participants will then  undergo [ADDRESS_1120666] with an automated machine. If a participant has 
blood pressure over 140/90, she will not proceed with the st udy. 
5.[ADDRESS_1120667] imaging (MBI)  
MBI testing will be performed at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster within the Division of Breast 
Imaging and Intervention. MBI  procedures will be done as per clinical standard of care 
(described below).  
5.4.1 Equipment – MBI examinations will be performed on an FDA -approved dual -head gamma 
camera system comprised of cadmium zinc telluride detectors and collimation optimized for low -dose breast imaging (LumaGem, Gamma Medica, Salem, NH).

Check -in phone call s at day [ADDRESS_1120670] feeding prior to injection of Tc -99m sestamibi.  
MBI examinations will be  performed with a dispensed dose of 8 mCi (300 MBq) Tc -99m 
sestamibi (range 7.2 – 8.8 mCi). A nuclear m edicine technologist will deliver an 
intravenous injection of the Tc -99m sestamibi dose in an antecubital vein of either arm. 
Flushing of the syringe with saline and use of syringes that provide low sestamibi adhesion is recommended to minimize residual ac tivity.  
Infiltration, or extravasation of the injected dose into the soft tissue rarely occurs (~1 -2% 
of studies). If infiltration is suspected, the technologist will observe the count rate obtained on a persistence view prior to beginning imaging. If the  count rate is lower than typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 
(defined as less than 0.2 kcts/minute in the craniocaudal [CC]  view and less than 0.3 
kCts/minute in the mediolateral oblique [MLO]  view for an average -sized breast) the 
technologist will image the injection site to evalua te.  
If there is no evidence of infiltration on imaging of the injection site, the technologist will proceed with the breast images.  If infiltration is confirmed by [CONTACT_810234], the technologist will ask for the patient’s consent to proceed with a second injection of [ADDRESS_1120671]. Placement of pi[INVESTIGATOR_810227]’s back is recommended to reduce motion and increase comfort.

5.5 MBI  Interpretation  
MBI interpretation will be performed by [CONTACT_810236]. The radiologists will 
subjectively assess BPU  on a 5- category scale as 1 – photopenic, 2 – minimal, 3 – mild, 4 
– moderate, or 5 – marked . Changes in BPU between pre -tamoxifen and post -tamoxifen 
MBI  will be assessed, with blinding to the order of the studies .  
 The interpreting study radiologist will issue a report in the patient’s  medical record to state 
that the MBI was performed for research purposes under IRB #[ADDRESS_1120674] of care  
[17].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1120675] tamoxifen tablets (available in either 10 mg or 20 mg doses) and over -encapsulation to arrive at 5 mg tablets.  
Participant instructions for the tamoxifen medication will be as follows: 
• Take one capsule per day for 30 days  
• Take each dose at approximately the same time each day  
• Capsules should be taken with water or a non- alcoholic beverage. Capsules can be 
taken with or without food. 
• If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it 
is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular 
dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a mis sed one.  
Participants will also be given a “Drug Diary” log and asked to make notes of when each dose is taken and  to record any symptoms experienced . Participants will be asked to return 
Drug Diary logs and pi[INVESTIGATOR_810228] 2. Any  remaining  pi[INVESTIGATOR_810229]. 
 Participants will be  advised that they may elect to stop the tamoxifen medication at any 
time, should they experience unwanted side effects . Patients will be asked to contact [CONTACT_810237]. Patients who start tamoxifen  but choose to stop earlier than 
[ADDRESS_1120676] (Study Visit 2) at that 
time.

6.2 Tc-99m sestamibi  
Tc-99m sestamibi is an FDA- approved drug with an excellent safety profile. This drug has 
been safely used in clinical practice for over 30 years. Very rarely, patients receiving sestamibi experience mild symptoms such as flushing, a rash, or a brief metallic taste after injectio n. 
6.3 Radiation  
The radiation dose from a total administered dose of 8 mCi Tc -99m sestamibi has an  
effective (whole -body)  dose of ~2.[ADDRESS_1120679] that 
about 5% of study part icipants will have an abnormality found on the MBI test. Finding an 
abnormality on the study testing can be emotionally distressing  to participants . Participants 
with concerning findings on MBI will  be recommended to return for additional diagnostic 
workup, as per routine clinical standard of care . Participants will be informed that a ny 
additional testing beyond the MBI test is  not part of this research study and financial costs 
will need to be covered by [CONTACT_810238].  
6.[ADDRESS_1120680] 20 mg dose tamoxifen, vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and vaginal discharge are the most likely side effects.  However,  in studie s of 
women taking low -dose (5 mg  or 10 mg ) tamoxifen, hot flashes and vaginal discharge were 
not increased compared to women taking placebo.   Among women taking 20 mg tamoxifen for 5 years , there is a small increased risk of 
uterine cancer, abnormal blood clots, or vision changes. Other less serious side effects 
reported  from 20 mg tamoxifen treatment include changes in menstrual cycle ( among 
premenopausal women) , weight gain, depression, insomnia, and urinary incontinence. 
These side effects are not expected to occur for short -term, low -dose tamoxifen used in this 
study.  
 Tamoxifen can cause birth defects. Participants who can become pregnant will undergo a 
pregnancy test prior to MBI, which must be negative. Participants will be instructed to avoid pregna ncy during the study and for at least [ADDRESS_1120681] serious side effects to occur with 5 mg tamoxifen over a 30 -day 
period, patients will be advised to stop taking tamoxifen medication immediately if any of the following should occur:  
• vision problems  
• loss of appetite  
• yellowing of skin or eyes  
• unusual bruising or bleeding 
• fever  
• blisters  
• rash 
• swelling of eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, hands, arms, feet, ankles, or lower legs  
• thirst 
• muscle weakness  
• restlessness  
• vaginal bleeding or spott ing

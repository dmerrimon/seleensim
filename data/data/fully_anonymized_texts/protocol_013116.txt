CONFIDENTIAL1 Introduction
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to 
US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International 
Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures. 
1.[ADDRESS_389121] allowed sphincter 
preserving surgery to be offered to a greater proportion of patients and therefore avoid permanent 
ostomies.  However, temporary ostomies are often used as part of sphincter preserving surgery to 
minimize the consequences of a complication at a downstream anastomosis, and subsequently closed 
when clinically appropriate.  Eventual restoration of intestinal continuity and closure of the ostomy puts 
patients at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a hernia at that site – a complication that occurs in approximately one third 
of patients1-5.  What is not known is whether the strategies used to treat other types of abdominal wall 
hernias will be applicable in this situation due to its unique circumstances.  There is a critical need to 
develop an intervention to reduce the incidence of hernia formation at the site of previous ostomies as 
these hernias at minimum reduce quality of life through chronic pain and disfigurement and at worst may 
require emergency surgery for intestinal obstruction.  Without an improvement in technique, it is likely 
additional patients will experience this complication as the colorectal cancer survivor cohort grows.   
Incisional hernias are common occurrence with an incidence ranging from 10 to 58%. 1,6  Risk 
factors include obesity, malnutrition, immunosuppression, connective tissue disorders, and previous 
abdominal surgery.7-11 While some of these risk factors (like smoking) may be modifiable, others (such as 
the level of wound contamination) are not.[ADDRESS_389122] bulky tumors.13  
Open procedures are unlikely to be entirely replaced by [CONTACT_316119] a significant clinical burden both for the patient and the clinician.  
One such incisional hernia is particularly challenging: the hernia at the site of a prior intestinal 
ostomy.1,3,4,6,14,[ADDRESS_389123] common ostomy used for temporary intestinal diversion for colon and rectal 
cancer is the diverting loop ileostomy (herein referred to as ileostomy), which is an ostomy fashioned from 
the terminal segment of the small intestine. An ileostomy is used to protect a downstream anastomosis 
while patients heal or undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, and is preferred over colostomies due to the 
comparative ease of construction, ease of reversal, and a low rate of complications.  They may be closed 
at a later time, as dictated by [CONTACT_102]’s underlying disease process, restoring intestinal continuity.  
Hernias at the site of previous stoma placement are poorly understood, but are estimated to occur in up 
to a third of patients.1-[ADDRESS_389124] but for the purposes of diversion of the fecal stream rather than as the result of a congenital 
condition or iatrogenic process in a previous surgical site.  Primary repair of fascial defects, as is 
commonly performed for closure of ileostomy, is not well supported in the literature for repair of abdominal 
wall hernias because of an unacceptably high recurrence rate, reported at up to 43%.[ADDRESS_389125] been used in these situations, 
with the prevailing theory being that biologics are more resistant to infection.21,22 More recent data 
suggesting that sublay placement of a macroporous mesh of lightweight permanent or bioabsorbable 
SCAR Trial Page 3
Version: I
CONFIDENTIALsynthetic materials are relatively resistant to chronic infection challenge this notion, perhaps indicating the 
design and plane of implantation rather than material of the mesh are most important.22-[ADDRESS_389126] categories classify mesh 
placement: onlay, underlay, and sublay.  Onlay is positioning of a mesh over a closed fascial incision in 
the subcutaneous space. Underlay is positioned within the peritoneal cavity beneath the closed fascial 
incision.  The sublay (retro-rectus) position is within the muscular layers of the abdominal wall where 
fascial planes are closed on both sides of the mesh (Figure 1). Multiple reports have indicated 
intraperitoneal placement of mesh is associated with a higher recurrence rate compared to sublay or 
onlay techniques, with the sublay associated with the most favorable long term outcomes.30-[ADDRESS_389127] patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery 
for distal colorectal cancer will also undergo temporary proximal diversion, minimizing the quality of life 
reduction of this portion of the procedure is imperative.  It is well known hernias are associated with a 
reduced quality of life.40
Figure 1. Sublay (Retro-rectus) placement of mesh (highlighted in green)
Our long-term goal is to develop a technique for closure of ostomy sites that minimizes the 
potential for hernia formation.  The current literature is limited by a lack of prospective evaluation of the 
effectiveness of reinforcement of ostomy closure sites.  Therefore, prospectively evaluating the technique 
will yield a more detailed understanding of how and when hernia formation at the ostomy closure site 
occurs and the presence of any unexpected findings.  Our overall objectives in this study protocol, which 
is the first step towards our long-term-goal, are to (i) validate our ostomy site closure technique 
incorporating prosthetic mesh and calculate its associated costs, (ii) measure and compare patient 
reported quality of life pre- and post-intervention, and (iii) prospectively evaluate the incidence of hernia at 
SCAR Trial Page 4
Version: I
CONFIDENTIALthe stoma closure site at 6-months post procedure.  Our central hypothesis is that a mesh reinforcement 
of the site during closure of an ostomy is safe and will reduce the incidence of hernia over time.  The 
rationale for this project is that survival from colorectal cancer will continue to increase and improving the 
quality of life of patients by [CONTACT_316120] .  
1.2 Investigational Device (Attachments A, B, C, D)
Bard™ Soft Mesh – is a light weight, woven, large open pore mesh made of polypropylene.  It is an FDA 
approved product indicated for use in the reconstruction of soft tissue defects.  
1.[ADDRESS_389128] been conducted regarding implantation of mesh to reinforce abdominal wall 
defects and this is widely accepted among surgeons who treat hernias.16,17,30  Light weight polypropylene 
mesh, specifically implanted in the identical anatomical position as proposed by [CONTACT_316121].23,24,31,32,41 Furthermore, a 
large scale, multiple institution trial using this specific mesh, and ones of similar design and construction 
marketed by [CONTACT_316122], implanted in the same anatomic location under the same levels of wound 
contamination found acceptable infection and hernia recurrence outcomes.23
1.3.1 Safety Events
The previously referenced trial reported an overall 31% incidence of surgical site occurrences (SSO), which 
were defined as any surgical infection, wound dehiscence, wound breakdown, enterocutaneous fistula, 
seroma/hematoma formation, wound cellulitis, suture abscess, or nonhealing wound as described by [CONTACT_316123].42 The criteria for 30-day SSI was taken directly from the CDC criteria and 
was categorized into superficial, deep, and organ space infections. This included 7% wound dehiscence 
rate, 5% incidence of seroma or hematoma, 4% wound cellulitis rate, and a 1% enterocutaneous fistula 
rate.  The SSI rate was (14%) where S-SSI was 8%, D-SSI was 3%, and O-SSI was 3%.  In their cohort, 
only 4% of patients required mesh removal.23  These findings are consistent with other reports of similar 
studies.26,27  
1.4 Risk/Benefits
The primary concern is for surgical site occurrences.  In the absence of mesh, the incidence of infection in 
ileostomy closures is estimated between 6 and 18%.43-45  This rate is minimized with the use of a purse 
string skin closure with iodine impregnated gauze packing vs partial closure with an open ended drain 
(Penrose type) or primary skin closure.46  Prospective trial data estimates the overall incidence of infections 
when bioabsorbable mesh is placed in Class II and III ventral hernia repairs at 18%.  None required mesh 
explantation and all wounds eventually healed.[ADDRESS_389129] an infection rate of 7.1% for clean contaminated 
and 19% for contaminated cases. 23  Surgical site occurrences will be treated on an individual patient basis 
determined by [CONTACT_316124].  Infection may potentially be treated with 
antibiotics, local wound care, operative debridement, radiographically guided drainage procedures, vacuum 
assisted wound closure devices, or mesh removal at the discretion of the study team.  Other potential 
adverse events are those inherent to intestinal surgery; anastomotic leak, peritoneal abscess formation, 
bowel obstruction, or ileus, in addition to the risks associated with general anesthesia.
2 Study Objectives
Primary Objective: To validate the technical procedure of mesh implantation at the time of ileostomy 
closure and preliminarily determine the incidence of surgical site occurrences (particularly those requiring 
intervention) compared to standard ileostomy closure technique.  
SCAR Trial Page 5
Version: I
CONFIDENTIALSecondary Objective #1: Measure and compare quality of life scores for aspects related to the procedure 
to those related to bowel function.
Secondary Objective #2: To evaluate the process for longitudinally monitoring for the occurrence of 
hernia at site of stoma closure. We will evaluate our study protocol for the feasibility of performing a larger 
trial by [CONTACT_316125], retention of patients, adherence to the study protocol, and process 
assessment.  
By [CONTACT_316126][INVESTIGATOR_799], our expected outcomes are to have demonstrated a high level of 
procedural fidelity among the operating surgeons of the modified ostomy closure technique and 
comparable costs to the standard procedure as well as greater than 80% recruitment and retention of 
eligible participants, and greater than 90% adherence to the study protocol.  We also expect to 
preliminarily demonstrate safety and similar quality of life compared to historical controls on short term 
follow-up.  These results are expected to inform development of an appropriately powered, multiple 
center, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of our novel modification of ostomy 
closure technique to the standard technique.  
[ADDRESS_389130] phase will include five patients 
treated and followed sequentially.  If there are 1 or fewer major wound occurrences (those requiring 
return to the operating room) then the study will proceed to the second phase which will include a total of 
15 patients followed concurrently.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary end point of the study is the validation of the mesh implantation procedure.  We will assess 
the incidence of wound occurrences (defined as S-SSI, D-SSI, organ space SSI, dehiscence, and seroma 
formation) at 30days, with particular attention to wound occurrences requiring procedural intervention, 
including but not limited to, operative debridement, radiographically guided drain placement, or excision of 
the mesh.  These incidences will be compared to historical controls.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints
The secondary endpoints will be evaluation of the incidence of hernia formation at the ileostomy site on a 
prospective basis at 30 days and 6 month intervals thereafter until two years from the date of ileostomy 
closure.  The Promis SF 2.0 8a Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities instrument will be used 
to assess quality of life and the Colorectal Functional Outcome (COREFO) instrument will be used to 
evaluate bowel function at each interval.

CONFIDENTIAL4.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Pre-existing systemic infection at the time of ileostomy takedown
2. Cirrhosis, chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, or collagen disorder
3. On current immunosuppression (anti-TNF agents, chemotherapy, or prednisone >10mg/day)
4. Previous abdominal hernia repair with mesh placement
5. Concurrent procedures in addition to closure of diverting loop ileostomy
6. Ileostomy closure not completed through the previous stoma site (i.e. those requiring 
exploratory laparotomy for closure)
4.[ADDRESS_389132] Recruitment and Screening
Study subjects will be recruited from the Dartmouth Hitchcock Department of Surgery, Division of Colon 
and Rectal Surgery clinical practice.  Patients will be deemed eligible for the study based upon clinical 
indicators for appropriateness of ileostomy closure.  
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects
Patients may be withdrawn from the study at any time based upon withdraw of consent.  Patients may 
also be withdrawn if the study treatment cannot be tolerated (i.e. removal of mesh device is required).  
Patients must continue to participate for 30days post-operatively in order for inclusion in the analysis of 
the primary endpoint data.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_389133]’s participation will be included in the analysis of the 
treatment effect.  Should a subject be withdrawn from the study for any reason, survival data will be 
maintained in accordance with the guidelines for follow-up prescribed by [CONTACT_94497].
5 Study Procedures
5.1 Encounter 1 
Patients will be assessed for ileostomy closure based upon completion of therapy after primary 
resection of their malignancy.  Appropriate candidates will be determined at the operating surgeon’s 
discretion based on customary evaluation of clinical status.  The informed consent process will be 
initiated and the patient recruited into the study. 
5.2 Encounter 2 
This encounter is the operative procedure.  The procedure for closing the ileostomy (i.e. bowel 
anastomosis) will be at the discretion of the surgeon, provided it is performed through the ileostomy site 
without additional laparotomy incisions.  In accordance with SCIP guidelines, pre-operative intravenous 
antibiotic and subcutaneous pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis will be administered. 
Patients with a history of MRSA infection will also receive a dose of intravenous vancomycin prior to the 
procedure.
The abdominal wall reconstruction portion of the procedure will be standardized to ensure 
consistency between surgeons.  The posterior rectus sheath is closed with native tissue either primarily, 
using hernia sac if present, or bridged with Vicryl-type mesh and a quickly absorbing suture material.  
This is done to isolate the mesh from the peritoneal cavity.  The retrorectus plane is developed using 
electrocautery and blunt dissection to provide adequate placement of mesh such that it overlaps the 
posterior sheath defect by a minimum of 3cm on all sides.  The mesh is placed in this plane and secured 
in place with slowly absorbable monofilament (0-PDS preferred) sutures placed through the anterior 
fascia or with application of fibrin sealant at the surgeon’s discretion.  This space is then irrigated with 
SCAR Trial Page 7
Version: I
CONFIDENTIAL250mL of bacitracin/neomycin/polymixin antibiotic solution, patients with a history of MRSA will have 
vancomycin added to this solution.  The anterior rectus sheath is then closed in a running fashion with 
slowly absorbing monofilament suture (0-PDS preferred).  Again, 250mL of antibiotic solution are used as 
irrigation.  A closed suction drain may be left in the retrorectus space at the discretion of the surgeon.  
Scarpa’s layer is closed if possible and then skin closed with a circumferential purse string absorbable 
suture and the subcutaneous cavity packed with Iodoform gauze.  This gauze is then removed on post-
operative day 2.  Post operatively the patient will receive standard care.  
5.[ADDRESS_389134] follow-up for their cancer surveillance in accordance 
with NCCN guidelines which include computed tomography imaging every 6 months.  Concurrently, 
clinical cancer surveillance evaluation by [CONTACT_67361] (in conjunction with surveillance visits by 
[CONTACT_287008]) will be performed on the same schedule with evaluation of clinical evidence of hernia 
formation as well as assessment of patient experience with the stoma site as part of regular cancer 
surveillance visit.  These images will be subsequently evaluated for radiographic evidence of hernia 
formation by a radiologist blinded to the presence of the mesh, which is radiolucent.  Patients will be 
undergoing computed tomography evaluation primarily as part of their cancer surveillance, and this 
imaging is not obtained expressly for the purposes of this study, and are only secondarily utilized to 
screen for hernia occurrence.  Patients will also undergo ultrasound examination of the ostomy closure 
site at 30d post operatively then on the same 6 month schedule.  These images are obtained for the 
purposes of the study and are intended to be compared to the computed tomography findings to evaluate 
congruence of the two modalities.  These visits occur on a prescribed schedule for a period of 5 years 
after cancer treatment has concluded, after which no further follow-up is required.   
Sonographic evaluation of the stoma site will be obtained on the Supersonic Unit in the Advanced 
Imaging Center using an 8-15 mHz linear transducer.
Cine clips will include all margins of the mesh repair to ensure adequate coverage of the repair site.
SUPI[INVESTIGATOR_44466]:
Patients will initially be examined in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].
1. Longitudinal and Transverse images of the stoma site will be obtained with normal breathing 
followed by a video clip in long or transverse plane.
2. Longitudinal and Transverse images of the stoma site will be obtained with Valsalva maneuver 
followed by a video clip in long or transverse plane with Valsalva. 
3. If a stoma site hernia is identified, measurements of the abdominal wall defect will be obtained 
with and without Valsalva. 
4. If a stoma site hernia is identified Longitudinal and Transverse images of the stoma site will be 
obtained with transducer compression followed by a video clip in long or transverse plane.
STANDING:
Patients will then be examined in the standing position.
1) Longitudinal and Transverse images of the stoma site will be obtained with normal breathing 
followed by a video clip in long or transverse plane.
2) Longitudinal and Transverse images of the stoma site will be obtained with transducer 
compression followed by a video clip in long or transverse plane.
3) If a stoma site hernia is identified on standing views only, measurements of the abdominal wall 
defect will be obtained with and without Valsalva.

6 Statistical Plan
6.1 Sample Size Determination
6.2 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_316115] (20) represents an 
attainable number within the planned study period (1 year) based on the clinical volume of our group.  
Our group treats approximately 35-40 patients per year who would likely meet inclusion criteria for 
this trial.  We estimate a cohort of 200 patients in a randomized trial will be required to demonstrate 
superiority of the technique, and a 10% sample of that cohort will be sufficient provide preliminary 
safety data as well as to demonstrate feasibility of a future trial.  
6.[ADDRESS_389135] the hypothesis that the procedure can 
obtain a 50% reduction in the incidence of hernia formation at previous ileostomy sites compared to rates 
reported in the literature.  The secondary objectives have not been previously reported in the literature 
either for patient reported outcomes or prospective evaluation of hernia formation.  Further work, based on 
the data from this study, will attempt to show the superiority of the technique over currently used closure 
techniques as well as patient satisfaction with the procedure.  
6.[ADDRESS_389136] Population(s) for Analysis
The statistical analysis for this study will use an all-treated population:  Any subject who participated in 
the study and underwent the study procedure.  Patients without complete follow-up data will be excluded 
from the final analysis.  
7 Safety and Adverse Device Effects
7.1 Definitions
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such 
as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
results in study withdrawal
is associated with a serious adverse event
is associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests

An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life-
threatening problem or death, caused by [CONTACT_316128].  Internal 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) reports must be made within [ADDRESS_389137] be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow-up is defined as 90 days following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316116]
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.
General Physical Examination Findings
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study. 
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met: 
The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality
The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity
The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc.

7.3.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the Dartmouth IRB
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_316129], 
affiliated with a Dartmouth research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to the Dartmouth IRB. 
The Dartmouth College IRB (CPHS) requires expedited reporting of those events related to study 
participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The 
Dartmouth IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the 
criteria outlined below.  The Dartmouth IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems 
within 10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:
Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site or off-site) 
that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_214167]:
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected 
in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document and other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.)

CONFIDENTIALAND
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118637], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_118689].)
Reporting Process
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Dartmouth 
IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable 
Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information 
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form 
and/or other study documentation). Internal Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) reports must be 
made within 10 working days.

2. Should a patient require return to the operating room for treatment of a wound occurrence 
requiring removal of the mesh, the trial will be suspended pending investigation of the case to 
determine the cause of the wound occurrence as well as to evaluate the necessity of modification 
of the protocol to avoid similar occurrences in future patients.  
3. If either of the above conditions occur, in addition to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], both the CPHS and NCCC 
DSMAC will be promptly notified.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see Section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type 
of unanticipated adverse device effects.
[ADDRESS_389141] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have access to that information and why
Who will use or disclose that information
The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

CONFIDENTIAL8.2 Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_110799], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.
8.3 Case Report Forms
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank 
because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable 
to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has 
been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the 
correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT 
ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial 
and date it.
8.4 Records Retention
Data related to the study subjects and the trial will be maintained for a minimum of 5 years following the 
procedure.  This data will be secured using the Velos eResearch Database.   
9 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting
9.1 Safety and Data Monitoring
   This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_65063] (DSMAC) of the Norris 
Cotton Cancer Center. It is a multidisciplinary committee charged with overseeing monitoring of safety of 
participants, conduct, progress, and validity and integrity of the data of all clinical trials at NCCC at 
Dartmouth.  The Committee meets quarterly to review accrual rates and information for studies that have 
accrued participants.  The Clinical Cancer Review Committee (CCRC) determines the frequency of DSMAC 
data and safety review.  This protocol will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.  The DSMAC has the authority 
to suspend or to recommend termination to the CCRC of all research activities that fall within its jurisdiction.  
In the event that a study is suspended or terminated, that information will be forwarded to the CPHS 
(Dartmouth IRB) office.

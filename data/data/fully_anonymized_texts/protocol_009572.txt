CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 17 of 76 1 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
1.1 Background Information  
Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT) infection remains the most frequently reported infectious disease in 
the [LOCATION_002] (US ) (1). Several sequelae can result from CT infection in women, the most 
serious of which include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and scarring of the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], 
ovaries, endometrial lining, and occasionally, adjacent perineum, which increases the risk of  
future ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility. These consequences are the main reason that CT 
infection is estimated to be the costliest  of all non- viral sexually transmitted infections  (STIs)  
(2). 
An acidic vaginal pH and colonization with Lactobacillus  species (LB) are two proven 
components of the multiple defense mechanisms active against infection in the lower female genital tract (3). These species are thought to play key protective roles by [CONTACT_472480]  (4), (5), (6). A lower vaginal pH may inhibit STIs, 
including CT infection (7) . In vitro studies have shown that exposure to vaginal secretions at 
lower pH significantly inhibits CT replication  (7), (8). In another experiment, the growth of CT 
within epi[INVESTIGATOR_472469] (9) . 
 
A prospective case -controlled study found an association between CT infection and higher 
vaginal pH (median pH of 4.[ADDRESS_605734] and 4.0 in controls, respectively), independent of any other factors (10) . The study included [ADDRESS_605735] infections and 145 controls. Sixty -two (62) of 
the women with CT were diagnosed with concurrent STIs ( bacterial vaginosis [ BV], genital 
warts, Neisseria gonorrhoeae  [GC], trichomoniasis , and candidiasis).  However, even when the 
analyses were restricted to the [ADDRESS_605736] a pH  >4.5. This study, in itself, was unable to answer whether 
lower vaginal pH reduces risk of acquisition of urogenital CT infection, and further study is 
needed. However, the results of this study lead to the hypothesis that reduction of vaginal pH 
(through treatment) in asymptomatic women with conditions that are known to increase vaginal 
pH (such as BV), may help to prevent CT infection, particularly in those at increased risk of 
infection.  
 
A recent study of 61 women exposed to GC through an infected par tner was conducted at the 
Baltimore City Health Department STI clinics and showed that 100% of the women whose 
vaginal pH was ≥5.0 were subsequently infected with GC vers us 40% of the women whose pH 
was <5.0 (when measured within 5 days of GC exposure) (11). Additionally, pH -dependent risk 
was independent of BV as diagnosed by [CONTACT_472481] c riteria.  These data suggest that modification of 
vaginal pH could be used clinically to reduce risk of GC infection in women.

1.2 Scientific Rationale  
AMPHORA  is an acid -buffering  vaginal gel (pH 3.5) containing three active ingredients 
(L-lactic acid, citric acid , and potassium bitartrate ). It is currently in development  as a 
contraceptive to be applied intravaginally before sexual intercourse . During development , it was 
found to have in vitro activity  against GC, as well as BV- associated microbes, without having a 
detrimental effect on beneficial native LB  and to inhibit  Trichomonas vaginalis  under both 
aerobic and anaerobic conditions  (Investigator’s  Brochure , 2016) . This has led to further 
development  as a microbicide to lessen the risk of , or prevent  acquisition of , STIs . 
Subsequent s tudies done  on AMPHORA in the animal model support further in vivo microbicide 
research . AMPHORA with and without  nonoxynol -9 (N-9) was applied vaginally to Swiss 
Webster mice before inoculation of 15 µL 104 or 105 inclusion forming units [ IFU] CT. 
AMPHORA  was found to provide protection against upper genital tract infection in 88%  to 
100% of the animals, whereas the other four vaginal gel products tested protected only 0%  to 
38% of the animals. It was also  determined that the addition of 5% N -[ADDRESS_605738] at the usual challenge inoculum  (22) . 
In another murine study, AMPHORA  displayed significant protection against transmission of 
GC with only one  of [ADDRESS_605739] GC in vitro; a 0.625% solu tion of this product inhibited six  of the  seven  GC 
strains  (23) . 
Low adherence to product use  is an ongoing challenge in vaginal microbicide studies , though 
recent analysis of study data has produced baseline predictors of high adherence  (24). A recent 
prospective study on sexual risk behavior a nd incident STIs included a sub study that showed use 
of cell phone -based e- diaries assisted in achieving an enhanced subject compliance rate of 89.7%  
(25).  
1.3 Study Objectives  
Primary:  To determine if intravaginal AMPHORA  reduces the risk of urogenital Chlamydia 
trachomatis  (CT) infection  
Secondary : To determine if intravaginal AMPHORA  reduces the risk of urogenital Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae  (GC) infection

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 20 of 76 2 Study Design 
Eight hundred forty -four ( 844) women , ages [ADDRESS_605740] 16 weeks, this study targets those at high risk for 
infection  (1), (26) .  
Regardless of whether a potential subject agrees to participate in the study, subjects should be treated according to each site’s routine standard of care (SOC) for STI prevention which should 
follow the prevention strategies recommended by [CONTACT_7698] 
(https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/clinical.htm). These strategies include client -centered STI 
prevention c ounseling addressing subject’s individual risk factors and advice on the correct and 
consistent  use of male condoms t o prevent STIs and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) , as 
well as condom provision if part of the site’s SOC. Those who agree to participate ( ie, subjects 
who provide  informed c onsent) should be treated according to SOC prior to and throughout the 
study pe riod as necessary.  
Subjects will be tested for current GC/CT infection by [CONTACT_472482] ( NAAT ) 
via vaginal swab. Those negative for current infection will be  enrolled. Those who test positive 
for CT/GC i nfection will receive SOC treatment. To meet eligibility criteria, these subjects will 
not be enrolled until 3 to 4 weeks after screening (at least 21 days after treatment).  
Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 ( 422 subjects per treatment arm) to 
either AMPHORA or placebo ; 5 g of AMPHORA or placebo will be supplied in pre -filled,  
single -dose applicators. A baseline vaginal pH and  a full gynecologic exam (speculum) will be 
obtained at enrollment.  
Subjects are instructed to apply AMPHORA  or placebo  gel immediately before or up to  one hour 
prior to coitus for the duration of the 16-week intervention period. AMPHORA  or placebo is to be  
re-applied in the same manner for each occurrence of sexual intercourse.  Subjects will keep an 
electronic diary ( eDiary ) to document and track sexual activity and product  use. 
Every 4 weeks ( 5 visits), all subjects will return to the clinic for repeat CT/GC NAAT  (vaginal 
swab) , urine pregnancy  (urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin [ uHCG ]) testing, eDiary  review , 
and return of used and unused investigational  product . Applicators  will be visually  inspected for 
use and staining will be performed to confirm vaginal insertion of used (empty) applicators . At 
Visits 2 to 4, subjects will be re- supplied w ith AMPHORA  or placebo  gel. At Visit 5 , subjects will

will be encouraged to receive appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any AE resolve or the subject’s condition becomes stable.  
3.6.[ADDRESS_605756] to Follow -up  
The study design has incorporated primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies for reducing the number of subjects los t to follow -up. Primary strategies include having sites: 1) fully inform 
subjects  of study visit details prior to randomization, 2) address ing subject s’ expectations on 
study participation, 3) motivating subjects  to adhere to  follow -up visits and research protocols, 
and 4)  utilizing e Diaries for data entry and review.  Secondary strategies include : 1) scheduling 
all visits  around subjects ’ availability whic h are within the visit window , 2) provid ing a visit 
reminder  ahead of time , and 3) reviewing data for missed and overdue follow -up visits. Tertiary 
strategies include: 1) discussing subjects’  difficulty in adhering to study protocol and answering 
any question s they might have  and 2) continu ing attempts to reach subjects lost to follow -up and 
recording all contact [CONTACT_14386].  
A subject will be considered as lost to follow -up if participation in study activities is not 
continued after:  
• Three attempts at telephone contact [CONTACT_472484] , followed by  
• Issuance of a certified letter to last documented address of subject, and no response within [ADDRESS_605757]’s case report form 
(CRF ) and in source document s. The reason(s) for the lost to follow -up, if known, and the 
appropriate timelines for subject -study site correspondence will be captured along with the study

4.1 Study Products Description 
There are two study produc ts used over the course of the i ntervention period for this study: 
1) AMPHORA and 2) placebo.  
 
AMPHORA  
AMPHORA  is in development  as a vaginally administered contraceptive gel and microbicidal 
agent. AMPHORA is an acid -buffering  gel (pH 3.5) containing three active ingredients  (L-lactic 
acid 1.8% , citric  acid  1%, and potassium bitartrate  0.4%)  and the following non- active 
ingredients: benzoic acid, alginic acid , xanthan gum, glycerin, and water.  
 
Placebo  (Universal Placebo Gel)  
The placebo used in this study is  universal p lacebo gel (UPG).  UPG is an isotonic non -bufferi ng 
gel, with pH adjusted to 4.5 and containing 2.7%  hydroxyethylcellulose, sorbic acid, sodium 
hydroxide, sodium chloride , and purified water. In clinical studie s, UPG has been proven safe 
and accep table when used up to twice daily for 14 days (27) .

4.1.1 Formulation and Packaging  
For this study, pre -filled, single -use applicators will be used.  The AMPHORA and placebo gels  
will be filled (5 g) into  identical single -dose applicators consisting of an injection molded opaque 
white high -density polyethylene ( HDPE ) barrel with a rounded distal end for easy insertion. A 
thermoplastic rubber pi[INVESTIGATOR_472470]. This component 
will sea l the end of the barrel to keep the contents stable over time and also functions as the 
applicator pi[INVESTIGATOR_472471]. A HDPE  plunger rod will be packaged alongside of the barrel 
within a n aluminum  overwrap. Product will be dispensed as a box of 10 overwra pped applicators 
with used applicator return bags and instructions for use.

4.1.5 Distribution to Subjects/ Return of Unused Product and Used Applicators  
Following screening, enrollment , and randomization, subjects will be issued a 4- week  supply of 
investigational product  based on the  individual subject’s projected usage. Each investigational 
product  box contains [ADDRESS_605764] , as needed, 
should their supply be exhausted prior to the next study visit; however, excessive product usage 
should be brought to the attention of the Investigator  and Sponsor . At Visit  5, subjects will return 
all unused product and used applicators.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_605765]  in exactly the same 
manner. To administer , the plunger rod is inserted into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_472472]. The cap is removed from the distal end of the barrel; the barrel is then inserted into the 
subject’s vagina (distal end first).  The plunger rod is pushed into the barrel, subsequently moving 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_472473]. Only the gel will lea ve the barrel.   
Detailed instructions for administration are included as Appendix C  and supplied to the subject  
with the investigational product. Subjects will be trained in investigational product  application 
prior to issuance.

6.1 Responsibilities  
Investigator s participating in this clinical study are  required  to: 
• Evaluate subject safety including assessment of AEs for serio usness, severity, and 
causality  
• Notify the ICON GPHS  Medical Monitor  of SAEs within 24 hours  of becoming 
aware of them  
• Provide detailed written reports, including necessary documentation requested by [CONTACT_472496], promptly following immediate initial reports  
• Inform the IRB of AEs as required by [CONTACT_25435]  
6.2 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)   
Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject who has received a study 
product intervention and that does not necessarily have to have a causal re lationship with the 
study product . An AE can, therefore, be any unf avorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a study medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the study medicinal 
product.  
Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE)   
An SAE is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a n SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require m edical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition   
The term “life- threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject  was 
at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an ev ent which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it w ere more severe.  
The term “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” describes a period of at least [ADDRESS_605779] always be exercised and when in doubt the 
case should be considered serious.  
Non-serious Adverse Event  
A non- serious AE is any AE which does not fulfill the definition of an SAE. 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE)  
A TEAE is any AE  occurring after the application of the study product  and w ithin the time of 
residual product effect, or pre -existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after the 
application of study product  and within  the time of residual product  effect . The time of residual

The determination of seriousness, severity, and causal ity will be made by a site Investigator .  
AMPHORA® Protocol: EVO -003 
Evofem, Inc . v6.0 – [ADDRESS_605784] to the following categories : 
Seriousness  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening; this means that the subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event , 
and it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were 
more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]

• Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472474] t he subject  or require intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes ; examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or de velopment of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious and 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate.  
 Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to Com mon Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. In general, CTCAE severity grades are:  
• Grade 1: m ild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: m oderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental a ctivities of daily living (ADL) (i nstrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc)  
• Grade 3: s evere or medic ally significant but not immediately life -threatening;

ADL (s elf-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking  medicati ons, and not bedridden)  
• Grade 4: l ife-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated

laboratory values related to the study. The Investigator  should inform the subject when medical 
care is needed for AEs.  
The period for reporting new AEs  will continue until the post -intervention follow -up visit  (final 
study visit) .  
All non- serious AEs classified as possibly/probably related to the investigational product  must be 
followed until the subject has recovered and all queries have been resolved. However, cases of chronic conditions can be closed if determined by [CONTACT_472499], with an outcome of 
“recovering” or “not recovered.” If a subject  died from another event, these cases can be closed 
with an outcome of “not recovered.”  
All other non -serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for 
chronic conditions), or until the end of the post -intervention follow -up stated in the protocol, 
whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. If a subject died from another event, these cases can be closed with an outcome of “not recovered. ” 
The Investigator  must enter follow -up informat ion about non- serious AE s on the AE form within

Monitoring will be conducted to ensure that human subject rights and well -being are protected, 
data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, and the study complies with 
the protocol/amendment(s), and applicable regulatory requirements .  
In order to ensure protocol compliance, monitoring visits will occur at scheduled intervals prior to, during, and at study completion. The visit frequency will be defined in a monitoring plan and 
communicated to the Investigator s. 
A separate study -specific monitoring plan will define the monitoring details  such as the 
frequency of monitoring visits and percentage and selection of charts/source documentation to be 
monitored. An ICON GPHS  CRA will be responsible for th e clinical monitoring at the study 
sites. The CRA will operate in dependently from the study site s and will comply with ICON 
GPHS  SOPs . The CRA will ensure that the Investigator s understand the investigational status of 
the study product , all requirements of the protocol, and his/her regulatory responsibilities as an 
Investigator . The C RA will visit th e clinical site  in accordance with the monitoring plan to assess 
compliance with the protocol, verify accuracy and completeness of the data, perform 
accoun tability of study product , and review essential regulatory documents. 
The investigational site s will provide direct access to all study -related documents and records 
maintained by [CONTACT_737] s, including but not limited to study- related source data for the

Evofem, Inc . v6.0 – [ADDRESS_605792] infection in women is associated with higher vaginal pH (pH > 4.5) 
(10). This finding is supported by [CONTACT_472500] (7) . In addition, a  higher vaginal 
pH has been associated with increased transmission of GC  (28). AMPHORA also contains a 
relatively high c oncentration of lactic acid (1.8% w/v).  Lactobacilli inactivate CT through the 
production of lactic acid (29). Thus, AMPHORA  should reinforce the ability of lactobacilli to 
maintain healthy levels as well as provide additional lactic acid that may act directly in 
preventing CT infection. 
8.[ADDRESS_605793] infection among the intervention groups ( AMPHORA  or placebo ).  
It is assumed that the proportion of subject s experiencing at least one infection of CT during the 
study period (incident infection of CT) up to Week 16 under placebo will be 22.5%. An incident 
infection of CT of 13% in the subject s receiving active treatment (ie, a treatment difference of 
9.5%) is considered clinically relevant for  AMPHORA  versus placebo. Using a Chi -square t est 
for the primary endpoint, [ADDRESS_605794] s per treatment group ([ADDRESS_605795] s total in the 
ITT population) will yield approximately 80% power to detect 9.5% treatment difference with a 
2-sided 5% type I error rate (SAS 9.3 PROC POWER). Assuming t hat 20% of the total enrolled 
subject s will be lost to follow -up, 15 % will be re -infected with GC (making them ineligible for 
the primary endpoint analysis) , and 5% will be deemed ineligible for analysis due to antibiotic 
use, the total sample size planned  for this study is [ADDRESS_605796] s.  
8.3 Final Analysis Plan  
8.3.1 Analysis Populations  
This study will utilize three analysis populations:  Intention- to-Treat (ITT), modified Intention -to-
Treat (m ITT), and safety.  
The ITT population will consist of all randomized subjects.  The mITT population will consist of 
all randomized subjects who are negative for c hlamyd ia and gonorrhea  at enrollment and report

Evofem, Inc . v6.0 – [ADDRESS_605797] and/or GC, not all 
subjects will be evaluable for each endpoint since the use of antibiotics would treat both possible 
infections. Therefore,  the subjects analyzed for the primary efficacy endpoint are those that are  
infected with CT or who complete the study with no re -infections. Likewise, the subjects 
analyzed for the secondary efficacy endpoint are those that are  infected with GC or who 
complete the study with no re -infections.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_605798] infection will 
be compared between the intervention groups ( AMPHORA  or placebo) using a Chi -square test.

Evofem, Inc . v6.0 – 25 January 2019 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   Page 51 of 76 The primary efficacy analysis will be completed using the subjects deemed analyzable (see 
Section 8.2 ) from the mITT population.  
The primary statistical hy pothesis being tested is that t here is no difference in the proportion of 
subjects with CT infections in the AMPHORA  intervention group versus placebo . In statistical 
terms:  
H0: p AMPHORA  = ppla cebo , HA: p AMPHORA ≠ pplacebo  
 
where pAMPHORA and pplacebo  denote the proportion of subjects with CT infections during the 
study while on AMPHORA  or placebo, respectively . Denominators for percentages are number 
of subjects in the m ITT population in each intervention group. To test superiority over placebo, 
the incident infection of CT will be compared against placebo based on a Chi -square test. The 
estimated difference in  proportions, 95% confidence interval , and p- value will be presented. A 
two-sided 5% type I error rate (α=0.05) will be used.  
Similar analyses will be performed for incident infection of GC.  
8.4.2 Data A nalysis for Safety  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities® (MedDRA) v17.0 
or higher. The incidence of AEs (new or worsened) will be summarized by [CONTACT_472501], preferred term, severity , and relationship to study intervention. The incidence of death, 
SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_472502].  
8.4.3 Analyses for Exploratory Objectives and Endpoints  
Adherence with AMPHORA  usage during study (rate of product use adherence) will be 
measured  by [CONTACT_122317]/analysis of returned gel applicators and e Diary data. Summary statistics 
of adherence overall and by [CONTACT_448074].  
Based on the adherence rate for each subject, sensitivity analyses will be conducted in the same 
manner as the primary and  secondary endpoint analyses to examine if the level of re -infection 
between treatment groups differs for ≥20% , ≥40%, ≥60%, ≥80% , and 100% adherence rates. 
These sensitivity analyses will be performed on the mITT population.  
Subject satisfaction  with the study drug (including sexual satisfaction in Appendix E ) will be 
summarized using frequency and percentage.   
Subject sexual satisfaction will be measured utilizing baseline and follow -up questions on the 
impact of study drug on sexual function with the SFQ and item 10 on the FSFI. These scores and 
responses will be  summarized using frequency and percentage.

The table referenced below is a modification of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (v4.03, May 2009)  tables, adjust ed to display common AEs applicable to this 
study. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. A brief defi nition is provided to 
clarify the  meaning of each AE term. Any clinical event deemed by [CONTACT_472510] a Grade  4 event.  
A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description  of the grade; a  single dash ( -) indicates a grade 
is not available.  ADL = Activities of Daily Living.  
ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRADE 
For abnormalities NOT found el sewhere in the t ables use the scale below to estimate grade of 
severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
GRADE 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
GRADE 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling;  limiting 
self-care ADL**.  
GRADE 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
GRADE 5  (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.

How to Use the Study Drug  
 
Description  
• Each single -use foil pouch contains a pre -filled applicator with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_447140] a 
plunger rod (Figure 1).  
 
Important Use Information  
• During your entire time in this study, use the Study Drug every time you have vaginal sex regardless of the time of the last application or even if you have sex more 
than once in a day. The Study Drug can be used immediately before or up to one 
hour before vaginal sex.  
• If you or your partner develop burning or irritation of the vagina or penis or experience difficult or painful urination, discontinue use and consult your clinical site 
staff.  
 Instructions for Using the Study Drug  
1. 
• Wash your hands with soap and water before opening the foil pouch. 
• Remove the pre -filled applicator and plunger from the foil pouch. 
 
2. Gently insert the pointed end of the plunger into the opening inside the pre -filled applicator 
until the plunger lightly snaps in place (Figure 2). Be careful not to push the plunger farther 
after it snaps in place to avoid the release of any Study Drug into the cap.

3. 
• Remove the pi[INVESTIGATOR_472478] -filled a pplicator (Figure 3). The pre -filled 
applicator is now ready for use.  
• NOTE – space between the Study Drug and end of the applicator is normal.  
 
 
 
4. 
• Hold the applicator at the grooved area closest to the plunger. Gently place the 
applicator into the opening of your vagina pushing it as far as it will comfortably go, 
similar to the placement of a tampon (Figure 4).  
• NOTE -  Lying on your back with your knees up may help with this step.  
 
 
5. Using your index finger, push the plunger all the way into the bar rel of the pre -filled 
applicator until it stops to ensure all the Study Drug has been applied (Figure 5).

or plunger. Place the used applicator in the resealabl e plastic bag provided (only one 
applicator per bag) and return along with all other used and unused applicators to next 
scheduled visit.  
• The Study Drug gel is effective immediately after insertion. Vaginal sex should occur 
within one hour after insertion.

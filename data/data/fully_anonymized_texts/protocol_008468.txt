 STUDY SUMMARY  
 
Title  DEFINE -PCI 
Study Chairman  Gregg Stone (CRF)  
Study PIs  Allen Jeremias (CRF), Manesh Patel (Duke), Justin Davies (Imperial 
College London)  
Background  Numerous studies of coronary stenting over the past decade have 
consistently demonstrated that  recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_345479], occurring in approximately 20% 
of patients. This may lead to a substantial in crease in repeat invasive 
procedures and associated health care costs.  
 
Physiologic assessment of coronary stenoses prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is superior to coronary angiography alone 
for lesion evaluation, reducing overall major c ardiac events as well as 
cost. However, data on post PCI physiology is scarce and thus rarely 
used in clinical practice. Limited clinical data on post PCI Fractional 
Flow Reserve (FFR) and instant aneous  wave -free ratio (iFR) indicate 
that a substantial num
ber of patients (up to 20%) have impaired 
coronary physiology at the completion of the procedure despi[INVESTIGATOR_345480]. It is not known whether an abnormal 
post -PCI FFR  or iFR  is predictive of recurrent angina and whether the 
routine u se of physiological indices of coronary function can predict 
future cardiovascular events.  
 
iFR safely and accurately quantifies stenosis severity in a wide range 
of lesions and may be helpful in assessing post PCI physiology. 
Compared with FFR, it allows rapid assessment of the lesion without 
induction of maximal hyperemia with adenosine. iFR pullback has  the 
potential additional advantage of interrogating the entire coronary 
artery to identify culprit lesions with significant pressures gradients.  
Hypothesis  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_345481]/stenoses as 
assessed by [CONTACT_345498] (QCA) post 
angiographically successful PCI. The hypotheses of this study are:  
1. iFR is impaired in a substantial proportion of patients 
following  operator -assessed angiographically successful PCI   
2. Post -PCI iFR detects residual significant CAD that is not 
detected  on QCA (defined by >50% stenosis)  
3. Post PC I iFR  is predictive of futur e advers e cardiovascular 
events  
Objectives  1. Determine the range of post -PCI iFR  and the rate of significant 
residual ischemia defined as iFR <0.90 following operator -
assessed angiographically successful PCI  
2. Determine the proportion of cases in which the iFR would 
become non- significant if a focal stenosis demonstrated by [CONTACT_345499].  This will be the  number or

Document Control # D000124064/C   #[ADDRESS_429054] to residual stenosis by [CONTACT_13775] , residual stenoses 
and device success (i.e. optimal stent implantation). The goal is to 
correlate abnormal iFR measurements to their anatomic reason (i.e. device related complications, angiographically undetected 
residual lesions, or diffuse atherosclerotic disease).  
4. Determine the relationship between post -PCI iFR and clinical 
outcomes, such as recurrent angina and MACE.  
5. Establish the relationship bet ween post -PCI iFR and objective 
assessment of quality of life.  
 
Study Design and Methods  DEFINE -PCI is a multi -center, prospective study in up to 25 centers  in 
[LOCATION_003] and internationally. Consented subjects with CAD who undergo physiologic lesion assessment with iFR<0.[ADDRESS_429055] will be used for 
analysis of the primary endpoint. Assuming a 10% rate of residual 
>50% stenosis based on QCA versus a conservative 15% rate of 
iFR<0.90 with a two -sided type I error of 0.05, approximately 500 
patients will be required to achieve 90% power.  
 
Primary Endpoint  Rate of residual ischemia defined as iFR <0.90 after operator -
assessed angiographically successful PCI (residual diameter 
stenosis <50% in any  treated lesion in the target vessel)  
Secondary Endpoint  Secondary cli nical endpoints (assessed in relation to post PCI 
iFR ([as dichotomous and continuous variable]):  
1. Composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, 
ischemia -driven target vessel revascularization or recurrent 
ischemia at one year (definition below)  
2. Target vessel failure defined as cardiac death, target vessel 
myocardial infarction, ischemia -driven target vessel 
revascularization

 INTRODUCTION  
Background  
Although myocardial revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) has been demonstrated to provide symptomatic benefit in patients with 
myocardial ischemia, numerous studies have demonstrated that up to 20 % of  
patients experience recurrent angina in the year following PCI, potentially leading to a substantial increase in invasive and/or noninvasive testing, as well as its attendant 
costs. To date, outside of traditional, guideline- recommended antianginal medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], there are no techniques that have been demonstrated to reduce the 
likelihood of post -PCI recurrent angina
. 2,3,4    
Among patients with stable angina, physiologic assessment of coronary stenoses for angiographically indeterminate lesions  prior to PCI, typi[INVESTIGATOR_345487] (FFR), has been demonstrated to be a superior strategy and has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce costs compared with coronary angiography alone. 
5,[ADDRESS_429063]- PCI lesion assessment is uncommon, and current expert 
consensus guidelines do not offer specific recommendations regarding its use. In a 
recent retrospective, single- center study of 574 patients (664 lesions), post- PCI FFR 
led to reclassification of about 20% of lesions , requiring additional  intervention. 
Additionally, patients with a final FFR > 0.86 had significantly lower rates of major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared with patients with a final FFR ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_429064]- free ratio (iFR) measurement, which provides an 
instantaneous assessment of stenosis severity  without the need for prolonged 
assessment or the administration of pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_345488], has 
emerged as a tool to provide rapid lesion assessment. iFR safely and accurately 
quantifies stenosis severity in a wide range of lesions and may be helpful in assessing 
post PCI physiology.

cardiovascular events. This study will assess (a) the frequency of iFR significant 
Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #[ADDRESS_429066] PCI, (b) differentiation between focal and diffuse disease, 
(c) the proportion of cases in physiology that would normalize with additional PCI, 
and (d) the correlation between phys iology and clinical outcomes.  
Clinical  Experience with Device 
 
1) Comparisons with FFR:   
Since its introduction multiple studies using off -line analysis have assessed  the utility 
of iFR against FFR as a reference standard.[ADDRESS_429067] -free period within 
diastole, every study has reported a classification match between iFR and FFR of 80 -
90%. Recently, a large international analysis demonstrated similar levels of 
agreement with FFR when performed on- line using the commercially available 
console, in real -world c atheter laboratory environments. 17 
 
2) Head to head comparisons of iFR and FFR against other diagnostic modalities :  
Direct comparisons with non- invasive ischemia detection tests (single- photon 
emission computed tomography, SPECT) or other physiological non- FFR indices 
(coronary flow reserve (CFR), hyperaemic stenosis resistance index (HSR)  12,[ADDRESS_429068] iFR 
comparisons with these modalities at present is lower than studies using FFR as a 
comparator.  
 
• Comparison with HSR : HSR assesse s coronary stenoses according to their 
pressure -flow velocity relationships that form the foundation of all coronary 
physiology. HSR  provide s a highly stenosis -specific assessment of coronary 
flow limitation.  iFR has been assessed in the CLARIFY study, and in a larger 
independent dataset against hyperaemic stenosis resistance index (HSR). In 
both of these studies, iFR had a diagnostic classification match in excess of 
90%  with HSR as the reference standard .  No improvement in diagnostic 
accuracy was seen w hen adenosine was administered over the entire cardiac 
cycle (FFR) or over the wave -free period (iFR -adeno).   
 
• Comparison with SPECT : iFR has been assessed against nuclear imaging in a 
study reported by [CONTACT_345505]  13 This study reported that iFR, FFR, and a 
flow -based resting index, basal stenosis resistance index (BSR), all had similar 
diagnostic power.  Again no improvement was observed following 
administration of adenosine.     
 
Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #160101  
 
Page 13 of 45 
 • Comparison with CFR : A recent study by [CONTACT_345506].[ADDRESS_429069] CFR. In this multi -center  
invasive study of 216 lesions measuring coronary pressure and flow in 
patients undergoing physiological assessment of the severity of coronary 
artery disease, it suggested that the discordance rates between pressure and flow based indices were significantly improved by [CONTACT_345507]. This improved accuracy was independent of the CFR threshold used (i.e. 1.7, 2.0 or 2.5), or whether clinical or isch emic cut -points for iFR or FFR were 
used.  
 
• Comparison with PET:  Two recent studies have compared PET perfusion 
imaging with hyperaemic and rest invasive physiological measures.  De Waard et al. showed no difference between classification of ischemia between iFR and 
FFR against PET as the reference standard.  Classification agreement with PET  
hyperem ic MBF was 76% for FFR and 77% for iFR. Hwang  et al. also show 
similar findings with overall diagnostic accuracies of FFR and iFR o f 69.6%, 
and 73.9% respectively. 
12,[ADDRESS_429070]- PCI iFR values is limited, and it is unclear how often 
coronary physiology remains abnormal after PCI, and whether PCI performance could be improved by [CONTACT_345508]. This study is designed to assess the 
relationship between iFR pullback  and the distribution of coronary stenoses as 
asse ssed by [CONTACT_345498] (QCA) following angiographically 
successful PCI. The hypotheses of this study are:  
• iFR is impaired in a substantial proportion of patients following operator -
assessed angiographically successful PCI.   
• Post -PCI iFR  detects residual significant CAD that is absent on QCA (defined by 
>50% stenosis)  
o This could be due to: -   
 The presence of stenosis which are not apparent on angiography  
 The presence of diffuse disease  
 Sub-optimal PCI result  
• Post PCI iFR is predictive o f future adverse cardiovascular events

STUDY OBJECTIVES  
• Determine the range 
•  of post -PCI iFR and the rate of significant residual ischemia defined as iFR 
<0.90 following operator -assessed angiographically successful PCI  
• Determine the proportion of cases in which the iFR would become non -
significant if a focal stenosis demonstrated by [CONTACT_345509].  This will be the used in the sample size calculation for a future 
randomized trial.  
• Determine the relationship between post- PCI iFR pullback and QCA with 
respect to residual stenosis by [CONTACT_13775], residual stenoses and device success (i.e. 
optimal stent implantation). The goal is to correlate abnormal iFR 
measurements to their anatomic reason ( i.e. device related complications, 
angiographically undetected residual lesions, or diffuse atherosclerotic disease).  
• Determine the relationship between post- PCI iFR and clinical outcomes, such 
as recurrent angina and MACE.  
• Establish the relationship between post- PCI iFR and objective assessment of 
quality of life.

Adverse Event Reporting  
 
For the purposes of this study, because the Verrata pressure guide wire is 
commercially available , adverse event reporting for this study will be limited to ADEs, 
SADEs, and UADEs (per the below  definitions).  
 
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product or medical device and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unf avorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product or device, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product or device.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death,  
• is life- threatening,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that do not meet the above criteria may still be considered 
an SAE if they seriously jeopardize the subject and require immediate medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the aforementioned outcomes.  
 Note that adverse events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345491]- study -emergent conditions do not constitute SAEs.  
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
For the purposes of this protocol, an ADE is defined as an adverse event that is related to or associated with Veratta pressure wire  use, or an adverse event for which a causal 
relationship by [CONTACT_345513].  
  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #[ADDRESS_429084] (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by – or 
associated with – the device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol (including 
documents such as the protocol, informed consent form, or other study -related 
documents), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device 
that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
Anticipated potential Adverse Events (per device IFU) are described below in 
Description of Device.  
 
Reporting of Clinical Events  
 
All clinical events observed during the course of this study will be recorded by [CONTACT_345514] e- CRF.  All MACE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_345515], ECGs, and angiograms.  Additional events may be 
triggered by [CONTACT_345516], monitoring, and by [CONTACT_345517] (these 
additional possible events will be referred to as “triggered events”.)  
 
Device Malfunctions or Use Errors  
Device malfunctions or use errors wil l be recorded and evaluated for possible 
untoward effects on the subject. For the purposes of this study, a device malfunction 
is defined as a failure of the device to perform its intended function when used in 
accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU). If a VERRATA
® PRESSURE GUIDE 
WIRE or any subsequent next generation Philips Volcano pressure wires  device 
malfunction results in an adverse experience for the subject, this adverse experience 
should be considered an adverse device effect and recorded on  the appropriate CRF.

Protocol Deviations and Waivers   
A protocol deviation is defined as an event where the clinical Investigator or site 
personnel deviate from the study protocol or study procedures. It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there are no deviations from the protocol 
without prio r notification and approval of the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee and in 
full compliance with all established procedures and conditions of the reviewing IRB/IEC.  
The Investigator may deviate from the protocol without prior written approval from 
the Sponsor  or Sponsor’s designee in cases of medical emergencies, when the 
deviation is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to the subject. In that event, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee 
immediately by [CONTACT_127449], notify the reviewing IRB/IEC 
and confirm notification to the Sponsor or designee in writing. Prior deviation approval is generally not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control, for exampl e, the subject was not available for 
a scheduled follow -up office visit. These events, although outside the Investigator’s 
control, are still required to be reported on the appropriate protocol deviation form 
in order to ensure that all deviations from the standard subject population are 
adequately documented and reported. The Investigator will inform the Sponsor or 
Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #160101  
 
Page 28 of 45 
 Sponsor’s designee of all deviations, and the reviewing IRB/IEC of all protocol 
deviations as per the IRB/IEC requirements for this study.   
The occurrence of protocol deviations will be monitored by [CONTACT_56834]’s designee for evaluation of Investigator compliance to the Protocol, Good Clinical Practices, and regulatory requirements.  
Gross non -compliance with the protocol at an individual site that may jeopardize the 
outcomes or the integrity of the trial may result in termination of enrollment at such 
non-compliant sites.  
 
Description of the Device  
 
The Verrata pressure guide wire (hereafter referred to as the “pressure guide wire”) 
is a steerable guide wire with a pressure transducer mounted 3 cm proximal to the 
tip. The Verrata guide wire measures pressure when used with the SmartMap, 
ComboMap, s5 Series, and CORE Series of systems. The pressure guide wire has a  
diameter of 0.014” ( 0.36 mm) and is available in lengths of 185 cm or 300 cm* and 
also in straight or preshaped  tips. The pressure guide wire is packaged attached to 
the connector with a torque device to facilitate navigation through the vasculature.   It 
is possible that futu re iterations of the Verrata wire may be used in the study which 
will offer improved performance and reliability.   
CONTRAINDICATIONS:  
This pressure guide wire is not intended for use in crossing a total vessel occlusion.

Ethical Considerations  
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal 
prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IEC/IRB 
concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the Investigator and a copy of 
this decision will be provided to the sponsor before commencement of this study.  
Benefits  
 
No direct benefits to the patient are expected.  However, information gained during this 
study may lead to improved treatment workflows for patients with coronary artery disease 
in the future.  
Risks   
The Philips Volcano pressure guide wires used in this s tudy are cleared for commercial use 
by [CONTACT_345520]. Information related to contraindications, adverse 
effects, warnings, and precautions are included in the device Instructions for Use.    
 
Risks associated with the use of pressure guide wires in patients with coronary artery 
disease are well understood, and incidence rates are very low. An extensive review of the safety of using pressure wires in [ADDRESS_429086] 2 reports 
of arterial dissection (0.16%) and a single report of device entrapment (0.8%). The largest of these studies
0F1 (N=648) is that which reported the 2 dissections.  Both were successfully 
managed and re presented only 0.3% of the adverse events for this single study.  A widely 
reported event was chest discomfort associated with the administration of adenosine in 86% of patients.  Notably, the DEFINE PCI protocol will be using the instantaneous free -
wave r ation (iFR) which does not require the administration of adenosine.

Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #[ADDRESS_429087] 
is 0.0056% and 0.0048  (less than one chance in more than 17,000- 20,000 uses) , 
respectively.         
 Patients deciding to participate in this study are thus expected to bear standard  risk 
associated with advancing and pulling back the pressure guide wire through the 
vasculature more times than would be typi[INVESTIGATOR_268249] a standard PCI procedure. Site personnel 
are well -practiced in the use of pressure guide wires in the coronary anatomy, and are 
advised to use dis cretion in repeating a pressure reading in cases where this presents 
elevated patient risk d ue to any specific anatomical or physiological factor.  Hence, the 
risk associated with the additional pressure wire p rocedures is considered standard .   
 
Mitigation of Risks  
The study site investigators will be selected for their experience and skill in Coronary  
interventions and familiarity with the use iFR and iFR pullback . Appropriate subjects will be 
selected using clearly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that subject treatment 
is consistent with current medical standards and practices.  
Risk – Benefit Analysis  
. In terms of complexity, the  Verrata Wire does not have moving or expandable parts, nor is 
any portion of the device implanted within the subject. Finally, the Verrata Wire  is cleared 
by [CONTACT_345521] a rteries , and the device does not emit 
ionizing radiation.   Patient participation is expected to provide insight for better managing 
ischemic coronary artery disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_345492].  Hence, the overall benefits to the body of knowledge for treating coronary artery disease outweighs the risk ass ociated with the additional pressure wire steps.

Discontinuation of the Trial by [CONTACT_345531]:   
• Failure to meet expected enrollment goals,  
• Any effectiveness/safety information that could significantly affect continuation of 
the trial or any other administrati ve reasons  
 
Discontinuation of a Site by [CONTACT_345532] a study site at any 
time. Reasons for terminating the participation of a study site include, but are not limited to, 
the follow ing:  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Data recording is consistently inaccurate or incomplete  
• Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study  
• IRB/IEC decides to terminate or suspend approval for the Investigator  
• Study center or Investigator violates GCP or the study contract, disrupting the 
appropriate conduct of the trial  
• Investigator asks to withdraw from study participation  
 
Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept c onfidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the local regulatory authority, as well as applicable US laws and 
regulations.  
Personal Health Information (PHI) will be acquired during the consenting process of the subject and from the medical re cords. This information will be utilized to identify the 
subject and contact [CONTACT_345533]. The PHI is part 
of the subject clinic chart, and will be secured in a locked office when not in use. To ensure 
that confide ntiality is maintained, subject names will not be used in this evaluation in any 
other way. A unique identifying number will be used. This identification method will be consistent for each subject throughout the evaluation.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use Protected Health 
Information (PHI), the Investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information 
collected prior to the revocation of the authorization.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN AND  DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE 
SIZE                                                                                          
 
Target population  
This analysis focuses on CAD Patients reporting an iFR < [ADDRESS_429091] one coronary 
artery chosen from 25 US and International centers.  
Data lock determination  
The dataset will lock after all data needed for assessment of primary and secondary 
endpoints are reliably obtained, and any impossible data points are investigated and 
resolved.  
Definition of Endpoints  
This analysis classifies each patient into one of two categories : patients with residual 
ischemia (RI) and patients without. This data is distributed binomially, and the primary endpoint measures the proportion of patients with 
residual ischemia defined 
as iFR <0.90 after successful PCI ( p).   
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with RI defined as iFR <90, is 
computed using maximum likelihood analysis. We compute the maximum likelihood 
estimate as 𝑝𝑝=𝑁𝑁−1∑𝑦𝑦𝑠𝑠𝑁𝑁
𝑠𝑠=1, and Clopper – Pearson 95% confidence intervals.  
The null h ypothesis states no difference in the proportion of RI from 10%, or more 
formally,  𝐻𝐻0:𝑝𝑝−0.10=0. The alternative hypothesis concludes any difference in RI 
from 10%, or 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎:𝑝𝑝−0.10≠0.

Sample size computation  
We assume a 10% rate of RI in the study (?) population which is defined as a residual 
stenosis of > 50% on QCA.  
With 500 enrolled patients, type I error held at 5%, and the ability to detect a proportion of 15% RI, this study is powered at 90%.   
 Secondary Endpoint analysis  
Kaplan Meier’s product l imit estimate computed as 𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡)= ∏�1− 𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗� 𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗<𝑡𝑡  , where we 
partition time into j  intervals 𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 based on events, will measure time to event endpoints 
(listed as secondary endpoints 1 -5). We conclude a significant survival difference 
between any two grou ps with the logrank test, and hold the expected type I error to 
5%. We correct the type I error of the 5 related survival hypothesis using Benjamini and Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate.   
This protocol models Quality of life (secondary endpoint 6) as a mix ed linear model,  
𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 ~ Ν�𝛽𝛽0+ 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗�𝛽𝛽1+ 𝑏𝑏1𝑗𝑗𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 �+𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗,Σ�, where β ’s describe fixed effects, b ’s describe 
random effects, Σ  describes a compound symmetric covariance matrix, and Ν  the 
multivariate Gaussian distribution. We parameterize the covariance matrix with Compound symmetry, as opposed to autoregressive, because within time points will dominate variability compared to across time points.  
The Kappa statistic will measure agreement between iFR and QCA’s ability to detect 
RI by [CONTACT_62252] 𝜅𝜅 = (𝑝𝑝
𝑒𝑒− 𝑝𝑝1)
(1− 𝑝𝑝1)� , or the  difference between empi[INVESTIGATOR_345497].  
We estimate the proportion of cases in which the iFR would become non- significant if a 
focal stenosis demonstrated by [CONTACT_345511] (Secondary endpoint 
8) by 
𝑝𝑝=#(Number  of non−significant iFR  pullbacks )
#(Patients )�  
And  assess the significance using a Binomial test.  
The cause for impaired iFR is summarized using proportions, and the χ2 test assess 
the null hypothesis that each cause of impaired iFR occurs at the same rate.  
We use linear regression to associate a set of covariates with the change in post- PCI 
iFR minus pre- PCI iFR. In case of nonlinear associations of covariates with change in 
iFR, we use kernel regression.  
 
Philips Volcano   DEFINE -PCI Protocol  
Document Control # D000124064/C   #[ADDRESS_429092], using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The null hypothesis  argues the 
proportion of RI detected with iFR equals 10%. The alternative hypothesis concludes the proportion of RI detected by [CONTACT_345535] 10%. The normal approximation 
tests this hypothesis using the statistic 𝑍𝑍= √𝑛𝑛(𝑝𝑝−0.10)
�𝑝𝑝(1−𝑝𝑝), and compares this statistic to 
the standard normal distribution.  
Handling Missing data  
Any patients with missing primary or secondary endpoints will be list- wise deleted 
from the above analysis. If unable to recover missing covariates, we will impute 
missing values for co variates if the total amount of missing values is less than 5%. 
This analysis will exclude any covariates with a majority of values missing.

1. Abstract  
 
People with multiple  sclerosis have abnormalities in multiple metabolic pathways that can be 
identified using metabolomics. The aberrant pathways identified in people with MS, in our 
preliminary studies using untargeted metabolomics , include primary and secondary bile 
acid me tabolism . Bile acids have several biological functions beyond aiding in lipid absorption 
in the gut, and can modulate the function of cells in the peripheral immune system and the CNS. 
Bile acid metabolism is also closely linked to the gut microbiota. Bile acid supplementation 
reduced neuroinflammation and was neuroprotective  in models of various neurodegenerative 
and neuroinflammatory disorders. Bile acid supplementation has been tested in early trials in 
neurodegenerative disease and has been well tolerat ed. Whether bile acid supplementation is 
beneficial in MS is not known.  
 
The objective of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of supplementation with a bile 
acid – tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in people with  progressive  MS. We will also 
assess whether this intervention normalizes the abnormal bile acid levels in circulation and 
impacts the composition of the gut microbiota and peripheral immune cell function.  
 
Aims:  
 
1. Establish the safety of bile acid supplementation and determine whether this intervention 
leads to normalization of the bile acid profile in people with MS with abnormal bile acid 
metabolism  
 
2. Assess the effects of bile acid supplementation on the gut microbiota and the peripheral 
immune system in people with MS  
There is a nee d for adjunctive treatments that carry low risk and address the underlying 
pathophysiology of MS. This project aims to show that a bile acid – TUDCA is safe and well -
tolerated in MS patients and could result in beneficial effects on bile acid metabolism, g ut 
microbiome and peripheral immune cell function in people with MS. If successful, this project 
could yield a new treatment strategy with both immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects.

3. Background   
 
Multiple Sclerosis is associated with alterations in multiple metabolic pathways including bile acid 
metabolism . Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder 
that leads to inflammation and neurodegeneration involving the central 
nervous system. Abnormalities in metabolic pathways have been 
identified in multiple sclerosis, both in plasma and cer ebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_13858] [1]–[3]. The majority of reports identified alterations in energy 
metabolism or oxidative stress; however, technological limitations 
prevented a large -scale evaluation of the metabolome in MS until 
recently. Now, recent advances allow for the use of global untargeted 
metabolomics to identify hundreds of small molecules in biological 
matrices using gas/liquid chromatography coupled with mass 
spectrometry [4]. We utilized untargeted global metabolomics to 
understand alterations in the metabolome of people with MS and 
identified a lterations in multiple metabolic pathways. Both primary and 
secondary bile acid metabolism were identified as metabolic pathways 
that were altered in the MS population (see preliminary data). 
Intriguingly, we noted dysregulation of these pathways in both r elapsing 
remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS). While the precise 
mechanism of this alteration is unknown, it may be linked to alterations 
in the gut microbiota or intestinal motility.   
Bile acids have multiple biological functions, and their metab olism 
is closely related to the gut microbiota . Bile acids are primarily 
produced in the liver through the action of multiple enzymes on 
cholesterol [5]. Primary bile acids are further modified by [CONTACT_560755] (with glycine or  taurine) and are then stored in the gall bladder. They are secreted into the 
intestine and the majority of bile acids are converted to secondary bile acids and reabsorbed in the ileum 
and colon  and transported back to the liver by [CONTACT_560756] ( enterohepatic circulation) [5],[6] . In 
the gut, bile acids can undergo deconjugation (removal of glycine or taurine) through the action of bile 
salt hydrolases (BSH) found in several bacteria. The process of deconju gation allows further conversion 
Figure 1. Bile acid synthesis and 
metab olism. The two pathways of bile acid 
production and associated enzymes are 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230]. The role of gut microbiota in 
secondary bile acid production and bile acid 
metabolism is also highlighted  (From 
Wahlstrom et al [38]).

of primary to secondary bile acids through 7 -dehydroxylation. While BSH activity is found in all major 
bacterial and archaeal divisions , The 7-dehydroxylation ability is limited to Clostridium  (Cluster XIVa 
& XI) and Eubact erium , both belonging to Firmicuites  phylum [7]. A previous study found a significant 
reduction in species belonging to Clostridial clusters XIVa & XI in people with MS [8]. Such an 
alteration could le ad to a decrease in the secondary bile acid pool.   
Bile salts have differing 
affinities for the various 
classes of bile acid 
receptors , and hence 
alterations in the 
composition of the bile 
acid pool may have a 
significant impact even 
when the overall bil e 
acid pool is unchanged. 
Table [ADDRESS_736962] been linked to control of various metabolic functi ons 
including – lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and development of obesity [6].  
Bile acid supplementation can alter the gut microbiota in humans and animal models of 
autoimmune disease. A recent study in patients with primary biliary cholangitis noted alterations in the 
gut microbiota  in this population. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) led to a partial 
restoration of the gut microbial profile to a normal state , suggesting that bile acid supplementation can 
lead to alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome [9]. Another recent study utilizing an  animal 
model of inflammatory bowel disease, demonstrated the presence of an altered gut microbiota in mice 
with experimental colitis. UDCA treatment normalized the increased ratio of Firmicutes to 
Bacteroidetes [10]. In this study bile acid supplementation also prevented a decrease in Clostridium 
cluster XIVa which has been noted to be decreased in people with MS [10]. 
Bile acids have immunological functions and can modulate both innate and adaptive immunity . 
The gut is the largest immune organ of the body and alterations in the gut microbiome have a profound 
effect on neuroinflammation [11]. Recent studies in MS have noted alterations in gut microbiota, 
however the metabolic consequences of these alterations have not been elucidated [12],[13] . Metabolites 
produced by [CONTACT_136918], including bile acids, can have significant effec ts on immune cells [14]. Bile 
acids activate receptors on immu ne cells including the nuclear Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and cell -
surface G -protein coupled receptors (TGR5) . FXR receptors are found predominantly on myeloid cells, 
but are also present on lymphocytes and NK cells [15]. Treatment of mice with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a FXR agon ist resulted in amelioration of disease, through 
increased production of interleukin -10 (IL -10) from myeloid cells [15]. The TGR5 receptor is also found 
on microglia and myeloid cells and in animal models of neuroinflammation a TGR5 agonist led to a 
reduction in severity and inhibition of myeloid cell activ ation [16],[17] .  
Bile acids are bioactive in the CNS and have neuroprotective effects . Bile acids and their precursors 
have been detected in brain tissue and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] [18]. Besides microglia, TGR5 receptors have 
also been described on astr ocytes and neurons [19]. The activation of this rec eptor is associated with 
increased adenylate cyclase activity, increased intracellular Ca2+ and production of reactive oxygen 
species. Bile acids have also been postulated to have effects on mitochondrial function, as well as the 
unfolded protein response . Several studies have demonstrated that secondary bile acids such as UDCA, 
glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and TUDCA may have neuroprotective properties. In a mouse Table 1. Classes of bile acid receptors with a listing of bioactive endogenous ligands

 model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) utilizing MPTP toxicity – TUDCA supplementation mediate d 
neuroprotection through modulation of c -Jun N -terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and reactive 
oxygen species production [20]. UDCA supplement ation reversed mitochondrial dysfunction noted in the 
fibroblasts from patients with LRRK2  mutations linked to familial PD [21]. Neuroprotection in the retina,  
in various models (retinal  detachment, optic nerve injury), has also been demonstrated with bile salt 
treatment [22]–[24]. This effect is thought t o be mediated through a reduction in apoptosis and 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.  
Trials of bile acid supplementation have been conducted in other neurodegenerative conditions 
and have shown good safety profiles and CNS penetration . A recent trial of  TUDCA in 34 ALS 
patients randomized to either TUDCA 1gm twice daily or placebo for 54 weeks  revealed a higher rate of 
response (defined as slowing in the slope of decline on a standardized rating scale) in the TUDCA 
arm[25]. TUDCA was well tolerated and there were no serious adverse effects in this trial . Two patients 
in the TUDCA arm of the trial had mild diarrhea and none of the patients ha d any changes in safety 
laboratory parameters that were monitored. A previous trial of UDCA in ALS employed a cross -over 
design and utilized 3.5 gm/day of UDCA for 3 months [26]. This trial found a reduction in the slope of 
decline in one of the three outcomes utilized. There was a high attrition rate related to GI adverse effects 
of UDCA . Another trial of UDCA supplementation in ALS revealed a dose -dependent increase in CSF 
UDCA concentrations, demonstrating good CNS penetration [27]. The European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) recently accorded orphan drug status to TUDCA for the treatment of ALS  in Europe. Trials are 
also ongoing in Huntington’s disease and PD ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT0051 4774) .  
PRELIMINARY DATA  
People with MS have alterations in their metabolome compared to 
healthy controls. We performed untargeted global metabolomic 
profiling of plasma from people with RRMS and healthy controls (n=27 
in each group) utilizing gas or liqu id chromatography coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectra obtained were compared to 
a reference library to identify individual compounds and the relative 
abundance was calculated using the area under the curve of the mass 
spectra. Using thi s method, we identified over [ADDRESS_736963] 
squares -discriminant analysis (OPLS -DA) (Figure 2).  
People with MS have alterations in both primary and secondary bile 
acid metabolism . In the first discovery cohort described above we noted 
reductions in the levels of multiple primary and secondary bile a cids in 
people with MS . To follow -up on our findings, we performed untargeted 
metabolomics in a validation cohort of 50 RRMS, 50 progressive MS 
and 50 healthy controls . In this study we again noted a reduction in multiple bile acids in RRMS and 
PMS groups (Figure 3A) . We also investigated alterations in individual metabolic pathways using 
pathway dysregulation scores (calculated as described in Drier et al) [28]. This method generates a score 
for a metabolic pathway for each individual based on their distance from a principal components curve 
constructed based on healthy control data. These scores range from [ADDRESS_736964]. We found significant alterations in both primary and 
secondary bile acid metabolism in RRMS and PMS groups  (Figure 3B & 3C). In this cohort, we also 
noted a correlation of PDS scores for secondary bile acid metabolism with those for xen obiotic Figure 2. Metabolomics differentiates 
people with MS from healthy controls.

metabolism (Xanthine and Benzoate, p<0.01 for both)  indicative of a link between the gut microbiota 
and bile acid metabolism . 
Since pathway analysis utilizes a priori  specification of metabolic pathways, we also used an agnostic 
method - weighted  correlation network analysis (WGCNA)  that identifies modules of highly correlated 
metabolites. We identified a module that contained bile acids and the eigen -metabolite values for this 
module differed significantly between RRMS, PMS and control groups wit h a reduction noted in bile 
acids in both RRMS and PMS groups (p<0.001 for both) .  
 
In animal -models of MS supplementation with bile acids leads to improvement of disease . We then 
tested the hypothesis that supplementation with a bile acid (TUDCA) would a lter the course of disease 
in a mouse model of MS - EAE. Seven -week old C57/BL6 mice were immunized with MOG 35-55 and 
CFA subcutaneously along with injection of pertussis toxin intraperitoneally (IP). Mice were then 
monitored for development of disease, an d at disease onset they were randomized to either TUDCA 500 
mg/kg or placebo (PBS) IP for 3 weeks. At the end of the experiment we noted a significant reduction in 
the severity of disease in the TUDCA treated group  (Figure 4A) and a reduction in spi[INVESTIGATOR_34407] d 
demyelination (based on Black -gold staining) and macrophage infiltration (Iba1+ cells) on histology  
(Figure 4B). Recent studies from other groups corroborate our findings; Ho & Steinman demonstrated 
that supplementation with a synthetic bile acid resulte d in reduction in severity of EAE [29]. 
Additionally, another independent group demonstrated the ability of a FXR agonist to reduce CNS 
inflammation through an IL -[ADDRESS_736965] [15].  Figure 3. Bile acid metabolism is

people with MS and healthy 
controls. In this study, 24 people 
with MS and 27 cont rols received 
5000 IU of vitamin D daily for 3 
months. We obtained plasma at 
beginning and end of the study and 
performed metabolomic profiling. 
We utilized WGCNA to identify 
metabolite modules and then 
utilized generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) to de termine the 
change in metabolite modules 
following vitamin D treatment. 
We found a reduction in markers 
of oxidative stress and alterations 
in lipid metabolism in healthy 
controls following vitamin D 
supplementation but noted a lack 
of a similar effect in people with MS (Figure 5). This study demonstrated the ability of metabolomics to 
track changes in metabolic pathways following a therapeutic intervention.   
These preliminary data clearly demonstrate that people with MS have altered bile acid metabolism an d 
that supplementation of a bile acid (TUDCA) had a beneficial effect in an animal model of MS . 
Additionally, we demonstrate that metabolomics can be used to monitor the effects of a therapeutic 
intervention in MS.  
We hypothesize that bile acid supplement ation in people with MS will be safe, well tolerated and lead to 
normalization of the bile acid profile and favorable immune and neuroprotective effects

While this trial is primarily focused on establishing the safety and tolerability o f TUDCA in 
patient s with progressive MS, the inclusion of a placebo group will enable us to determine 
whether changes observed in serum bile acid profiles, gut microbiota, immunophenotype and 
clinical/ quality of l ife measures are related to TUDCA treatmen t. This would prov ide 
information regarding the utility of pursuing larger trials focused on clinical outcomes in this 
patient population.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
 
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)  is a hydroph ilic bile acid that is normally produced 
endogenously in humans in the liver, by [CONTACT_560760]. It is used in Europe to 
treat cholestatic liver disease and gallstones. TUDCA has been used in trials for liver cirrhosis, 
primary biliary cirr hosis, transthyretin  related amyloidosis, cholesterol gallstones, diabetes, and 
ALS [30]–[33], with a good safety  profile. Diarrhea was the most common side effect noted in 
these studies, which utilized varied doses of TUDCA.  
As noted in the background section , we chose TUDCA as an intervention since it has been 
previously demonstrated to be safe  and have several be neficial effects (on ER stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, immunological effects and neuroprotection) that could potentially 
lead to benefits in patients with MS. Additionally since TUDCA can change the circulating bile 
acid pool this c ould potentially hel p correct this metabolic abnormality that we have identified in 
our preliminary studies.  
We will obtain TUDC A from Bruschettini S.r.l (Geno a, Italy). This medication is manufactured 
as 250 mg capsules and hence participants will take 4 capsules two times a  day of either TUDCA 
or placebo. The study medication will be provided through the Johns Hopkins investigational 
drug services and will appear identical to maintain blinding. TUDCA is approved in Italy for the 
treatment of cholestasis a nd gallstones. It wa s recently accorded orphan drug status by [CONTACT_560761].  
Dose : We chose a dose of 1 gm BID based on the trial of TUDCA in ALS that was recently 
completed across three ce nters in Italy [25]. Participants in this trial had no significant adverse

 events on TUDCA, and there appeared to be some evidence for a bene fit in this early ph ase 
study. This dose is  higher than the dose utilized in treatment of cholestatic disease  and is close to 
the 30 mg/kg dose utilized in a trial of UDCA in ALS that was well tolerated and showed no 
significant difference in serum and CSF  concentrations comp ared to a higher dose of 50 
mg/kg [27],[30] . 
Pharmacokinetics of TUDCA : Previous studies have demonstrated that about 65% of the oral 
dose of TUDCA is absorbed and then undergoes first pass metabolism in the liver followed by 
[CONTACT_560762][34]. Administration of bile acids such as UDCA and TUDCA 
results in a change in the overall serum bile acid concentration – between 1.9 – 8 fold and alters 
the composition of the bile acid po ol[35],[36] . A trial of UDCA in ALS also demonstrated dose -
dependent increased in CSF concentrations of the bile acid [27]. 
 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for 
non-FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  
populations ar e changed.  
 
N/A 
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  
 
We are using a non -FDA approved drug, however this will be utilized either with an IND or 
with an IND waiver from the FDA.  
 
 
7. Study Statis tics 
 
a. Primary outcom e variable . 
The primary outc ome of this study is the safety and tolerability of TUDCA supplementation. 
This will be based on number of adverse events occurring in the two treatment groups and 
the rate of drop -out in each study arm. This  data will be docume nted at each study visit.  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
 
1. Metabolomics  – We will store plasma before and after the study intervention to assess the 
effect of the study medication on fasting bile acid levels. This will enable us to determ ine 
whether the stud y drug raised the levels of bile acids that were deficient in people with MS. 
Targeted metabolomics analyses will be pe rformed  through Metabolon Inc.  
2. Gut microbiota –The composition of the gut microbiota is closely related to bile acid  
metabolism, and alt erations in bile acid receptor (FXR) signaling can significantly affect 
composition of the gut microbiota [37],[38] . We will collect first morning stool specimens 
prior to and following study treatment to determ ine the effect of bi le acid supplementation on 
the gut microbiota in people with MS.  
3. Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  – We will store PBMCs from before and after the study intervention to 
assess the effect of TUDCA supplementation on the peripheral immune system. Our 
laboratory has expertis e in immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_560746]: __ 01/11/2021__________________

Page 14 of 21 
 therapeutic interventions on peripheral immune cell function. These assays will be performed 
at the end of t he study . 
4. Other outcomes  – We will also collect information re garding quality of l ife using the 
MSQOL -54 instrument [39] administered at the visits noted in the table above. We wi ll also 
measure lipi d profile and hemoglobin A1c at baseline and end -of-study, since bile acid 
metabolism is linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.  
 
Assessment of important covariates : We will collect demographic information including age, 
gender, cigar ette smoking, waist circumference, and BMI which can affect circulating bile 
acid levels. Another critical factor that can affect bile acid metabolism and the gut microbiota 
is diet. Since TUDCA could potentially lead to GI side effects, this may result in  a change in 
diet. T o monitor changes in diet we will perform the Block Food frequency questionnaire 
before and after the study intervention48. Since antibiotics and probiotics can lead to changes 
in the gut microbiome and could also affect bile acid metabolism, we will collect detailed 
information on the use of both these co variates so they can  be adjusted for in our final 
analyses.  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
 
Safety data  will be analyzed as they are captured in real time. Assessments will focus on AEs 
(including study tre atment tolerability assessments, laboratory evaluations, vital signs and 
physical examination). The incidence rate of AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_9313], 
severity and by [CONTACT_78487]. Tolerability analysis will be based on the 
number (%) of particip ants who failed to complete the study due to adverse events. Lab 
values for each parameter will be summarized by [CONTACT_265558]. For quantitative parameters, we 
will present summary statistics for actual values and change from baseline. W e will compare 
chang es over the [ADDRESS_736970] for important 
covariates including BMI, age, gende r and measures deriv ed from the food frequency 
questionnaire.  
 
Gut microbiota data,  a priori  analyses will assess changes in relative abundances of different 
gut bacteria as well as microbial genes that encode bile acid metabolizing enzymes 
(identified fr om the literature an d NCBI Gene database) which occur as a result of TUDCA 
treatment. Exploratory analysis will assess the effects of TUDCA on the metagenome using a 
combination of pathway and set -based approaches previously applied in metagenomics 
analysi s of MS and other di seases to identify other biologically relevant changes [41]–[43].

 Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_193310] , we will  summarize data usin g summary statistics (mean and 
standard deviation), before and after study treatment. We will utilize paired t tests to compare 
proportions of various immune cell sub -populations at different time points. For both sets of 
data we will u tilize mixed -effects  regression models to assess the change in bacterial taxa/ 
metagenomics pathways/ immune cell subsets over time, and determine their relationship to 
changes in bile acid concentrations with TUDCA supplementation .   
 
Sample size justific ation  
Since this is primarily a safety study we based our sample size on the ability to detect 
changes in our secondary outcomes, especially metabolomics. Previous studies of 
supplementation of UDCA and TUDCA have resulted in alterations in the total serum  bile 
acid levels (2 -8 fold change) and the composition of the bile acid pool. Based on our 
preliminary data, to detect a 50 - 70% change in levels of an individual bile acid, with a 
power of 85% and two -tailed alpha of 0.05 the required sample size would be between 14 – 
27 in each arm. Accounting for a 10% drop -out rate, we will aim to recruit [ADDRESS_736971] previously noted significant alterations in metabolic profiles in 
MS patients treated with vitamin D and dimethyl f umarate in studies u tilizing between 18 -24 
patients (as shown in preliminary  data).  
From a safety stand -point, a sample size of 30 would enable us to conclude with 80% 
confidence that the rate of occurrence of serious adverse events with TUDCA treatment wa s 
less than 5% if no ne of the patients experienced a serious adverse event during the study [40].   
 
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] . 
 
We will discontinue treatment if a participant develops abnormal safety labs (serum AST or 
ALT > 3 x upper limit of nor mal, serum bilirubin  > 3 x upper limit of normal, eGFR < 
60ml/min/1.73m2), becomes pregnant during the study, cannot tolerate the drug, develops an 
adverse event grade [ADDRESS_736972] will determine if it is safe to resume 
the study.  Subjects who become suicidal during the study (codes 1 -4, 
http://www.fda.gov/do wnloads/Drugs/Guidan ceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidance
s/UCM225130.pdf ) will be referred to a psychiatrist or to a psychiatric emergency room for 
evaluation at the discretion of the site treating physician.  
 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : An independent DSMB  will be utilized for 
subject monitoring. The DSMB will consist of a neurologist, a hepatologist and a statistician. 
The DSMB will meet every 12 weeks  and any time an SAE occurs. All SAEs will be 
reported to the DSMB delegates within 24  hours of the study staff becoming aware of the 
SAE. The DSMB will be required to review SAEs and respond with recommendations within 
two business days. If more than 3 subjects experience serious adverse events, the study will 
be put on hold and the DSMB w ill decide on whethe r the adverse events were secondary to 
study treatment. They will make a judgement as to whether the study should continue and, if 
so, whether a reduction in TUDCA dosing or other protocol  modification s are recommended.

 8. Risks  
 
a. Medica l risks, listing all  procedures, their major and minor risks and expected 
frequency.  
 
TUDCA treatment : In previous studies of TUDCA and UDCA – adverse effects include – 
mainly GI related effects – diarrhea, constipation, gas, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pa in and 
anorexia, oth er adverse effects  which are less frequent  (< 1% each) include – headache, rash 
and pruritus  [25],[27],[30] .  
While no serious adverse effects have been note in  previous studies, s everal of the described 
AEs could lead to issues with tolerability in MS patients especially those with bowel function 
abnormalities.  
In a recent trial of TUDCA 1 gm twice daily in patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
there were  no serious adverse effects.  
 
Venipuncture : The potential risks include discomfort, bleeding or bruising at site of blood 
draw, and in rare cases fainting or infection.  
 
Clinical examination (including EDSS, MSFC):  There are no significant risks of this 
procedure.  
 
Stool spe cimen collection : There are no significant risks of this procedure.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 
TUDCA treatment : We are utilizing a dose of TUDCA that has recently been shown to be 
safe in a trial in another chronic neurologica l disorder. We are a lso monitoring safety labs 
and conducting neurological evaluations every 8 weeks to monitor fo r any adverse effects 
that may b e related to the treatment.  
 
Venipuncture : Blood will be drawn by a trained study team member.  
 
 
c. Plan for rep orting unanticipated  problems or study deviations.  
 
Unexpect ed Adverse Event : An adverse event is considered unexpected when its natur e or 
severity is not consistent with the product information (e.g. package insert safety 
information,  the investigational plan, the investigato r’s brochure, the protocol, or the 
informed consent form).

    Serious Adverse Event : A serious adverse event (any adverse event that suggests a 
significant  hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution) must be reported. This 
includes, but may not  be limited to, death, a life -threatening event, i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560747], persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, 
congenital  anomaly/ birth defect,  other protocol -specified conditi ons, or an event that  
requires intervention  to prevent permanent  impairment or damage.  Serious adverse events 
will be collected from informed consent signing  until 30 days after study completion or until 
30 days after a participant withdraws from the stud y. 
 
Grading of Advers e Events  
We will use the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 to report and grade all adverse events, whether or not they are 
related to disease progression or treatment.  The r elationship between a n adverse event and 
the study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_560763].  
   Serious Adverse Event Reporting  The following process for reporting a serious adverse event  
will ensure compliance  with the Internation al Conference on Harmonisation guidelines:  
1. The Institutional Review Board will be notified in one business day of a serious 
adverse event.  
2. Standard reporting will occur if the event is serious, expected and drug -related, 
serious, expec ted and not drug -related, or serious, unexpected and not drug -related.  
3. Expedited reporting is required if the event is serious, unexpected and drug -related. 
This type of event must be reported to the appropriate authorities within 15 days 
unless it is fata l or life -threatening ; a fatal or life -threatening event must be reported 
within 7 days.  
   Pregnancy Reporting Requirements:  Any pregnancy that occurs during  a clinical study with 
an investigational drug will be reported to the IRB and DSMB , and  pregnanc ies will be 
followed to their conclusion.  Female participants should immediately  inform the investigator 
of pregnancies and will stop taking the study medications. The  investigator will report 
pregnancies to the Institutional Review Board and DSMB  within one business day.  The 
investigator will counsel the participant about the risks of continuing the pregnancy  
 
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
 
Each participant  will be assigned a study identification n umber , and the data k ey will be kept 
in a separate, secure location.  Electronic records will be stored on a secure, password -
protected network.  Any paper records will be kept in a locked file cabinet inside a locked 
office.  These measures should prevent a breach of privacy.  T he consequences should be 
minimal, as the subjects with MS will have already established care and carried the diagnosis 
thereof.  There should be no social stigmata for the participants . 
 
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
 
There ar e no significant fina ncial risks to participants from this study.

9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
There are no individual medical benefits for participating in this study. As there is no 
curative treatm ent for MS , there is a glaring need for more knowledge and more effective 
treatment approaches for individuals with progressive MS. This study has the potential to 
benefit progressive MS patients in the future . 
 
 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensati on for participant s including possible total compensation, 
proposed bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the 
protocol.  
 
No compensation will be provided to subjects for participating in this trial.  
 
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of stud y procedure(s) or dru g (s) or substance(s) to participant s and 
identify who will pay for them.  
 
The subjects will not be charged for any of the procedures in the study. They will only be 
responsible for the cost of any travel to and from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560748]. The cos ts of parking at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560749].

BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE 
 Edentulism is a condition of being toothless, which impacts the patient’s ability in performing some daily tasks and affects their esthetic appearance and self- confidence  (Misch, 2007). Prostheses 
supported by [CONTACT_635785]’ quality of life by [CONTACT_1541] a pleasant appearance as well as comfort in speaking and chewing (Sargozaie et al., 2017). After extraction, the bony socket 
undergoes significant horizontal and vertical resorpti on especially in the maxillary posterior area 
(Chappuis et al., 2017). These changes often lead to more complex and time-consuming procedures, 
such as a lateral or transcrestal sinus lift, for placing implants in the area.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_635769], providers are faced with challenges such as elevated cost, higher morbidity, and 
more intra- and post-surgical complications. Thes e challenges may be overcome by [CONTACT_635786]. Howeve r, the definition of a short dental implant remains 
a topic of controversy. According to Striezel & Reichart, an implant with a length of ≤11 mm is 
considered short (Strietzel and Re ichart, 2007) whereas some authors consider a short implant to be 
<10 mm (Mezzomo et al., 2014, Telleman et al., 2014)  or <8 mm (Fan et al., 2017). Additionally, an 
implant with a length of ≤6.5 mm has been defined as extra-short (Anitua et al., 2014, Anitua et al., 
2015) . During the last decade, short implants have shown to be a reliable and effective alternative solution for patients with bone atrophies (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_635770]., 2017). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that 
unfavorable crown to implant (C/I) ratio is not related to increased biological complications or 
implant failure (Garaicoa-Pazmino et al., 2014). However, prevalence of peri-implantitis could present a greater concern due to the limited length , especially for people with previous history of 
periodontitis. A recent meta-analysis on short implants versus standard implants in the posterior jaw that included 13 studies with 1269 patients and 2631 implants showed no significant difference in 
implant survival, marginal bone loss, complications, or prosthesis failure. Nevertheless, it was 
 
4 
 concluded that short implants with <[ADDRESS_849598]-length ( ≥8mm) implants  (Lemos et al., 2016). In a systematic 
review based on the evaluation of 8 randomized cont rolled clinical trials (RCTs), the European 
Academy of Osseointegration (EAO) Consensus C onference in 2015 noted that longer dental 
implants in the augmented sinus caused a higher number of biological complications, increased 
morbidity, costs and surgical time. Therefore, shor ter dental implants may be the preferred treatment 
alternative (Thoma et al., 2015). A recent multicente r, randomized, controlled clinical trial found that 
short implants (6 mm) for single-tooth restorations  in the posterior maxilla were a viable solution 
versus longer implants ( ≥10mm) in combination with sinus lift. After three years of follow-up and 
with a residual ridge height of 5–[ADDRESS_849599] in both groups and no statistically 
significant difference in prosthet ic complications were reported  (Pohl et al., 2017). All these studies 
excluded patients with a previous history of periodontitis. 
 
 
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and radiological parameters of 5 mm short implants 
(GS) compared to longer implants (GL) (10 mm) placed in sinus-grafted sites. 
 Null Hypothesis (H
0): There are no statistically significa nt clinical or radiographic outcome 
differences between the two groups, GS and GL.  
Alternative Hypothesis (H 1): There are statistically significant  clinical or radiographic outcome 
differences between the two groups, GS and GL. 
 
 
STUDY DESIGN 
 
The present study will be a parallel, randomized single center clinical trial performed according to 
the CONSORT statement (http://www.consort-statement.org/). 
Two different treatment modalities, GS and GL, will be compared in this randomized clinical trial. 
GS subjects will receive a short dental implant (5 mm in length) with no sinus lift whereas GL 
subjects will receive a [ADDRESS_849600] (IRB) for the Medical Sciences at the University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor, MI, must review and approve this study befo re enrollment of participants begins. It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to assure that all aspects of the institutional review are conducted in 
accordance with current Federal Regulations.  A lett er with IRB approval for the protocol must be 
received by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_635771]. Amendments to the protocol 
will be subject to the same requirements as the original protocol.  At each annual protocol renewal, 
an updated report of the numbers of samples and any adverse events will be provided to the IRB.  
After completion or termination of the study, the investigator will submit a final report to the IRB.  
This report should include any deviations from the protocol, the number of patients evaluated, 
adverse events, and a conclusion summarizing the results. This study will also be registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, the study will be conducted according to the principles outlined in 
the Declaration of Helsinki on experimentati on involving human subjects, as revised in 2000. 
Partially edentulous patients requiring an implant to  replace a missing tooth in the maxillary premolar, 
1st molar, or 2nd molar area with bone crest heig ht more than 5 mm but less than 8 mm will be 
recruited for this trial. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled (half randomized for each group) in the 
Periodontics and Oral Medicine clinic at the Univer sity of Michigan School of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, 
Michigan.  

 
[ADDRESS_849601] will also be given a copy of his/her 
informed consent. 
Patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to the research study will receive a 
dental implant at no cost and an implant crown at re duced cost to replace their missing tooth. Research 
subjects will be followed for 24 months (± 1 mont h) after implant placement, for a total of 23-26 
months (see Appendix A: Schedule of Events) for the entire study. Subjects will complete 10 research 
visits as described in the Study Procedures.

 STUDY PROCEDURES 
Clinical measurements 
1) The following measurements will be taken for each treated implant by a blinded, calibrated 
examiner at the implant placement (surgery V2), at the time of prosthetic placement (5-month post-
op V6), 12-month follow-up (V8), and 24-month follow-up (V10). 
  Marginal bone level (MBL): It  will be calculated based on standardized radiographs using 
registered bite-block with a Rinn (Dentsply Rinn, Elgin, IL, [LOCATION_003]) film holder and expressed 
as the distance from the implant shoulder to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact (BIC) 
on the mesial and distal side of the implant. The mean values will be calculated for each 
implant at the time of implant placement, at th e time of prosthetic placement (5-month post-
op V6), 12-month follow-up (V8), and at 24-month follow-up (V10). In the case that the 
bone levels around the study implants are hidden or difficult to read, new radiographs will 
be taken. Peri-implant marginal bone levels will be measured using the ImageJ software* 
(ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, [LOCATION_003]) (Schneider et al., 
2012). The software will be calibrated for every single image using the known implant 
length or the length of the implant collar. Me asurements of the mesial and distal bone crest 
level adjacent to each implant will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm. Implants with bone up 
to the coronal margin of the implant collar will be given a value of zero. Mesial and distal 
measurements of each implant are averaged, and a mean calculated at patient level and then at group level.  
 [COMPANY_003] and BOP: It will be assessed at 4 sites pe r implant (mesial, distal, buccal, and palatal) 
with a measurement stent using a periodontal probe (UNC, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, [LOCATION_003]). 
[COMPANY_003] are measured from the distance of the mucosal margin to the bottom of the probable pocket in mm. BOP is recorded using the foll owing scoring method: 0) no bleeding 1) an 
isolated bleeding spot is visible, 2) blood form s a confluent red line on margin, and 3) heavy 
or profuse bleeding. 
 Plaque: The level of oral hygiene will be evaluated using the Modified gingival index (Lobene 
et al., 1986) (Scores 1-4).  0 = Absence of inflammation 
1 = Mild inflammation or with slight changes in color and texture but not in all portions of 
gingival marginal or papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] 
2 = Mild inflammation, such as the preceding criteria, in all portions of gingival marginal or 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] 
 
9 
 3 = Moderate, bright surface inflammation, erythema, edema and/or hypertrophy of gingival 
marginal or papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] 
4 = Severe inflammation: erythema, edema and/or marginal gingival hypertrophy of the unit 
or spontaneous bleeding, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], congestion or ulceration. 
 Prosthesis failure: Planned prosthesis which c ould not be placed due to implant failure(s), 
loss of the prosthesis secondary to implant failure(s), or replacement of the definitive 
prosthesis for any reason.  
 Implant failure: It will be defined as implan t mobility (assessed from force applied with two 
hand instrument), pain, or neuropathy.  
 Implant success: It will be defined as 1) Absen ce of persistent subjecti ve complaints such as 
pain, foreign body sensation and/or dysesthesia 2) Absence of a peri-implant infection with 
suppuration 3) Absence of mobility 4) Absen ce of a continuous radiolucency around the 
implant and 5) Absence of any biological or prosthetic complications (Buser et al., 2012)  
 Peri-implantitis: It will be defined as detectable radiographic bone loss beyond the initial 
biological bone remodeling. 
2) The following measurements will be taken for each treated implant by a blinded, calibrated 
examiner after implant placement, 12-month follow-up, and 24-month follow-up.  
 Bone thickness (BT): It will be determined based on CBCT and expressed as the distance 
from the most coronal bone-implant contact [CONTACT_635789]. The mean values will be calculated for each implant.  
3) The following measurements will be taken for each treated implant by a blinded, calibrated 
examiner at prosthetic placement, 12-month follow-up, and 24-month follow-up. 
 Crown to implant ratio: The height of the crowns will be measured on the radiographs from 
the implant-abutment interface to the most coronal point on the crown. The anatomical crown-to-implant ratio (anatomical C/I ratio) will then be calculated dividing the anatomical 
crown by [CONTACT_635790].4) 
 
4)  ISQ (Implant stability quotiant) will be m easured at the time of healing abutment placement. 
Intra-operatory measurements  
 Subjective evaluation of the bone type (Lekholm & Zarb 1985) during implant site 
preparation will be performed by [CONTACT_11065].  
- Type 1: Almost entirely comprised of homogeneous compact bone 
 
10 
 - Type 2: thick layer of compact bone surrounding a core of dense trabecular bone 
- Type 3: thin layer of cortical bone surrounding a core of dense trabecular bone 
- Type 4: Thin layer of cortical bone surrounding a core of low-density trabecular bone 
coupled with the surgeon’s tactile perception 
 Thickness of soft tissues will be measured with a 1.0-mm marked periodontal probe (UNC, 
Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, [LOCATION_003]) on the top of bone crest in the center of future implant 
placement. This will ensure direct visibility  of mucosal thickness during measurement. 
 Patient phenotype: Classification of the patient’s phenotype will be thin, medium, thick, or 
very thick by [CONTACT_635791] (Hu-Friedy). 
 Chair time of the surgical procedure will be recorded from the end of local anesthesia until 
the completion of sutures. 
 The time required for placement of one single implant, with both treatments (short implants 
and sinus floor elevation with placement of longer implants) will be calculated as follows: 
the time required for the entire surgical pr ocedure (from anesthesia to sutures) will be 
assessed for each patient and divided by [CONTACT_635792]. The ratio of the 
time required for placement of a single short implant to the time required for a sinus floor 
elevation procedure in combination with a long er implant will be calculated and expressed 
as a percentage.  
 A wireless magnetic-based Osstell Mentor RF Analyzer (Ostell [LOCATION_003], Linthicum, MD, [LOCATION_003]) 
will be used to assess primary implant stability. The designated transducer (SmartPeg) will be hand-tightened per the manufacturer’s instructions to the fixture. ISQ values will be taken 
immediately after implant placement and measured in triplicate and averaged to yield the 
mean baseline ISQ value for each implant.  
Clinical measurement to monitor early healing 
 At the 2-week post-op suture removal visit (± 2 days after surgery) clinical photographs will 
be taken. In addition, data on soft tiss ue complications (edema, bleeding), general 
discomfort, pain (measured by [CONTACT_635793] 0 to  100) (Appendix A) and patient satisfaction 
(Appendix B) will also be collected at the 2-week post-op visit.  
 Demographic data and patient questionnaires  
At the pre-surgical visit, age, gender, smoking ha bits (number of cigarettes/day) will be recorded.  
At the 2-week post-op visit, data on post-opera tive pain during the first day and possible side 
 
[ADDRESS_849603]-opera tive pain medication quantified. Patients will 
receive 3 sheets containing the VAS scale to be fi lled out daily. In case of drop out, the related 
reason will be registered (Appendix B).  
Furthermore, all patients will be asked at the 2-weeks, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up to give 
their perception of the received therapy by [CONTACT_12550] a questionnaire concerning function, 
esthetics, cleaning of the implant-supported rest orations, satisfaction, and cost (Appendix C).  
Screening & Pre-surgical procedures  
The medical history and vitals (heart rate and blo od pressure) will be taken. In addition, clinical 
photographs and one standardized periapi[INVESTIGATOR_635772]. A CBCT scan will be 
taken before implant placement for screening eligibility, and impressions will be taken for surgical 
guide preparation. The CBCT scan may be scheduled separately due to availability of the CBCT 
machine. 
 
Randomization and masking of examiners 
The randomization of the patients to either the test  (5-mm implant) or control group (10-mm implant) 
is determined using a computer-generated randomization list (www.random.org). After 
administration of a local like 2% Li docaine with 1:100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], su lcular incisions at the adjacent 
teeth and a midcrestal incision will be performed, al lowing reflection of a full-thickness flap. At this 
stage, the randomization concealment will be broken, and the surgical site will be prepared according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
Surgical procedures 
The medical history and vitals (heart rate and blood pressure) will be taken prior to the surgical 
procedure. In addition, clinical photographs will be taken during the surgical procedure. An implant 
surgical guide for partially edentulous patients will be fabricated according to procedure previously 
described by [CONTACT_635794] (Shotwell et al. 2005).

8. Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_635774] (Type I) using the Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_635775] 15-20 rpm. Final seating of the Short Dense bone Tap may require the use of the Ratchet Extension and the Ratchet Wrench.  
9. The implant will be placed into the prepared si te at approximately 15-20 rpm. Final seating 
of the implant may require the use of a Ratchet Extension and Ratchet Wrench. 
10. To remove the implant mount, Open End Wrench will be placed onto the mount. The screw 
is loosened at the top of the mount with a Large Hex Driver or Large Hex Driver Tip 
inserted into the Right-Angle Driver or Low Torque Indicating Ratchet Wrench and rotate 
counter-clockwise. After the screw is completely loosened, the Open End Wrench will be 
rotated counter-clockwise slightly before removing the mount. The mount can be carried 
from the mouth with the Open End Wrench.  
11. Cover Screw from the No-Touch Implant Tray with the Small Hex Driver (PHD00N) is 
placed onto the implant at no more than 10 Ncm.  
12. Soft-tissue flaps will be secured and repositioned with sutures.

3. 2.8 mm reamer (SCA kit, Neobiotech, Seoul, South Korea) will then be inserted with different 
stoppers until the sinus memb rane wall is fractured.   
4. After the sinus membrane wall is fractured, a gauge will then be applied to check sinus wall 
surrounding to ensure membrane is lifted from the sinus wall.   
5. Subsequently, bone graft (human allograft) small particle (size 250µm to 850 µm) will be 
inserted into the osteotome sites then slowly tapped into the sinus floor either by [CONTACT_635795]/spreader (SCA kit, Neobiotech, Seoul,  South Korea) or osteotome instrument by 
[CONTACT_635796]. These instruments should not enter the sinus cavity. 
6. The sinus floor should be elevated to at least 2 mm height longer than the desired implant 
length due to bone shrinkage occurring after healing.  
7. Implant osteotome drills will be used to drill the osteotome site to the final diameter size 
according to the manufacturer’s guideline, but only to the level of remaining bone height.  
Again, the instruments should not enter the sinus cavity to avoid any potential perforation. 
8. 10mm length of Zimmer T3 with DCD Ex Hex Parallel Walled implant will be placed into 
the prepared hole. 
9. Cover Screw is placed onto the implant at no more than 10 Ncm.  
10. Soft-tissue flaps will be secured and repositioned with sutures. 
11. Final periapi[INVESTIGATOR_635776].  
All surgeries will be performed under local anesthesia using one or more of the following 
medications: 
 Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], (Xylocaine 2%®-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000 and 1:50,000, 
Dentsply Pharmaceutical, York, PA, [LOCATION_003]). 
 Articaine (Septanest 4%®-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000, Dentsply Pharmaceutical, York, PA,

[ADDRESS_849606]-surgical instructions 
All subjects will be prescribed and instructed to take the following oral antibiotics after surgery: 
500 mg amoxicillin (GlaxoSmithkline) three times per day for 7 days, or 300 mg clindamycin (if 
allergic to penicillin) four times per day for 7 days. In addition, 600 mg of ibuprofen (Brufen; 
Abbott S.R.L., Latina, Italy) as needed, and chlorhexidine mouthwashes 0.12% twice daily for 2 
weeks. Subjects with a removable prosthesis will be  instructed  to not wear them during the healing 
phase. The sutures will be removed after 2 weeks. Any surgical complication will be recorded such 
as infection, pain, and other adverse events.  
 Prosthetic placement 
After 4 months of submerged healing, exposure of the implant and placement of a healing abutment 
is performed. After  2 weeks, the sutures are removed. After 5 months of submerged healing, 
impressions via pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up impression copi[INVESTIGATOR_635777] a polyether material (Impregum 3M/ESPE, Neuss, [LOCATION_013]) and/or a digital scan (TRIOS, 3Shape, Denmark). Within 1 to 3 weeks,

The study coordinator and investigator will make an accurate and adequate written progress reports 
to the IRB at appropriate intervals not exceeding one year. The investigator will make an accurate 
and adequate final report to the IRB within [ADDRESS_849607] a minimum clini cally significant difference in bone loss of 0.5 
mm using α = 0.05, a power (1- β) = 80%.  Considering possible dr opouts, the number of patients 
will also be increased by 10% for each arm. On the basis of this data, the minimum needed number 
of patients to be enrolled in this study is [ADDRESS_849608] group (GS) and 17 for the control group 
(GL). Mean values, standard deviations, and medians will be calculated for the clinical 
parameters. The association between crown-implant ratio and final bone loss as well as prosthetic 
complications will be examined. Changes of the parameters over time within the two groups as well 
as differences between groups will be analyzed using repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
 
 
PATIENT SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE 
 
Deviations 
The investigator will not deviate from the protocol without obtaining written approval from the IRB.  
Any other changes or deviation in the protocol will be made as an amendment to the protocol and must be approved by [CONTACT_635797].  Risks associated with dental x-rays 
In this study, patients will have about eight standard dental x-rays and two CBCT scans. They should 
experience no more discomfort related to the x-rays  than they would with x-rays taken during regular 
dental visits. The only discomfort may be related to the x-ray film or film holder pressing on the soft 
tissues.   
The biologic effect of radiation is termed “effec tive dose” (EF) and is expressed in milliSieverts 
(mSv). The amount of radiation for one dental x-ray is about 0.[ADDRESS_849609] udy treatment(s) or other available 
treatments. The likelihood that the patient will be assigned a treatment that will be less effective than 
other study treatments or other available treatments is unknown. Both surgery methods are the 
standard of care. Mild to moderate pain and swelling is expected for both groups. There is a very low 
risk of uncontrolled bleeding that may occur with subjects that are in general good health and not 
taking medications that are classified as a blood-thinner. In some cases, subjects may feel some 
temporary sensitivity with the teeth next to the implant. 
 
Implant Related Risks 
1) Implant Failure 
2) Biologic complications such as sinus membrane perforations, persistent bleeding, sinusitis (or 
acute sinus infection), rupture of sinus membrane , soft tissue (graft) dehiscence, abscess, pus, 
pain, swelling, peri-implant mucositis (heavily inflamed soft tissue without bone loss), or 
peri-implantitis (bone loss around the implant). 
3) Prosthetic complications such as fixed prosthet ic device detachment, loosening of abutment 
screws or healing caps, and fracture of the screw, framework, or occlusal material. 
 
Risk of Sinus Lift 
A major risk of a sinus augmentation is that the sinus membrane could be pi[INVESTIGATOR_635783]. There 
are other risks involved including infection, inflammation, hematoma, pain, graft failure, sinusitis, 
and hemorrhage. 
 
Risk of Bone Graft  
Donor bone (allograft) will be used  during this study. This material has been used for more than [ADDRESS_849610] of care risks.  
Adverse Events (AE) 
One of the following determinations will be used to document the relationship of any adverse events 
to the study test material:  
 NOT RELATED 
 POSSIBLE 
 PROBABLE  
 
ANY SERIOUS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT INCLUDING HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_635784], WHICH OCCURS DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, WHETHER 
OR NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY, MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY (WITHIN 24 
HOURS) TO THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. Reports  of serious or unexpected adverse events 
will be made immediately to: [CONTACT_635801]-Ju Oh, Ph one number: ([PHONE_13233] or [CONTACT_375700] Ravidà, 
Phone number: ([PHONE_13234]. 
 
This telephone report or fax must be followed within [ADDRESS_849611]’s pa rticipation in the study even if they want to 
continue to participate. For instance, a subject may be  withdrawn if the researcher believes that it is 
not in their best interest to stay in the study, if they become ineligible to participate, if their condition changes and they need treatment that is not allowed while taking part in the study, or if the subject 
does not follow instructions from the researchers.

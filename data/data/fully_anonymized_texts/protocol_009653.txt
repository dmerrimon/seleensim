M923 (BAX2923) is a proposed similar biological medical product (hereafter referred to 
as “proposed biosimilar”) to HUMIRA®(adalimumab, [COMPANY_013], Inc.; hereafter referred to 
as “Humira”). Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF- α). 
Unlike etanercept, adalimumab does not bind to tumor necrosis factor–beta. Adalimumab was first approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and, later, for several other inflammatory conditions and has since been used widely, including in many large clinical studies. Hence, its effectiveness, tolerability, and safety are well established.
M923 is produced by [CONTACT_16238] (DNA) technology in a 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Clinical Condition/Indication
The medical need for a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) is demonstrated with the 
approval and use of the originator product Humira and its place in the treatment of several chronic autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult and pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and adult and pediatric plaque psoriasis.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with approximately 
symmetrical inflammation of the joints of the hands and feet, leading to joint destruction, CCI
CCI
M923 Page 19of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_18792] AUG 26
and paraproteinemia (“rheumatoid factor”). The condition is associated with increased 
morbidity  and mortality from all causes, and requires long -term treatment.2;3;[ADDRESS_1272498] their medication gain control of their treatment 
schedule (within the limits of the product label) and treatment setting, thus improving 
their treatment experience.5However, there are barriers to self -injection, including 
dexterity  problems and injection anxiety , which can prevent self
-injection being used 
successfull y and lead to lower treatment adherence.5This study  seeks to evaluate 
usability  of a SC AI for M923 in subjects with active, moder ate to severe RA.
6.3Population 
to Be Studied
The study  will enroll 32 subjects with active, moderate to severe RA. Adult ( ≥18 y ears) 
male and female subjects will be considered to be eligible provided that they satisfy  all of 
the eligibility criteria listed in Section 9.1and Section 9.2.
6.4Findings f
rom Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
M923 has been characterized and compared with US - and European Union (EU)-sourced 
Humira using a battery of nonclinical in vitro assay s, as well as an in vivo 
pharmacokinetics ( PK)study  in mice , and a PK and immunoge nicity study in 
cynomolgus monkey s. The results of the pharmacology , PK, and immunogenicity  
assessments demonstrated similar biological activity  of M923 and Humira. Specificall y, 
the results indicated that M923 was similar to Humira in terms of binding act ivity for 
soluble human TNF -α, the human Fcγ receptor, human C1q complex, and the human 
neonatal Fc receptor; activity  in the antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity  and 
complement -dependent cy totoxicity  assay s; potency  inthe L929 mouse fibroblast cell 
line assay ; in vivo single -dose PK profile in mice and cynomolgus monkey s; and 
immunogenicit y
(in vivo in cy nomolgus monkey s and ex vivo T-cell proliferation in 
human dendritic cells) .
The PK profiles, safet y, tolerability, and immunogenicity  of M923, US Humira and 
EUHumira PK of M923 were evaluated in healthy  volunteers in aPhase 1, randomized, 
double -blind, 3 -arm, parallel -group, single -dose clinical study  (Study  #911301). Subjects 
received a single dose ( 40mg) of M923 o r Humira (US Reference Product or EU 
Reference Protein Product) and were 
followed- up for 71 day s. Overall 324 healthy  
subjects were randomized and treated. All randomized subjects completed the study .
M923 Page 20of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_18792] AUG 26
Mean serum concentration -time profiles for M923 (n=107) , EU Humira (n=103), and 
USHumira (n=105) were similar in the primary  PK anal ysis set of subjects. Median time 
to maximum concentration was 144.[ADDRESS_1272499]-squares mean 
ratios for the primary  PK parameters [C max(maximum concentration) , AUC (area under 
the curve) (0-inf), and AUC( 0-336)] and secondary PK parameters [AUC( 0-672), AUC( 0-840), 
AUC( 0-1008), AUC( 0-1344), and AUC( 0-last)] were fully  contained within the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) bounds of 80.00% to125.00% for all treatment pairings. The 
secondary  anal yses performed utilizing PK analy sis subsets based on immunogenicity  
designations ( anti-drug antibody  [ADA] PK analysis set and non- ADA PK anal ysis set; 
neutralizing ADA [nADA] PK analy sis s et and non -nADA PK analy sis set ) supported the 
primary  anal ysis results.
Adalimumab exposure was weakl y correlated with formation of confi rmed ADAs and/or 
nADAs in subjects with low confirmed ADA tit ers. Review of individual adalimumab 
versus concentration time profiles did not reveal a consistent relationship between time of 
appearance of ADA or nADAs and time of last quantifiable adalimuma b concentrations 
or with shape of the terminal phase in subjects with low titers at low titer s (<1:8). ADAs
with higher tit ers which appeared earlier after administration tended to be associated with 
a shorter time to last quantifiable concentration and el imination half -life. These 
observations appeared to be independent of treatment.
There appeared to be a relationship of lower overall exposure (AUC) and half-lifeand 
higher apparent clearance (CL /F) in the presence of ADAs compared to absence of ADAs 
(ADA versus non-ADA population) and in the presence of nADAs compared to absence 
of nADAs (nADA versus non-nADA population). It should be noted that these apparent 
ADA
-correlated differences were independent of treatment (M923, US Humira ,or 
EUHumira) .
The overall incidence of ADA and nADA was comparable in each group (78.0% and 
16.5%, respectively , for subjects on M923; 78.5% and 20.6% for EU Humira and 80.6% 
and 27.8% for USHumira).
In this stud y (Study #911301), M923, US Humira ,and EUHumira were safe and well 
tolerated in the healthy  subjects. No subjects died or withdre w from the study  due to an 
AE. One subject reported SAEs of foot fracture, wound infection, and laceration as a 
result of trauma. All [ADDRESS_1272500] 1 AE was comparable among the 
M923 Page 21of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_18792] AUG 26
3 treatment arms, ranging from 47.7% to 53.3%. Most of the AEs were considered mild 
and unrelated to treatment by  [CONTACT_941] i nvestigators. The number of subjects with severe AEs 
was low. Injection site reactions were mostly  mild. No clinically  significant trends over 
time or between the [ADDRESS_1272501] rocardiogram (ECG) results.
Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated 
for all primary  treatment comparisons 
(M923/US Humira; M923/ EUHumira; EU Humira/US Humira) in Study # 911301. 
M923 was demonstrated to be well -tolerated and to have a safet y profile comparable with 
those of EU Humira and US Humira after a single dose .
6.5Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to 
Human Subjects
All risks, contraindications, precautions, dosage and administration considerations, drug 
interac tions and overdose considerations that have been described for Humira appl y to 
M923 (see Section 9.2 of the I nvestigator’s Brochure [IB] for M923) . The safet y profile 
of M923 is anticipated to be similar to that of Humira ; however, i nvestigators should 
carefully  monitor for all AEs, including AEs not described as associated with Humira.
6.6Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council 
forHarmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996), 
Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations, the European Clinical Trial Directive 
(2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC), and applicable national and local regulatory

usability  of an AI and safety  of M923 targeting a total of 32 subjects w ithactive,
moderate to severe RA . 
The overall study  design is illustrated in Figure 1.
8.3
Duration of Study Period(s) and Subject Participation
The overall duration of the study  is up to 10 months from study  initiation (ie, first subject 
enrolled) to study  completion (ie, last subject last visit). The recruitment period is 
expected to be [ADDRESS_1272503] (ie, last study  visit), is up to 32 weeks (4 -week S creening period, 4- week 
treatment period, 20-week treatment extension period, and 4- week safety  follow - up 
period). Subjects who are considered inadequate responders, or who withdraw earl y or 
choose not to cont inue to the treatment extension period will continue for a 4-week safet y 
follow -up period
. All other subjects will enter the safet y follow- up period on completion 
of the treatment extension period. An inadequate response is defined as a 
<20% improvement in
the swollen joint count and tender joint count from Baseline to 
Week 12. Subjects with an inadequate response will be counseled about their treatment 
options and discontinue treatment at the Week [ADDRESS_1272504] -Self-injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) 
modules at Week 4 ( see 
Section 20.4).

10. STUDY PROCEDURES
10.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment
Any patient who provides informed consent (ie, signs and dates the informed consent 
form [ICF] and assent form, if applicable) is considered a study subject and enrolled in the study.
10.[ADDRESS_1272525] Identification Code
 All study documents 
(eg, CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Additionally, a uniquely coded SIC(s) is permitted as long as 
it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (eg, collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in 
compliance with laws governing data privacy.
10.3 Screening and Study Visits
The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re-screened with the approval of the medical advisor or sponsor study physician, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject.
The overall study design is illustrated in the  Figure 1.  Details on the procedures to be 
performed at each study visit, including Screening, can be found in Section 20.[ADDRESS_1272526] be performed within 28 days of Baseline, allowing enough time from Screening (Visit 1, Days -28 to Baseline) to Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1) in order to ensure eligibility requirements for Screening are met.[COMPANY_003]

Usability  will be assessed using the SIAQ tool (version [v] 2. 1), which is a valid, reliable 
PRO instrument in patients with RA.5
The PRE -SIAQ module (v2. 1) is a 7-item questionnaire that investigates feelings about 
injections, self
-confidence (regarding self- administration), and satisfaction with 
self-injection (each i tem graded on a 5 -point scale).5The POST -SIAQ module (v2. 1) is a 
27 item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self- image, self -confidence 
(regarding self -administration), pain and skin reactions during or after the injection 
(injection -site reactions), ease of use of the self -injection device, and satisfaction with 
self-injection. Each item graded on either a 5 -point or 6 -point scal e (see Section 20.4)
Subjects will complete the PRE -and POST
-SIAQ questionnaires prior to and after 
self-administration of IP, respectivel y, Q2W during the initia l 4-week treatment period 
(see Section 20.2).This assessment should be recorded in the eCRF.
11.2 Secondary Usability Assessments
Secondary  usabilit y measures are observer assessment of usability b y subjects as 
determined b y (i) ability  to successfull y follow the steps in the IFU to self -administer 
M923 via the AI and (ii) investigation of the frequency
 of observed or reported 
diffic ulties (‘potential hazards’) at Week 4, as well as change over time. At Weeks 0, 2, 
and 4 (Visits 2 to 4), the observer should observe the subject perform self -injection and 
complete the observer questionnaire (see Sections 20.4 and 20.6). In addition, usability  
evaluations at Baseline and Week

therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fev er, dizziness, etc.) , conditions (eg, peritonitis, 
bacteremia, etc.) ,or outcome of death temporally  associated with the use of an IP, 
whether or not considered causall y related to the IP .
A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event not present prior to 
the initiation of the treatments or an y event already present that worsens in either 
intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the treatments.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dos e meets one or 
more of the following criteria:
1. Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death)
2.Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment
of the investigator , at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it been more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906220] –inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1667],
regardless of length of stay

6.Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may  not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906221] e. Examples of such events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic
bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependence or drug abuse
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HI V, HBV, or HCV

Uncomplicated pregnancies , following maternal or paternal exposure to I Pare not 
considered an (S)AE; however, an y pregnancy complication or pregnancy  termination by  
[CONTACT_1728], elective, or spontaneous abortion shall be considered an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)
Any suspected adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active comparators) that 
is both serious and unexpected.
The event(s) must meet all of the following
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment (seeSection [IP_ADDRESS])
Once determined to meet the criteria for a S[LOCATION_003]R, a serious adverse event should be 
submitted to regulatory  agencies expeditiously .
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Serious Adverse Event
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as an y serious adverse 
effect on health or safet y or an y life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity , or degree of incidence in the study  protocol o r product labeling, or an y 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safet y, or welfare of subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity , specificit y, or outco me is 
not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y 
Information ( RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologica l properties of 
the product , but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product
under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using 
the IB as the RSI . This determination will include considerations 
such as the number of 
AEs previously  observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of a product.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing Diseases
Pre-existing diseases that are present before entry  in to the study  are described in th e 
medical history, and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration 
after IP exposure, will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an increase in the 
severit y, duration, or frequency of a pre -existing disease, the event must b e described on 
the AE CRF.
12.1.[ADDRESS_1272541] undergoing study -related procedure(s) before the first M923 treatment will 
be recorded on the AE CRF; for SAEs the SAE Report ( SAER )form is to be used ,in 
addition; however, these events will not be included in the anal ysis of AEs .
Each treatment -emergent AE (non-serious AE or SAE) from the first M923 exposure 
until study  completion/discontinuation or [ADDRESS_1272542] M923 treatment will
be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis 
could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a sy mptom or sign, in standard 
medical terminology  in order to avoid 
the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions (see definition in Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the 
investigator for:
1.
Seriousness as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
2.Severity  as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
3.Causal relationship to I P exposure ,study  procedure , or device as defined in
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if 
applicable action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug 
interrupted, drug discontinued , not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the 
AE CRF. Recovering/resol ving AEs will be followed until resolution, medically
stabilized, or 4weeks after the study  completion/termination visit, whichever comes first.
If the severity  rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original 
AE report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the 
course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported.
Treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, 
and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected 
pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed 
M923 Page 48of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_18792] AUG 26
with regar d to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy, and/or other observations because 
these events may be reportable to regulatory  authorities.
Any pregnancy  that occurs after administration of M923 will be reported on a Pregnancy  
Report Form and followed- up at estimated date of delivery  and [ADDRESS_1272543] be reported on the provided SAE R Form within 24 hours 
after becoming aware ; no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description below:
1.Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner
with the subject’s normal functioning level
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require m inimal therapeutic
intervention
2.Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require therapeutic
intervention
The AE produces no sequel a/sequelae
3.Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may lead to temporary
inabili ty to resume usual life pattern
The AE produces sequel a/sequelae , which require (prolonge d) therapeutic
intervention
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severit y of an AE with a 
study -related procedure(s) , if necessary .

Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_18792] AUG 26
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality  assessment includes, eg, 
assessment of temporal relationships, de- challenge/re -challenge information, association 
(or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely  
cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the i nvestigator will assess the causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE usin g his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
1. Not related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P
A more likely  alternative etiology  exists
2.
Related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may
include but is not limited to the following
:
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration of IP (positive
re-challenge)
oPositive results in a drug sensitivity  test (skin test, etc.)
oToxic level of the I P as evidenced by  [CONTACT_279525] I P
concentrations in the blood or other bodily  fluid
Another etiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely
For events assessed as not related or unlikel y related and occurring within 
72hours , the 
investigator shall provide the alternative etiology . These causality  definitions will also be 
used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study -related procedure(s), if nece ssary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Reporting
Adverse events/SAEs will be assessed at all s tudy visits as outlined in Table 2and 
Section12.1 above.
Adverse Events/SAEs are to be recorded on the AE page ofthe eCRF. Each event should 
be recorded separatel y.
Any SAE, including death due to any  cause, which oc curs during this study , whether or 
not related to the IP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study  site’s 
first knowledge of the event). All SAEs must be reported via the Electronic Data Capture

examination will be conducted , limited to include the following bod y systems: heart, 
lungs, abdomen, extremities, and skin, and an y other assessments required to evaluate 
A
Es.
At Screening, if an abnormal condition is detected, the condition will be described on the 
medical history  CRF. At study  visits, if a new abnormal or worsened abnormal 
pre-
existing condition is detected, the condition will be described on the AE CRF. If the 
abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a 
pre-existing disease (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), not clinically  significant, a symptom 
of a new/worsened condition already recorded as an AE, or due to another issue that will 
be specified, the investigator will record the justification on the source record.

12.8 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include body  temperature ( °C or ° F), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (breaths/min), pulse 
rate (beats/min), and s ystolic and diastolic blood p ressure (mmHg). Height (in or cm) and 
weight (lb or kg) will also be collected.
Vital signs will be measured at Screening and within 30 minutes before and after 
administration of I P at each study  visit, and at study  completion/termination
(seeTable 2). Blood pressure will be measured when subjects are resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_206142] 5 minutes .Height will be measured at Screening onl y.
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the CRF. For each abnormal 
vital sign value, the 
investigator will determine whether or not to report an AE (see definition in Section 12.[ADDRESS_1272553] the medical diagnosis [preferabl y ], symptom, or sign on the AE CRF ). 
Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of 
an abnormal value , or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically

12.9 Electrocardiograms
A 12-lead ECG assessment will be done at Screening, performed prior to drawing blood 
at these study  visits (see Table 2).
The 12-lead ECG values are to be recorded on the CRF. For each abno rmal ECG value, 
the investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE (see definition in 
Section 12.[ADDRESS_1272554] the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis will be recorded on the 
AE CRF ). Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or 
etiology  of an abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained 
when clinicall y indicated. Any abno rmal value that persists should be followed at the 
discretion of the investigator .
12.10 Local Injection Site Reaction Evaluation
Assessment for local injection site reactions site of SC injections of M923 will be
performed prior to M923 administration at these study  visits (see Table 2).
Injection site evaluations will be made b y clinical staff as described below; if an injection 
site reaction is ob served, a phy sician will characterize and document the reaction as an 
AE. Injection sites will continue to be reviewed at the time points indicated in Table 2, or 
until the AE is resolved.
Injection sites will be monitored for pain, tenderness, ery thema ,
and swelling. Each 
injection site reaction will be categorized using the intensity  grading scheme presented in 
Table 1; the intensity  of each resulting AE will be categorized as described in 
Section
[IP_ADDRESS] (eg, a moderate intensit y injecti on site reaction may  be recorded as a 
mild AE if considered appropriate according to the Invesitgator’s judgement, based on 
the AE grading schemes presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

 Background and Introduction  
 
Chronic cough patients are treated for the etiologies of gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD), cough variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) formerly called 
postnasal drip syndrome with varying benefi t (4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_534751], UACS and CVA, these patients continue to experince persisting cough that 
is termed as idiopathic cough or unexplained cough. Studies have shown that cough can 
be unexplained or idiopathic in upto 42% of patients (5). 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  is a highly prevalent condition in the general population (6). A 
large retrospective study performed at Utah Valley Pulmonary Clinic identified a 44% 
prevalence of OSA in chronic cough population. 93%  of patients treated with CPAP showed 
improvement in cough (2). Besides this study,  a number of case reports have identified OSA as 
a perpetuating cause for chronic cough (7 -8). Based on this, a number of mechanistic pathways 
by [CONTACT_534757] (3).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_534752], no study has conclusively shown that CPAP therapy alone provides 
improvement in cough relief as patients with treated for chronic cough are often rendered 
multiple different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534753], CVA and UACS. Additionally no study till date has 
used a placebo arm to demonstrate improvement in cough intensity measurements with CPAP 
therapy.  
The current study purports aims to establish a definitive relationship using a CPAP vs. sham 
CPAP arm to assess changes in subjective and objective cough measures in chronic cough 
patients with comorbid OSA. Sham CPAP therapy is a well- established modality to 
demonstrate efficacy of OSA therapy on a multitude of disease states, ranging from metabolic 
syndrome to reflux disease (9).  
  
  
 
 
 
Purpose and Objectives  
 
AIM:   To demonstrate that therapy of conomitant OSA in patients with chronic cough 
improves or resolves chronic cough.  
Chronic cough is an important clinical problem in primary care and subspecialty practice (1). 
Besides the distress experienced by [CONTACT_534758], signficant healthcare 
resources are expended to understand the role of gastroesophageal reflux,  asthma and post -
nasal drip in understanding their contribution to c ough.  
Recently obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has found to be common in patients with chronic 
cough (2). More importantly, treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) led to improvement in cough in chronic cough patients (2). Mechanisms  by [CONTACT_534759] (ERICA)   IRB_00062049

inflammation (3).  
Our study purports to definitively establish that CPAP therapy for treatment of OSA in chronic 
cough patients improves cough. While these p atients with chronic cough are not routinely 
screened and treated for OSA, our study aims to evaluate these chronic cough patients  with 
screening questionnaires for OSA and if necessary with polysomnography and randomize 
them to either CPAP or sham CPAP fo r [ADDRESS_694493] inflammation using exhaled b reath condensate.

clinics  within the University of Utah healthcare system. Patients will be consented at either 
Clinic 3, pulmonary clinic or at the University of Utah Sleep Center.  
Posters with info rmation about the study will be hung in the clinic workrooms where they can 
be seen by [CONTACT_534760].

Clinic 3 (Pulmonary) at University of Utah Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534755] -Wake Center, University of Utah  
 
Description of the consent process(es), including the timing of consent:  
Once patients meet study criteria based on results of STOP -BANG questionnaire and 
polysomnography, they will be eligible to be conse nted by [CONTACT_473].

CLINICAL PROCEDURES : 
We anticipate these will already be performed as part of  clinical evaluation prior to 
enrollment in the study  (this is done as part of routine evaluation for chronic cough ). 
• Chest radiography  
• Pulmonary function testing (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], single breath diffusion capacity measurement)  
• Exhaled nitric   oxide testing if available  
• STOP -BANG screening   questionnaire  
• Full-night attended or unattended polysomnography if STOP -BANG questionnaire 
abnormal with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_534756] -disodered breathing.  
STUDY PROCEDURES  
• Consent Form  
• Study Questionnaires:  
• Leicester -cough questionnaire (LCQ) at baseline,   6 weeks, 12 weeks and at 24  weeks  
• GERD- QoL  questionnaire (GERD -QoL) at baseline and 6 weeks  
• Sino- nasal outcome test (SNOT -20) at baseline and 6 weeks  
• Asthma Life questionnaire   (ALQ) at baseline and 6 weeks  
• Laryngeal dysfunction scores (LDQ) at baseline and 6weeks  
• Leicester cough monitoring for 24 hours at baseline , at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. 
• Exhaled breath condensate at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.  
• CPAP data download at 6 weeks, 12 week  
  
  
  
 
 
Procedures performed for research purposes only:   
Once individuals with chronic cough that meet inclusion criteria are found to have OSA on 
polysomnography, they will be given an option to enroll in the current study. These 
procedures will be done as part of the research study.

 STUDY PROCEDURES    
1. CONSENT FORM  
2. STUDY QUESTIONNAIRES  
• Leicester -cough questionnaire (LCQ) at baseline,   6 weeks, 12 weeks  
• Cough VAS scale at baseline, 6 weeks and at 12 weeks  
• GERD- QoL  ques tionnaire (GERD -QoL) at baseline and at 6 weeks  
• Sino- nasal outcome test (SNOT -20) at baseline and at 6 weeks  
• Asthma  life questionnaire at baseline and at 6 weeks  
• Laryngeal dysfunction scores (LDQ) at baseline and at 6 weeks  
3. Cough monitoring for 24 hours, a t baseline and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.  
4. CPAP data download at 6 weeks,  12 weeks  
5. Exhaled breath condensate at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.  
Once patients are enrolled, they will be randomized to either straight CPAP or sham CPAP. 
Randomization will be done by [CONTACT_2420], Thi -Ly Downing and treating physicians 
(and investigators) will be blinded to whether the patient received straight CPAP or sham 
CPAP. Patients will be evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks after randomization as part of study. At 6 
weeks,  patients will be unblinded and placed back on straight CPAP. The pressure on straight 
CPAP will be determined according to the results of the polysomnography or they will be kept 
on 10cm of CPAP (adjustments to this may be made by [CONTACT_9137], T hi-Ly 
Downing who is the CPAP coordinator for the Sleep Center). For sham CPAP, patients will be 
kept at 1 -2cm of pressure as per sham CPAP recommendations and no adjustments to this will 
be made although there may be adjustments made in mask or interface used for the CPAP. 
 
 
 
Statistical Methods, Data Analysis and Interpretation  
 
PRIMARY END -POINT  
1. Change in LCQ score in CPAP -treated   patients vs.   sham CPAP -treated patients. This 
will be compared between baseline LCQ score prior to initiation of CPAP or  sham 
CPAP and compared to the LCQ score at 6 weeks. 
2. Change in Leicester  cough monitoring measured at baseline and at 6 weeks  after CPAP 
or sham -CPAP therapy.  
3. Change in measurements of exhaled breath condensate 8 isoprostane, IL -6, 
nitrite/nitrate, H2O2 an d LTB4 at baseline and at 6 weeks.  
SECONDARY END- POINTS  
• Change in GERD -QoL scores,  change in LDQ scores at 6 weeks  
• Change in LCM at 12 weeks compared to 6 weeks in sham CPAP patients  
• CPAP compliance at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.

 STUDY PROTOCOL  
Subjects with randomized to straight CPAP (either at 10cm or at a pressure determined during 
PSG) OR sham CPAP (1 -2cm) following mask -fitting session during PSG or prior to that. 
After 6 weeks of therapy, patients will evaluated for above -mentioned end- points and study 
analyses will be done. Patients will be then placed on CPAP (as prescribed by [CONTACT_63175]) and 
followed at 12 weeks  again.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS TO BE ENROLLED  
Based on the results of a recently concluded CPAP intervention study for chronic cough, mean 
chan ge in LCQ with CPAP was + 4.1 (with 4.14 SD in baseline and followup LCQ scores)  
Mean change in LCQ with placebo was 1.1 (Lancet 2012)  
Expected difference between mean LCQs of two groups 3.0 
• To achieve 80% difference to detect a significant difference of 0.05 level for a 
difference means of 2.58, 19 subjects per group needed assuming no attrition using a 
mixed models analysis of repeated measures data.

needed.

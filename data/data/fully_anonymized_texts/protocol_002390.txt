TITLE:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to as sess the safety , 
pharmacokinetics  and efficacy of MAU868 for the treatment of BK viremia in kidney transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349903]:  MAU868 -[ADDRESS_434969]:  MAU868 
PHASE: 2 
INDICATION:  Treatment of BK viremia  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary o bjective of this study is:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of MAU868  
Secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To assess the impact of MAU868 on BK virus related outcomes including viruria, 
viremia, BK virus nephropathy, graft function and rejection am ong renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349904]  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics of MAU868  
BACKGROUND:  
Infection wit h BK virus (BKV) is essentially ubiquitous, with estimates ranging between 80 and 
90% of the population globally. Primary infection occurs in  childhood (usually by 10 years of 
age) and is either a mild, non -specific, self -limited illness or asymptomatic. P ersistent infection 
is established in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_349905], ureters, and bladder, and is effectively 
controlled, though never eliminated by [CONTACT_27639]. Compromised immune function can 
lead to uncontrolled viral replication and d evelopment of disease. The two  best-characterized 
BKV-associated diseases are a nephropathy that affects kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
(i.e., a disease of the allograft) and hemorrhagic cystitis , with or without renal involvement , that 
affects hematopoieti c stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. BKV nephropathy (BKVN) is a 
leading cause of premature allograft loss, second only to allograft rej ection. Patients who 
develop BK viremia irrespective of whether biopsy confirms BKVN have been reported to have 
significantly lower allograft survival at 10  years (24.8% vs 85.6%, P <0.001; Moura et al 2017). 
BKV-associated hemorr hagic cystitis prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], often requires administration of 
blood products and urologic intervention, can involve the native kidneys  and can lead to death 
in the most severe cases. BKV has four major genotypes , but genotype is not linked wit h the 
risk or severity of disease.  
MAU868 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds the viral capsid protein, VP1, that 
is responsible for binding to the surface of host cells (i.e., the first step in the infection of new 
cells; Tsai and Qian 2010). MAU868 neutralizes all four BKV genotypes at sub -nanomolar

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 concentrations in vitro. It binds to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_349906]1 that is highly conserved . Resistance -
associated BKV variants were not identified in two ind ependent long -term in vitro selection 
studies, demonstrating that MAU868 has a high in vitro barrier-to-resistance. It is being 
developed for the treatment  of clinically significant BKV infection in immunosuppressed 
populations, notably solid organ and hem opoietic stem cell trans plant (HSCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
The results of the non -clinical studies identify no specific risk for investigation of MAU868 in 
human subjects, as expected for a human monoclonal antibody that recognizes a foreign 
(i.e., non-human) antigen. No MAU868 -related eff ects were observed in rats after once weekly 
dosing (5 doses total) of MAU868 up to 750 mg/kg IV and 150 mg/kg S C. In addition, MAU868 
did not bind human tissues (42 normal tissues) or blood smears as assessed by 
[CONTACT_9064].  
To date, a total of 27 subjects ([ADDRESS_434970] with BKV nephropathy) have 
received MAU868. A first -in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled, single 
ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAU868 
following IV or SC administration to healthy adult subjects was performed. Twenty-six subject s 
received doses of MAU868 up to 100 mg/kg IV or 3 mg/kg S C; all doses were safe and well 
tolerated. No deaths or SAEs were reported , and there were no AEs that led to the 
discontinuation of dosing or the study. After single doses, serum concentrations of MAU868 
declined in a biphasic manner with a terminal half -life of 23 to 30 days. The estimated relative 
bioavailability of MAU868 fo llowing S C administration was 57.6%. Admi nistration of 
MAU868 increased anti -BKV antibody titers and the neutralizing potency of the serum, while 
administration of placebo had no effect.  
One adult female kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349907]868 1350 mg IV for 
refractory BKV nephropathy  (i.e., preceding persistent BK viremia for ~7 months with biopsy 
confirmation) as part of an individual patient managed access program requested and initiated 
by [CONTACT_1963]. She received a total of [ADDRESS_434971] of which were 
administered every two weeks. The treating physician elected to pre -treat the patient with 
steroids, antihistamines, and acetaminophen for each infusion. MAU868 was considered safe 
and well tolerated by [CONTACT_349949]868 or  the infusion.  
Further details of non -clinical and clinical studies conducted to date with MAU868 can be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
To date, there are no effective antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_349908] . MAU868 has the potential to 
be a safe a nd well-tolerated therapy that can eliminate a threat to the survival of the renal 
allograft and greatly simplify the post -transplantation care of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

STUDY D ESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double-blinded, proof -of-concept study in kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Up to 36 subjects with BK viremia will participate in 1 of 3 sequential 
cohorts.  Each cohort will randomize approximately  12 subjects (8 MAU868 and 4 placebo).  
The study will consist of a screening period, a 12-week treatment period and a 24-week 
follow-up period.  
Protocol-specific procedures should not be performed until the patient has consented to 
participation in the s tudy.  However, assessments and procedures performed as part of standard 
of care prior to informed consent, including determination of BK vir al load in plasma may be 
used to qualify a patient for the study.  Once qualifying BK viremia has been confirmed, s ubjects 
should be randomized as soon as possible and no more than 10 days after the sample 
documenting the viremia was collected.   
During th e treatment per iod, subjects will receive MAU868 or placebo approximately every 
28 days (every 4 weeks) for 12 week s (4 doses total). Urine and blood will be monitored for 
BKV DNA by [CONTACT_349950] [ADDRESS_434974] testing more frequently (i.e., weekly) 
than mandated by [CONTACT_349951] 6 weeks of tre atment and when clinically indicated. 
During the study, BKV DNA by [CONTACT_349952].  P harmacokinetics 
(PK), viral resistance, and anti -drug antibodies (ADA) will also be monitored. Subjects should 
continue study drug until the last scheduled dose, regardless of changes in plasma BK viral load, 
use of rescue therapy, and/or need for change i n immunosuppressive regimen for any reason.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Routine post -transplantation care is to be guided by [CONTACT_737] ’s discretion and site 
standard of care.  This includes decisions to change the immunosuppressive regimen for a 
subject for any reason except for changes in immunosuppression in response to BK viremia . 
In order to treat BK viremia, prior to randomization, (i .e., prior to screening, during the 
screening period and at the Baseline Visit) Investigators are permitted to decrease or alter 
immunosuppressive therapy at their discretion and/or per standard of care  at their site.   
However, in the fir st 4 weeks after randomization, Investigators should refrain from additional 
changes in immunosuppressive regimen in response to BKV unless the viral load has increased

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 RATIONALE FOR DOSE AND SCHEDULE SELECTION:  
In Cohort 1, MAU868 will be administered as an IV infusion of [ADDRESS_434982] animal model of BKV infection or disease ; therefore, the most robust 
estimate of the clinical dose considers the following parameters  1) MAU868 BKV neutralizing 
activity in vitro, 2) simulation of serum concentrations based on a model created from Phase 1 
data in healthy volunteers , and 3) published literature on the extravascular distribution of 
immunoglobulin (renal 13.7%) . For clinical efficacy, our therapeutic approach is  to maintain the 
Ctrough in target tissues ≥10 -fold the 50% effective conce ntration (EC50) of the least su sceptible 
BKV genotype (genotype III).  A review of the information is as follows:  
A high-content imaging -based in vitro neutralization assay in RPTE cell s was used to 
characterize the antiviral activity of MAU868 determined against representative isolates from 
the four major genotypes of BKV (genotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively); genotypes I and IV 
account for approximately 95% of the global seropre valence, while genotypes II and III account 
for the remaining 5% ( Zheng et al 2007; Zhong et al 2009 ).

100 mg/kg IV) and the serum concentration data was used to develop a PK model.  The model 
was then used to estimate C trough concentrations for a series of [ADDRESS_434984] on BK viremia, MAU868 would need to curtail BKV replication  in the target 
tissue (i.e., kidney). Based on an in vivo radiolabeled s tudy in animals and physiologically based  
pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) modeling estimates, the antibody biodistribution coefficient in kidney 
is 13.7% ( Shah and Betts 2013 ). The estimated trough levels for each treatment arm were 
compared directly to in vitro-determined antiviral activity (EC 50 and EC 90) for each BKV 
genotype and corrected for the assumed antibody distributions in kidney.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 These data s how that the planned dose regimens of MAU868 for each treatment arm provides 
high virus  neutralizing tissue levels with kidney exposures at Ctrough ≥10-fold the EC [ADDRESS_434985] susceptible BKV genotype (III). Specifically, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 253 to 
2618-fold (Cohort 1), 365  to 3775-fold (Cohort 2), and 1264 to 13,061 -fold (Cohort 3)  above 
the EC 50 at the end of treatment (12 wee ks, range = least to most susceptible BKV genotype). 
Using EC 90 determinations, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 6 to 231-fold (Cohort 1), 
8 to 33-fold (Cohort 2), and 28 to 1152 -fold (Cohort 3)  above the EC [ADDRESS_434986] administered dose of MAU868 expected in this  study 
(6750 mg =  100 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient ) was also the highest administered dose (MAU868 
100 mg/kg) investigated in the first -in-human study and below the no observed  adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) exposure (750 mg/kg) in the 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study in rats. 
Specifically, human steady -state AUC ex posure at the proposed dose of MAU868 1350 mg 
(20 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient) once monthly (206231 µg·hr/mL) provid es safety margins of 
6.9X and 5.0X, respectively, compared to the NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the 
4-week rat study and to the AUC  at the highest human dose (100 mg/kg; 1031155 µg·hr/mL) 
tested to date. Likewise, human steady -state AUC exposure a t the proposed dose of MAU868 
6750 mg once monthly (1031155 µg·hr/mL) provides a safety margin of 1.4X compared to the 
NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 142 0000 µg·hr/mL) in the 4 -week rat study.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 STUDY STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442]:  
The study may be discontinued , or paused, for reasons that may include (but are not limited to): 
reasons of safety, lack of study drug availability, inability to enroll the study, or decision by a 
regulatory authority or the Sponsor  (see Appendix D) . 
In the event that a dosing cohort shows  efficacy and it is not anticipated that additional dosing 
would show added efficacy, the sponsor may choose to stop and not complete the study.  
Further, in the instance of 2 or more treatment -related SAEs, 2 or more treatment related AEs 
Grade 3 or highe r or 2 or more clinically significant treatment -related Grade 3 or higher 
laboratory abnormalities, the study will be paused pending an SSRC review of the safety events. 
The Sponsor will inform the applicable regulatory authorit y(ies) of any safety -related pause in 
the study.     
 In the case that the study is discontinued, the Sponsor will promptly inform the Investigators 
and applicable regulatory authority(ies) of the termination of the study and the reason(s) for the 
termination. The Investigators are re sponsible for promptly informing subjects that they must 
discontinue study drug. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination, as specified 
by [CONTACT_349957](s).  
DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD : 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB ) will review cumulative unblinded safety 
data as outlined in the DSMB  charter. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : 
Analysis Populations : 
The primary e fficacy analysis will be performed in the modified ITT (MITT) analysis 
population . The MITT includes subjects who meet all of the following criteria:  
• Received at least 1 dose of study drug   
• Has at least [ADDRESS_434987] -baseline plasma BK viral load result available  
Additional analyses will be performed in the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) analysis population

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Efficacy Analyses  
In all efficacy analyses, the placebo subjects from the cohorts will be combined. Thus, the 
analysis models will include treatment group (four levels: placebo, low dose, medium dose, high 
dose) as a factor. Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Co x proportional hazards 
regression models. Proportion endpoints will be analyzed using logistic regression models.  
Quantitative endpoints will be analyzed using one-way analysis of varianc e (ANOVA) models . 
In all analyses, pairwise contrasts comparing each  of the three active groups to the combined 
placebo group will be tested.  All efficacy and  exploratory analyses will be conducted using 
two-sided tests at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_434989] and proportion endpoints will be analysed 
using Fisher’s exact te st. Due to the small sample sizes, time -to-event variables will be 
summarized descriptively.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on data from the Safety Analysis Population. Adverse 
events (AEs), vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_349958] s.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
MAU868 levels in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A  detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report. 
The anticipated Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) i s 50.0 ng/mL. Concentrations will be 
expressed in mass per volume units (e.g., ng/mL). Missing values or those concentrations below 
the LLOQ will be labeled as such in the data listings and  reported as “zero” in data presentations 
and calculations.  
MAU868 serum concentration data will be listed by [CONTACT_3598]/sampling time point. 
Descriptive summary statistics of trough levels will be provided by [CONTACT_765]/sampling time point, 
including th e frequency (n, %) of concentrations below the LLOQ and reported as  zero. 
Summary statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD, CV (arithmetic and 
geometric), median, minimum and maximum. Concentrations below LLOQ will be treated as 
zero in summary statistics.  
Summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard devia tion) and individual subject listing of serum 
concentration measurements of MAU868 at the assigned time points will be provided as 
surrogates of systemic exposure.  
Interim Analyses  
Separate from the blinded safety review by [CONTACT_349959] 2, unblinded safety and tolerability data (adverse events, clinical laboratories, 
vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy data (BK viral load in the plasma) and PK (MAU868 
plasma levels) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_349960] [ADDRESS_434990] completed 
the treatment period . The treatment assignment in Cohort 1 will be unblinded; however, these 
data will not include associated subject or site identif iers. The objectives of this interim analysis

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 are to evaluate wheth er four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered every 28 days for a total 
of 4 doses demonstrate:  
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK viral load in plasma compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
The conclusions from this first analysis will be used by [CONTACT_349961]868 early -on in this first -in-patient study. Unless a significant safety issue 
related to administ ration of MAU868 has been identified, the conclusio ns will have no impact 
on Cohort 2 or the study’s design.  
Following completion of the 12 -week treatment periods for Cohorts 1 and 2, cumulative 
unblinded data from both cohorts will be reviewed for safety and tolerability (adverse events, 
clinical laborato ries, vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy (BK viral load in the plasma) 
and PK (MAU868 plasma levels). The treatment assignments will be unblinded; however, these 
data will not include associated sub ject or site identifiers. The objectives of this second interim 
analysis are to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 [ADDRESS_434991] dose followed by 3 more doses of MAU868 
1350 mg IV adminis tered every 28 days demonstrate:  
• safety and  tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK viral load compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
Based on the SSRC’s safety, efficacy and PK conclusions for Cohorts 1 and 2, the dosing 
regimen for Cohort 3 may be adjusted in dosage and/or duration; however, the dosage and 
duration for Cohort 3 will not exceed the dose already specified in the protocol. Cohort 3 will 
not be opened for screening and enrollment until this evaluation has been co mpleted. 
Sample Size Determinations : 
This study will randomize  approximately 36 subjects (12 per cohort) to  MAU868 and placebo 
in a 2:1 ratio (24 MAU868 and 12 placebo; 8 MAU868 and 4 placebo per cohort).  This study 
is not powered to an efficacy endpoint.   The number of subjects chosen will prov ide data useful 
in determining proof of concept.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 BKV Infection and Nephropathy  
The human polyomavirus BK (BK viru s or BKV) is a DNA virus that infects 80 -90% of the world's 
population ( Kean 2009;  Boothpur  and Brennan 2010; Egli et al 2009). It is generally acquired 
during chi ldhood and, subsequently, establishes a lifelong infection in renal tubular  and 
uroepi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] ( Antonsson 2010 ).  Although the primary and persistent infections are generally 
clinically silent, BKV reactivation may occur  in the setting of organ transplantation  when innate 
immune T cell immunity  is compromised by [CONTACT_349963] ( Ambalathingal 2017 ). 
In particular, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349916].  
BKV replication in immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349917] a well -established 
clinical course from viruria (~ 35% of all kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) to viremia (~11%) to 
nephropathy (3 -5%; Sawinski and Goral 2015;  Hirsch et al 2013;  Dharnidharka et al 2011 ). 
The median onset of detectable viruria is [ADDRESS_434999] -transplantation (rang e 2 to 41 weeks), and 
the median onset of viremia is 10 weeks (range 5  to 51 weeks; Babel et al 2009 ). The median onset 
of BKV nephropathy is [ADDRESS_435000] -transplantation (range 7  to 113 weeks;  
Hirsch and Steiger 2003).  
Patients who develop BK viremia irrespective of  whether biopsy confirms BKV  nephropathy  have 
been reported to have significantly lower allograft survival at 10  years (24.8% vs 85.6%, P <0.001; 
Moura et al 2017). By [CONTACT_22242], patients w ithout viruria do not develop viremia; lik ewise, patients 
without viremia do not develop nephropathy (Babel et al 2009 ).  
The main risk factor for BKV replication and the development of diseas e is the level of 
immunosuppression, including the type of induction therap y used prior to transplantation. 
A number of other risk factors including recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], male sex, allograft rejection, degree of 
human leukocyte antigen mismatching, length of cold  ischemia time, an d recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349918] (e.g., donor positiv e-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_349919]) have also been implicated 
(Sawinski and Goral 2015). No single risk factor is reliably predictive . 
Current treatment guidelines recom mend reduction of immunosuppression to control the infection, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_349920] n BK viremia is >104 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  (KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline 2009 ). Clearance 
of the viremia takes months and often requires multiple stepwise re ductions in the 
immunosuppression. Subjects for whom immunosuppression is r educed have an increased risk of 
acute allograft rejection (Bohl and Brennan 2007;  Sood et al 2012 ).  
There are no specific or effective anti -BKV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  These data underscore the need for more 
effective means to control or prevent BKV reactivation.  MAU868 has the potential to be a safe 
and well-tolerated therapy that can eliminate a threat to the survival of the renal allog raft and 
greatly simplify the post -transplantation care of kidney transplan t recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.2 MAU868  
BKV encodes only seven proteins and lacks the traditional targets for antiviral drugs 
(e.g., protease, polymerase). The non -enveloped icosahedral virion of BKV is composed of three 
different viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3), but only VP1  (the major viral capsid protein) is exposed 
on the virion surface.  
MAU868 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds the viral capsid protein, VP1, that is 
responsible for b inding to the surface of host cells (i.e., the first step in the infection of new cells; 
Tsai and Qian 2010). MAU868 neutralizes all four BKV genotypes  at sub-nanomolar 
concentrations in vitro. It recognizes a conformational epi[INVESTIGATOR_349921]1 that is highly conserved, 
resulting in a high barrier to resistan ce in vitro. It is being developed for the prevention of clinically 
significant BKV infection in immunosuppressed populations, notably solid or gan and HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
The most relev ant data for the present study are summarized in the sections below. For  detailed 
information, please refer to the MAU868 Investigator's Brochure.  
1.3 Non-clinical Data  
The non-clinical evaluation of MAU868, a human monocl onal antibody recognizing a non -human 
antigen, was performed according to the ICH S6(R1) guidelines. Details rega rding all non -clinical 
studies conducted to date with MAU868 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
No genotoxicity or reproductive toxic ology studies were conducted because M AU868 1) is a fully 
human monoclonal IgG1 antibody comprising native non -modified amino acids, 2) does not 
contain any chemical linkers or chelators, 3) is highly specific for an epi[INVESTIGATOR_349922], and 4) there are no pharmac ologically relevant animal models.  
Because MAU868 is a protein comprised of  native amino acids and because if its pharmacological 
mechanism of action it is considered to be non -genotoxic.  
BKV VP1 is the major viral ca psid protein and the only protein expo sed on the virion surface. 
Binding of VP1 to ganglioside receptors on the h ost cell surface initiates internalization of the 
virus (Tsai and Qian 2010 ). Binding of MAU868 to VP1 blocks these i nteractions and prevents 
infection of new cells.  
MAU868 has pi[INVESTIGATOR_349923]1 and sub -nanomolar neut ralization potency against 
all four BKV genotypes.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 MAU868 binds to a conformation -dependent e pi[INVESTIGATOR_349906]1. T he key contact [CONTACT_349964] (Y169, 
R170, and K172), all located within the VP1 EF loop, are 100% conserved among reference 
isolates and 156 ( genotype I) and 66 ( genotype IV) GenBank sequences analyzed. Mutations at 
these locations confer either  a loss of viral  fitness (i.e., inability to replicate) or no change in 
susceptibility to MAU868.  
Resistance selection experiments in renal proximal tubule epi[INVESTIGATOR_349924] I and genotype IV, which comprise 95% of global seroprev alence, failed t o generate 
virus with genotypic resistance to MAU868 after six serial passages (>84 days in cell culture). 
Mutant BK viruses harboring a series of VP1 polymorphisms at other locations in VP1 that were 
identified through analyses of availabl e sequences in G enBank also confer no reduced 
susceptibility to MAU868  in vitro. The available non -clinical data demonstrate a high barrier to 
the development of resistance to MAU86 8 in vitro. 
Repeated dose -toxicity studies were conducted in rats. O nce weekly IV or SC administration for 
4-weeks (5 doses total) of MAU868 up to 750  mg/kg IV and 150 mg/kg SC to rats was well 
tolerated. The NOAEL for IV administration was 750  mg/kg/week;  the NOAEL for SC 
administration was 150 mg/kg/week.  
1.4 Clinical Data  
To date, a total of 27 s ubjects ([ADDRESS_435001] with BKV nephropathy) have 
received MAU868.  
A first-in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose study to assess 
the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAU8 68 following IV or SC administration to 
healthy adult subjects was performed. A total of 33 subjects parti cipated in the study; 26 subjects 
received MAU868 and 7 received placebo.  MAU868 doses of 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg 
(4 subjects received each dose)  were administered  IV as 1-hr infusions. S ix subjects received 
MAU868 3  mg/kg as a bolus S C injection. Administration of study drug was followed by 
[CONTACT_349965], pharmacokinetics, and testing for anti -drug antibodies up to [ADDRESS_435002]-dose. Ex vi vo assessments o f neutralizing serostatus were also performed prior to and 28 days 
after administration of  MAU868 or placebo.  No deaths or SAEs were reported, and there were no 
AEs that led to the discontinuation of the infusion or the study.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.4.1 Human Safety and Tolerability Data  
Single doses up to 100 mg/kg MAU868 were safe and well tolerated. Eleven (11) of 26 subjects 
exposed to MAU868  (42%) and one o f seven subjects exposed to placebo (14%) reported adverse 
events. Events occurring in mor e than one subject included nasal congestion (3), oropharyngeal 
pain (3), and injection site hemorrhage (2) - all in subjects who received MAU868.  
1.4.2 Human Pharmacokinet ic Data 
The time course of exposure to MAU868 following IV administration was consistent with that of 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_349925]1 and therefore dose -proportional and predictable. The observed C28d 
("trough") concentrations of MAU868 (mean ± S D) were 4.9 ± 1. 4, 19.4 ± 5.0, 59.9 ± 11.0, 
171.3 ± 12.7 and 509.8 ± 145.9 ug/mL following adm inistration of 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 A high-content ima ging-based in vitro neutralization assay in RPTE cells was used to characterize 
the antiviral activity of MAU868 was determined against  representative isolates from the four 
major genotypes of BKV (genotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively); genotypes I and IV account 
for approximately 95% of the global seroprevalence, while genotypes II and III account f or the

to estimate C trough concentrations for a series of [ADDRESS_435008]

Based on  an in vivo radiolabeled study in animals and PBPK modeling estimates, the antibody 
biodistribution coefficient in kidney  is 13.7% ( Shah and Betts 201 3). The estimated trough levels 
for each treatment arm were compared directly to  in vitro-determined antiviral activity (EC 50 and 
EC90) for each BKV genotype and corrected for the assumed antibody dist ributions in kidney.  
These data show that the planned  dose regimens of MAU868 for each treatment arm provides high 
virus neutralizing tissue levels with kidney exposures at Ctrough ≥10-fold the EC [ADDRESS_435009] 
susceptible BKV genotype (genotype III). Specifically, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 
253 to 2618-fold (Cohort 1), 365  to 3775-fold (Cohort 2), and 1264 to 13,061 -fold (Cohort 3) 
above the EC 50 at the end of treatment (12 weeks , range = least to most susceptible BKV genotype). 
Using EC 90 determinations, k idney exposures at Ctrough range from 6 to 231-fold (Cohort 1), 
8 to 333-fold (Cohort 2), and 28 to 1152 -fold (Cohort 3)  above the EC [ADDRESS_435010] administered dose of MAU868 expected in this study 
(6750 mg = 100 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient ) was also  the highest administered dose 
(MAU868  100 mg/kg) investigat ed in the first -in-human study and belo w the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) exposure (750 mg/kg) in the 4 -week repeat -dose toxicity study in rats. 
Specifically, huma n steady-state AUC exposure at the proposed dose of MAU868 1350 mg 
(20 mg/kg for a 67.5 kg patient) once monthly (206231  µg·hr/mL) provides safety margins of 6.9X 
and 5.0X, respectively, compared to the NOAEL (750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the [ADDRESS_435011] human dose (100 mg/kg; 1031155 µg·hr/mL) tes ted to 
date. Likewise, human steady -state AUC exposure at the proposed dose of MAU868 6750 mg 
once monthly (1031155 µg·hr/mL) provides a safety margin of 1.4X compared to the NOAEL 
(750 mg/kg; 1420000 µg·hr/mL) in the 4 -week rat study.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 1.7 Rationale for Choice  of Comparator  and Background Therapy  
Placebo is the comparator because there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_349926].  
Induction and maintenance  immunosuppression is to be determined at the discretion of th e 
attending physician(s).  
1.8 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
MAU868 may prevent progression of BKV infection to irreversible renal allograft injury. Since 
current mana gement of BKV reactivation involves reduction of immunosuppressive regimens 
(with accompanying increased ri sk for rejection), if MAU868 is effective in preventing BKV 
nephropathy in the post -kidney transplant setting, post -transplant care could be simplified with 
improved clinical outcomes.   
To date, n o MAU868 -specific risks have been  identified. The overall a dverse event profile from 
the first-in human study was quite satisfactory. Based on clinical data from pooled 
immunoglobulin preparations and a monoc lonal antibody active against respi[INVESTIGATOR_151495], potential  risks of MAU 868 include infusion -related reactions, including allergic 
(e.g., hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis) and non -allergic (e.g., cytokine release syndrome) reactions, 
renal dysfunctio n, and thromboembolic events.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a randomize d, placebo -controlled, blinded, proof -of-concept study in kidney transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . Up to 36 subjects with BK viremia will participate in 1 of 3 sequential cohorts.  Each 
cohort will randomize approximately 12 subjects (8 MAU868 and 4 placebo). The study will 
consist of a Screening period (pre-treatment) of up to [ADDRESS_435013] for the study.  Once qualifying BK viremia  has been confirmed, subjects should 
be randomized as soon as possible and no more than 10 days af ter the sample documenting the 
viremia was collected.   
MAU868 or placebo will be administered approximat ely every 28 days (every 4 weeks) for 
12 weeks (4 doses total).  Urine and blood will be monitored for BKV DNA by [CONTACT_349967] [ADDRESS_435014] testing 
more frequently (i.e., weekly) than mandated by [CONTACT_349951] [ADDRESS_435015] scheduled dose, regardless of 
changes in plasma BK viral load , use of rescue therapy  and/or need for change in 
immunosuppressive regimen for any reason.

Study participants will be randomly assigned to their treatments. Two participants will be assigned 
to receive treatment with MAU868 for each participant assigned to receive treatment with placebo 
(2:1 randomization ). Randomization wi ll occur via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 
The Investigator or delegate will contact [CONTACT_349969] a potential study 
participant is e ligible. The  IWRS will assign a randomization number that will be used to link the 
subject to  a treatment arm.  
The randomization numb er is only used to identify which treatment study participants have been 
assigned to receive. The number assigned to a sub ject at screening remains the unique identifier 
for the subject throughout the study. For information on subject numbering, please see “Subject 
numbering ” section in the IWRS manual.  The randomization numbers will be generated using 
procedures that ensure  that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from the Sponsor,

7 STUDY PROCEDU RES 
7.1 Informed Consent  
Eligible subjects may onl y be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent.  
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific pr ocedures (i.e., all of 
the procedures describe d in the protocol). However, assessments  or procedures performed as 
standard of care may be used for the purposes of screening. The process of obtaining informed 
consent must be documented in the subject source  documents. 
Information about common side effe cts already known about the investigational drug can be found 
in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed 
consent and should be discussed with the subject duri ng the study as needed. Any new information 
regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will 
be communicated as appropriate. New information might require an update to the informed 
consent and then must be  discussed with the subject.  
Once the subject has signed the informed consent, the subject may enter the Screening Period of 
the study.

8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Schedule of Events  
Subjects should be seen for  all visits/assessments as outli ned in the assessment schedule or as close 
to the designated day/time as possible.  
Missed, late, or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation  from the study .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should remain in the study.   In the case of 
premature discontinuation from st udy drug, subjects should be considered to have completed the 
treatment period and should complete the assessments required in the follow -up period 
(see Appendix A).  Although the actual study days will vary between subjects and will not align 
with protocol -defined visit study days, time from last study dose remains the same (i.e., subjects 
will be seen approximately every [ADDRESS_435065] of study dose received).  If the subject cannot be seen on the precise 
protocol-defined study day, the acceptable visit window is ±[ADDRESS_435066] should be reconciled, and  the adverse event 
and concomita nt medications recorded on the eCRF and the reason for discontinuation of study 
documented.  (See Appendix A, Schedule of Events) .

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 8.[ADDRESS_435067] Demographics/ Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline c haracteristics will be collected for all subjects. Relevant medical 
and surgical history, including the primary cause of end -stage renal disease and other past or 
ongoing conditions, shall be recorded. Investigators have the  discretion to determine the rel evance 
of the medical and surgical history for individual subjects.  
The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) will be recorded for all subjects who receive a kidney 
from a deceased donor. The information necessary for determini ng the KDPI [INVESTIGATOR_349935], 
height, weight, ethnicity, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, cause of death, 
serum creatinine, hepatitis C serostatus, and whether donation occurred after circulatory death.  
More specific instructions a nd details regarding the baselin e characteristics of subjects are outlined 
in the eCRF completion guidelines . 
8.3 Efficacy / Pharmacodynamics  
The efficacy of MAU868 in treating BK viremia will be measured primarily by [CONTACT_349981] r time. 
Samples (plasma or urine ) will be collected for viral load assessment at the time points defined in 
the Assessment schedule . (See Appendix A, Schedule of Events.)  
Follow instructions outlined in the Laboratory Manual  regarding sample colle ction, numbering, 
processing and shipment. A centralized, validated quantitative PCR (qPCR) as say, targeting 
multiple conserved regions of the viral genome, will be utilized for quantification of BKV viral 
load. These result s of each subject’s testing will  be reported to the Investigator. It is recommended 
that these results be used by [CONTACT_349982]. The presence of MAU868 is not expected to affect th e results of the 
qPCR BKV viral load assay because viral nucleic acid will first be isolated from the sample for 
quantitation,  removing all antibodies and virus/host proteins. A detailed Virology Analysis Plan 
will be prepared separately.  
8.4 Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs)  
Several clini cal outcome assessments will be evaluated . These include :  
• Graft function  as measured by [CONTACT_349983] -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] , 
• Graft survival  as determined by [CONTACT_18451] a functioning graft that has not required a 
re-transplant or permanent renal replacement th erapy, 
• Subject survival ,

testing for all fem ales of childbearing potential will  be performed before infusions #2 on Day 28, 
#3 on Day 56 and #4 on Day 84.  
8.5.2 Physical Examination  
Information from physical examinations will be kept at the clinical site as source d ata and will not 
be transferred to the Sponsor as part of the study analysis (i.e., recorded in the eCRF) unless 
findings are related to an adverse event or are otherwise significant (and so are reported as an 
adverse event  or medical history ).

8.5.[ADDRESS_435069] 12 -lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs) will be performed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Interpretation 
of the tracing must be made by a qualified  physician and documented on the ECG / in the ECG 
section of the eCRF. Original ECG tracings, appropriately signed, will be archived at the study 
site. 
8.5.6 Pharmacokinetics  
PK samples will be collected at the timepoints defin ed in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A). 
Follow instructions outlined in the Laboratory Manual. regarding sample collection, numbering, 
processing and shipment. See Section 8.3, Use of Residual Biological S amples. 
MAU868  levels in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report.  
Actual time of dosing and actual times of blood collecti on will be recorded on the  PK blood 
collection eCRF page. For a detailed description of blood sampling, handling, labeling and 
shipment instructions please refer to the Laboratory Manual.  
PK samples obtained after study drug infusion should be collected f rom a vein opposite the ar m

Results of PK samples will not be reported to the site. These samples will be analyzed , and the 
results reported by [CONTACT_349984]-party specialty labs.  
8.5.7 BKV by [CONTACT_349985] ( Appendix A). Follow the instructions outlined in the Laboratory  Manual, 
regarding sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment.  
8.5.8 Other Assessments : Viral Resistance and Immunogenicity  
To monitor for the possible development of resistance -associated variants (RAVs) to MAU 868, 
the BKV VP1 coding region will be sequenced and translated to the correspondi ng amino acid 
sequence. The VP1 amino acid sequences from subjects will be aligned to their corresponding 
baseline sequences (derived from BKV detected in the urine at  Baseline) and reference isolate 
sequences to determine if any change from -baseline or ch ange-from-reference RAVs are pre sent. 
The susceptibility of RAVs to MAU868 will be determined by [CONTACT_349986]1 
gene into a BKV reference isolate vector, gen erating a chimeric virus for MAU868 phenotypic 
assessment. The EC50 and EC90 value s and fold change from baseline and reference values will 
be reported. If the resulting chimeric virus does not replicate, the individual RAV(s) may be 
engineered directly in to the BKV reference isolate vector through site -directed mutagenesis and

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test v ariables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time the subject signs consent  through the Follow Up Visit. Subjects should 
be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator, whether or not 
they think the event is due t o study drug. Beginning at Scree ning (following completion of an 
Informed Consent Form by [CONTACT_423]), Investigators should m ake an assessment for adverse 
events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome r ather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_737] a nd recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease o r 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition tha t led to a medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adv erse event, not the procedure it self.  
Any medical condition already present at consent should be recorded as medical history and not 
be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
Baseline changes in severity,  frequency, or seriousness at an y time during the study. In this case, 
it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Subjects who  develop treatment-related SAEs, treatment-related Grade 3 or higher AEs, or 
clinically significant  treatment-related Grade 3 or  higher laboratory  abnormalities  should be 
followed until resolution  of the AE or laboratory  abnormality,  or, if the AE or laboratory  
abnormality  was present at  baseline, until the value returns to baseline level. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory o r other examination (e .g., ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at initial d osing and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse events, as described below. The Investigator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in de ciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessm ent is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are de termined to be an error should 
not be reported as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(e.g., ECG abnormalities ) should be reported as an adver se event if any of the following are 
applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality  
• If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality  
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator  
9.1.1 Adverse (Drug)  Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a study drug related to any dose should be considered an 
adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a study drug means that a causal relationship between a 
study drug  and an adver se event is at least a reasonabl e possibility, i .e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out.

9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_349988] (intensity) of each adverse event and will also categorize 
each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug us ing the categories of “yes” or 
“no.” 
Assessment of Severity  
The severity of all adverse events should b e graded according to the CTCAE v5.0. For those 
adverse event terms not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild sympt oms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicat ed 
• CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• CTCAE G rade 3: Severe or medically sign ificant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349936]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• CTCAE Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent interv ention indicated  
CTCAE Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
Causality Assessment  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug  is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (not related, unlikely to be r elated) – The time course betwee n the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) is suspected.  
Yes (possibly, probab ly, or definitely related)  – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) can be  
identified. 
The definition impl ies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from study drug administration 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other di sease the subject may have. 
 Concomitant drug 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the tr eatment the subject recei ves should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for th is class of study drug.  
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical an d/or mental stresses 
The exposure to stress might i nduce adverse changes in the r ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical 
and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug.  
The known pharmacologic propertie s (absorption, distri bution, metabolism, an d excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_435074] 
For subjects experiencing infusion -associated AEs, the Investigator, or designee, is responsible for 
determining if immediate discontinua tion of study thera py is required (see Section 3.3.2 ).  
In addition, for all cases of AEs associated with study infusion that occur during or within 2 hours 
after the completion of infusion require enhanced reporting using the specif ied Infusion-associated 
AE Report eCRF, regardless of whether drug discontinuation cr iteria are met. 
Note:  All treatment-related AEs of grade 3 or  higher and treatment-rel ated AEs of cytokine 
release syndrome and serum sickness of grate 2 or higher require discontinuation from study 
drug (see Section 3.3.2 ).

Statistical Methods  
Efficacy Analyses  
In all efficacy analyses, the placebo subjects from the cohorts will be combined.   Thus, the analy sis 
models will include t reatment group (four levels: placebo, low dose, medium dose, high dose) as 
a factor. Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression 
models.  Proportion endpoints will be analyzed using logistic r egression models. Quantitative 
endpoints will be analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models .  In all analyses, 
pairwise contrasts comparing e ach of the three active groups to the combined placebo group will 
be tested.   All efficacy analyses will be conducted using two-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance, with no adjustment for multiplicity.

Version 2.0, 15Apr2020 Additional efficacy analyses will be c onducted using the data from each cohort. Quantitative 
endpoints will be analysed using the two -sample t test and proportion  endpoints will be analysed 
using Fisher’s exact test. Due to the small sample sizes, time -to-event variables will be 
summarized des criptively.  Details of the data and process for the interim analyses will be described 
in the Stati stical Analysis Plan and SSRC Charter. 
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on data from the Safety Analysis Population. Adverse events 
(AEs), vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory evaluations will be summarized by [CONTACT_270415].  
Pharmaco kinetic Analysis  
MAU868 levels  in serum will be determined by a validated ELISA -based method. A  detailed 
description of the method used will be included in the PK bioanalytical data report. The  anticipated 
LLOQ is 50.0  ng/mL. Conce ntrations will be express ed in mass per volume units (e .g., ng/mL). 
Missing values or those concentrations below the LLOQ will be labeled as such in the data listings 
and reported as “zero” in data presentations and calculations.  
MAU868 serum concentration  data will be listed by [CONTACT_3598]/sampling time  point. 
Descriptive summary statistics of trough levels will be provided by [CONTACT_765]/sampling time point, 
including the frequency (n, %) of concentrations below the LLOQ and reported as zero. Summary 
statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD , CV (arithmetic and geometric),

Interim Analyses  
Following completion of the 12 -week treatment period of Cohort 1, unblinded safety and 
tolerability data (adverse events, clinical laboratories, vitals/physical exams and ECGs) , efficacy 
data (BKV viral load in the plasma) and PK (MAU86 8 plasma levels) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_349993] ( SSRC). The treatment assignment in Cohort 1 will be 
unblinded; however, these data will not include associated subject or s ite identifiers. The objectives 
of this interim analysis are  to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 1350 mg IV administered 
every 28 days for a total of 4 doses demonstrate:  
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in BK plasma viral l oad compared to placebo  
• predicted M AU868 plasma levels  
The conclusions from this first analysis will be used by [CONTACT_349961]868 early -on in this first -in-patient study. Unless a significant safety issue related 
to administration of MAU868 has been i dentified, the conclusion s will have no impact on Cohort  2 
or the study’s design.  
Following completion of the 12 -week treatment periods for Cohorts 1 and 2, cumulative unblinded 
data from both cohorts will be reviewed for  safety and tolerability (adverse e vents, clinical 
laboratories, vitals/physical exams and ECGs), efficacy (BKV viral load in the plasma) and PK 
(MAU868 plasma levels). The treatment assignments will be unblinded; however, these data will 
not include assoc iated subject or site identifiers. The objectives of this second interim analysis are 
to evaluate whether four doses MAU868 [ADDRESS_435092] dose followed by 3 more doses of 
MAU868 1350 mg IV administer ed every 28 days demonstr ate: 
• safety and tolerability signals compared to placebo  
• a decrease in viral load compared to placebo  
• predicted MAU868 plasma levels  
Based on the SSRC’s safety, efficacy and PK conclusions for Cohorts 1 and 2, the dosing regimen 
for Cohort 3 may be adjusted in dosage and/or duration; however, the dosage and duration for 
Cohort 3 will not exceed the dose already specified in the protocol. Cohort 3 will not be opened 
for screening and enrollme nt this evaluation has been completed

Section 3.3.2 of the protocol  outlines criteria for discontinuation from study drug.  All treatment -
related SAEs and certain treatment -related AEs and treatment -related laboratory abnor malities 
should result in immediate discontinuation from study drug.  Re -challenge is not permitted.  
Determination of whether an individual treatment related non -serious A E and/or treatment related 
laboratory abnormality should prompt discontinuation of st udy drug depends on the severity of the 
AE and laboratory abnormality based on Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5 grade.   
Note that the foll owing requires immediate discontinuation of study drug:  
• Treatment-related AEs of Grade 3 or higher (including infusion reactions) except for 
cytokine release syndrome and serum sickness where a severity grade of 2 or higher should 
prompt discontinuation . CTCAE criteria for infusion related reactions, cytokine release 
syndrome, and serum si ckness are below.  The complete CTCAE criteria for other 
treatment related AEs may be accessed at the  following website:

What is the background information that supports this research? (Summarize previous work and provide references.) The present study intends to determine the effect of psychoeducation on engagement with modifiable risk factors for depression and anxiety. While psychoeducation, and etiological beliefs about depression in particular, have been conceptualized as an important part of mental health literacy (MHL), little evidence exists to suggest what the content of psychoeducation should entail in order to improve the stated goals of MHL of recognition, management and prevention of common mental health problems such as anxiety and depression (Kelly, Jorm & Wright, 2007).  As such, factors that increase both engagement with modifiable risk factors are key to the prevention of common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Risk factors are variables that if present increase likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_154526]. Modifiable 
Page 5 of 15 1_Part II Application SOC-ED 112217 MRF.docx risk factors are those variables that could be reasonably altered by [CONTACT_233661]). For depression and anxiety, these include health behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, weight management, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], sleep, positive activities, physical activities and social support (Cairns et al., 2014; Zimmermann, Chong, Vechiu & Papa, 2017).  Prevention is especially warranted for college students, because they are at a developmentally unique time of life before which 80% of individuals have not yet developed anxiety or depression. With respect to onset of depression, 20% of those with depression experience their first symptoms at age 19, meet criteria by [CONTACT_654] 25, 50% meet criteria by [CONTACT_654] 25, meet criteria by 38. Thus, college freshmen are at a key stage before which most individuals will have developed a disorder (Munoz, Mrazek & Haggerty, 1996).  Growth mindset may be an important aspect of preventative psychoeducation. Dweck and colleagues’ (1995) cognitive model of motivation has generated a significant body of work demonstrating that individuals have “implicit theories,” related to the malleability of a trait, and that individuals set goals and behave with respect to that aspect. Thus, learned concepts about the mutability of a trait have consequences for future behavior, and persistence on challenging tasks in particular. Mueller and Dweck (1998) show that children who receive praise for intelligence are more likely to exhibit behaviors of entity theorists by [CONTACT_233662], whereas children praised for efforts are more likely to resemble incremental theorists by [CONTACT_233663]. Beliefs about the malleability of self-attributes are learned and apply to specific traits. For example, an individual may have learned that intelligence is fixed but that a personality trait such as hostility is flexible (Yeager & Dweck, 2012; Scott & Ghinea, 2014). With respect to mental health, research on malleability beliefs has been limited, but it does appear that engendering a “growth mindset,” is effective for the reduction of mental health problems (Schleider & Weisz, 2016).   
Page [ADDRESS_282030] depression outcomes in a sample of college students, with students endorsing beliefs in emotion malleability experiencing fewer symptoms of depression (Tamir et al., 2007). One possible mechanism through which this protective may occur is through the engagement with modifiable risk factors. Thus, research is needed to further demonstrate the effectiveness of growth mindset for the prevention of depression and anxiety, and to determine through what mechanism this intervention may be effective. 28. State the study purpose, research hypothesis, or research questions: The present study aims to determine the effect of presenting psychoeducation emphasizing “growth-mindset,” and information on modifiable risk factors on engagement with modifiable risk factors. We hypothesize that psychoeducation emphasizing that mental health is malleable will increase the participant’s engagement with risk factors outlined in the intervention.  Participants will randomly be assigned to complete one of four conditions:  (1) Growth mindset + Modifiable risk factor information (2) Control + Modifiable risk factor information (3) Control + Growth mindset (4) Control + Control  This design will allow assessment of the incremental effects of growth mindset and modifiable risk factor information as well as interactions between these conditions. We hypothesize that condition [ADDRESS_282031] increase in engagement with modifiable risk factors for depression and anxiety followed by [CONTACT_233664] 2-3 which will be associated with greater increases in engagement with modifiable risk factors than the control group (condition 4).   29.

What will participants experience or be asked to do when assigned to the treatment / experimental group or to the control group? In all conditions, participants will be asked to read an article about mental health and complete a battery of questionnaires at Time 1.

Page 9 of 15 1_Part II Application SOC-ED 112217 MRF.docx items rated from either 1-6 or 1-5 (Tarlov et al., 1989).  Healthy diet questionnaire. Healthy diet will be assessed using a 10-item yes/no scale total of 10 points for health eating behaviors. Higher scores indicates that the participant tries to eat more fiber, more fruit, more vegetables, more fish, less meat, less sweets and pastries, tries to avoid the intake of fat, the consumption of butter, removes fat from meat does not add sugar to drinks (Zazpe et al., 2011).

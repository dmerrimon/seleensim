 2. STUDY  SUMMARY  
 
Name [CONTACT_790](s):  
Medtronic / HeartWare  (hereafter referred to as HeartWare)  
Title of protocol:  
A Prospective, Single Arm, Multi -Center Clinical Study in Collaboration with the InterAgency Registry for 
Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMAC S®) to Evaluate the Thoracotomy Implant Technique 
of the HeartWare HVAD® System in Patients with Advanced Heart Failure  
Study Number: HW006  
Number of Subjects:  
145 subjects implanted via thoracotomy with the HeartWare HVAD® 
System.  It is anticipated that each site will enroll at least [ADDRESS_1080462]. 
No site will implant more than 20 patients into the study without prior 
written approval from  HeartWare.  Number of Sites:  
Up to 30 Sites in the US and 1 site in Canada  
Study Design:  
This is a multi -center, prospective, single arm study that will evaluate the thoracotomy implant technique in up to 145 
subjects implanted via thoracotomy with the HeartWare HVAD® System and enrolled in the InterAgency Registry for 
Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTER MACS®) protocol and database.  
All participating centers will be current enrolled INTERMACS® sites in good standing and will follow the 
INTERMACS® protocol and procedures.  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is success at 6 months defined as all enrolled and implanted subjects:  
• Alive on the originally implanted device at [ADDRESS_1080463] has not had a stroke with a modified 
Rankin Scale ≥ 4 (assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080464] stroke event);  or 
• Transplanted by [CONTACT_43380] 6, and the subject has not had a s troke with a modified Rankin Scale ≥ 4 (assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080465] stroke event);  or 
• Explanted for recovery by [CONTACT_43380] 6, and the subject has not had a stroke with a modified Rankin Scale ≥ 4 
(assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080466] stroke  event).  
All subjects with stroke events from implant to Month [ADDRESS_1080467] -stroke 
mRS measure (≥[ADDRESS_1080468] stroke event) is obtained, even if this occurs after the [ADDRESS_1080469] to 
the primary endpoint.  
Secondary Endpoint:  
The secondary endpoint is an improvement in the mean length of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (initial recovery and step 
down unit) for al l enrolled and implanted subjects. The mean length of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785456]  
26.1 days for median sternotomy subjects.

Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will be collected according to the INTERMACS® protocol and procedure, as summarized in Section 
9. 
Device:   HeartWare® System  
The HeartWare® System is an implantable ventricular assist device, with the following major components: Implantable 
Centrifugal Rotary Blood Pump (HVAD® Pump) with Inflow and Outflow Conduits, Controller and Power Sources, 
Monitor, Power Sources, Battery C harger, Surgical Tools and Carrying Case.  
Intended Use:  
The HeartWare® HVAD is intended for use as a bridge to cardiac transplantation in patients who are at risk of death 
from refractory end -stage left ventricular heart failure.  
The HeartWare® HVAD is designed for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549641] -of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], including transportation via fixed wing 
aircraft or helicopter.  
The HeartWare® HVAD is contraindicated in patients who cannot tolerate anticoagulation therapy.  
Period of Evaluation:  
Subjects will be followed according to the INTERMACS® protocol and standard of care at the enrolling institution. 
Data recorded in the INTERMACS® database to the primary endpoint at [ADDRESS_1080471] implant of the HeartWare® 
HVAD will be evaluated.  
• Subjects  who have  been  transplanted  prior  to month  6 will be considered  complete  at the primary  endpoint  time- 
point.  
• Subjects,  who have  a device  exchange  prior  to month  6, will be evaluated  according  to the original  implant  date.  
• Subjects who remain on device support after the primary endpoint time -point, either the original device or 
exchange device, will be followed according to the INTERMACS® protocol until transplant, or until 2.[ADDRESS_1080472]’s study participation is considered comple te at either the time of 
induction  of anesthesia  for transplant,  or at the 2.[ADDRESS_1080473] implant  visit.  
• Subjects who have been explanted for recovery prior to month 6 will be followed until their next scheduled 
follow -up visit according to the INTERMACS® protocol, at which time their participation in the study is 
considered  complete.  
• The per -protocol analysis population will include those thoracotomy subjects with the outflow in the ascending 
aorta only.  As a result, enrollment may exceed sample size  requirements.  
• The per -protocol analysis population will include those thoracotomy subjects with the procedure performed on - 
pump only.  As a result, enrollment may exceed sample size  requirements.  
Subject data will be evaluated for a maximum of 2.5 years.  
Estimated  start  date:  October  2014 Estimated end date:   October 2018

Background:  
Heart failure is a progressive disease for which there are numerous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785457]; however, presently 
there is no cure and a more definitive therapy is not on the horizon. Cardiac transplantation is currently the most 
effective therapy for advanced heart failure. However, the lack of available donor organs restricts the use of heart 
transplantation to fewer than 2,500 patients per ye ar in the [LOCATION_002]1. In 2012, 2169 heart transplants were 
performed at approximately 125 heart transplant centers in the [LOCATION_002] (United Network for Organ Sharing 
website accessed February 23, 2013)1. Currently there are more than [ADDRESS_1080475], 
with 68% of those having a waiting time to transplant of longer than six months1. 
Clinical studies have shown a survival and quality of life benefit for patients supported by a left ventricular assist device  
(LVAD) when c ompared to those receiving medical therapy 2, 3. Approximately 35% of the patients who receive heart 
transplants are bridged with ventricular assist devices4. 
The US bridge -to-transplant trial (i.e. ADVANCE) was a multi -center, prospective, clinical trial designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of the HeartWare® System in heart failure patients listed for cardiac transplantation 5. The trial 
was conducted between [ADDRESS_1080476] 2008 and 25 February 2010 with a total enrollment of 160, including 140 implants  at 
30 sites. The implant procedure chosen for placement of the HVAD® Pump in this trial was via a median sternotomy5, 
and the current Instructions for Use (IFU) and patient materials reference this implant method and describe the 
associated risks.  
Since t he HVAD® Pump is small and designed to be placed within the pericardial space alternative implant procedures 
have been developed. Surgeons in Europe, Canada, and the [LOCATION_002] and throughout the world have successfully 
implanted the HVAD® Pump using bo th thoracotomy and sternotomy approaches 6-8. It is believed that the addition of  
the thoracotomy implant procedure will provide clinicians an additional option to optimize results and expand the  
potential patient population. There is a growing trend towar d the use of less invasive non -sternotomy incisions in all 
fields of cardiac surgery. While a median sternotomy provides the best access to the heart and great vessels, the same 
exposure could be accomplished with several smaller thoracotomy incisions. The  potential benefit to the subject 
participating in this study is the implantation of a blood pump using a technique that is less obtrusive and that may be 
more comfortable. Morbidity rates and time of recovery may also be positively affected. The thoracoto my technique for 
implant may provide benefits not currently available with existing technology such as less tissue trauma and shorter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
1. Must  be ≥19 years  of age at time of informed  consent  to participate  in the INTERMACS® registry.  
2. Subject  receives  a HeartWare® HVAD  (The  device  should  be the subject’s  first VAD  implant).  
3. Subject  signed  an INTERMACS® informed  consent  if required  by [CONTACT_785554]/CREB  policy.  
4. Subject signed a HeartWare® informed  consent  
Main Criteria for Exclusion:  
The INTERMACS® protocol has no exclusion for age, gender, race, ethnicity, or any other demographic limit. The 
following are exclusions currently described by [CONTACT_785555]® protocol:  
1. Subject is incarcerated  (prisoner).  
2. Subject  did not sign the informed  consent  at sites where  waiver  of consent  was not granted.  
In addition, for this study, the following exclusion criteria will be applied after enrollment into the INTERMACS® 
protocol:  
3. Body Surface Area (BSA) < 1.[ADDRESS_1080477] data is generated from non - INTERMACS® centers.  
8. Pediatric subjects (< 19 years of  age).  
9. Subjects who receive a temporary LVAD (e.g., ECMO, TandemHeart, Imp ella, etc.) 
10. Subjects whose device strategy is listed as “Destination Therapy” at the time of  implant.  
11. Severe Right Heart failure, defined as mean central venous or right arterial pressure > 20 mmHg on multiple 
inotropes,  or right  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (RVEF)  <15%  with clinical  signs  of severe  right  heart  failure

(e.g. ascites, treatment with diuretics and two inotropic drugs).  
12. ≥ 2+ Aortic insufficiency or mechanical aortic  valve  
13. Planned  concomitant  procedure  (e.g. valve  repair  or replacement,  CABG,  septal  defect  repair).  
14. Known LV  thrombus  
Study Procedures:  
All participating centers will follow the INTERMACS® protocol and procedures. A summary of the INTERMACS® 
protocol and procedures can be found in Section 9 . 
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:  
The primary endpoint is success at 6 months compared to a pre -specified performance goal. 
The secondary endpoint is an improvement in the mean length of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Additional observational endpoints will also be assessed at 6 months. Statistical tests will not be conducted.  
Sample Size Justification and Statistical Considerations:  
Primary Endpoint:  
Success at 6 months for thoracotomy is estimated to be 86% compared to a performance goal of 77.5%. Using an  exact 
binomial test, with a one -sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% Power, a sample size of 145 implanted subjects is required.  
Secondary Endpoint:  
The mean length of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785456] 26.[ADDRESS_1080479] deviation of 22.8 days and a  median 
of 20 days based on data from the BTT CAP population (N=242). Using a one sample t -test, with a one -sided alpha of 
0.05, a sample of 145 implanted subjects with an average value of 21.3 days or less will result in Power greater than 
80%.  
Due to the  skewed nature of this data, a non -parametric test (one -sample Sign test with a one -sided alpha of 0.05) to 
assess a reduction in median days (from the estimated 20 days) will also be conducted for support.

Approximately 35% of the patients who receive heart transplants are bridged with ventricular 
assist devices4. 
The US bridge -to-transplant trial (i.e. ADVANCE) was a multi -center, prospective, clinical trial 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of t he HeartWare® System in heart failure patients 
listed for cardiac transplantation 5. The trial was conducted between [ADDRESS_1080489] acement of the HVAD® Pump in this trial was via a median sternotomy5, 
and the current Instructions for Use (IFU) and patient materials reference this implant method and 
describe the associated risks.  
Since the HVAD® Pump is small and designed to be placed within the pericardial space 
alternative implant procedures have been developed. Surgeons in Europe, Canada, and the United 
States and throughout the world have successfully implanted the HVAD® Pump using both 
thoracotomy and sternotomy approaches6-8. It is believed that the addition of the thoracotomy 
implant procedure will provide clinicians an additional option to optimize results and expand the 
potential patient population . There is a growing trend toward the use of less invasive non - 
sternotomy incisi ons in all fields of cardiac surgery. While a median sternotomy provides the best 
access to the heart and great vessels, the same exposure could be accomplished with several 
smaller thoracotomy incisions. The potential benefit to the subject participating in this study is the 
implantation of a blood pump using a technique that is less obtrusive and that may be  more  
comfortable. Morbidity rates and time of recovery may also be positively affected. The 
thoracotomy technique for implant may provide benefits no t currently available with existing 
technology such as less tissue trauma and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].  
The thoracotomy procedure most often includes a small hemi -sternotomy for placement of the 
outflow graft in the ascending aorta, although the descending aorta may be selected in some cases. 
While most cases have been done on CPB, many cases in Europe no longer use CPB. For this 
study it is recommended that cases be done on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_785557]

4.2 Previous Patient  Experience  
4.2.1 International Bridge to Transplant  Study  
Between March 2006 and June 2009 the HeartWare® HVAD was evaluated as a bridge to cardiac 
transplantation at five centers in Europe and Australia. Fifty patients were enrolled in the trial 
with the last patient reaching the 180 day endpoint on June 2, 2009. This summary covers the 
period from March 3, 2006 through June 2, 2009. The pump was implanted in the pericardial 
space in all patients using a midline sternotomy and cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. There were 43 
males and 7 females rangi ng in age from 20 to 75 years (mean 48.6 ± 13.6) of which 40% had 
ischemic disease. BSA ranged from 1.40 to 2.56 m2 (mean 1.9 ± 0.23). The total duration of 
support was 47.8 patient years.  The mean duration of support was 349 ± 223 days with 20 
patients s upported > 1 year and 3 patients supported > [ADDRESS_1080493] common significant

Update as of October 25, 2013, 45 patients reached endpoint, 29 patients were transplanted, four 
were weaned  from support after recovery, 11 died on support and 6 remain supported. Twenty 
eight patients were supported longer than one year and 13 greater than two years. Six patients 
remain well on support with five patients on support greater than five years. Kap lan Meier

The ReVOLVE registry was an investigator -initiated registry of commercial implants performed 
between February of 2009 and November 2012.  Patients receiving the HeartWare® HVAD 
System for labeled indications only are included in this report. Data was collected at nine centers 
in Europe (7) and Australia (2). The ReVOLVE registry was not sponsored by [CONTACT_549654], 
although HeartWare provided support and assisted in the analysi s of the data. While the data was 
not monitored on -site, steps were taken to verify the accuracy through telephone and email

4.2.3  US Bridge to Transplant  Trial  
A bridge -to-transplant trial (i.e. ADVANCE) was conducted in the US. ADVANCE was a multi - 
center, prospective, clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HeartWare® 
HVAD in heart failure patients listed for cardiac transplantation. Enrollment into the study began 
on [ADDRESS_1080501] 2008.  The trial ended on 25 February 2010 with a total enrollment of 160, 
including 140 implants at 30 sites. Subjects were predominately male (72.1%), were 53.3 (± 10.3) 
years of age and 23% were Black/African American. BMI and BSA were 28.6 (± 6.1) kg/m2 and 
2.1 (± 0.3) m2, respectively and the average LVEF was 17.8% (± 7.1%). PCWP was elevated at 
23 (± 9) mmHg and pulmonary artery pressures were also high: 49 (±15) / 25 (± 9) mmHg. The 
cardiac index was significantly reduced at 2.0 ± 0.5. The majority of subjects were classified as 
NYHA class IV (95%). The most common etiologies were ischemic disease in (40.7%) and 
idiopathic etiology (45.7%). Duration of heart failure was g reater than 5 years in 48.6% (68/140) 
of subjects.  It was also observed that 17.9% and 13.6% of subjects had heart failures from [ADDRESS_1080502] common underlying risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
were smoking (64.3%) hyper tension (62.9%) and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (54.3%). For prior cardiac 
surgery, 6.4% (9/140) of subjects reported a prior history of coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] 
(CABG). No subject reported valve replacement, but valve repair was reported in 2.1% (3/140). 
LV red uction was reported in 7.1% (10/140) and prior sternotomy and prior thoracotomy in 
15.7% (22/140) and 3.6% (5/140) of subjects, respectively. Intra -aortic balloon pump therapy at 
baseline was reported for 25% of subjects and 85% presented with an implantab le cardioverter - 
defibrillator (AICD). At Baseline 80% of subjects in the HVAD treatment group were on 
intravenous inotropic therapy and 23% were on more than one inotrope, while 82% of subjects 
received diuretics. Mean hematological and laboratory values at baseline showed an elevated 
BUN at 26 (+14) mg/dL and a depressed hematocrit of 34.0% (+ 5.8%).  
 
The median time from incision to wire closure of the sternum was 3 hours and 23 minutes and 
median time on by[CONTACT_785558] 70 minutes. Subjects received (median)  1.5 units of packed red blood 
cells (PRBC).  The median parameters for HVAD settings were: 2700 rpm at 3.8 watts, yielding  
4.6 L/min of flow. In addition to implant, a number of additional surgical procedures were 
performed. The most common were patent fo ramen ovale (PFO)/atrial septal defect (ASD) 
closures (11/140) and tricuspid valve repair (11/140).  
A total of 776 events were reported during the 180 day primary analysis period. Of these 437 
(437/776, 56.3%) were INTERMACS defined specific events, and 33 8/776 (43.6%) events were 
recorded under the INTERMACS category of “other.” One UADE, chest wall erosion was 
reported during the 180 -day primary endpoint period.

with their originally implanted device and two deaths occurred after device exchange. There were 
26 device malfunctions reported for 20 patients during the study period.  Seven (5.0%) were due 
to the LVAD component; of these 6 involved thrombosis events, necessitating  exchange.  
The pre -specified primary endpoint analysis was a comparison of success rates using a non - 
inferiority margin of 15%. In the HVAD group the success rate in the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) / 
Safety Population at 180 days was 90.7% (127/140) and in the Per Protocol population 92.0% 
(126/137). The success for both Safety and Per Protocol populatio ns in the Control group was 
90.1% (448/497). The Primary analysis found that the 95% one -sided upper confidence limit 
(UCL) on the difference in success rates between HVAD group and controls was 4.5% for the 
Safety population and 0.9% for the Per Protocol population. Each of these limits was less than the 
15% non -inferiority margin (p <0.0001).  
Survival was defined as transplanted, or alive on device support, or alive after device explant for 
recovery. The overall Kaplan -Meier survival at 180 days in the HV AD group was 93.9% in the 
Safety population and 94.2% in the Per Protocol population. The corresponding survival for the 
INTERMACS control group was 90.2%. In addition survival status at Day 180 was assessed for 
all HeartWare® HVAD patients irrespective of  meeting a predefined outcome (transplant or 
explant). There were 130/140 (92.9%) of patients alive at day 180 (88/140 were alive on the 
original device, 5/[ADDRESS_1080508] device exchange, and 37/[ADDRESS_1080509] -transplant).  
The Quality of Life (Qo L) determined from KCCQ Overall Summary Score for the subset of 70 
patients who had data at both baseline and Month 6 showed a 31 point improvement over the 180 
day period. In addition, as measured by [CONTACT_20367] -5D Visual Analog Scale, 72 subjects who had 
both baseline and 180 day data showed an improvement of 29.5 points over the 180 day period. 
Functional analyses showed similar improvements. At baseline 133/139 subjects (96%) were 
classified as NYHA class IV. A Discharge visit was conducted for 128 patients (median duration 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785461] 19 days), and data on NYHA was available for 85/128, (66.3%) of these 
patients, data on 43 was not collected. At discharge, 4/85 (4.7%) were NYHA Class I, 47/85 
(55%) of subjects were class II, 26/85 (30.6) Class III and 8/85 (9.4%) Class IV. For the [ADDRESS_1080510], data collected at baseline and month 6 showed similar improvements in functional 
capacity. A total of 88 patients were still supported on the device at 6 months and of those, 74 
(84%), had 6 -minute walk  data at both baseline and 6 months, and they showed an average 
improvement in distance walked of 150 meters. Overall, both quality of life and functional 
capacity showed improvements following HVAD implant.

5. DEVICE  DESCRIPTION  
5.1 HeartWare® Ventricular Assist  System  
The HeartWare® System consists of a blood pump with an integrated, partially sintered inflow 
cannula; a 10mm diameter gel impregnated polyester outflow graft, and a percutaneous driveline. 
A strain relief is used on the outflow graft to prevent kinking and  secures the outflow graft to the 
pump. The driveline cable is wrapped with woven polyester fabric to encourage tissue in -growth 
at the skin exit site. The small, wearless pump has a displaced volume of 50cc and weighs 160 
grams. The pump has one moving pa rt, an impeller, which spi[INVESTIGATOR_785462] 10 L/min 
of flow. There are two motors in the pump housing with one motor providing redundancy. A short 
integrated inflow cannula is inserted into the left ventricle and the outflow graft connects the  
HVAD® Pump to the aorta. A sewing ring attaches to the myocardium and allows for pump 
orientation adjustments intraoperative. The device size and short inflow cannula allow for 
pericardial placement, which eliminates the need for abdominal surgery and device  pockets 
(Figure 1).

5.2 HeartWare® Controller   
The controller (Figure 2) is a microprocessor unit that controls and manages HeartWare® System 
operation. It sends power and operating signals to the blood pump and collects information from 
the pump. The percutaneous driveline is connected to the controller, which must always be 
connected to two power sources - an AC adapter or DC adapter and/or rechargeable batteries. The 
controller’s internal, non -replaceable, rechargeable battery is used to power an audible “No 
Power” alarm when both power sources are disconnected. The controller interfaces with the 
monitor through a data port.

5.7 Principles of  Operation  
Continuous flow pumps contain a rotating impeller that adds energy to the blood by [CONTACT_785560] (Figure 10). Impeller blades push the fluid 
through the pump using hydrodynamic and centrifugal forces. The net effect is to build up the 
fluid pressure, sometimes referred to as pump head (i.e., related to the differential pressure across 
the device)  or just head, such that the fluid is moved from the inlet to the outlet of the pump.  
Pump head is the difference between the afterload and the preload. Energy to rotate the impeller is 
provided through electromagnetic coupling between permanent magnets (rotor magnet) attached 
or enclosed within the impeller and the motor stators. The motor stators consist of coils of wire 
that are sequentially charged by [CONTACT_378393], turning the coils into electro magnets. These 
electromagnets have the effect of dragging the rotor magnets around an axis of rotation. The 
HVAD® Pump is efficient at pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_785465].

5.7.1 Blood Flow  Characteristics  
The amount of flow a rotary pump can generate is dependent upon the diameter of the impeller, 
the geometry of the impeller blades, housing design, motor capacity, rotational speed, and 
pressure differential that exists across the pump. This allows for in -vitro pump characterization for 
a specific pump and is the basis for blood flow  estimation.  
The HeartWare® System estimates blood fl ow rate using HVAD® Pump characteristics (electrical 
current, impeller speed) and blood viscosity. Viscosity is calculated from the patient’s hematocrit. 
To obtain the most accurate estimate of blood flow, the patient’s hematocrit must be entered into 
the HeartWare® monitor.  Flow estimation should be used as a trending tool only, as it cannot 
adapt to changing fluid conditions.  
The volume of flow generated by [CONTACT_785561]® Pump is determined by [CONTACT_785562]. The pressure that the HVAD® Pump 
must work against is similar to the mean arterial pressure. If the pump speed (RPM) is set too low 
then the device may not generate enough forward pressure. This can lead to retrograde flow (flow 
from t he aorta back through the device and into the left ventricle). The maximum rotational speed 
is determined by [CONTACT_785563]. If the speed is set too high and 
the pump attempts to pump more blood than is available, ventricul ar suction may occur.  
The controller operates in “Fixed” mode, which maintains a constant motor speed. The motor 
speed range is between 1800 and 4000 RPM. The appropriate speed should be determined based 
on the patient condition.  
 
5.7.2 Physiological Control  Algorithms  
The “Fixed” mode is used for HVAD® Pump operation means the clinician sets the pump speed 
(RPM). In addition, the HVAD® Pump control algorithms provide clinicians information about 
device performance and HVAD® Pump blood flow estimation.  
5.7.3 Flow  Estimation  
Estimated HVAD® Pump blood flow is calculated using VAD power, speed parameters, and 
hematocrit, based on a blood sample from the patient. The default hematocrit setting is 30%, but 
for accurate flow estimation, the patient’s hematocrit should b e entered into the monitor.  
Adjustments to the hematocrit setting on the monitor should be made for hematocrit changes of ± 
5% or greater.  
 
5.7.4 Ventricular Suction Detection  Alarm  
A suction condition may occur due to ventricular collapse or inflow occlusion. V entricular 
collapse occurs when a continuous flow VAD attempts to pump more blood from the left ventricle 
than is available, resulting in considerable reduction in ventricular volume. Left ventricular 
collapse can be the result of clinical events affecting  left ventricular preload, including 
hypovolemia (bleeding), right heart failure, arrhythmia or pulmonary embolus. An inflow 
occlusion occurs when the inflow cannula is obstructed by [CONTACT_785564], also

causing a suction condition. Temporary inflow obstruction can occur as a result of surgical 
positioning, patient position or during straining (valsalva).  
The ventricular suction detection alarm functions by [CONTACT_785565]. A flow baseline is established by [CONTACT_785566]. A trigger value is established at 40% below the estimated flow baseline. An indication of 
suction is obtained when the minimum flow falls below this trigger level. The alarm wil l be 
triggered if this condition is maintained for 10 seconds.  
The flow minimum that triggers the suction alarm is also used to define the suction clear limit. 
The estimated flow baseline is continuously compared to this limit. The suction alarm will be 
cleared if the flow baseline is maintained above the trigger level for 20 seconds. This is an 
indication that the suction condition has cleared.  
The ventricular suction detection alarm can only be activated from th e System Screen of the 
monitor. Therefore, only the clinician has access to control the state of this alarm. The default 
setting for Suction Response is off. In this mode, there will be no alarm during a ventricular 
suction condition. An “Sx Off” message w ill be displayed on the lower left -hand corner of the 
monitor screen below the “Fixed” mode display. When Suction Response is enabled (via the 
“Alarm” button), the “Sx On” message will be displayed on the lower left -hand corner of the 
monitor screen below the “Fixed” mode display.  
The Suction Response “Alarm” mode must not be turned on if the patient is in a suction condition. 
If the mode is turned on during a suction condition, the “Sx On” message will be displayed on the 
monitor and the ventricular suctio n detection alarm will be enabled but will be inaccurate due to 
the fact that normal baseline parameters could not be established during a suction condition. The 
algorithm attempts to establish a baseline detection level to distinguish abnormal conditions.  This 
is not possible if the patient is experiencing ventricular suction when the algorithm is initiated.  
Once the suction condition clears, an accurate baseline will be obtained automatically and the 
suction detection will proceed. Manual changes to the s peed will immediately disable the 
ventricular suction detection alarm. An “Sx Off” will be displayed on the monitor screen below 
the “Fixed” Mode display. The clinician will have to reactivate the alarm after adjusting the  speed.

The vent ricular suction detection function will temporarily deactivate if:  
• The estimated flow value becomes invalid. Once the flow estimation is within valid range, 
then the ventricular suction detection will  resume.  
• The baseline flow value is less than 1.8 L/min – the algorithm loses sensitivity if the 
baseline and, therefore, the suction detection level gets too low. Once the baseline value is 
above 1.8 L/min, then the ventricular suction detection will  resume.  
 
The clinician changes the viscosity input – the algorithm recognizes that a change in the fluid 
viscosity will cause a change in the estimated flow. The ventricular suction detection reactivates 
once a new baseline is established.

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINT  MEASURES  
6.1 Study  Objectives  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of implanting the 
HeartWare® HVAD System via thoracotomy in patients at risk of death from refractory end -stage 
left ventricular heart failure, who receive the device intended as a br idge to cardiac 
transplantation.  
This is a multi -center, prospective, single arm study that will use data from subjects enrolled in 
the InterAgency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS®) 
protocol and database.  
All participating  centers will be current enrolled INTERMACS sites in good standing. 
Participating centers will follow study subjects as they normally do for patients enrolled into 
INTERMACS®. 
Endpoints will be evaluated for subjects who receive the HeartWare® HVAD System implanted 
via thoracotomy.  
 
6.2 Estimated Period of  Study  
6.2.1 Time  Schedule

database, including transplant date, reason for explant, and cause of death.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_1080542]’s participatio n in the study according to 
the INTERMACS® protocol and procedures.  
INTERMACS defines 17 specific event that it considers as serious event in patients receiving a 
VAD as these specific event definitions usually encompass the traditional categorization of 
serious (i.e. considered life threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in death, if the 
event results in disability or permanent damage, or requires an intervention to prevent one of these 
outcomes).  
INTERMACS® also defines a category of “ Other” adverse events and collects these as reported by 
[CONTACT_785575]. These will be summarized and presented in the study reports, but the 
recording of these ‘Other’ events does not capture the event seriousness or relationship to device 
(any even ts related to the device if applicable are captured under the INTERMACS® 
categorization of Device Malfunction).  
The events listing in the INTERMACS protocol are listed below and definitions included in

10.1 Pre-Implant Device  Management  
Refer to the HeartWare® HVAD Instructions for Use for detailed equipment set -up procedures.  
10.2 Implant  Procedure  
Refer to the Instructions for Use for the thoracotomy implant procedure, which describes 
HeartWare® HVAD placement in the pericardial s pace, cannulation techniques and tunneling of 
the percutaneous lead.  
 
10.3 Postoperative Patient Management including Blood Pressure (BP) 
Management  
Refer to the HeartWare® HVAD Instructions for Use for postoperative patient management 
guidelines.  
HeartWare strongly recommends BP Management for all implanted subjects. Since the HVAD® 
Pump provides continuous flow, resulting in narrow arterial systolic/diastolic pulse pressures, 
monitoring of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is important. The recommended MAP t arget for 
subjects supported by [CONTACT_785576]® HVAD is < 85 mmHg (as tolerated).

11.1 Study Endpoints and  Hypotheses  
11.1.1  Analysis  Populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population will include all enrolled subjects intended to receive 
the HVAD® pump via thoracotomy at the time of skin incision.  
The Per -Protocol (PP) subject population will include all ITT subjects who were implanted with 
the HVAD pump® via thoracotomy, on -pump, and with outflow to the ascend ing aorta. Sample 
size requirements reflect the minimum number of subjects needed for the PP population.  
The primary analysis population is the PP population. All endpoints will be assessed on the ITT 
and PP populations.  
 
11.1.2  Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is success at 6 months defined as all enrolled and implanted subjects:  
• Alive on the originally implanted device at [ADDRESS_1080549] has not had a stroke 
with a modified Rankin Scale ≥ 4 (assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080550] stroke event);  or 
• Transplan ted by [CONTACT_43380] 6, and the subject has not had a stroke with a modified Rankin 
Scale ≥ 4 (assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080551] stroke event),  or 
• Explanted for recovery by [CONTACT_43380] 6, and the subject has not had a stroke with a modified 
Rankin Scale ≥ 4 (assessed ≥[ADDRESS_1080552] stroke  event).  
 
All subjects with stroke events from implant to Month [ADDRESS_1080553] -stroke mRS measure (≥[ADDRESS_1080554] stroke event) is obtained, even if this occurs 
after the [ADDRESS_1080555] to the primary endpoint.

The success prevalence in the thoracotomy group will be statistically compared to the 
performance goal (77.5%) using an exact binomial test (i.e., the lower 95% one -sided confidence 
limit will be greater than 77.5%). Success will be met if the lower bound of the one -sided exact 
95% confidence limit is greater than 77.5%.

11.2 Sample Size  Justification  
Primary Endpoint:  
Success at 6 months is estimated to be 86% compared to a performance goal of 77.5%. Using an 
exact binomial test, with a one -sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% P ower, a sample size of 145 
implanted subjects is required.  
The target success estimate of 86% is based on the following:  
• The primary endpoint observed in the final BTT IDE Report for the more recent BTT CAP 
population (N=242), resulted in a success prevale nce of 85.8% (205 out of 239 eligible 
subjects) for sternotomy  subjects.  
• Post-approval data from the INTERMACS Registry (through Q2 2014), indicates similar 
results for the sternotomy population of 88.0% (396/450) with a lower prevalence of 
success for the  small subset of thoracotomy (83.3%, 55/66) and thoracotomy on -pump 
(82.6%, 38/46)  subjects.  
• The INTERMACS Federal Partners Report (from Q1 2014) indicates an 85% Kaplan - 
Meier survival estimate at 6 months. This is not the same as “success” in that post - 
exchange survival is  considered.  
• The INTERMACS Industry Report for HeartWare (from Q2 2014) indicates an 88% 
Kaplan -Meier survival estimate at 6 months. This is not the same as “success” in that 
post-exchange survival is  considered.  
Success will be met if the lower bound of the one -sided exact 95% confidence limit is greater than 
77.5%.  
For exploratory purposes, the primary endpoint will also be assessed and observed by:  
• Site 
• CPB (on pump, off  pump)  
• Outflow  location  
Secondary Endpoint:  
The mean length of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785456] 26.[ADDRESS_1080558] deviation of  
22.8 days and a median of 20 days based on data from the BTT CAP population (N=242). Using 
a one sample t -test, with a one -sided alpha of 0.05, a sample of 145 implanted subjects wi th an 
average value of 21.3 days or less will result in Power greater than  80%.  
Due to the skewed nature of this data, a non -parametric test (one -sample Sign test with a one - 
sided alpha of 0.05) to assess a reduction in median days (from the estimated 20 days) will also be 
conducted for support.  
For exploratory purposes, the secondary endpoint will also be assessed and observed by:  
• Site 
• CPB (on pump, off  pump)

• Outflow  location  
The sample size calculations were performed using nQuery Advis or®. 
11.3 Site Poolability  
The primary and secondary endpoints will be performed on pooled data, however, an Analysis 
Site poolability assessment will be incorporated into the design of the study. This will involve 
pooling sites into “Analysis Sites” with a tar get size of [ADDRESS_1080560] recently created previous Analysis 
Site. 
A Fisher’s exact test will be performed to test the homogeneity of success at [ADDRESS_1080561] (p -value < 0.15), an investigation of prognostic factors (i.e., baseline 
characteristics, medical history or other covariates of interest) will be reviewed to under stand 
variability between Analysis Sites. As a supplemental analysis, a logistic regression model will 
be performed to estimate the probability of success controlling for Analysis Site and the selected

  Version.  7.[ADDRESS_1080567] access to the heart and great 
vessels, the same exposure could be accomplished with several smaller thoracotomy incisions. For 
patients who will require more than one cardiac operation (for example, VAD implantation as a 
bridge to transplantation), avoiding a median sternotomy in the first operation will reduce the 
surgical risk of a redo sternotomy in the following operations. Less -extensive mediastinal 
dissection in non -sternotomy incisions could reduce the prevalence and severity of postoperative 
bleeding. This is particularly important in VAD patients who require early anticoagulation therapy 
after implant. In addition, with a thoracotomy the pericardium remains mostly intact, which 
results in the stabilization of right heart function and possibly avoiding right heart  dilatation  
during the procedure, especially when initially starting the HVAD® Pump. Many of these benefits 
also apply if the second operation is don e via thoracotomy. The HVAD® Pump is designed to be 
implanted in the pericardial space. Its small design allows some versatility in placement and 
therefore does not limit the implant to a single surgical procedure. This implant versatility 
provides clinici ans multiple options for implant and allows them to best match the patient with the 
procedure. There are some patients who may fare better with a thoracotomy rather than 
sternotomy. The potential benefit to the subject participating in this study is the im plantation of a 
blood pump using a technique that is less obtrusive and that may be more comfortable. Morbidity 
rates and time of recovery may also be positively affected. The thoracotomy technique for implant 
may provide benefits not currently available w ith existing technology. The potential benefits as 
mentioned above include:  
 
 
 
Potential Benefit  Thoracotomy Implant  
Less invasive implant procedure  • Smaller  incisions  
• Shorter  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785471]  • Less tissue  trauma  
• Virgin sternotomy at later  procedure  
• Thoracotomy at second procedure/device  exchange

12.2 Risk  Analysis  
There are no foreseeable, additional risks associated with the thoracotomy approach for 
implantation of the HeartWare® System beyond those historically associated with implantable,  
continuous flow LVAD systems. While no new risks have been identified, there are some events 
that can be more easily treated via a sternotomy as compared to a thoracotomy. For example, the 
LV can be examined for thrombus more thoroughly and RVAD support c an be more easily 
initiated using a sternotomy. The complications (LV thrombus, right heart failure) can be 
mitigated to some degree with patient selection, however, complications are unpredictable.  
Pneumothorax is a known complication of thoracic surgery which can occur in patients who 
receive either a sternotomy or thoracotomy, however since the risk of pneumothorax may be 
higher in thoracotomy patients it was added to the potential complications list. HeartWare 
believes it has used its best efforts to fo resee hardships and potential adverse events of either in - 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785472]® System.  
Implantation of an LVAD is an invasive operation involving a major thoracic procedure (median 
sternotomy or left thoracotomy), general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation and frequently 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. These procedures are associated with numerous risks including death. 
The HeartWare® Ventricular Assist System is implanted in the hostile environment of the human 
body. This environment places s evere challenges to the function of the device. Risks associated 
with the implant procedure and use of the device may include, but are not limited to, the 
following. Other than death, the adverse events are listed in alphabetical order according to

Executive Summary and Background  
The initial goal of INTERMACS® (the Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted 
Circulatory Support) was to establish a registry of adult and pediatric patients receiving 
a mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) to treat heart failure. With data 
collection beginning in 2006, INTERMACS® now serves as the national quality 
improvement system to assess the characteristics, treatments, and outc omes of 
patients receiving MCSDs approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).  
INTERMACS® also includes MCSD -implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722065]. These activities 
are supported by [CONTACT_785555]® data and clinical coordinating center (DCC) under 
contract t o the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  
 
The purposes of INTERMACS® include:  
1. Collecting pertinent and standardized patient demographic, clinical and device - 
related data elements from participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785482];  
2. Providing confidential periodic reports to the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], government 
agencies, and industrial partners to improve the quality of care of patients receiving 
mechanical circulatory support a nd to evaluate the effectiveness and optimal 
utilization and performance of these  devices;  
3. Fostering collaborative research based upon the data collected by [CONTACT_785583]®; and 
4. Serving as a scalable data infrastructure for pre and post market  studies.  
 
Broadly, the registry will enable evaluation of best medical practices for advancement of 
public health with respect to the use of MCSDs for the treatment of heart failure. Data 
reports from the registry are shared with the NHLBI, FDA and the Centers for  Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) through a collaboration agreement. The FDA is interested 
in patient/device outcomes as a way to monitor safety, and CMS through the Joint 
Commission utilizes INTERMACS® data for site -based quality improvement 
assessmen ts. Key performance measures are supplied to every participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785483], along with a description of the benchmarking methodology used, to 
facilitate comparison of one institution’s outcomes to aggregated national data.  
Following review of a  request for dissemination, data may be shared with basic and 
clinical researchers, with consideration for privacy regulations. Analytic strategies and 
data analyses are conducted resulting in publications, presentations, and potentially 
follow -up investig ations.  
 
INTERMACS® collects information pertaining to patients, care providers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and 
devices. Most of these data are collected through chart review by [CONTACT_785584]. Standard of care Quality of life (QoL ) and functional 
capacity data are collected for adults and pediatric patients through administration of 
instruments and tests. Additionally, standard of care neurocognitive data are collected 
for adults.  
 
INTERMACS® requires that to be a member in good st anding, each participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785484] 4.0  
02/27/2014  
7  
  
INTERMACS® database. To facilitate this requirement, INTERMACS® works closely 
with the member hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
INTERMACS® collects dat a on all patients receiving FDA -approved MCSDs at all 
participating sites.  Standardized data collection forms and practices are followed 
utilizing a web -based system. All Privacy Act provisions are followed in handling and 
storing patient protected health  information (PHI).All participating centers are required to 
obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Board (EB) approval before collecting 
registry data.  
 
An NHLBI -appointed independent Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB) 
evaluates the regis try on an ongoing basis as to procedures, findings, and adverse 
events to assure patient safety, confidentiality of records, and registry integrity. The 
OSMB advises the NHLBI and the INTERMACS® co-investigators when and if changes 
should be made.  
 
INTERMACS® is currently supported through a Public -Private Partnership, which 
includes funding from the NHLBI and fees collected from participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785485] -approved MCSDs.  
Collaborating Institutions receiving fundin g on this project include: 
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)  
Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785486]® registry is the national quality improvement system designed to 
advance the understanding and application of mechanical circulatory support in order to 
improve the duration and quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure . These 
activities are supported by [CONTACT_785555]® data and clinical coordin ating center 
(located at UAB and hereafter referred to as the DCC) under contract to the NHLBI. 
INTERMACS® functions as a partnership between the NHLBI, FDA, CMS, participating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and industry with the intent of generating outcome standards for cur rent 
clinical device application, providing a platform for the introduction of new technology, 
and acting as a vehicle for the evaluation of patient -device interactions.  
 
Registry Organization  
A university -based DCC (UAB) is responsible for administrative support, data collection 
and management, site activation and monitoring, data analysis and reporting, as well as 
registry coordination. Oversight includes an Executive Committee comprised of NHLBI 
staff and nationally -recognized investigators in advanced h eart failure and MCSDs. A 
detailed description of the registry organization, its structure, and the various  
Protocol Version 4.0

committees responsible for ensuring the integrity of INTERMACS® can be found in the 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP).  
 
A. INTERMACS – Adults  
 
A.1.0  Registry  Design  
A.1.1  Patient  Eligibility  
 
Scope  
The scope of INTERMACS® for adults encompasses those patients receiving durable 
MCSDs approved by [CONTACT_785585][INVESTIGATOR_785487]. There 
is no exclusion for gender, rac e, or ethnicity.  
 
Screening  
 
Each patient who receives an MCSD at an institution will be screened according to the 
eligibility criteria listed below. For patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria, the 
following information will be recorded on the screening log: gender, race, age decade, 
brand of the implanted device (left or right side of the heart), date of implant, patient in 
an MCSD clinical trial, and death should it occur within 2 days of implant. This basic 
information is necessary to assess completeness of patient capture and possible bias in 
the registry. No further information will be collected on patients who do not meet the 
inclusion criteria.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
All patients ≥19 years of age who receive an FDA -approved durable MCSD * implanted 
at an INTERMACS®-activated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. (NOTE: Patients implanted before the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785488]®.) 
*Refer to MOP Appendix K for the FDA -approved Adult Device Brands List.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 
1) Patients who receive a durable MCSD, which is not FDA-approved.  
 
2) Patients who are <19 years of  age. 
 
3) Patients who are incarcerated persons  (prisoners).  
 
Follow -up 
 
All patients will be followed as long as an MCSD is in place. If a patient has an MCSD 
removed and is not transplanted, then the patient will be followed for 1 year. Vital  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/2014

 .  
 
status, including transplantation and survival, will be determined during this year. If a 
patient transfers his/her care to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the patient is deactivated at the 
implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785489] -activated at a new center provided 
the new center is an INTERMACS®-participating center. The patient transfer process 
can be found in the MOP, Section 4.4.  
 
If a patient has an MCSD removed and is transplanted, then the patient is no longer 
followed in INTERMACS® At that time, the patient becomes part of the Organ 
Procurement and Transplant Network ( OPTN) transplant database and will be 
followed by [CONTACT_785586]. A patient underg oing transplantation more than 1 year after 
MCSD explantation with no re -implant will be followed in INTERMACS® for the first year 
after explant to determine if they have undergone transplantation or died. If the patient 
undergoes a transplant, then he/she  will be followed through the OPTN database at the 
time of transplantation.  
 
A.1.2  Design  
While INTERMACS® was intended to be primarily a prospective registry when it was first 
established, in actuality the data are collected retrospectively from existing medica l 
records or concurrently in the normal course of treatment on patients who meet the 
eligibility criteria. Additional standard of care evaluations and contact [CONTACT_785587][INVESTIGATOR_785490].  Specifical ly, post 
implant follow up data are collected at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and every 
6 months after that for up to 1 year after the device is explanted. Physical examination 
and functional capacity testing is a routine portion of the care for the se patients; the 
interview consists of survey questions from the EuroQOL (EQ -5D-3L), Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the Trail Making Neurocognitive Test, Part 
B assessment. These interviews are described below in Section  A.4.4 . 
 
A.1.3  Additi onal Datasets  
With cooperation between industry and INTERMACS®, patients who were part of FDA 
device approval studies may be moved into INTERMACS®. The process for acquiring 
these data is developed on a case -by-case basis.

A.1.4  Major End  Points  
 
 
INTERMACS® provides critical and contemporary data on patient outcomes, with 
additional insight into risk factors and patient -related indices. Death, transplant, and 
explant for recovery are the  major discrete endpoints recorded, to provide the most 
fundamental outcome statistics.  
 
Information about re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785491], which is particularly relevant for the patient populat ion with 
advanced heart failure receiving ventricular assist devices, as re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785492]. In addition, the number 
of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785493], aft er the initial 
implant. Any subsequent surgery or implants are also noted in addition to the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785494]. Specific attention is devoted to capturing this parameter in order to provide a 
relative estimate of cost.  
 
The complex endpoints that include th e patient’s functional capacity and QoL are also 
critical to the evaluation of current MCSD therapy, for which improvements in both 
survival and function have been compelling. These indices become increasingly 
important as patient survival improves. When c omparing device therapy among various 
devices, estimates of quality -adjusted survival and cost -effectiveness require 
quantification of quality and estimates of cost based on resource utilization, as 
discussed above.  
 
Defining and recording adverse events a re important data collected within the Registry. 
Definitions of adverse events within the registry are fluid and reflect changing clinical 
practices and device characteristics.  The incidence and prevalence of adverse events    Baseline Variables And Endpoints

are made with in the context of device type, management practices, patient co - 
morbidities, timing of implantation, surgical experience and technique; all are based on 
uniform adverse event definitions. For each major adverse event (device malfunction, 
bleeding, infecti on, neurological, and death), additional variables must be included 
which potentially allow a determination of whether an adverse event most likely resulted 
from device design failure or malfunction ( device -related), patient co -morbid conditions 
(patient -related) , or errors in patient management (e.g., inadequate anti -coagulation) 
(management -related ). 
 
 
A.2.[ADDRESS_1080589] be completed to become an active 
participant in INTERMACS®. 
 
A.2.1  Eligibility  
Any medical center in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada that has an active 
MCSD program is eligible to participate in INTERMACS®. In addition, the 
program must provide personnel  and facilities to record and transmit 
data.  
 
A.2.2  Registration  
INTERMACS® registration must be completed online at: 
https:// www.intermacs.org/enrollment . The steps necessary for INTERMACS® 
membership are outl ined in detail in the MOP.  
 
1. The medical center is registered by [CONTACT_785588][INVESTIGATOR_785495].  
2. The Personnel Contact [CONTACT_465470], including staff roles, must also be 
completed.  
 
In order to complete the registration process, the Center must assign the following roles 
to qualified personnel:  
 
• Local Principal Investigator (PI), responsible for oversight of data submissions 
and registry  compliance  
• Site Administrator , to act as “point person” for data related inquiries, receipt of 
reports and audit  coordination

A.2.3  IRB/EB  Approval  
In preparation of materials for IRB/EB review and approval, participating sites will use 
the INTERMACS® protocol, which is a two -part registry – INTERMACS®- Adults and 
INTERMACS® - Pediatr ics/pediMACS. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785496]® 
protocol and supporting documentation (e.g., request for waiver of consent) to the 
IRB/EB for approval. The guidelines and supporting documents for the medical center’s 
submission of an application to p articipate in INTERMACS® are located in the MOP. If 
the IRB/EB approves the application for participation in this registry, documentation of 
that decision along with the Federal Wide Assurance Number (FWA) and current 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendm ents (CLIA) documentation must be 
submitted to INTERMACS® before a site can be activated. IRB/EB approval documents 
are submitted to the DCC on a yearly basis.  INTERMACS® will send annual reminders 
to the participating centers at least 30 days prior to ex pi[INVESTIGATOR_785497]/EB  approval.  
Lapse in local IRB/EB coverage will result in immediate suspension, including data entry 
capability.  
 
The facility is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all IRB/EB documentation. 
Documentation of IRB/EB status is subject  to INTERMACS® audit.  
 
A.2.4  Agreements and  Fees  
The Business Associate Agreement and Participation Agreement are provided in the 
MOP, Appendix D. These agreements are between the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785498]®. They contain the center’s and INTERMACS®’s responsibilities. The 
signed agreements must be submitted to INTERMACS®. 
 
Each site must pay a required participation fee prior to activation. INTERMACS® is 
structured to provide value to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785499].  For example, INTERMACS®: 
• completes and submits Medical Device Reports (MDRs)specific to MCSDs to the 
FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 803.10 on behalf of each  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
• submits 21 CFR 803.10 -required reports to device manufacturers for each 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
• provides quarterly quality assurance reports to  each participating  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
• provides datasets for quality improvement purposes to participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785500],  
• creates patient specific chronological history of the major clinical events after 
implant,  and 
• encourages local physicians and coordinators to participate in the administration 
and activities within the  registry.  
 
A.2.[ADDRESS_1080590]  
Site personnel participating in INTERMACS® must complete a financial disclosure and 
conflict of interest form.  The form is  provided in the MOP, Appendix E .  The form must

IRB/EB policy.  
 
A.2.[ADDRESS_1080592] one INTERMACS® staff member  at the institution must complete the 
INTERMACS® training process, which requires participation in a live web -based data 
entry training session. The DCC will schedule the training once the site has completed 
steps A.2.1 through A.2.6 . 
 
A.2.8  Activation  
After completing steps A.2.1 through A.2.7 , site personnel will be notified of their 
activation (i.e., access to read or enter data in the INTERMACS® web-based data 
application). This notification will consist of a secure e -mail that will contain the 
individual’s user name [CONTACT_2383].

A.3.0  Patient  Safety  
A.3.1  Risks and  Benefits  
 
Risks  
There is no added procedural risk to patients through involvement in INTERMACS®. No 
risk or procedures beyond those required for routine care will be imposed. The data 
collected for this Registry are from medical chart abstraction . The only  exception is the 
concurrent collection of limited functional capacity data, QoL data via patient interviews, 
and neurocognitive data. The interviews and tests are standard of care for heart failure 
patients receiving MCSDs and are not considered greater t han minimal risk.  
 
There is always the risk of loss of confidentiality. However, safeguards, policies and 
procedures are in place to keep PHI in each registry record confidential as required 
under the Information Security clauses of the Federal Acquisition  Regulations. All 
registry information will be sent through a highly secure website to the INTERMACS® 
database. All INTERMACS® employees have passed background checks for 
government clearance to handle PHI. PHI is not available to anyone outside of 
INTERMA CS®, unless required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., to ensure safety). No published or 
unpublished report or visual or speaking presentation about the registry will include any 
material that will identify a patient in this registry.  
 
Benefits  
 
There is no direct benefit to  the heart failure patients who participate in this registry. 
However, future heart failure patients may benefit from the knowledge gained through 
this registry.  
 
A.3.2  Informed Consent  Process  
INTERMACS® will not require additional consent other than the routin e consent that is 
required for the MCSD surgical procedure. This is an observational data registry. In 
general, information will be retrieved from existing medical records. Minimal testing and 
contact [CONTACT_785590][INVESTIGATOR_059] i s required for follow -up 
interviews and physical examination. Physical examination, functional capacity testing, 
and interviews are considered standard of care for these patients. The interview will 
consist of questions from QoL instruments and neurocognit ive assessment. No data 
beyond the data gathered in the course of routine care will be collected for this 
registry.  
 
Patients will be provided with a summary statement describing the registry when 
completing the routine MCSD surgical consent form (refer to  Attachment 1 ). 
 
Participating sites will follow their local IRB/EB policies. Refer to the MOP, Section 5.2, 
for additional guidance and Appendix C for supplementary documents that may be 
required by [CONTACT_50810]/EBs.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080594] at any participating center. 
Recruitment is not appli cable since the registry obtains information through a review of 
existing medical records.  
 
There are no costs or compensation to the patient or patient’s family for participation in 
this registry.  
 
 
A.4.0  Data  Collection  
A.4.1  Assignment of Registry Identification  Number  
A registry identification number will be assigned to each patient prior to entry of data 
into INTERMACS®. This identification number will be used as the primary patient 
identifier between the site, INTERMACS®, MCSD manufacturers, and government 
agencies.  
 
A.4.2  Web-based Data Entry and Systems  Security  
All data will be entered through the INTERMACS® web-based data entry system. 
Complete documentation is contained at the data entry website ( www.intermacs.org ), 
and the INTERMACS® Site User’s Guide can be  found in the MOP, Appendix M. The 
forms should be filled out as soon as possible after the implant and at the time of follow - 
up events (within specific time windows). The data are divided into forms that 
correspond to the clinical time course of the pati ent. 
 
Minimal PHI [e.g., patient’s name; date of birth; last [ADDRESS_1080595] number; health insurance claim number (HICN), if applicable; device 
serial number; implant date; and optionally the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785502]], are 
entered into the INTERMACS® database.  This information allows the patient to be 
linked to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) transplant datab ase should 
he/she undergo transplantation, to CMS databases, and to FDA medical device safety 
databases.  
 
INTERMACS® complies with all national patient privacy regulations. All registry data 
shall be maintained on secure servers with appropriate safeguards  in place. All 
INTERMACS® employees have passed federal Health and Human Services (HHS) 
background checks for government clearance. Access to the production databases 
containing PHI is on a need -to-know basis only.  INTERMACS® personnel will  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080596] procedures, are being followed. Any breach of confidentiality and immediate 
mitigation steps will be reported to the appropriate oversight bodies (e.g.,  the NHLBI 
and the IRB/EB according to their institutional policies) and these immediate mitigation 
steps will be implemented.  
 
The database and web servers reside in an environment that provides multiple layers of 
physical and systems security. INTERMACS® is compliant with the Security Act of [ADDRESS_1080597] (FISMA). Regular audits take 
place to verify compliance.  
 
Systems security is deployed with third party software and hardware, strict adherence to 
policy, and re gular verification and auditing. The servers that host the web applications 
are built within the Windows 2008R2 framework. They follow Microsoft’s best security 
practices and group policy recommendations from the National Institute for Standards 
and Techno logy (NIST).  
 
Each server is monitored 24x7 for both intrusion and vulnerabilities by [CONTACT_785591]-party software package. Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012R2 
is used for deploying any system patches in accordance with security poli cies. The 
network is also protected by [CONTACT_785592] -virus retrieval and deployment system.  
 
Firewall software assists in preventing hacking, virus, and other security risks from the 
outside. Internally, the servers reside on a segmented part of the Vi rtual Local Area 
Networks (VLAN) that is isolated from the rest of the network protecting it from any 
adverse internal forces. All server access requires use of second level authentication for 
administrative access. Regular internal and external penetratio n and vulnerability tests 
are conducted by [CONTACT_238957] -party contractors to determine any weaknesses in the network.  
 
A.4.[ADDRESS_1080598] of the data elements is the establishment of 
seven INTERMACS® patient profiles that describe the clinical severity at the time of 
implant, aid in risk stratificati on, improve patient selection, and refine the definition of 
future trial populations (refer to MOP Appendix O for a description of the seven patient 
profiles). INTERMACS® also seeks to transition away from the artificial distinction of 
bridge versus destin ation intent, by [CONTACT_44745], before and at intervals after implant, the 
relative likelihood and limiting factors for transplant eligibility.

Device and Operative Details (implant)  
 
The critical elements which characterize the device an d describe the implant procedure 
will be recorded within [ADDRESS_1080599] -operative follow -up will be at 1 
week.  The remaining interval follow -up visits occur at 1 month, 3 months, 6  months,  
and every 6 months for the life of the device. If the device is explanted without 
transplantation, the patient will be followed for 1 year following explant for the major 
events of death or transplantation.  
 
The follow -up forms will all include information on vital signs and volume status, 
medications, basic laboratory values, and device settings. [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional status will be noted. At each time interval beginning with the [ADDRESS_1080600] of considerations relevant to that decision. Echocardiographic informati on will 
be included regarding function of both ventricles and atrioventricular valves.  
Hemodynamic measurement regarding filling pressures, pulmonary pressures, and 
cardiac output will be included when available.  
 
Adverse Events  
 
Data on specific adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_15781]:  
(1) The occurrence of hemolysis , hypertension and right heart failure are considered 
‘triggered events’. These events are ‘triggered’ based on the relevant medical data 
collected at follow -up and  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
(2) Other adverse events (see MOP Appendix A for a complete list) will be identified and 
collected through routine data acquisition at the specified follow -up intervals or at 
time of  event.  
 
A.4.4  Quality of Life  Data  
QoL will be measured by [CONTACT_20367] -5D-3L instrument (refer to MOP Appendix F), as well 
as the KCCQ (refer to MOP Appendix H). It is anticipated that completing these 
instruments will take the patient approximately [ADDRESS_1080601] -implant 
(3 months, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for the life of the device).  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080602], Part

assesses working memory, visual processing, visuospatial skills, selective and divided 
attention, and psychomotor coordination. It is anticipated that completing this 
assessment will take less than 5 minutes of the patient’s time. In addition, for patients 
who experience a neurological event, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score is 
recorded. The mRS will be administered at follow -up visits after a post -implant 
neurological event.  
 
A.4.6.  Functional Capacity  Data  
Functional capacity measures are collected pre -implantation and within follow -up 
intervals post implant at 3 months, 6 mont hs, and every 6 months thereafter. Included 
in these functional capacity measures are: [ADDRESS_1080603] a wide array of patient, 
device, and follow -up information. This section outlines the  general analyses and the 
statistical methods.

A.5.3  Patient  Profiling  
Patients who receive MCSDs will be characterized regarding their demographic data, 
medical history, and clinical status inclu ding descriptors of heart failure, pre -implant 
laboratory values and pre -implant hemodynamic data.  
 
A.5.4  Primary  Endpoints  
The discrete endpoints are death, transplant, and explant for recovery. Other endpoints 
include patient adverse events, re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], device related adverse events, 
change in QoL, costs (resource utilization), functional status and changes in 
hemodynamic parameters and laboratory values.  Each of th e endpoints will be 
analyzed as time related events.

Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080604] function is the 
instantaneous (or daily) rate of an event. This function can depi[INVESTIGATOR_785506], decreasing or peaking.  
 
Parametric hazard estimation will employ sim ple to complex hazard models depending 
on the distribution of the event. Both the parametric survival function and the 
corresponding hazard function will be displayed to provide a complete description of the 
event.  
 
Competing Outcomes  
 
Depi[INVESTIGATOR_785507] a sing le time -related event do not take into account other events. For 
example, a depi[INVESTIGATOR_785508].  
Patients are censored at time of transplant. If informative censoring does not exist (i.e., 
if patients are not  transplanted due to impending death but instead selected at random 
for transplant), then the depi[INVESTIGATOR_785509].  In reality, this rarely occurs, since patients are usually selected at 
a given time because of medical necessity. This informative censoring complicates the 
interpretation of this single event depi[INVESTIGATOR_182513].  
 
Alternatively, one may wish to estimate the simultaneous time -related probability of 
mutually exclusive events. Competing outc omes estimation allows the time -related 
probability of actually experiencing each of these events. At any point in time, a patient 
has either experienced one of the three events or he/she is alive and waiting for one of 
the events to occur. A probability c an be assigned to each of these four possible states 
and the sum of the four probabilities will be equal to one at each point in time. The non - 
parametric estimation of these probabilities is an adaptation of the Kaplan -Meier 
method. In the standard use of  the Kaplan -Meier methods, event probabilities are 
accumulated across time.  In competing outcomes analysis, the combined event is  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080605]. It only requires (assumes) that haz ards for different levels of risk factor are 
proportional across time. This assumption is often incorrect. The magnitude of the 
effects of the final risk factor model from Cox regression is not easily displayed due to 
the lack of a specified hazard model. This also prevents a simple, continuous depi[INVESTIGATOR_785510] a specific patient with his unique values of the risk factors.  
 
Consequently, we have pursued a parametric version of survival regression that builds 
on a framework of hazard functions. The concept is s till proportional hazard regression, 
but the hazard function is estimated and decomposed into additive phases. Each phase 
is then constructed to be a function of the risk factors. The model of risk is then totally 
specified as a mathematical equation that can be “drawn” for any time period and any 
specified set of risk factors. This system also allows the identification of risk factors that 
impact different phases of risk.  
 
Predictions  
 
This ability to produce time -related expected survival for a specific p atient (with his/her 
specific risk profile) is one of the strengths of parametric hazard analysis. The 
predictions are a function of the estimated hazard functions and the identified risk 
factors.  The hazard function and risk factors are derived from the actual data.  
 
Repeated Events (Adverse Events)  
 
Most adverse events can occur more than once. For example, once a patient 
experiences an infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], he/she remains at risk for another epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. These 
repeating events require methods that are an expan sion of the previously described 
methods.  
 
First Events Analysis  
 
The first occurrence of an event can be analyzed exactly as a terminating event such as 
death (see previous discussion). While this analysis does not appear very useful 
clinically for events  that recur frequently, it does provide a time -related estimate of the 
proportion of patients who have remained free of the event.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080606]. This approach will allow 
detection of device related event s whose occurrence rate is rising to unacceptable 
levels at some point in time.  
 
Cumulative Event Estimation  
 
Another useful display of repeated events depi[INVESTIGATOR_785511], on the average, for a single patient. This method of  depi[INVESTIGATOR_785512] a function of time.  
 
Modulated Renewal  
 
Another method of analyzing repeated events is the modulated renewal method. In this 
approach, the unit of observation is each epi[INVESTIGATOR_785513]. A patient is tracked from 
time of device implant until he/she experiences his/her first event. The patient is then 
re-entered into the analysis, with a new starting time and is tracked until his/her next 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. This process is continued for event re -occurrences. T he analysis of this data 
structure is then performed in the parametric hazard domain and is particularly 
amenable to risk factor analysis that incorporates the event history of a patient when 
predicting his/her next occurrence.  
 
Each of these methods for r epeated adverse events contributes to the understanding of 
the time course of the event and the related risk factors.  The methods will be 
particularly helpful in calculating the time related risk of device related adverse events.

A.5.6  Planned  Analyses  
 
Patient Characteristics  
 
Patients who receive MCSDs will be summarized regarding their demographic data, 
medical history, and clinical status including descriptors of heart failure, pre -implant 
laboratory values and pre -implant hemodynamic data. Novel aspects of the registry 
include the seven INTERMACS® patient profiles that describe the clinical severity of 
disease at the time of implantation. The categorization of patients into INTERMACS® 
profiles will facilitate risk stratification for outcomes  and advance the selection of 
patients who have sufficient severity of disease to warrant MCSDs. An additional 
component is the ongoing evaluation of patients with regard to evolving eligibility for 
transplantation and explantation in order to better under stand the factors leading to 
transplantation or explantation. Subsequent tracking of patients will allow the decision 
process to be continually refined for better outcomes.  
 
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_82658], measures of central tendencies, measures of 
dispersion, cumulative distribution functions, graphical displays, cross tabulations and 
correlations.  
 
MCSD Characteristics  
 
MCSDs that are implanted will be summarized according to their physical and 
physiologic characteristics (e.g., size, weight, pu lsatile or continuous flow, range of flow 
rates, etc.) and their initial flow settings. The Industry Committee, which consists of 
representatives from each participating device manufacturer, will assist in selecting 
variables for analysis that are relevant  to emerging technologies.  
 
Survival  
 
The analysis of post -implant survival will utilize all of the methods outlined in the 
previous section. The emphasis will be on the time -related pattern of overall death and 
each of the causes of death. The investigati on of risk factors, especially those risk 
factors which can be modified for a patient, will be a priority.  
 
Transplantation  
 
Time to transplant will be analyzed similarly to survival.  In addition to the examination 
of patient risk factors and device facto rs which predict survival to transplant, the 
prolonged implant duration in many “bridge” patients awaiting a suitable heart donor will 
facilitate analyses that give insight into longer -term “destination” therapy.  
 
Adverse Events: Patient - and Device -Relate d 
 
A key feature of the entire registry analysis will be the examination of the time course 
and risk factors for all of the possible patient -related and device -related adverse events. 
The methods listed under Analytic Methods will be used to evaluate these  interactions.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/2014  
24  
  
 
Competing Outcomes  
 
The major events that “compete” for a patient are death, transplantation and explant for 
recovery. The simultaneous time -related estimation of the probability of these events 
will be depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230]. Separate r isk factor analyses will be performed for each individual 
outcome event.  
 
Quality of Life (QoL)  
 
Repeated measures methodology will test for changes in pre -implant and follow -up 
interval measures. Multiple linear regression will be used to identify patient  groups who 
have the least and the greatest improvement in QoL. Analyses will focus on the impact 
of MCSD therapy on QoL indicators, comparisons with QoL after transplant and other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785514] (through published studies or parallel  patient 
cohorts).  
 
Costs  
 
Multivariate statistical techniques, most often regression analysis, are used to 
investigate relationships among the variables of interest. Analytical emphasis will be on 
resource utilization.  
 
Analysis of MCSD Efficacy  
 
In all of the analyses for death, transplant, recovery, adverse events, QoL, and costs, 
the effects of device characteristics (pulsatile flow, size, etc.) on outcome will be 
investigated. A major focus of INTERMACS® will be the identification of the strengths 
and weaknesses of the different devices for specific patient subsets and facilitation of 
the evolution of MCSD technology.  
 
Evaluation of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785515]® will be periodically evaluated for 
their outcomes. Th e basis of the evaluation will be risk -adjusted comparisons using the 
results of the multivariable analyses. The observed survival, depi[INVESTIGATOR_1797] a Kaplan - 
Meier, is also represented. The observed and expected deaths will then be statistically 
compared where  the patient -specific risk factors and length of follow -up are explicitly 
incorporated into the comparison.

A.6.0  Reports  
INTERMACS® will provide summaries to the following entities:  
 
A.6.1  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
Quarterly Statistical, Semi -annual and the Final Report will include an overall summary 
of INTERMACS® patient characteristics, implant characteristics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785516]/activation, adverse events and significant outcomes. Manuscripts will be 
provided for review w ithin 30 days of publication.  
 
A.6.2  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS)  
CMS will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_785517] a CMS -specific 
Quarterly Statistical Report.  
 
A.6.3  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  
In accordance with 21 CFR 803.19, sites participating in INTERMACS® (referred to as 
“user facilities” by [CONTACT_1622]) are exempt from the normal requirements in 21 CFR 803.30 
for adverse events reported to INTERMACS®. Instead, INTERMACS® will make the 
appropriate reports to both th e manufacturer and FDA on behalf of the site.  
 
Also in accordance with 21 CFR 803.19, device manufacturers participating in 
INTERMACS® are exempt from the 30 calendar day reporting requirement in 21 CFR  
803.50.  Instead, any adverse event reported to or re ceived from INTERMACS®, which  
meets the threshold for reporting in accordance with the MDR Regulation(21 CFR 
803.50) is due to FDA no later than [ADDRESS_1080607] report. All other FDA requirements concerning adverse event or 
complaint handling, investigation, retention, etc. remain unchanged.  
 
INTERMACS® (on behalf of participating sites/user facilities) and manufacturer reporting 
requirements are based on the exemptions granted by [CONTACT_179937] 21 CFR 803.19 as 
shown in the table below.  Refer to Section 7.3 of the MOP for additional information.

1) Objective performance criteria (OPC): Randomized trials of Investigational 
Device Exemption (IDE) MCSDs may not be practical. The FDA will often allow 
single arm studies where the results from an investigational medical device are 
compared with OPC.  These OPC are d erived from the literature or  existing  
databases. INTERMACS® can be used to generate OPC for the major safety 
endpoints after MCSD implant.  
2) Unexpected risks: INTERMACS® can be analyzed to identify MCSDs with 
unexpected risks for major safety  events.  
 
A.6.4  Indus try 
In addition to the reports discussed in Section A.6.3 , quarterly reports will be provided to 
each MCSD manufacturer summarizing data entered into INTERMACS®. A specific 
manufacturer will not receive identifiable information about any MCSDs from other 
manufacturers.  The reports will provide statistical summaries of patient demographics

will be on completeness of periodic follow -up and also on identifying impossible or 
improbable combinations of variables.  Questionable data points will be verified.  
 
A.7.[ADDRESS_1080611] to analytical quality assurance (QA) audits following the 
completion of data entry. Depending on the types of discrepancies identified, 
INTERMACS® will contact [CONTACT_785593]. Resolution may 
be accomplished via telephone contact, e -mail and/or hard copy mailings. The 
discrepancies and their resolutions will be tracked for future reference and further 
review.  Based on a review of the results of the an alytical QA processes, additional 
items may be incorporated into the QA process at the Executive Committee’s  request.  
Participating centers will be able to review and modify previously submitted data at any 
time. Additionally, summary screens and reports o f patients and devices reported, 
current patient status, most recent reported event and other data will be available to the 
member institutions to assist the institution in assessing the completeness of reporting. 
INTERMACS® will employ established procedu res to maintain the quality of

A.7.3  Medical Event  Review  
Medical event review is a function of both the DCC and the Medical Event Review 
Committee.  The Committee will:  
• provide guidance on summarizing and evaluating the quality of the adverse 
event  data;  
• provide strategies for electronically identifying duplicate events and questionable 
events;  
• focus on the review and categorization of devi ce malfunction;  and 
• provide guidance to the nurse monitors for auditing the correct capture of 
adverse events. All data identified as questionable are resolved via direct 
interactions between the nurse monitors and the local  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080613] of c ontacts.  
 
A.8.4  Audit Process for  Centers  
The audit process for all participating INTERMACS® sites involves interactions in the 
form of an on -site visit or a review of the documents submitted to the DCC and 
discussion with site staff via telephone and/or WebEx ( remote review). Sites are notified 
up to 60 days prior to a routine on -site audit. Audited data include key data fields, as 
determined by [CONTACT_744836]®. 
The INTERMACS® monitor contacts the site by [CONTACT_21197] a pre -audit review 
approximately 2 weeks before the scheduled audit. During the call, the monitor reviews 
site specific summaries for duplicated events, unknown sources of bleeding, unknown 
causes of death, device explants inconsistencies and any other noted discrepancies.  
The sites are requested to make co rrections and to provide redacted source 
documentation (as needed for remote review), prior to the actual audit.  
 
During the audit, monitors will review data accuracy of web -based data submissions and 
information contained in source documents as well as pa rticipant performance and 
progress. “For Cause” audit visits will be made as indicated by [CONTACT_80826][INVESTIGATOR_785522], which reviews hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785523].  All audit results will be reported to the Exec utive Committee.  
 
The audit process will identify member institutions that perform poorly in data 
submission compliance. The INTERMACS® monitors, in collaboration with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785524], will identify and work with these underperformers to i dentify 
reasons for low rates of data collection and/or tardy data submission. These institutions 
will be retrained on proper data collection methods with the goal of identifying and 
overcoming obstacles to submission .

B. INTERMACS –Pediat rics (pediMACS)  
The INTERMACS® registry for pediatric patients is also referred to as 
“pediMACS”, which is used throughout the remainder of this protocol, to 
differentiate it from INTERMACS®– Adults.  
 
B.1.0  Registry  Design  
B.1.1  Patient  Eligibility  
 
Scope  
 
The scope of pediMACS encompasses pediatric patients receiving durable or temporary 
MCSDs approved by [CONTACT_1622].  There is no exclusion for gender, race, or ethnicity.  
 
Screening  
 
Each patient who receives an MCSD at a pediMACS institution will be screened 
according t o the eligibility criteria listed below. For patients who do not meet the 
inclusion criteria, the following information will be recorded on the screening log: 
gender, race, age decade, brand of the implanted device (left or right side of the heart), 
date o f implant, patient in an MCSD clinical trial, and death should it occur within 2 days 
of implant. This basic information is necessary to assess completeness of patient 
capture and possible bias in the registry. No further information will be collected on 
patients who do not meet the eligibility  criteria.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
All patients <19 years of age who receive an FDA -approved durable or temporary 
MCSD * implanted at an INTERMACS®-activated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. (NOTE: Patients implanted 
before the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785525].)  
 
* Refer to MOP Appendix K for the FDA -approved Pediatric Device Brands List.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 
1) Patients who receive an MCSD, which is not FDA-approved.  
 
2) Patients who are ≥19 years of  age. 
 
3) Patients who are incarcerated persons  (prisoners).  
 
Once a patient is entered as a pediatric patient, the patient will remain in pediatric status 
until the implanted device is explanted.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080614]. If a patient has an MCSD 
removed and is not transplanted, then the patient will be followed for 1 year.  Vital 
status, including transplantation and survival, will be determined during this year. If a 
patient transfers his/her car e to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785526] -activated at the new center provided 
the new center is a pediMACS -participating center. The patient transfer process can be 
found in the MOP,  Section 4.4.  
 
If a patient has an MCSD removed and is transplanted, then the patient is no longer 
followed in pediMACS . At that time, the patient becomes part of the OPTN transplant 
database and will be followed by [CONTACT_785586]. A patient undergoing transplantation 
more than [ADDRESS_1080615] undergone transplantation or died.  If 
the patient undergoes a transplant, then he/she will be followed through the OPTN 
database at the time of  transplantation.

The complex endpoints that include the patient’s functional capacity and QoL are also 
critical to the evaluation of current MCSD therapy, for which improvements in both 
survival and function have been compelling. These indic es become increasingly 
important as patient survival improves. When comparing device therapy among various 
devices, estimates of quality -adjusted survival and cost -effectiveness require 
quantification of quality and estimates of cost based on resource util ization, as 
discussed above.  
 
Defining and recording adverse events are important data collected within this registry. 
Definitions of adverse events within the registry are fluid and reflect changing clinical 
practices and device characteristics. The incid ence and prevalence of adverse events 
are made within the context of device type, management practices, patient co -   Baseline Variables And Endpoints

morbidities, timing of implantation, surgical experience and technique; all based on 
uniform adverse event definitions . For each major adverse event (device malfunction, 
bleeding, infection, neurological, death), additional variables must be included which 
potentially allow a determination of whether an adverse event most likely resulted from 
device design failure or malf unction ( device -related), patient co -morbid conditions 
(patient -related) , or errors in patient management (e.g., inadequate anti -coagulation)

B.2.3  IRB/EB  Approval  
In preparation of materials for IRB/EB review and appr oval, participating sites will use 
the INTERMACS® protocol, which is a two -part registry – INTERMACS® - Adults and 
INTERMACS® - Pediatrics/pediMACS.  The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785527] 4.0

supporting documentation (e.g., request fo r waiver of consent) to their IRB/EB for 
approval. The guidelines for the medical center’s submission of an application to 
participate in pediMACS are located in the MOP. If the IRB/EB approves the application 
for participation in this registry, documentat ion of that decision along with the FWA 
Number and current CLIA documentation must be submitted to pediMACS before a site 
can be activated. IRB/EB approval documents are to be submitted to the DCC on a 
yearly basis. PediMACS will send annual reminders to t he participating centers at least 
30 days prior to expi[INVESTIGATOR_785497]/EB approval.  Lapse in local IRB/EB coverage will 
result in immediate suspension, including data entry capability.  
 
The facility is responsible for obtaining and maintaining all IRB/EB do cumentation. 
Documentation of IRB/EB status is subject to pediMACS audit.  
 
B.2.4  Agreements and  Fees  
The Business Associate Agreement and Participation Agreement are provided in MOP 
Appendix D. These agreements are between the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785528]. They 
contain the center’s and pediMACS’s responsibilities. The signed agreements must be 
submitted to pediMACS.  
 
The annual fee for participation in pediMACS is waived for the first year. After the first 
year, each site must pay a required participation fee. Pe diMACS is structured to 
provide value to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785499].  For example, pediMACS:  
• provides quarterly quality assurance reports to each participating  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
• provides site -specific datasets to aid in quality improvement at that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785529],  
• creates patient specific chronologic history of the major clinical events after 
implant,  and 
• encourages local physicians and coordinators to participate in the administration 
and activities within the  registry.

B.3.0  Patient  Safety  
B.3.1  Risks and  Benefits  
 
Risks  
 
There is no added procedural risk to patients through involvement in pediMACS.  No 
risk or procedures beyond those required for routine care will be imposed. The data 
collected for this Registry are from medical chart abstraction. The only exception is the 
concurrent collection of limited functional capacity data and QoL data via patient/parent 
interviews. The interviews and tests are standard of care for pediatric heart failure 
patients receiving MCSDs and are not considered greater than minimal risk.  
 
There is always the risk of loss of confidentiality. However, safeguards, policies and 
procedures are in place to keep the PHI in each registry record c onfidential as required 
under the Information Security clauses of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. All 
registry information will be sent through a highly secure website to the pediMACS  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080622] passed background 
checks for government clearance to handle PHI. PHI is not available to anyone outside 
of pediMACS, unless required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., to ensure safety). No published or 
unpublished report or visual or speaking presentation ab out the registry will include any 
material that will identify a patient in this registry.  
 
Benefits  
 
There is no direct benefit to the pediatric heart failure patients who participate in this 
registry. However, future patients with heart failure may benefit from the knowledge 
gained through this registry.  
 
 
B.3.[ADDRESS_1080623] with the patient/parents outside of the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785531] - 
up interviews and physical examination. Physical examination, functional ca pacity 
testing, and interviews are considered standard of care for these patients.  The 
interview will consist of questions from QoL instruments for patients and their legally 
authorized representatives. No data beyond the data gathered in the course of 
routine care will be collected for this  registry . 
 
Patients/parents will be provided with a summary statement describing the registry 
when completing the routine MCSD surgical consent form (refer to Attachment 2 ). 
 
Participating sites will follow their local  IRB/EB policies. Refer to the MOP, Section 5.2, 
for additional guidance and MOP Appendix C for supplementary documents that may be 
required by [CONTACT_50810]/EBs.  
 
B.3.[ADDRESS_1080624] at any participating center. 
Recruitment is not applicable since the registry obtains information through a review of 
existing medical records.  
 
There are no costs or compensation to the patient or patient’s family for participation in 
this registry.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/2014

B.4.0  Data  Collection  
B.4.1  Assignment of Registry Identification  Number  
A registry identification number will be assigned to each pati ent prior to entry of their 
data into pediMACS. This identification number will be used as the primary patient 
identifier between the site, pediMACS, MCSD manufacturers, and government 
agencies.  
 
B.4.2  Web-based Data Entry and Systems  Security  
All data will be entered through the pediMACS web -based data entry system. Complete 
documentation is contained at the data entry website ( www.intermacs.org ), and the 
pediMACS Site User’s Guide can be found in the MOP, Appendix N. The forms should 
be filled out as soon as p ossible after the implant and at the time of follow -up events 
(within specific time windows). The data are divided into forms that correspond to the 
clinical time course of the patient.  
 
Minimal PHI (e.g., patient’s name; date of birth; last [ADDRESS_1080625] number; device serial number; implant date; and optionally, the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785502]), are entered into th e pediMACS database. This 
information allows the patient to be linked to the UNOS transplant database should 
he/she undergo transplantation and to FDA medical device safety  databases.  
 
PediMACS complies with all national patient privacy regulations. All re gistry data shall 
be maintained on secure servers with appropriate safeguards in place. All pediMACS 
employees have passed federal HHS background checks for government clearance.  
Access to the production databases containing PHI is on a need -to-know basis only. 
PediMACS personnel will periodically review all activities involving PHI to ensure that 
such safeguards, including standard procedures, are being followed. Any breach of 
confidentiality and immediate mitigation steps will be reported to the appropria te 
oversight bodies (e.g., the NHLBI and IRB/EB according to their institutional policies), 
and these immediate mitigation steps will be implemented.  
 
The database and web servers reside in an environment that provides multiple layers of 
physical and syste ms security. PediMACS is compliant with the Security Act of [ADDRESS_1080626] the web applications 
are built within the Windows 2008R2 framework. They follow Microsoft’s best security 
practices and group policy recommendations from the NIST.  
 
Each server is monitored 24x7 for both intrusion and vulnerabil ities by [CONTACT_785591]-party software package.  Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012R2

02/27/[ADDRESS_1080627] the likelihood of 
success of MCSD therapy. Data elements  include seven patient profiles that describe 
the clinical severity at the time of implant, aid in risk stratification, improve patient 
selection, and refine the definition of future trial populations (refer to MOP Appendix O 
for a description of the seven  patient profiles). PediMACS also records, pre and post 
implant (at defined intervals), the relative likelihood and limiting factors for transplant 
eligibility.  
 
Device and Operative Details (implant)  
 
The critical elements which characterize the device and describe the implant procedure 
will be recorded within [ADDRESS_1080628] implant then the 1 month follow -up 
form will be completed. The remaining interval follow -up visits occur at 3 months, 6 
months, and every 6 months for the life of the device. If the device is explanted without 
transplantation, the patient  will be followed for 1 year following explant for the major 
events of death or transplantation.  
 
The follow -up forms will all include information on vital signs and volume status, 
medications, basic laboratory values, and device settings.  NYHA functional  status and

with the [ADDRESS_1080629] of considerations relevant to that decision. Echocardiographic 
information will be included regarding function of both ventricles and atrioventricular 
valves. Hemodynamic measurement regar ding filling pressures, pulmonary pressures, 
and cardiac output will be included when available.  
 
Adverse Events  
 
Data on specific adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_15781]:  
 
(1) The occurrence of hemolysis , hypertension , and right heart failure* are 
considered ‘triggered events’. These events are ‘triggered’ based on the relevant 
medical data collected at follow -up and  re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
(2) Other adverse events (see MOP Appendix A for a complete list) will be identified and 
collected through routine dat a acquisition at the specified follow -up intervals or at 
time of  event.  
 
*Refer to the pediMACS User’s Guide, Appendix N, for reporting of right heart failure.  
 
B.4.4  Quality of Life  Data  
QoL will be measured by [CONTACT_785596] (refer to MOP Ap pendix 
F). It is anticipated that completing these instruments will take the patient/parent [ADDRESS_1080630] -implant (3 months, 6 months, and every 6 
months thereafter for the life of the device).  
 
After implantation, the PedsQL and VADQoL instruments will be completed as 
scheduled, whether the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785532] a clinic visit.  Missing answers will 
be queried by [CONTACT_785597]. Reasons for not collecting 
the QoL instruments will be  recorded.  
 
B.4.[ADDRESS_1080631] implant at 3 months, 6 months, and 
every 6 months thereafter. Included in these functional capacity measures are:  [ADDRESS_1080632], gait speed, and cardiopulmonary exer cise indices.  
 
For pediatric patients <10 years of age, general functional capacity data is collected pre - 
implant, implant discharge, and at follow -up intervals (i.e., [ADDRESS_1080633]). Thes e data include the child’s 
functional capacity (e.g., sedated, paralyzed, intubated, ambulating), primary nutrition,

and if the patient has had non -medically required excursions off the unit (collected at [ADDRESS_1080634] impla nt and at implant discharge).  
 
B.5.[ADDRESS_1080635] a wide array of patient, 
device, a nd follow -up information. This section outlines the general analyses and the 
statistical methods.  
 
B.5.2  Purposes  
• Summarize the characteristics of the patients who are receiving MCSDs, when (in 
relation to progression of disease) they are receiving MCSDs and why (bridge to 
transplant, bridge to recovery, rescue therapy, or bridge to decision), and outcomes 
of the  therapy  
• Summarize the characteristics of MCSDs that are being  implanted  
• Describe post -implant adverse events and estimate their time -related  distribu tion 
• Determine risk factors (both patient related and MCSD related) for post -implant 
events  
• Contribute to evidence based management of patients with implanted  MCSDs  
• Provide device specific analyses to aid in MCSD  development  
• Evaluate safety and efficacy of  MCSD  implants  
• Determine the time -related costs (resource utilization) of MCSDs and the risk factors 
associated with increased  costs  
• Compare the costs (resource utilization), of MCSD therapy to other treatments for 
pediatric patients with advanced heart  failure 
• Evaluate QoL pre - and post -MCSD  implant  
• Compare alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (MCSD, transplant, medical) for pediatric patients 
with advanced heart  failure  
• Produce patient -specific predictions of time -related outcomes to aid in clinical 
decision making and allocation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785533]  
 
B.5.3  Patient  Profiling  
Patients who receive MCSDs will be characterized regarding their demographic data, 
medical history, and clinical status including descriptors of heart failure, pre-implant 
laboratory values and pre -implant hemodynamic data.

Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080637] function is the 
instantaneous (or daily) rate of an event. This function can depi[INVESTIGATOR_785506], decreasing or peaking.  
 
Parametric hazard estimation will employ simple to complex hazard models depending 
on the distribution of the event. Both the parametric survival function and the 
corresponding hazard function will be displayed to provide a complete description of the 
event.  
 
Competing Outcomes  
 
Depi[INVESTIGATOR_785507] a single time -related event do not take into account other events. For 
example, a depi[INVESTIGATOR_785508].  
Patients are censored at time of transplant. If informative censoring does not exist (i.e., 
if patients are not transplanted due to impending death but instead selected at random 
for transplant), then the depi[INVESTIGATOR_785535].  In reality, this rarely occurs, since patients are usually selected at 
a given time because of medical necessity. This informative censoring complicates the 
interpretation of this single event depi[INVESTIGATOR_182513].  
 
Alternatively, one may wish to estimate the simultaneous time -related probability of 
mutually exclusive events. Competing outcomes estimation allows the time related 
probability of actually experiencing each of these events. At any point in time, a patient 
has either experienced one of the three  events or he/she is alive and waiting for one of 
the events to occur. A probability can be assigned to each of these four possible states 
and the sum of the four probabilities will be equal to one at each point in time. The non - 
parametric estimation of t hese probabilities is an adaptation of the Kaplan -Meier 
method. In the standard use of the Kaplan -Meier methods, event probabilities are 
accumulated across time. In competing outcomes analysis, the combined event is 
analyzed and then probabilities are accu mulated separately according to which event 
occurred.  
 
Multivariable Risk Factor Analysis  
 
The most common multivariable method for identifying risk factors is Cox proportional 
hazard regression. This method assumes proportional hazards for different level s of a 
potential risk factor. The p -value results from testing the null hypothesis that the 
proportionality parameter is equal to one. The method is often called a semi -parametric 
technique because it does not require or estimate the form of the underlying  parametric 
hazard. It only requires (assumes) that hazards for different levels of risk factor are 
proportional across time. This assumption is often incorrect. The magnitude of the 
effects of the final risk factor model from Cox regression is not easily displayed due to 
the lack of a specified hazard model. This also prevents a simple, continuous depi[INVESTIGATOR_785510] a specific patient with his unique values of the risk factors.  
 
Consequently, we have pursued a parametric version of survival regression that builds 
on a framework of hazard functions.  The concept is still proportional hazard regression,  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080638] function is estimated and decomposed into additive phases. Each phase 
is then constructed to be a function of the risk fac tors. The model of risk is then totally 
specified as a mathematical equation that can be “drawn” for any time period and any 
specified set of risk factors. This system also allows the identification of risk factors that 
impact different phases of risk.  
 
Predictions  
 
This ability to produce time -related expected survival for a specific patient (with his/her 
specific risk profile) is one of the strengths of parametric hazard analysis. The 
predictions are a function of the estimated hazard functions and the id entified risk 
factors.  The hazard function and risk factors are derived from the actual data.  
 
Repeated Events (Adverse Events)  
 
Most adverse events can occur more than once. For example, once a patient 
experiences an infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], he/she remains at risk for another epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. These 
repeating events require methods that are an expansion of the previously described 
methods.  
 
First Events Analysis  
 
The first occurrence of an event can be analyzed exactly as a terminating event such as 
death (see previous discussion). While this analysis does not appear very useful 
clinically for events that recur frequently, it does provide a time -related estimate of the 
proportion of patients who have remained free of the event.  
 
The FDA Approach  
 
Most of the medical devi ce guidance documents from the FDA for analyzing events that 
can happen multiple times specify a specific analytic approach.  First, a calculation of 
the percent of patients who experience at least one event during the first [ADDRESS_1080639]. This approach will allow 
detection of device related events whose occurrence rate is rising to unacceptable 
levels at some point in time.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/2014  
44  
  
 
Cumulative Event Estimation  
 
Another useful display of repeated events depi[INVESTIGATOR_785511], on the average, for a single patient. This method of depi[INVESTIGATOR_785512] a function of time.  
 
Modulated Renewal  
 
Another method of analyzing repeated events is the modulated renew al method. In this 
approach, the unit of observation is each epi[INVESTIGATOR_785513]. A patient is tracked from 
time of device implant until he/she experiences his/her first event.  The patient’s then  
re- entered into the analysis, with a new starting time and  is tracked until his/her next 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. This process is continued for event re -occurrences. The analysis of this data 
structure is then performed in the parametric hazard domain and is particularly 
amenable to risk factor analysis that incorporates the eve nt history of a patient when 
predicting his/her next occurrence.  
 
Each of these methods for repeated adverse events contributes to the understanding of 
the time course of the event and the related risk factors.  The methods will be 
particularly helpful in calculating the time related risk of device related adverse events.  
 
B.5.[ADDRESS_1080640] to 
evolving eligibility for transplantation and explantation in order to better understand the 
factors leading to transplantation or explantation. Subsequent tracking of patients will 
allow the decision process t o be continually refined for better outcomes.  
 
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_82658], measures of central tendencies, measures of 
dispersion, cumulative distribution functions, graphical displays, cross tabulations and 
correlations.  
 
MCSD Characteristics  
 
MCSDs that are implanted will be summarized according to their physical and 
physiologic characteristics (e.g., size, weight, pulsatile or continuous flow, range of flow 
rates, etc.) and their initial flow settings.  The Industry Committee, which consists of 
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/[ADDRESS_1080641] survival to transplant, the 
prolonged implant duration in many “bridge” patients awaiting a  suitable heart donor will 
facilitate analyses that give insight into longer -term “destination” therapy.  
 
Adverse Events: Patient - and Device -Related  
 
A key feature of the entire registry analysis will be the examination of the time course 
and risk factors  for all of the possible patient related and device related adverse events. 
The methods listed under Analytic Methods will be used to evaluate these interactions.  
 
Competing Outcomes  
 
The major events that “compete” for a patient are death, transplantation  and explant for 
recovery. The simultaneous time -related estimation of the probability of these events 
will be depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230]. Separate risk factor analyses will be performed for each individual 
outcome event.  
 
Quality of Life (QoL)  
 
Repeated measures methodolog y will test for changes in pre -implant and follow -up 
interval measures. Multiple linear regression will be used to identify patient groups who 
have the least and the greatest improvement in QoL. Analyses will focus on the impact 
of MCSD therapy on QoL indi cators, comparisons with QoL after transplant and other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_785514] (through published studies or parallel patient 
cohorts).  
 
Costs  
 
Multivariate statistical techniques, most often regression analysis, are used to 
investigate relat ionships among the variables of interest. Analytical emphasis will be on 
resource utilization.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
02/27/2014  
46  
  
 
Analysis of MCSD Efficacy  
 
In all of the analyses for death, transplant, recovery, adverse events, QoL, and costs, 
the effects of device characteristics (pulsatile flow, size, etc.) on outcome will be 
investigated. A major focus of pediMACS will be the identification of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the different devices for specific patient subsets and facilitation of the 
evolution of MC SD technology.  
 
Evaluation of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785536]. The basis of the evaluation will be risk -adjusted comparisons using the 
results of the multivariable analyse s. The observed survival, depi[INVESTIGATOR_1797] a Kaplan - 
Meier, is also represented. The observed and expected deaths will then be statistically 
compared where the patient -specific risk factors and length of follow -up are explicitly 
incorporated into the comparison . 
 
 
B.6.0  Reports  
INTERMACS will provide summaries to the following entities:  
 
B.6.1  National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
Quarterly Statistical, Semi -annual and the Final Report will include an overall 
summary of INTERMACS® patient characteristics, implant  characteristics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785516]/activation, adverse events and significant outcomes. Manuscripts will be 
provided for review within 30 days of publication.  
 
B.6.2  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS)  
CMS may receive pediMACS -specific reports if  requested.  
 
B.6.3  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  
FDA requires “user facilities”, which they define as “a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], ambulatory surgical 
facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, or outpatient treatment facility”, to

1) OPC: Randomized trials of IDE MCSDs may not be practical. The FDA will 
often allow single arm studies where the results from an investigational medical 
device are compared with OPC. These OPC are derived from the literature or 
existing databases. PediMACS can be used to generate OPC for the major 
safety endpoints after MCSD  implant.  
2) Unexpected risks: PediMACS can be analyzed to identify MCSDs with 
unexpected risks for major safety  events.

provide step -by-step directions for auditing processes involved in data entry, 
maintenance, and review to ensure data quality and  completeness.  
 
B.7.3  Medical Event  Review  
Medical event review is a function of both the DCC and the Medical Ev ents Review 
Committee.  The Committee will:  
• provide guidance on summarizing and evaluating the quality of the adverse event 
data.  
• provide strategies for electronically identifying duplicate events and questionable 
events.  
• focus on the review and categorization of device  malfunction.  
• provide guidance to the nurse monitors for auditing the correct capture of 
adverse events. All data identified as questionable are resolved via direct 
interactions between the nurse monitors and the local  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
 
B.8.0  Centers: Requirements, Training, Assistance and  Audits  
B.8.1  Requirements for  Centers  
Each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785521]: (1) provide dated proof of initial and annual IRB/EB 
approval, proof of FWA Number, proof of Privacy Awareness Training for the principal 
site staff (to include the Principal Investigator, Co -Investigators and Site Coordinator), 
and proof of CLIA documentation;(2) have at least one person complete training;(3) 
enter complete baseline, implant and follow -up data on all patients; (4) submit to re gular 
and “for cause” data audits; and (5) correct identified errors in a timely fashion.  
 
B.8.[ADDRESS_1080647] training on an ongoing basis. 
This is a secure, subscription -based service that allows fo r meetings and their related 
documents to be conducted in a virtual electronic environment. Participants are allowed 
to view the trainer’s desktop. Attendees follow along as the trainer shows step -by-step 
instructions.

 B.8.3  Assistance to  Centers  
A comprehensive pediMACS Site User’s Guide will provide step -by-step instructions for 
using the system and will include definitions for all fields collected in the system. The Site 
User’s Guide will also identify main processes in the application and expl ain standard 
procedures for data collection.  Refer to MOP Appendix N.  
 
The DCC is available to provide assistance with data collection and entry, regulatory 
questions, data requests and analyses, and technical support. Refer to the MOP, 
Appendix L, for a complete list of contacts.  
 
B.8.4  Audit Process for  Centers  
The audit process for all participating pediMACS sites involves interactions in the form of an 
on-site visit or a review of the documents submitted to the DCC and discussion with site staff 
via telephon e and/or WebEx (remote review). Sites are notified up to 60 days prior to a routine 
on-site audit.  Audited data include key data fields, as determined by [CONTACT_785598].  
 
The pediMACS monitor contacts the site by [CONTACT_21197] a pre -audit review approximately 
2 wee ks before the scheduled audit.  During the call, the monitor reviews site specific  
summaries for duplicated events, unknown sources of bleeding, unknown causes of death, 
device explants inconsistencies and any other noted discrepancies. The sites are reque sted 
to make corrections and to provide redacted source documentation (as needed for remote 
review) prior to the actual audit.  
 
During the audit, nurse monitors will monitor data accuracy of web -based data submissions 
and information contained in source do cuments as well as participant performance and 
progress. “For Cause” audit visits will be made as indicated by [CONTACT_80826][INVESTIGATOR_785522], which reviews hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785523].  All audit results will be  reported to the Executive Committee.  
 
The audit process will identify member institutions that perform poorly in data submission 
compliance. The pediMACS monitors, in collaboration with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785538], 
will identify and work with these underperformers to identify reasons for low rates of data 
collection and/or tardy data submission. These institutions will be retrained on proper data 
collection methods with the goal of identifying and overcoming obstacles to submission.

 Adult Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 
(INTERMACS®):  Patient Information  
As a patient receiving a durable, Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) -approved mechanical 
circulatory support device (MCSD) at [insert institution name [CONTACT_785620]] , we plan to collect 
information about your initial device implant as well as your follow -up visits. Information that 
includes your medical history, quali ty of life questionnaires, and information about the health 
care costs will be entered into the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted 
Circulatory Support (INTERMACS®) database. INTERMACS® is the national quality 
improvement system used to collect and evaluate the characteristics, treatments, and 
outcomes of MCSD patients. This means that we will use the information entered into 
INTERMACS® to learn more about MCSDs and heart failure, which may lead  
to improvements in the devices and how we treat hea rt failure patients in the future. We may 
also use this information in the future to gain a better understanding of quality of life, medical 
practices, and  
other factors associated with MCSD implants. While you will not directly benefit from this 
registry,  future  
heart failure patients may benefit from the knowledge gained through this registry.  
INTERMACS® data are used by [CONTACT_785599] M CSD - 
implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In addition, INTERMACS® works closely with the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, MCSD -implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], device 
manufacturers, medical teams and scientists to evaluate the best med ical practices to improve 
the treatment of advanced heart failure.  
 
Limited protected health information (e.g., your name; date of birth; last [ADDRESS_1080648] number; health insurance claim number, if applicable; device serial 
number; implant date; and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15168]) is collected by [CONTACT_744836]®. 
This information will allow your data to be linked to the United  Network for Organ Sharing 
database if you receive a heart transplant, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
databases for coverage purposes, to cost databases, to FDA databases and to the 
manufacturer of your MCSD for medical device reporting.   Because INTERMACS® complies 
with all national patient privacy regulations, all registry data are transmitted from [insert 
institution name [CONTACT_785620]] to the INTERMACS®database through a secure website and 
maintained on secure servers with safeguards in place. All Privacy Act provisions are followed 
in handling and storing patient data, and all INTERMACS® employees have passed 
background checks for Federal Government clearance to handle protected health information. 
Protected  health  information  is not available  to any employee  outside  of INTERMACS®, unless 
required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., to ensure your safety), and an INTERMACS®-assigned identification 
number is used to help maintain  your 
confidentiality. No published or unpublished report or visual or speaking presentation about the 
registry will include any material that will identify you in this registry.  
If other MCSD studies begin that use INTERMACS® data, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785539]. If at that time, you are in terested in participating in the 
study, you will be given information about the study and asked to sign an informed consent.

(pediMACS): Patient 
Information  
 
Because you/your child is receiving a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - 
approved durable or temporary mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) at 
[insert institution name [CONTACT_785620]] , we plan to collect information about your/your 
child’s initial dev ice implant as well as your/your child’s  
follow -up visits. Information that includes your/your child’s medical history, quality of 
life questionnaires, and information about the health care costs will be entered into 
the Pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory 
Support for Pediatric Patients (pediMACS) database. PediMACS is the national 
quality improvement system used to collect and evaluate the characteristics, 
treatments, and outcomes of pediatric MCSD patients. This means that  we will use 
the information entered into pediMACS to learn more about MCSDs and heart failure, 
which may lead to improvements in the devices and how we treat heart failure 
patients in the future. We may also use this information in the future to gain a be tter 
understanding of quality of life, medical practices, and other factors  
associated with MCSD implants. While you/your child will not directly benefit from 
this registry,  future  pediatric  heart  failure  patients  may benefit  from the knowledge 
gained thro ugh this  registry.  
 
PediMACS data are used by [CONTACT_785601] -implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In addition, pediMACS works closely with the Nat ional 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, MCSD - 
implanting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], device manufacturers, medical teams and scientists to evaluate 
the best medical practices to improve treatment of advanced heart failure.  
 
Limited prot ected health information (e.g., your/your child’s name; date of birth; last 5 
digits of your/your child’s social security number, or in the event that a social security 
number has not yet been issued for your child, the last [ADDRESS_1080649] number; device serial number; implant date; and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15168]) 
is collected by [CONTACT_785598]. This information will allow your/your child’s data to be 
linked to the United Network for Organ Sharing database if you/your child receive a 
heart transplant and to FDA databases, to cost databases, and to the manufacturer 
of your/your child’s  
MCSD for medical device reporting. Because pediMACS complies with all national 
patient privacy regulations, all registry data are transmitted from [insert institution 
name [CONTACT_785620]] to the pediMACS  
database through a secure website and maintained on secure servers with 
safeguards in place.  All 
Privacy Act provisions are followed in handling and storing patient data, and all 
pediMACS employees have passed background checks for Federal Government 
clearance to handle protected health information. Protected health information is 
not available to any employee outside of pediMACS,  
unless required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., to ensure your/your child’s safety), and a pe diMACS - 
assigned identification number is used to help maintain your confidentiality. No  
 
 published or unpublished report or visual or speaking presentation about the 
registry will include any material that will identify you/your child  in this registry.  
 
If other MCSD studies begin that use PediMACS data, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785540]/your child are interested in participating. If at that time, you/your

Adverse event definitions continue to evolve. The adverse event definitions below may be  
revised according to the published adverse event definitions as determined by [CONTACT_66121] (NIH) funded Mechanical Circulatory Support Database Registry 
(INTERMACS Manual of Operations Version 4.0;2014).  
The most current version of Ad verse Event definitions will be used in the study.

INTERMACS Adverse Event Definitions: 
Adult and Pediatric patients  
Approved by [CONTACT_785603]:  May 15, 2013  
 
This document contains the following adverse event definitions:  
 
• Hemolysis  •  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_418925]  
• Right  Heart  Failure  •  Venous  Thromboembolism  
• Device  Malfunction  •  Wound  Dehiscence  
• Major  Bleeding  •  Arterial Non -CNS  Thromboembolism  
• Major  Infection  •  Oth er SAE 
• Neurological  Dysfunction  •  Hepatic  Dysfunction  
• Cardiac  Arrhythmias  • Hypertension  
• Pericardial  Fluid  Collection  Adult  definition  
• Myocardial  Infarction  Pediatric  definition  
• Psychiatric  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  •  Renal  Dysfunction  
 
Additional Notes:  
Medical Device Reports:  
INTERMACS reports MDRs (FDA mandated Medical Device Reports) on behalf of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785541]. Each device malfunction adverse event that is reported to the 
registry generates a reportable MDR. This is the only mechanism for an  MDR. Other events 
(hemolysis, death, etc.) may lead to an MDR only if the event is associated with a device 
malfunction and the device malfunction is reported to the registry.  
Triggered Adverse Events:  
The adverse events, hypertension, hemolysis and right  heart failure are not directly entered into 
the registry. Each of these events is a result of direct clinical measurements. The clinical 
information collected at the specific follow -up information is used to identify these adverse 
events. For example, blo od pressure is collected at each follow -up visit. If the recorded mean 
blood pressure is above 110, then the event “hypertension” is internally identified. This strategy 
allows future adjustment of the “cut points” for an adverse event depending on the evo lving 
clinical understanding of the event.

Device Malfunction:  
 
A Device Malfunction occurs when any component of the MCSD system ceases to 
operate to its designed performance specifications or otherwise fails to perform as 
intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the Instructions for 
Use. 
 
Device malfunctions can be further defined as major or minor : 
 
1. Major device malfunction, otherwise known as failure, occurs when of one or more of the 
components of the MCSD system either directly causes or could potentially induce a state  of 
inadequate circulatory support (low cardiac output state) or death. A failure that was 
iatrogenic or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] -induced will be classified as an Iatrogenic/Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] -Induced Failure. 
A device malfunction or failure is considered major when one of the following conditions 
occurs:  
a. Suspected or confirmed pump  thrombus (see  below)  
b. Urgent transplantation (immediate 1A listing for  transplant)  
c. Pump  replacement  
d. Pump  explant  
e. Breach of integrity of drive line that required  repair  
f. Death  
 
2. Minor device malfunction includes inadequately functioning external components which 
require repair or replacement but do not result in 1a -f. Device malfunction does not apply to 
“routine” maint enance which includes repair/replacement of: external controller, pneumatic 
drive unit, electric power supplies, batteries and interconnecting  cables.  
 
 
Pump Thrombus represents a special case of major device malfunction and can be 
delineated as suspected pump thrombus or confirmed pump thrombus . Pump 
thrombus  will be classified as “SUSPECTED” (see definition below) based upon 
clinical, biochemical, or hemodynamic findings or “CONFIRMED” (see definition below) 
based upon device inspection or inco ntrovertible radiologic studies or absence of 
appropriate Doppler flow signals that confirms thrombus within the device or its conduits 
that results in or could potentially induce circulatory  failure.  
 
1. Suspected pump thrombus is a pump -related malfunction in which clinical or MCSD 
parameters suggest thrombus on the blood contact[CONTACT_785606], cannulae, 
or grafts.  Signs and symptoms should include at least 2 of the 3 following  criteria:  
a. Presence of  hemolysis  
b. Presence of heart failure not explained by [CONTACT_785607]  
c. Abnormal pump  parameters  
 
 HeartWare® HVAD  
HW006  
  Version  7.[ADDRESS_1080663] 2018  Page 167 of 175   
  
Suspected pump thrombus should be accompanied by 1 or more of the following 
events or interventions:  
i. treatment with intravenous anticoagulation (e.g., heparin), intravenous 
thrombolytics (e.g., tPA), or intravenous antiplatelet therapy (e.g., eptifibatide, 
tirofiban)  
ii. pump  replacement  
iii. pump  explantation  
iv. urgent transplantation (UNOS status  1A) 
v. stroke  
vi. arterial non -CNS  thromboembolism  
vii. death  
 
2. Confirmed pump thrombus is a major pump -related malfunction in which thrombus is 
confirmed within the blood contact[CONTACT_785608]. This can be reported via direct visual inspection or by [CONTACT_785609] b y the absence of  an appropriate Doppler flow signal that results 
in or could potentially induce circulatory failure or result in  thromboembolism.  
 
If a Suspected Pump Thrombus event is ultimately confirmed through visual inspection 
following pump replacem ent, urgent transplantation or upon autopsy following death, the 
event will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_785610].

Major Bleeding:  
 
An epi[INVESTIGATOR_785545] o ne 
or more of the following:  
a. Death,  
b. Re-operation,  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
d. Transfusion of red blood cells as  follows:  
 
If transfusion is selected, then apply the following rules:

Major Infection:  
 
A clinical infection accompanied by [CONTACT_77368], fever, drainage and/or leukocytosis that is treated by 
[CONTACT_14181]-microbial agents (non -prophylactic). A positive culture from the infected site or organ 
should be present unless strong clinical evidence indicates the n eed for treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_744816].  The general categories of infection are listed below:  
 
Localized Non -Device Infection  
Infection localized to any organ system or region (e.g. mediastinitis) without evidence of 
systemic involvement (see sepsis definition), ascertained by [CONTACT_785611], viral, fungal or protozoal infection, and/or requiring 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_179774].  
 
 
Percutaneous Site and/or Pocket Infection  
A positive culture from the skin  and/or tissue surrounding the drive line or from the tissue 
surrounding the external housing of a pump implanted within the body, coupled with the need to 
treat with antimicrobial therapy, when there is clinical evidence of infection such as pain, fever, 
drainage, or leukocytosis.  
 
 
Internal Pump Component, Inflow or Outflow Tract Infection  
Infection of blood -contact[CONTACT_404069]. (There 
should be a separate data field for paracorporeal pump that describes infection at the 
percutaneous cannula site, e.g. Thoratec PVAD).

Evidence of systemic involvement by [CONTACT_80601], manifested by [CONTACT_744858]/or 
hypotension.  
 
Neurological Dysfunction:  
 
Any new, temporary or permanent, focal or global neurologic dysfunction ascertained by a 
standard neurological history and examination administered by a neurologist or other qualified 
physician and documented with appropriate diagnostic tests and consultation note; or an 
abnormality identified by [CONTACT_785612]. The examining physician will classify the 
event as a cerebrovascular event as defined below or as a non -vascular acute neurologic 
event. A neurologic event may be recognized by a clinically evident sign or symptom, or by 
[CONTACT_183552] -silent electrographic seizure activity, or as a clinically silent lesion detected by 
[CONTACT_404072]. Each neurologic event should be classified by [CONTACT_785613]:

a. Transient ischemic attack, defined as an acute transient neurologic deficit 
conforming anatomically to arterial distribution cerebral ischemia, which resolves in < 
24 hours and is associated with no infarction on brain imaging (head CT  performed  
>24 hours after symptom onset; or MRI*).  
 
b. Ischemic stroke, defined as a new acute neurologic deficit (or acute  encephalopathy 
or seizures in children <6 months**) of any duration associated with acute infarction 
on imaging corresponding anatomically to the clinical deficit. Ischemic stroke should 
be sub classified as due to arterial -distribution ischemia or due to venous 
thrombosis.  
 
c. Acute symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, defined as new acute neurologic deficit 
(or acute encephalopath y or seizures in children < 6 months**) attributable to 
Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). ICH subtype should be specified as one or a 
combination of the following types: subarachnoid, intraventricular, parenchymal, 
subdural.  
 
d. Clinically covert ischemic stroke  or ICH: infarction or ICH seen by [CONTACT_785614], without clinical findings of stroke or ICH at the time of event  recognition.  
 
e. Hypoxic -Ischemic Encephalopathy: Acute new encephalopathy*** due to hypoxic - 
ischemic injury (HIE), manifest as clinicall y- evident signs or symptoms, or  subclinical 
electrographic seizures found by [CONTACT_785615].  
 
f. Acute new encephalopathy*** due to other causes, manifest as clinically -evident 
signs or symptoms or subclinical electrographic seizures found by [CONTACT_785616], ICH or 
HIE, as defined above. This category of "other" acute encephalopathy includes 
neurologic signs or symptoms or subclinical seizures found to be attributable to  other 
conditions such as meningitis, toxic -metabolic or drug -related  processes.  
 
 
*** Acute encephalopathy is a sign or symptom of some underlying cerebral disorder, 
and is manifest as depressed consciousness with or without any associated new global 
or multifocal neurologic deficits in cranial nerve, motor, sensory, reflexes and cerebellar 
funct ion. 
 
Cardiac Arrhythmias:  
 
Any documented arrhythmia that results in clinical compromise (e.g., abnormal VAD function 
[e.g., diminished VAD flow or suction events], oliguria, pre -syncope or syncope, angina,

dyspnea), or requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314556] (drug therapy, defibrillation, cardioversion, 
ICD therapy (e.g., shock or anti -tachycardia pacing) or arrhythmia ablation procedure). Cardiac 
arrhythmias are classified as 1 of 2 types:  
1) Sustained ventricular arrhythmia resultin g in clinical compromise, or requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785546], defibrillation, cardioversion, ICD therapy, or 
arrhythmia ablation  procedure.  
2) Sustained supraventricular arrhythmia resulting in clinical compromise,  or 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785546], cardioversion, ICD therapy, or 
arrhythmia ablation  procedure.  
 
 
Pericardial Fluid Collection:  
 
Accumulation of fluid or clot in the pericardial space that requires surgical intervention or 
percutaneous catheter drainage. This event will be subdivided into those with clinical signs of 
tamponade (e.g. increased central venous pressure and decreased cardiac/VAD output) and 
those without signs of tamponade.  
 
 
 
Myocardial Infarction:  
 
Two categories of myocardial infarction will be identified:  
 
 
Peri-Operative Myocardial  Infarction   
The clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_404007] -MB or Troponin > 10 
times the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404008], found within 7 days following VAD implant 
together with ECG findings consistent with  acute myocardial infarction. (This definition 
uses the higher suggested limit for serum markers due to api[INVESTIGATOR_785547], and does not use wall motion changes because the api[INVESTIGATOR_785548].)  
 
 
Non-Perioperative Myocardial Infarction  
The presence at > [ADDRESS_1080671] -implant of two of the following three criteria:  
 
 
a) Chest pain which is characteristic of myocardial  ischemia,  
b) ECG with a pattern or changes consistent with a myocardial infarction,  and 
c) Troponin or CK (measured by [CONTACT_404071]/laboratory medicine 
methods) greater than the normal range for the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_785549]® HVAD  
HW006  
  Version  7.[ADDRESS_1080672] 2018  Page 172 of 175   
  
fraction (≥ 3% total CK). This should be accompanied by a new region al LV or 
RV wall motion abnormality on a myocardial imaging study.  
 
Psychiatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]:  
 
Disturbance in thinking, emotion or behavior that causes substantial impairment in functioning or 
marked subjective distress and requires intervention. Intervention i s the addition of new 
psychiatric medication, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or referral to a mental health professional for treatment. 
Suicide is included in this definition.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064]:  
 
Impairment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_785550], tracheostomy  or the inability to

  Version  7.[ADDRESS_1080673] 2018  Page 173 of 175   
  
Hepatic Dysfunction:  
 
An increase in any two of the following hepatic laboratory v alues (total bilirubin, 
aspartate aminotransferase/ AST and alanine aminotranferease/ ALT) to a level greater 
than three times the upper limit of normal for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], beyond [ADDRESS_1080674] -implant 
(or if hepatic dysfunction is the primary cause of death).  
 
 
Hypertension:  
 
New onset blood pressure elevation greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 
mm Hg diastolic (pulsatile pump) or 110 mm Hg mean pressure (rotary pump).  
 
PediMACS : Hypertension is defined as systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure 
greater than the 95th percentile for age which requires the addition of a new IV or 
oral therapy for management. The event shall be considered resolved upon the 
discontinuation of the treatment.  
 
 
Renal Dysfunction:  
 
Two categories of renal dysfunction will be identified:  
 
 
Acute Renal Dysfunction  
Abnormal kidney function requiring dialysis (including hemofiltration) in patients who did 
not require this procedure prior to implant, or a rise in serum creatinine of greater than 3 
times baseline  or greater than 5 mg/dL (in children, creatinine greater than 3 times 
upper limit of normal for age) sustained for over 48 hours.  
 
 
Chronic Renal Dysfunction  
An increase in serum creatinine of 2 mg/dl or greater above baseline, or requirement for 
hemodial ysis sustained for at least 90 days.

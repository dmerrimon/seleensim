Jason Sluzevich, MD   CONFIDENTIAL 1 Introduction 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice standards, and applicable [LOCATION_002] 
g
overnment regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
1.1 B ackground 
 
Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_22785] (LPP) is a form of lymphocyte mediated scarring alopecia. It is a chronic 
condition that predominates in women between the ages of 45 ‐70. Patients present with discrete 
patches of hair loss with characteristic perifollicular erythema and scale [1]. Diffuse or localized 
scalp involvement may be seen. Disease progression results in irreversible hair loss and has been 
associated with significant impact on quality of life, depression, and anxiety [2]. Successful 
treatment of LPP requires clearance of the lymphocytic inflammation early in the disease course 
to prevent irreversible follicular destruction and permanent hair loss. 
 
Conventional topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (e.g. corticosteroids) and systemic immunosuppressives (e.g. 
mycophenolate mofetil) used in the treatment of LPP directly inhibit lymphocytes but generally 
cannot induce clinical remission [3]. Therefore, there remains a critical unmet therapeutic need 
for an alternative topi[INVESTIGATOR_484364]. 
1.2 In vestigational Agent 
 
Valchlor, a gel formulation of mechlorethamine, is an alkylating agent with anti-neoplastic and 
anti-inflammatory properties.  Each tube of Valchlor contains 0.016% of mechlorethamine which 
is equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCL.   It is designed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_484365]-
mucosal skin surfaces. With topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086], there is no systemic absorption. Valchlor is 
FDA approved for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_484366] (MF) type 
cutaneous T cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior skin ‐directed therapy.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_622547] alterations of the surrounding cytokine milieu. This has been demonstrated for 
neoplastic conditions such as mycosis fungoides as well as for other inflammatory skin disorders 
such as psoriasis [4,5]. Histologically, the lymphocytic inflammation in LPP is confined to the 
upper portion of the hair follicle known as the infundibulum. The superficial nature of this 
lymphocytic inflammation is ideally suited to targeted topi[INVESTIGATOR_484367]. The gel vehicle of Valchlor is also 
especially ideal for hair bearing scalp application. The distribution of Langerhans cells in the hair 
follicle is greatest in the infundibulum which also corresponds to where the lymphocytic 
inflammation in LPP is the greatest [6]. Valchlor has been shown to deplete resident Langerhans 
cells in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_484368] [7]. The failure of other systemic immunosuppressives in treating LPP may 
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622548] of epi[INVESTIGATOR_484369]. 
  
The
 possible risks associated with Valchlor include: 
1. 
Flammable Gel.  The gel formulation is an alcohol-based product and is flammable when 
exposed to fire or other flame before completely drying. This risk will be minimized through 
application instruction procedures provided to study participants and the exclusion of smokers in 
the study. 
 
2. Embryo-fetal Toxicity. Toxicity has been demonstrated with systemic administration of 
mec
hlorethamine, the active ingredient of Valchlor gel. This risk is minimized in that topi[INVESTIGATOR_484370]. 
Additionally, pregnant, nursing females, or females planning or actively trying to become 
pr
egnant will be excluded from the study. All female study participants of child bearing potential 
prior will be screen ed for pregnancy with urine B-HCG testing at all study visits and will be 
required to use one form of contraception during the study period. 
 
3. 
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer.  Retrospective analysis has shown that 2% (3/128) of patients 
receiving Valchlor for the treatment of early stage MF developed non-melanoma skin cancer 
after one year of use. Many of these patients had previously received other treatments known to 
increase skin cancer risk, and thus the absolute risk directly attributable to Valchlor has not been 
established. This risk will be minimized in this study in that patients will have surveillance skin

Jason Sluzevich, MD   CONFIDENTIAL screening at each follow-up visits, a shorter 6 month treatment interval, and  once daily 
a
pplication versus the BID to TID application utilized in patients with MF. 
 
4. 
 Mucosal or Eye Injury .  Mechlorethamine, the active ingredient in Valchlor, can cause pain, 
burns, inflammation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Blindness and severe irreversible anterior 
eye injury may also occur.  These risks are highly dependent on both the mechlorethamine 
concentration and delivery vehicle. For this study, the Valchlor formulation of mechlorethamine 
at 0.016% in a gel vehicle would be expected to be result in mild irritant reactions characterized 
by [CONTACT_484391]/or mucosal exposure. The concentrations 
pr
oducing scarring conjunctivitis or skin vesiculation have been reported to be 1% or higher and 
are far outside the range of concentrations used for medical purposes [8 , 9]. Additionally, there 
are no reports in the indexed PubMed literature of mucosal blistering, cutaneous 
blistering/scarring, or permanent ocular injury including blindness with medical range 
concentrations of Mechlorethamine. Mechlorethamine is used in clinical practice in the United 
States for face and scalp site application. In mycosis fungoides, especially the folliculotropic 
variant, multiple case reports have described the use of mechlorethamine application to the face 
and scalp either as a single agent or in combination with high potency corticosteroids with 
excellent tolerability and no adverse mucosal or ocular events [10]. Mechlorethamine application 
to 
the scalp for Langerhans histiocytosis has also been reported as safe and effective in both the 
pediatric and adult literature [11].   The risk of the mucosal/eye injury is minimized in this study 
given the low concentration of Mechlorethamine utilized; additionally, study participants must 
demonstrate understanding and have the functional capacity to apply the topi[INVESTIGATOR_484371]. 
 
5. Dermatitis. Mechlorethamine in liquid, ointment, cream, and gel formation can induce an 
idiosyncratic contact [CONTACT_484392], pruritus, and scaling to areas of application . 
This is highly treatment responsive to topi[INVESTIGATOR_484372]. This risk is minimized in that Valchlor with a gel vehicle has the lowest 
incidence of contact [CONTACT_484393].  
 
2 Study Obj
ectives 
 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential effectiveness of once daily 
application of Valchlor in decreasing disease activity in patients with Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_22785]. The 
primary measurement of efficacy will be with the Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_178370] (LPPAI) 
before and after 6 months of treatment. Secondary measures of efficacy will be the mean 
follicular density, Physician Global assessment (PGA) score, and the Dermatology Quality of 
Life Index (DQLI) score before and after six months of therapy. 
 
 
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622549] failed one prior topi[INVESTIGATOR_484373]. The presence of active disease will be 
based on a baseline clinical exam showing perifollicular erythema with scaling. Patients with 
predominance of end stage scarring hair loss but without significant active erythema will be 
excluded. Involvement restricted to the frontal scalp is a recognized clinical variant of LPP and is 
known as frontal fibrosing alopecia (FAA). As the histological features of LPP and FAA are 
identical, patients with FAA subtype of LPP would also be eligible to participate in the study. 
 
Eligible participants using high ‐potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], intralesional corticosteroids, or 
oral hydroxychloroquine may enroll but will be required to discontinue use during the study 
period. 
 
All study participants will apply Valchlor 0.016% gel to involved areas at night, beginning with 
three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) and increasing to daily application after 
one month, if well tolerated. Patients will be instructed to first part the hair away from involved 
area as needed, limit application to areas with alopecia and erythema, apply [ADDRESS_622550] from foods at 36°F - 46°F and apply 
within 30 minutes after removing from refrigeration.

Jason Sluzevich, MD   CONFIDENTIAL 3.4 P rimary Study Endpoints 
 
The primary outcome measure of efficacy will be the percent reduction of baseline Lichen 
Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_178370] (LLPAI) score after 6 months of treatment defined as follows. 
 C omplete response: LLPAI reduction greater than 85% from baseline score. 
 P art ial response: LLPAI reduction of between 25 ‐85% from baseline score. 
 Non‐re sponse: LLPAI reduction of less than 25% from baseline score. 
 
The Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_178370] (LPPAI) is a standardized validated quantitative measure 
of disease activity [12].  LPPAI score (0 ‐10) is calculated as follows: (pruritus + pain + 
burning)/3 + (scalp erythema + perifollicular erythema + perifollicular scale)/3 + 2.5 (pull test) + 
1.5 (spreading/2). Symptoms and signs are graded on a 4 ‐point scale with 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 
= moderate, and 3 =severe. Clinical progression and a positive hair pull test are graded 1=yes; 
0=no. 
3.5 S econdary Study Endpoints 
 
The secondary outcome measures of efficacy at baseline and after 6 months of treatment will 
include: 
 Mea n follicular density as assess ed using Canfield scalp photography  
 De rmatology Quality of Life Index (DQLI)  score : [ADDRESS_622551] of skin disease rated as 0=not at all/not relevant; 1=a little; 2=a lot; 3=very much  
 Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score : using standardized photography compared to 
the presenting baseline and scored as -1 = worse (no change to erythema with new areas 
of
 alopecia);  0 = no change; 1 = mild improvement (slight reduction in erythema, 
alopecia not progressive); 2= moderate (moderate reduction in erythema, alopecia not 
progressive); 3  = significant improvement (very mild erythema, alopecia not 
progressive); 4 = clear (no erythema, alopecia not progressive) 
 
3.6 P rimary Safety Endpoints 
 
The primary safety endpoint of this study will be the number of days between unintentional 
mucosa

Blood samples were analyzed from 16 and 15 patients following treatment with VALCHLOR 
(mechlorethamine gel 0.016%) and an identical formulation consisting of mechlorethamine 
0.032% w/w, respectively. For patients who received mechlorethamine 0.016%, samples were 
collected to measure mechlorethamine concentrations prior to dosing, on day 1, and at the first 
month visit. Following the topi[INVESTIGATOR_484376] 0.016%, there were no 
detectable plasma mechlorethamine concentrations observed in any of the patients. Patients who 
received mechlorethamine 0.032% had no measurable concentrations of mechlorethamine or 
half-mustard after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment.

Handling of Missing Data 
 
This is a prospective study and therefore we do not anticipate any missing data.  In the event of 
any unexpected missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made; missing data 
will simply be treated as missing in the statistical analysis. 
 
Multiplicity 
 
Since this is an exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no adjustment for multiple testing is needed.   
 
Primary Hypothesis: 
 
The primary endpoint for this study is the LPPAI score. While a minimal clinically significant 
difference for this outcome measure has not been established, clinically meaningful treatment 
responses will generate large changes in the LPPAI score given the weightings used in the 
underlying formula. Therefore, the proposed minimal accrual target of twenty patients will be 
adequate for the preliminary data generating purposes of an exploratory study. A larger sample 
size to detect smaller changes in the LPPAI score is not needed as small differences in the 
LPPAI score are not clinically meaningful. The minimal accrual target of 10 is achievable given 
an estimated incidence of LPP/FAA of 1 ‐3% in tertiary hair loss centers. The definitions of 
complete response, partial response, and non ‐response will be defined using standardized LLPAI 
scoring which will permit a relative comparison of treatment efficacy to previously published 
systemic treatments using hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil.  
 
In
terim Analysis 
 
There will not be any interim analysis given the low risk profile of the study formulation. 
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622559] Population(s) for Analysis 
 
Each participant who received the study drug will be included in the primary analysis regardless 
of study withdrawal for any reason. In the event of any study withdrawals, in secondary analysis 
we will examine the sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of patients who withdrew.

8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 De finitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) 
An
y unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
 Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
br
each of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
 Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND 
 Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures. 
 
 
Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal lab finding), symptom 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to 
the medicinal product.  
 
Each AE must be assessed by [CONTACT_180510] a reasonable 
possibility of causal relationship to Valchlor, and documented as either related or unrelated. The 
determination of the likelihood that Valchlor caused the AE must be provided by [CONTACT_78031] a qualified physician. .  
 
I
nitial screening for AE will include non-directed questioning of the patient at each follow-up 
visit during the study period along with the directed questioning and examination regarding:  
 
 Signs and symptoms of idiosyncratic allergic contact [CONTACT_484396].  
The primary investigator will then evaluate the patient and if the signs and symptoms are 
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622560] dermatitis reactions 
unable to be managed as outlined above will exit the study. 
 
 Unintentional  mucosa l and/ocular exposure 
 
Patients will be warned not to apply Valchlor near eyes, mouth, or nose as it can cause pain, 
redness, swelling, burning, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and blindness or permanent eye 
injury. If accidental Valchlor exposure to nose, mouth or eyes occurs, patients will be 
instructed to rinse affected areas with large amounts of water for [ADDRESS_622561] the patient to review 
application site instructions and schedule a follow-up evaluation if the patient reports 
persistent symptoms or erythema.   
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events defined as serious will the following:  
 de ath 
 li fe threatening adverse experience 
 hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
 pe rsistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 birth de fect/anomaly 
 medic ally significant 
 
Medically Significant: refers to important medical events that may not immediately result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_484378],  
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions above. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, will be regarded as n on-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adver
se Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow-up period is defined as the last scheduled visit. 
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.   
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622562] to report, to the sponsor-
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
 
Abn
ormal Laboratory Values 
Any clinical laboratory abnormality that can reasonably be related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_484379]. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_484380], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or surgery is to be reported as an adverse event if it 
can reasonably be related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_484381]. 
8.[ADDRESS_622563], the study team will seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event section of the case report form (CRF). All clearly clinically related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results will be recorded in the source document. 
 
All 
adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up , to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting 
Period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported to Actelion immediately (see 8.3 below). 
8.[ADDRESS_622564] be reported immediately to Actelion Global Drug Safety ( GDS ) as set forth in 
the IIS agreement (on Actelion SAE template FRM-001093). Actelion reserves the right to 
request additional information and clarifications on cases forwarded by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator.

[ADDRESS_622567] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 W
hat protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_484384], by [CONTACT_5151], retain the ability to use all information collected prior to the 
revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or 
use PHI, attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (long term 
survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
9.2 S ource Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial. 
9.3 Case Report Forms 
All data requested on the Case Report Form (CRF) will be recorded for each participant.  A 
standardized CRF will be generated by [CONTACT_61604].  All missing data will be explained.  If a space 
on the CRF is left blank because the question was not asked, “N/D” will be recorded.  If the item 
is not applicable to the individual case, “N/A” will be recorded.  All entries will be printed 
Valchlor in the treatment of Lichen Planopi[INVESTIGATOR_484359] [ADDRESS_622568] data will be written above it.  All such changes will be 
initialed and dated.  Errors will not be erased or whited-out.  For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, a clarification will be printed above the item, then initialed and dated.  If the 
reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, details to justify the 
correction will be neatly included.

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual loss and new -onset blindness in the [ADDRESS_472384].2  Proliferaitve diab etic retinopathy 129 
(PDR)  can lead to vitreous hemorrhage (VH) which may affect vision and is a lead ing indication 130 
for vitrectomy. V itreous hemorrhage  also can preclude performing panretinal photocoagulation 131 
(PRP), as well as the evaluation and treatment of o ther diabetic and non -diabetic retinal 132 
pathology such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and age -related macular degeneration.  Even 133 
in the modern era of using either PRP or anti -vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF ) [ADDRESS_472385], a Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) clinical 135 
trial showed that 27% to 34% of eyes developed VH over [ADDRESS_472386]  141 
Although VH by [CONTACT_377429], rapid clearance of the hemorrhage is 142 
desirable for both functional and anatomic reasons and also allows evaluation and treatment of 143 
the eye for other pathology such as DME.  Functional central and periph eral visual acuity (VA) [ADDRESS_472387] stabilization of the neovascularization in order to decrease the 151 
probability of new or worsening VH or traction or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment while 152 
further  clearing of the hemorrhage occu rred.  PRP generally leads to regression or quiescence of 153 
retinal neovascularization after a limited number of treatments and result s in a reduction of 154 
severe vision loss over 5 years to rates as low as 4% . [ADDRESS_472388] for several decades, results from the 157 
DRCR.net Protocol S (Prompt  Panretinal Photocoagulation versus Intravitreal Ranibizumab with 158 
Deferred Panretinal Photocoagulation for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy) published in [ADDRESS_472389] (difference +2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.5 to  164 
+5.0, non -inferiority P<0.001).  Although visual change at 2 years was not superior in the anti - 165 
VEGF group, the average visual acuity over 2 years (area under the curve) was significantly 166 
better in eyes that received anti -VEGF with a mean treatment group difference of +4.2 (95% CI: 167 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-2  +3.0 to +5.4, P<0.001).  In addition, eyes that underwent prompt PRP had greater visual field 168 
sensitivity loss (mean dB difference 372; 95% CI: 213 to 531, P<0.001), more frequent 169 
vitrectomy (15% versus 4%, difference 9%, 95% CI : 4% to 15%, P<0.001), and, among those 170 
without DME causing VA loss at baseline, were more likely to develop DME causing VA loss 171 
(28% versus 9%, difference 19%, 95% CI: 10% to 28%, P<0.001) over the course of [ADDRESS_472390] in the DRCR.net Protocol N 222 
(An E valuation of Intravitreous Ranibizumab for Vitreous Hemorrhage Due to Proliferative 223 
Diabetic Retinopathy), although the endpoint of this study was short -term avoidance of 224 
vitrectomy (16 weeks after randomization) rather than VA recovery.[ADDRESS_472391].  Although Protocol N did not show a difference in  vitrectomy rates at 227 
16 weeks comparing ranibizumab with saline injections, both treatment groups had lower than 228 
expected vitrectomy rates (12% vs. 17% respectively), and the ranibizumab group had greater 229 
visual acuity improvements (22±23 vs. 16±31, P  = 0.04), increased PRP completion rates (44% 230 
vs. 31%, P = 0.05), and a reduced rate of recurrent VH (6% vs. 17%, P = 0.01) compared with [ADDRESS_472392] with anti -VEGF therapy might avoid further surgical intervention in 235 
many eyes.  Indeed, by 52 weeks (with 12 weeks through 52 weeks of treatment at investigator 236 
discretion), only 40% of eyes in both groups received vitrectomy; thus, by 1 year approximately 237 
60% of eyes did not need vitrectomy. The efficacy of anti -VEGF treatment in allowing clearance [ADDRESS_472393] already received PRP is supported by 239 
another recent case series, which reported treatment with bevacizumab in 18 eyes of 18 patients 240 
with new onset VH after previous full PRP.27  By 12 months, 72.2% of eyes had complete 241 
clearing of VH.  However, although 9 (50%) of the eyes gained vision, overall there was no 242 
statistically significant visual gain over 12 months (mean best correct ed VA improved from 243 
1.32±1.03 to 1.09±1.10 logMAR, p = 0.433), and 2 eyes (11%) had severe vision loss of 3 or 244 
more lines of vision due to traction retinal detachment.   245 
 246 
1.1.3 Aflibercept  247 
The anti -VEGF agent to be used in this trial is intravitreous aflibercept injection, also known as 248 
VEGF  Trap -Eye or Aflibercept (Eylea®), which is a soluble decoy receptor fusion protein that 249 
has a high binding affinity to all isoforms of VEGF as well as to placental growth factor.  250 
Aflibercept received  approval by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) for the [ADDRESS_472394], a compara tive effectiveness trial in DME reported that aflibercept was more 264 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-4  effective than ranibizumab and bevacizumab in improving vision in eyes starting with CI -DME 265 
and worse levels of visual acuity (approximately 20/50 or worse).[ADDRESS_472395]:  prompt vitrectomy + PRP and intravitreous aflibercept 285 
injections . 286 
1.2 Study Objectives  287 
The objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate and compare visual acuity outcomes over the 288 
course of the study of a prompt vitrectomy + PRP regimen and an intravitreous aflibercept  [ADDRESS_472396] for which intervention is deemed necessa ry, and 2) [ADDRESS_472397]-operative complications for the vitrectomy group, and number of injections needed and 292 
percent requiring vitrectomy in the intravitreous afliberce pt group .   293 
1.3 Study Design and Synopsis of Protocol  294 
 295 
A. Study Design  296 
• Multi-center randomized clinical trial  297 
 298 
B. Major Eligibility Criteria  299 
• Age >=18 years  300 
• Type 1 or type 2 diabetes  301 
• Study eye with :  302 
o Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from 303 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary  304 
• Note: Prior PRP is neither  a requirement nor an  exclusion  [ADDRESS_472398] corrected visual acuity letter score 78 or worse (approximate Snellen 306 
equivalent 20/32 or worse)  with at least light perception  307 
• Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment 308 
of an eye with visual acuity letter score 78 to 69 (approximate Snellen 309 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-5  equivalent 20/32 to 20/40) to ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its 310 
potential  benefits outweigh the potential risks.   311 
o No evidence of  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or evidence of traction retinal 312 
detachment involving or thre atening the macula  313 
• If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual  assessment on clinical [ADDRESS_472399] care . 316 
o No history of vitrectomy  317 
 318 
C. Treatment Groups  319 
Eligible eyes , one per participant,  will be assigned randomly (1:1) to one of the  following 320 
groups:  321 
 322 
A. Intravitreous  2 mg aflibercept injections  323 
B. Prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  [ADDRESS_472400] be given on the day of 326 
randomization.  Follow -up injections will be performed as often as every 4 weeks unless criteria 327 
for deferral are met (see section 4.3.1).  Vitrectomy and PRP can only be performed if protocol 328 
criteria are met (see sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3). 329 
 330 
For the prompt vitrectomy + PRP  group, the vitrectomy must be scheduled to be  performed  331 
within 2 weeks of randomization.  Vitrectomy will be performed  according to the investigator’s [ADDRESS_472401]-operatively unless there is recurrent hemorrhage (see section 334 
4.5.2). 335 
 336 
D. Sample Size  337 
A minimum of  200 study eyes , one per participant,  will be randomized.   338 
 339 
E. Duration of Follow -Up 340 
Primary outcome : 24 weeks  341 
Total duration : 104 weeks   342 
 343 
F. Follow -up Schedule  344 
➢ Outcome Visits:  [ADDRESS_472402]-randomization : 346 
• Year 1: 4, 12, 24, 36, 52 wee ks 347 
• Year 2: 68 weeks, 84 weeks, 104 weeks  348 
 349 
It is recognized that the time between initial treatment and outcome visits will differ 350 
between the two groups due to the timing of the initial treatment; however, the 351 
differential timing of treatments is representative of clinical care in which anti -VEGF can 352 
be given immediately  and vitrectomy would need to be scheduled in advance.  Therefore, 353 
the area under the curve analysis will be representative of clinical care based on the time 354 
point that the decision is made to intervene.   355 
 356 
➢ Treatment Visits:  357 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-6  • Participants  receiving intravit reous aflibercept  also will have  treatment 358 
assessment visits  as often as every 4 weeks , depending on  recent  treatment 359 
administered.  360 
 361 
➢ Additional Visits:  362 
• Participants  undergoing vitrectomy will have a study visit [ADDRESS_472403] -vitrectomy 363 
for safety evaluation .  Investigators may schedule an initial  (e.g. 1 day) post- [ADDRESS_472404] care  at their discretion . 365 
 366 
G. Main Efficacy Outcome s 367 
 368 
Treatment Group Comparisons  369 
 370 
Primary Outcome:   Visual acuity area under the curve between randomization and 24 weeks   371 
 372 
Additional Key Outcomes (at 24, 52, and 104 weeks  unless otherwise indicated):  373 
• Visual acuity area under the curve between randomization and 52 and 104 weeks  374 
• Mean visual acuity at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits  375 
• Percent 20/20 or better, 20/32 or better, 20/40 or better, 20/200 or worse, and 20/800 376 
or worse  at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits   377 
• Proportion of eyes with at least [ADDRESS_472405] 30 letter gains or losses from baseline  378 
• Rates of recurrent VH on clinical exam  379 
• Percentage of eyes with retinal neovascularization  380 
• Mean OCT central subfield thickness  381 
• Treatment and follow -up costs  382 
• Mean chan ge in four Workplace Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire 383 
(WPAI Q) scales and area under the curve analyses  of the Work Productivity Loss and  384 
Activity Impairment scales at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits   385 
 386 
Key Outcomes within Treatment Groups  387 
• Percent undergoing  vitrectomy (initial vitrectomy in aflibercept  group or repeat 388 
vitrectomy in vitrectomy group)  389 
• Number of aflibercept  injections performed  390 
• Percent receiving PRP ( aflibercept  group only)  391 
 392 
The primary outcome of visual acuit y area under the curve at 24 weeks was primarily selected 393 
for sample size considerations.   The long -term additional key outcomes and within -group 394 
outcomes will be equally important as the area under the curve outcome for evaluating the 395 
overall follow -up co urse for these two treatment approaches.   Therefore, publication is not 396 
planned until the full 104 week follow -up has closed.   397

CHAPTER 2.  STUDY PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT  447 
2.1 Identifying Eligible Participant s and Obtaining Informed Consent  448 
A minimum o f 200 eyes (1 per participant) are expected to be enrolled into the randomized trial.  [ADDRESS_472409] signed an informed consent form can be randomized  up until the end date, 451 
which means the recruitment goal might be exceeded.   452 
 453 
Potential eligibility will be assessed as part of a routine -care examination.  Prior to completing 454 
any procedures or collecting any data that are not part of usual care, written  informed consent 455 
will be obtained.  For patients who are considered potentially eligible for the study based on a 456 
routine -care exam, the study protocol will be discussed with the potential study participant by a 457 
study investigator and clinic coordinator.  The potential study participant will be given the 458 
Informed Consent Form to read.  Potential study participants will be encouraged to discuss the 459 
study with family members and their personal physician(s) before deciding whether to participate 460 
in the study.    461 
 462 
Consent may be given in two stages (if approved by [CONTACT_1201]).  The initial stage will provide [ADDRESS_472410] two 466 
signature/date lines for the study participant:  one for a study participant to give consent for the [ADDRESS_472411] not proceed to randomize an 473 
individual until he/she is convinced that the individual is eligible and will accept assignment to [ADDRESS_472412] be met:  481 
1. Age >= 18 years  482 
• Participant s <18 years old are not being included because proliferative diabetic 483 
retinopathy  is so rare in this age group that the diagnosis may be questionable.   484 
2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)  485 
• Any one of the following will be considered to be suf ficient evidence that diabetes is 486 
present:  487 
➢ Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes  488 
➢ Current regular use of oral anti -hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes  489 
➢ Documented diabetes by [CONTACT_103204]/or WHO criteria (see Procedures Manu al for 490 
definitions)  [ADDRESS_472413] one eye meets the study eye criteria listed in section 2.2.2.  492 
4. Able and willing to provide informed consent.  493 
5. Patient is willing and able to undergo vitrectomy  within next 2 weeks  and the vitrectomy can 494 
be scheduled within that t ime frame . 495 
Exclusion  496 
A potential participant  is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria  are present:  497 
6. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis  (including placement of fistula  if performed 498 
in preparation for dialysis ) or kidney transplant . 499 
7. A condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would preclude participation in the study 500 
(e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and glycemic 501 
control).  502 
8. Initiation of  intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) within 4 months 503 
prior to randomization or plan s to do so in the next 4 months.  504 
9. A condition that, in t he opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would preclude participant  underg oing 505 
elective vitrectomy surgery if indicated during the study.  506 
10. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that involved 507 
treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the indication being 508 
studied.  509 
• Note : participant s cannot receive another investigational drug while participating in the 510 
study.  511 
11. Known allergy to any component of the study drug  or any drug used in the injection prep  512 
(including povidone iodine).   513 
12. Blood pressure > 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110).  514 
• If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by [CONTACT_14181] -hypertensive treatment, potential 515 
participant  can   become eligible.  516 
13. Systemic anti -VEGF or pro -VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.  517 
• These drugs cannot be used during the study.  518 
14. For women of child -bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant 519 
within the next two years . 520 
• Women who are potential participant s should be questioned about the potential for [ADDRESS_472414] only one study eye.  If both eyes are eligible at the time of randomizatio n, 530 
the study eye will be selected by [CONTACT_377430].  531 
 532 
The eligibility criteria for a study eye  are as follows:  533 
 534 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-3  Inclusion  535 
a. Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from proliferative diabetic 536 
retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary.   537 
• Note: Prior PRP is n either  a requirement nor an exclusion . 538 
• Subhyaloid hemorrhage alone does not make an eye eligible; however, presence of 539 
subhyaloid hemorrhage in addition to the criteria above will not preclude participation 540 
provided the investigator is comfortable with either treatment regimen.  541 
b. Immediate vitrectomy not required (investigator and participant  are willing to wait at least  4 542 
months  to see if hemorrhage clears sufficiently with anti -VEGF without having to proceed to 543 
vitrectomy ). 544 
c. Visual acuity  letter score ≤78 (approximate Snellen equi valent 20/32) and at least light 545 
perception .  546 
• Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment of an eye with 547 
visual acuity letter score 69 to 78 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 to 20/40) to 548 
ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its potential  benefits outweigh the potential risks.   549 
 550 
Exclusion  551 
d. Evidence of traction detachment involving  or threatening  the macula .  552 
• If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam to [ADDRESS_472415] care.  555

hemorrhage onset  or after onset .   570 
j. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular 571 
surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery other than vitrectomy anticipated 572 
within the next 6 months following randomization.  573 
k. History of vit rectomy . 574

4.1 Introduction  710 
All study eyes will be randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment groups:    711 
• Intravitreous  2 mg aflibercept injections   712 
• Prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  [ADDRESS_472438] be given on the day of 715 
randomization.  Follow -up injections will be performed as often as every 4 weeks according to 716 
the retreatment criteria below.  Vitrectomy and PRP can only be performed if protocol criteria 717 
are met.  718 
 719 
For the prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  group, the vitrectomy must be scheduled within 2 weeks of 720 
randomization.  The vitrectomy procedure and follow -up treatment are described below.  721 
 722 
4.2 Intravitreous Injections  723 
4.2.1 Inravitreous Aflibercept Injection (Eylea®)  724 
Eylea® (intravitreal aflibercept injection) is made by [CONTACT_7361], Inc. and is [ADDRESS_472439], followed by [CONTACT_11339] -study eye (see Procedures Manual for additional details).  If a [ADDRESS_472440]  766 
All eyes will receive a n injection of aflibercept at the 4 -week , 8-week  and 12-week visits, unless 767 
an adverse event precludes treatment.  768 
  769 
Starting at the 16-week visit, eyes with no c ontraindication to additional aflibercept  injections 770 
will be evaluated for retreatment based on the status of the hemorrhage and neovascularization.  771 
In general, the eye will receive an injection at each treatment assessment visit unless one of the 772 
below criteria is met :  773 
1. Success: t he vitreous hemorrhage has suff iciently cleared such that there is an 774 
adequate view of the entire fundus and neovascularization  is absent  775 
➢ Injection is deferred.  776 
2. Stability: it has been at least [ADDRESS_472441] visit.   779 
➢ Injection is deferred.  780 
3. A vitrectomy has already been performed  781 
➢ Eyes in the aflibercept  group that receive vitrectomy will follow the intra - and [ADDRESS_472442] not be given unless failure criteria are met  (see below for cases that first require 787 
discussion with the Protocol Chair or Coordinating Center designee ).  In addition, if any future [ADDRESS_472443] is at investi gator discretion after discussion with and approval from the Protocol 790 
Chair or Coordinating Center designee.   791 
 792 
• Failure criteria are defined as  [ADDRESS_472444] been given over the previous 4 months.  The 796 
investigator may perform PRP.   797 
 798 
OR 799 
 800 
2. New or worsened NV of the angle* has developed since the last visit. The [ADDRESS_472445] also receive intraoperative PRP  until “complete” .   815 
 816 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to 16 Weeks  817 
Vitrectomy prior to 16 we eks should not be performed unless one of the following is present:  818 
➢ Traction retinal detachment involving (within 1 disc diameter) or actively  threatening the 819 
macula  820 
➢ Rhegmatogenous  retinal detachment  821 
➢ Neovascular glaucoma resulting in increased intraocula r pressure that cannot be 822 
controlled medically,  angle neovascularization, or progressive neovascularization of the 823 
iris (at least 2 clock hours)  824 
➢ Ghost cell glaucoma resulting in increased intraocular pressure that cannot be controlled 825 
medically  826 
 827 
If other circumstances develop for which vitrectomy is being considered prior to 16 weeks , the 828 
Protocol Chair will be contact[CONTACT_291444].  829 
 830 
[IP_ADDRESS] At and After 16 weeks  831 
After the 16 week visit, vitrectomy may be performed (but is not required) if there is 1) persistent 832 
vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment and 2) the eye has received at least [ADDRESS_472446] performing 2 additional injections.   836 
 837 
If the investigator believes vitrectomy is required for the safety of the participant and the study 838 
eye does not meet these criteria, protocol chair approval is requi red to proceed.   839 
 840 
4.4 Vitrectomy  841 
For study eyes receiving vitrectomy, vitrectomy will be performed  according to the 842 
investigator’s usual routine , including pre -operative care, surgical procedure, and post -operative [ADDRESS_472447] be used (20 gauge is not 844 
permitted).   845 
 846 
Optional additional procedures at the discretion of the investigator  include, but are not limited to : 847 
• Removal of the internal limiting membrane.  848 
• Use of agents to improve visual ization of membranes, (e.g. triamcinolone acetonide , 849 
indocyanine  green dye , or other staining agents).  850 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-4 • Use of corticosteroids ( intravitreous , sub -tenon’s, sub -conjunctival) at the close of the 851 
procedure.  852 
• Cataract extraction.  853 
 854 
Study i ntravitreous  aflibercept  may be given pre -operatively , but then should not be given 855 
thereafter unless there is recurrent hemorrhage (see section 4.5.2 below) . If pre -op aflibercept  is [ADDRESS_472448] the option of 863 
signing the anci llary sample collection portion of the informed consent form to indicate their 864 
willingness to provide either a vitreous sample only (at least 1 cc of undiluted vitreous collected 865 
during the vitrectomy procedure) or to provide both vitreous and an additiona l aqueous sample 866 
(requiring an additional anterior paracentesis to collect at least 0.1 cc of aqueous fluid).    867 
 868 
If consent for vitreous and/or aqueous sampling is obtained, the sample(s) will be collected and [ADDRESS_472449] -Operative Treatment  884 
4.5.1 Panretinal Photocoagulation in the Vitrectomy Group  885 
PRP should be placed to the extent that it is considered “complete”.   “Complete ” PRP is defined 886 
as 500 micron size burns on the retina placed no further than 1 to 2 burn widths apart beginning 887 
~[ADDRESS_472450] to the equator for 12 clock hours . 888 
See procedures manual for additional details, i ncluding use of automated pattern.  889 
 890 
If it is determined during surgery that the eye has already received “complete ” PRP, further PRP 891 
treatment is not required.   PRP treatment can be performed using the investigator’s standard [ADDRESS_472451] delivery.     893 
 894 
If the size or amount of neovascularization increases following completion of the initial PRP 895 
session, additional PRP should be given if possible.  Aflibercept  may be given for 896

neovascularization, two  injection s of study aflibercept will be  given, 4 (±1) weeks apart .  903 
Additional aflibercept  may be given every 4(±1) weeks thereafter, at the discretion of the 904 
investigator.   Repeat vitrectomy (or air/fluid exchange) may only be performed if the recurrent [ADDRESS_472453] Surgery  (Both Groups)  [ADDRESS_472454] surgery (or referral  for possible cataract surgery) when a lens change is thought to be 911

routine.  Limited data will be collected for the study.   915 
4.7 Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema (Both Groups)  [ADDRESS_472456]-surgical edema, steroid drops or other alternatives may be given at the discretion of the 918 
investigator.  After 6 weeks , if DME is present  (OCT CSF above gender and OCT machine - [ADDRESS_472457] -surgical macular edema or other cause)  and vision is 20/32 or worse, treatment with 921 
intravitreous aflibercept  and deferred  focal/grid laser will be given , using the DRCR.net 922

will not be replaced.  998 
5.6 Discontinuation of Study  999 
The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_19305] (with approval o f the Data and 1000  
Safety Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of follow -up for all study [ADDRESS_472468] udy participant for follow -up visits.  A participant -oriented newsletter may be sent twice a 1012  
year.  A study logo item may be sent once a year.  1013  
 1014  
Study participants will be provided with a summary of the study results in a newsletter format 1015  
after completion  of the study by [CONTACT_55473].   1016  
5.8 Study Participant Reimbursement  1017  
The study will be providing  the study participant  with a  $[ADDRESS_472469] been caused 1041  
by [CONTACT_8235] (including treatment of the non -study eye with study treatment).  1042  
 1043  
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators  should apply the 1044  
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  1045  
 1046  
Yes 1047  
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 1048  
administration of the study treatment, and the adverse event cann ot be readily explained by [CONTACT_941] 1049  
participant ’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event 1050  
follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment; and/or the adverse event abates or 1051  
resolves upon discontinuati on of the study treatment or dose reduction and, if applicable, 1052  
reappears upon re -challenge.  1053  
 1054  
No 1055  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment (e.g., 1056  
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent il lness, or concomitant 1057  
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment 1058  
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_472470] dose of study drug).    1059  
 1060  
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a thre e-point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 1061  
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse 1062  
event is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but 1063  
may not be cl inically serious.  1064  
 1065  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  1066  
 1067  
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the DRCR .net website data entry form.   1068  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-2  1069  
Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the [ADDRESS_472471] occurrence that:  1075  
• Results in death.  1076  
• Is life -threatening; (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 1077  
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious advers e event).  1078  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  1079  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability [ADDRESS_472472] normal life functions (sight threatening).  1081  
• Is a congeni tal anomaly or birth defect.  1082  
• Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., 1083  
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 1084  
the outcomes listed above).  1085

A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will approve the protocol, template informed [ADDRESS_472474] common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in  patients receiving aflibercept  were [ADDRESS_472475]  occurred in <0.1% of 1115  
intravitreal injections with aflibercept  including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.  1116  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-3  1117  
 1118  
Safety data specific to the diabetes p opulation  were published from phase III studies VISTA and 1119  
VIVID, which included 872 eyes  with DME  with central involvement that received either 1120  
intravitreal aﬂibercept every 4 weeks , intravitreal aflibercept every 8 weeks after 5 initial 1121  
monthly doses , or macular laser photocoagulation.   Overall, the incidences of ocular and non - 1122  
ocular adverse events were similar across treatment groups at 52 weeks.32  The incidence of 1123  
APTC -defined thromboembolic events was similar across treatment groups.  There were no 1124  
reported cases of endophthalmitis, and intraocular inflammation occurred in less than 1% of [ADDRESS_472476] (2.4% and 1.0% in the aflibercept groups compared 1127  
with 0.3% in the laser group).33   The incidence of APTC ATEs in VISTA  and VIVID  1128  
during the  100 weeks study duration was 6.4% (37out of 578) in the combined EYLEA groups 1129  
compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group.33 1130  
 1131  
There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.   1132  
 1133  
6.5.2 Potential Adverse Effects of Intravitreous  Injection  1134  
Rarely, the drugs used to anesthetize the eye before the injections (proparacaine, tetracaine, or 1135  
xylocaine) can cause an allergic reaction, seizures, and an irregular heartbeat less than 1% of 1136  
the time.   1137  
 1138  
Sub-conjunctival hemorrhage or floaters will commonly occur as a re sult of the intravitreous  1139  
injection.  Mild discomfort, ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation, discharge or itching lasting 1140  
for up to a few days is also likely (more than 10% of the time).  1141  
 1142  
Immediately following the injection, there may be elevation of in traocular pressure. It usually 1143

paracentesis to lower the pressure.  The likelihood of permanent loss of vision from elevated 1145  
intraocular pressure is less than 1%.  1146  
 1147  
As a result of the injection, endophthalmitis (infection in the eye) could develop.  If this occurs, it is 1148  
treated by [CONTACT_377434], but there is a risk of permanent loss of vision including 1149  
blindness. The risk of endophthalmitis i s less than 1%.  1150  
 1151  
As a result of the injection, a retinal detachment could occur.  If this occurs, surgery may be 1152  
needed to repair the retina.  The surgery is usually successful at reattaching the retina.  1153  
However, a retinal detachment can produce permanent  loss of vision and even blindness.  The 1154  
risk of retinal detachment is less than 1%.  1155  
 1156  
The injection could cause a vitreous hemorrhage.  Usually the blood will resolve 1157  
spontaneously, but if not, surgery may be needed to remove the blood.  Although the surge ry 1158  
usually successfully removes the blood, there is a small risk of permanent loss of vision and 1159  
even blindness.  The risk of having a vitreous hemorrhage due to the injection is less than 1%.  1160

[IP_ADDRESS] Anesthesia  1162  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-4 Anesthesia may be  general endotracheal or local retrobulbar/peribulbar, usually with systemic 1163  
sedation.  Risks of systemic sedation and general anesthesia include cardiac arrhythmia and 1164  
death.  The risks of retrobulbar/peribulbar anesthesia include:  retrobulbar hemorrhage ; 1165  
perforation of the eye by [CONTACT_98847]; damage to the optic nerve; double vision lasting up to 24 1166  
hours or more; droopi[INVESTIGATOR_377425] 24 hours or more; difficulty speaking or 1167  
breathing; lightheadedness/syncope/vasovagal response; allergy t o any components of the 1168  
injection; life threatening response due to the spread of anesthesia to the brain stem, resulting in [ADDRESS_472477].   1171  
 1172  
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgic al Procedure  1173  
Risks of the vitrectomy procedure include a retinal tear (5%) and retinal detachment (1%).  1174  
Uncommon risks include infection (1/5,000) and serious hemorrhage (1/5,000).  Very rare risks [ADDRESS_472478], visual loss due to macular t oxicity of light or dye (if used) or [ADDRESS_472479] 1181  
with transient swelling of the posterior tiss ues. 1182  
 1183  
In some cases retrobulbar  or peribulbar  injection may be used to anesthetize the eye and to 1184  
reduce eye movements.  Complications of retrobulbar  and peribulbar  injections are rare.  They 1185  
include, but are not limited to, the following: retrobulbar hemorrhage (bleeding behind the 1186  
eyeball); perforation of the eye by [CONTACT_98847]; damage to the optic nerve; diplopia lasting up to 1187  
24 hours or more; ptosis lasting up to  24 hours or more; difficulty speaking or breathing; 1188  
lightheadedness/syncope/vasovagal response; allergy to any components of the injection; life 1189  
threatening response due to the spread of anesthesia to the brain stem, resulting in seizures, 1190  
drowsiness, con fusion, loss of ability to talk, convulsions, stoppage of breathing, or stoppage of 1191  
heartbeat. All of these complications are rare.  1192  
 1193

STATISTICAL METHODS  1204  
The approach to sample size and statistical analys is is summarized below.  1205  
7.1 Sample Size  1206  
The sample size has been chosen for the primary study objective, which is to compare visual 1207  
acuity outcomes  over time of prompt vitrectomy  + PRP regimen versus intravitreous aflibercept  [ADDRESS_472481] for which intervention is deemed 1209  
necessary . The primary outcome is visual acuity area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to 24 1210  
week s. The resulting analysis is a treatment group comparison of mean AUC adjusting f or 1211  
baseline visual acuity and baseline lens status.  1212  
7.1.1 Sample Size Assumptions  1213  
Aflibercept  Group :  To provide estimates for the aflibercept  arm, data from the DRCR.net 1214  
Protocol N trial ( An Evaluation of Intravitreal Ranibizumab for Vitreous Hemorrhage D ue to 1215  
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ) were reviewed for eyes with baseline visual acuity 20/32 or 1216  
worse. Eyes in Protocol N had structured treatment through 16 weeks and visits at 4, 8, and 12 1217  
weeks. Treatment was at investigator discretion between 16 and 52 weeks, at which time visual 1218  
acuity was measured. Based on visual acuity data (Table 1), the standard deviation of the AUC at 1219  
12 weeks was 19.2 (95% CI 17.1, 22.0) and the correlation with baseline visual acuity was -0.39 1220  
(95% CI -0.53, -0.23). Assum ing a true standard deviation of 19.2, this adjustment yields an [ADDRESS_472482] deviation of 17.7 (95% CI 16.3 to 18.7).  1222

Vitrectomy Group :  For the vitrectomy arm, data from a randomized trial comparing vitrectomy 1225  
with and without bevacizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy were reviewed (Manabe et 1226  
al., 2015).36 In the sham group, mean baseline visual acuity was 1.14 logMAR (28 letters) and 30 1227  
of the 34 participants (88%) were enrolled to treat persistent vitreous hemorrhage. At  one month 1228  
after surgery, mean visual acuity improved to 0.43 logMAR (64 letters). Without participant - [ADDRESS_472483] 1230  
deviation of visual acuity at one month was 0.48 logMAR (24 lett ers), which is less than the [ADDRESS_472484] deviation for visual acuity observed in the ranibizumab group at 4 weeks in 1232  
Protocol N (Table 1). Therefore, assuming the standard deviation of AUC for this group is 1233  
similar to the anti -VEGF group is likely a  conservative approach.  1234  
Projected Difference :  The estimated treatment group difference in AUC at  24 week s (6 months ) [ADDRESS_472485] baseline visual acuity of 33 1236  
letters, and the aflibercept  arm reaches a visual acuity of 64 letters by 6 months (Figure 1). These 1237  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-2 calculations projected an AUC difference of +8.3 letters in favor the of the vitrectomy arm. If 1238  
visual acuity in the aflibercept  arm did not reach 64 letters until 1 year, and had a visual acuity of 1239  
only 60 letters at 6 months, the difference would be +9.3 letters.  1240

 1242  
7.1.2 Sample Size Estimation  1243  
Table 2 shows sample sizes estimates under several scenarios. The final sample size has been 1244  
computed with type 1 error rate of 0.049 (0.001 adjustment for DSMC review) and 80% power . [ADDRESS_472486] deviation of 18 (after adjusting for correlation between baseline 1246  
and outcome), and a true difference in mean AUC of 8 letters, the required total sample size is 1247  
162 eyes. This will be increased to 200 eyes to account for u ncertainty in our projections and loss 1248  
to follow -up; if the rate of loss to follow -up is 7.5% , then the power for an effective sample size 1249  
of 185 would be 85%.   [ADDRESS_472487] 1251  
deviations (after adjustment for correlation between baseline and outcome). Total number of 1252  
eyes required for 80% / 90% power are shown in cells. The type I error rate is 0.049.  1253

enrolled with  7% loss to follow -up). In Protocol N, among eyes in the ranibizumab group with 1259  
baseline visual acuity of 20/32 or worse, 37% achieved 20/32 vision or greater by [CONTACT_122467]. As 1260  
power for the difference of two percentage s is dependent upon the absolute value of the 1261  
percentages, this estimate is used as a starting point for the calculations below.  1262

The expected half -widths for a within -group binary 95% confidence interval (e.g., percentage of 1267  
eyes in aflibercept  group requiring vitrectomy) are shown in Table 5. The expected half -widths 1268

Table 6. Expected half -widths of a 95% confidence interval for a between -group difference of 1273  
means (effective sample size of 186). The half -width depends upon the common standard [ADDRESS_472490] of a treatment group comparison of mean visual acuity AUC 1278  
from baseline to 24 week s between the two treatment groups adjusting for baseline visual acuity 1279  
and phakic status using analysis of covariance. Only  baseline and  outcome visits ( 4, 12, 24, 36, 1280  
52, 68, 84, and 104 weeks ), which are common to both groups,  will be used to calculate AUC 1281  
through the appropriate visit for the primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., 24 week s for primary 1282  
outcome). AUC will be calculated for each participant by [CONTACT_377435] 1283  
formula:  1284  
𝐴𝑈𝐶 = ∑(𝑉𝑖+𝑉𝑖+1
2×𝑑)𝑛
𝑖=1  1285  
Where Vi is the visual acuity from baseline measured at the ith visit, d is the number of days 1286  
between visi ts i and i+1, and n is the number of outcome visits included in the analysis. For 1287  
example, the primary outcome has n = [ADDRESS_472491] units of letters rather than letter days. 1290  
This statistic can then be interpreted as the average visual acuity over the time period between 1291  
baseline and the nth visit.  1292  
The primary analysis will include all randomized eyes according to treatment group assignment 1293  
at randomization. Rubin’s multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data. A sensitivity [ADDRESS_472492] will vary by [CONTACT_276493]/ethnicity. 1304  
However, both of these factors will be evaluated in exploratory analyses.  1305  
The primary outcome was primarily selected for sample size considerations.  The long -term 1306  
additional key outcomes and within -group outcomes will be equally important as the area under 1307  
the curve outcome for evaluating the overall follow -up course for these two treatment 1308  
approaches.  Therefore, publication is not planned until the f ull 104 week follow -up has closed.  1309  
7.2.2  Per-Protocol Analysis  1310  
A per -protocol analysis will be conducted that will include all randomized eyes except those in 1311  
the prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  group that never receive vitrectomy  and eyes from the aflibercept  [ADDRESS_472493] contri buted to the differences.  1315  
7.2.3 Interim Analysis Plan  1316  
There is no formal  interim data monitoring for efficacy or futility planned .   1317  
7.3 Secondary Outcomes  1318  
Additional analyses of visual acuity and other outcomes are summarized in the table below. 1319  
Analyses will include adjustments for baseline visual acuity and phakic status. Analyses will be 1320  
conducted at 24, 52, and 104 weeks  (note that visual acuity AUC at 24 weeks  is the primary 1321  
outcome, not a secondary outcome) . In addition, mean visual acuity , visual acuity AUC , and [ADDRESS_472494] months 1324

repeat  vitrectomy in vitrectomy group)  1334  
• Number of intravitreous aflibercept  injections performed  1335  
• Percentage of eyes receiving PRP ( aflibercept  group only)  [ADDRESS_472496] productivity loss. The analysis plan is briefly described and 1339

Data from the clinical trial on number of clinic visits completed, number of procedures 1341  
performed (e.g. vitrectomy, OCT, exam), and number of study aflibercept  injections will be used [ADDRESS_472497] for baseline score and phakic 1347  
status. Adjusted 95% confidence intervals for treatment group differences will be calculated. 1348  
Mean change at each visit in the following four scores will be analyzed:  1349  
• Absente eism:  percent work time missed due to vision  1350  
• Presenteeism:  percent impairment while working due to vision  1351  
• Work Productivity Loss:  percent overall work impairment due to vision  1352

11 2 Background 
2.1.1  Device Preclinical Experience  
 
G-Tech Medical has developed a noninvasive wireless patch system that measures 
electrical activity from the gastrointestinal smooth muscles on the abdominal surface.   
 2.1.2  Device Clinical Experience 
 
This technology has been studied as part of several non- significant risk IRB approved 
studies in both adults and pediatric populations to evaluate the patterns of gastrointestinal 
myoelectrical signals following surgery.
20–[ADDRESS_919298] flatus as much as 5 days (± 22 h) before occurrence.   
 
 
2.2 Background/prevalence of research topic  
 Gastrointestinal recovery after any visceral surgery is a complex dynamic process with 
multiple factors ranging from complexity of the surgery, degree of bowel handling and preoperative comorbidities affecting whether the recovery happens over few days, or is a 
slow prolonged affair lasting weeks.
1 Delays in the gastrointestinal recovery process or ileus 
is accompanied by [CONTACT_679491], pain, nausea, vomiting and the inability to 
tolerate oral feeding.2,3 Interventions to alleviate the ileus /distention include insertion or 
reinsertion of a nasogastric tube, instating nil per os  and, if necessitated, parenteral

12 nutrition.4  All of these factors contribute not only to patient discomfort, but extend length of 
stay (LOS), increase hospi[INVESTIGATOR_679478].5–7   
 
Clinically, the markers of gastrointestinal recovery are noted by [CONTACT_679492], defecation 
and the ability to tolerate solid food without significant nausea and vomiting.8 Passage of 
stool or flatus - considered a surrogate for intestinal and anastomotic continuity - is often 
used as the trigger to start stepwise dietary orders with the patient’s ability to tolerate each step marking their readiness for the subsequent meal.  Fast -track  and Enhanced Recovery 
After Surgery (ERAS)  programs that promote early feeding in advance of these clinical 
markers , along with opi[INVESTIGATOR_679479].
9–11 However, it has also been shown that, for as many 
as 25% of cases, the strategy does not work as noted earlier, with the need for  reinsertion of 
the nasogastric tube and reinstating nil per os status.  In a recent study of 513 consecutive 
colorectal patients who were on an ERAS protocol, 128 patients (24.7%) needed postoperative reinsertion of nasogastric tube at the 3.9±2.[ADDRESS_919299] gastrointestinal recovery/diet readiness for patients in advance of these clinical markers that may allow for interventions or fast-track programs to facilitate timely recovery. Auscultation for return of bowel sounds, long 
part of the standard of care, is controversial in its usefulness to indicate recovery. Bowel 
sounds have shown to have poor correlation with flatus/defecation and have proved 
unsuccessful in guiding diet interventions.

electrical and mechanical (contractile) events in the colon with internally placed electrode-strain gauge force transducers.
14–16 Electrical activity in the colon has been reported across 
a wide range of frequencies ranging from 0 to 40 cycles per min (cpm)).[ADDRESS_919301] been performed 
using electrodes placed internally during surgery, a major impediment towards broader use 
of such technology.

13 3 Rationale/Signific ance 
3.1 Problem Statement  
GI functional recovery after surgery is unpredictable and contributes to increased length of 
stay and postoperative readmissions for ileus.  
 
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
The purpose of the Phase 1 study  is to determine i f the my oelectrical measurements made 
by [CONTACT_941] G -Tech Wireless Patch System correlate with clinical markers of postoperative 
recovery such as passage of flatus/bowel movement, oral tolerance of diet and discharge 
readiness.  Subsequently the data will be studied to establish which information in the signals 
is important in determining when to feed patients  and possibly discharge them.  
 
These pi[INVESTIGATOR_584424], open clinical studies  suggests that myoelectrical activity, measured 
on the abdominal surface with a noninvasive wireless patch system, carries predictive value 
in determining time to feeding and time to flatus following open abdominal surgery. Having 
such information in advance of clinical measures could facilitate timely interventions, be it 
early feeding or delaying feeding as dictated by [CONTACT_102]’s unique recovery profile.  The G-
Tech Wireless P atch System would provide a unique insight into the process allowing for a 
tailored protocol that could improve patient satisfaction and optimize recovery. The system  
could also enable feedback on the impact to the overall gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity 
of medications, particularly opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], used for pain management that are known to inhibit 
gastrointestinal function by [CONTACT_679493] o f colonic motility.23–25 
While it remains to be seen, in addition to predicting time to flatus/bowel movement early on, 
the ability to continue monitoring the patient may allow one to predict onset of secondary complications, such as wound infections or anastomotic leaks, that are associated with ileus.  
Although not part of this protocol, given the wireless noninvasive nature of the system the patients could be discharged home with the patches, whereby [CONTACT_679494] a remote monitoring tool. This could be particularly useful in cases where the patients may have been 
discharged early and may be at a high risk for readmission. The system would then send updates/alerts to the care team for management and potentially avoid preventable 
readmissions.  
 
 
3.2.1  Potential Risks  
 
The risks associated with the G -Tech Patch System are related with the use of the G -
Tech Patch (electrical risks, skin allergy or chemical) and the export  of the data  
(anonymized data sent to G tech) .

differences between right colon, left colon, and rectum resections. 
 
6.4.3  Planned Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analyses  
The primary endpoint is to determine if there is  a correlation between the measured motor 
activity metrics of the various GI organs with measures of recovery, and to mathematically 
characterize the correlation in a manner that leads to predictive ability.  The study  is 
retrospective without intention to  treat.  Data analysis is performed by [CONTACT_679500] G -Tech 
Medical located in Mountain View, CA using proprietary software developed specifically for 
this purpose.  Data is accessed on a secure cloud server to which it was uploaded by [CONTACT_679501].  
Data analysis consists of extracting the myoelectric motor activity measured by [CONTACT_679502]- minute time segments and assigning them to an organ or organs.  The motor activity 
at any one time (instantaneous) and the cumulative activity up to that point in time will be 
examined for correlation to parameters associated with recovery rate such as time to first 
flatus, time to first solid meal, time to discharge, etc.  This will be done across all time points to find the earliest time that offers predictive value.  The specific final analysis approach 
taken will depend on the findings of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
In the study2 with c olonic  myoelectric activity measurements  after open abdominal surgery 
an inverse correlation was found between cumulative colon signal strength and time to first flatus which was approximately linear and was best characterized by [CONTACT_679503] (RMS) deviation of the residuals from a linear fit, in units of hours.  The optimal time for this 
analy sis was found to be at [ADDRESS_919321] ronger signals were more likely to be in the early feeding group and vice versa.  A 
statistical analysis was performed using a receiver -operator characteristic approach that led

determination of the optimal time, which was again at approximately 36 hours.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Objectives Analyses  
In addition to the analysis above, electronic medical record review will allow for the rate of 
ileus, readmission, and first bowel movement to be further correlated with the processed 
myoelectric signal.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
Anticipated and unanticipated adverse device events will be monitor through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]

Who is paying for the study? 
This study has no external funding and is being supported by [CONTACT_679509].  
 
Who is providing other support for the study?  
The medical device is being provided free of charge by [CONTACT_3455].  
 
What is the study about?  
The purpose of this study is to record the electrical signals that naturally occur in your digestive 
tract and motility patterns in individuals who undergo surgery.   Patients who have surgery 
have the potential to experience delayed recovery of their bowel movements or passing gas . 
Delayed recovery, or  ileus, causes the intestinal contents to back up because the bowels do 
not move in a rhythmic way that is needed.  The symptoms resulting from this include painful 
distended abdomen, nausea, vomiting , and dehydration.  A device, the G -Tech Wireless Patch 
System (WPS)  has been developed by a company, G -Tech Medical, Inc. , which measures the 
electrical activity from your intestines.  The device uses adhesive to adhere to your skin and 
it is placed on your stomach or abdomen to measure the natural electrical activity .  The 
purpose of the study is to determine if the measurements made by [CONTACT_941] G -Tech Wireles s Patch 
System correlate with clinical markers of gastrointestinal  recovery such as passage of flatus  
or your first bowel movement, oral tolerance of diet , and discharge readiness.  
 
This study is solely for obtaining patterns in various individuals to determine if the myoelectric 
signals measured by [CONTACT_941] G -Tech Wireless Patch System correlate with rate of gastrointestinal 
recovery following surgery.    
 
What are you asking me to do and how long will it take?  
The device will be placed post -operatively within  [ADDRESS_919332] if the surgical team has approved of showering after surgery.  
 
What are the risks and discomforts of participating?   
A potential risk in this study is the adhesive on the patch may cause mild irritation and leave 
temporary red or pi[INVESTIGATOR_679487], which should go away on 
their own a few days after the patch is removed.

38 We will tell you if we learn any new information that could change your  mind  about taking 
part in this study.   
 
What if there are unexpected findings from the study related to my participation?  
We do not anticipate findings that would directly relate to your care as the meaning of the 
data is not yet fully understood and the primary purpose of this study. If the results suggest a 
long- term relevance of the data to your current or future health status, we will communicate 
these findings to you.  
 
How can the study possibly benefit me?  
There are no direct benefits to you for  participating in this study .  
 
How can the study possibly benefit other people?  
The results of this study will help the future development of technology and to potentially 
help future patients by [CONTACT_679510] -operative care and decrease their length of stay

 8 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Treatments Against RA and Effect on FD G PET-CT:  
The TARGET Trial  
Précis:  The overarching goal  of this trial is to examine the effect of RA disease 
modifying drugs (DMARDs) on vascular inflammation.  We will accomplish 
this goal by [CONTACT_504637] (MTX).  These 
are:  a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) + MTX + hydroxychloroquine 
(HCQ [if subject was taking HCQ at study entry]) versus triple therapy (MTX 
+ sulfasalazine [SSZ] + hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]). The trial  design is a two -
arm RCT with blinded joint assessment and blinded FDG PET/CT readers.  
Subjects  and rheumatologists will be unblinded to treatment assignment 
but will be blinded to FDG PET/CT results. Joint count assessors will be 
blinded to treatment assig nment. The trial will be conducted at multiple 
sites across the US, with a duration of six months.  Recruitment will be 
over 24 months with six more months of follow -up.   
Objectives:  
 Primary: To compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX 
versus triple therapy in subjects  with RA who are inadequate responders 
to MTX using FDG PET/CT as a tool for detecting vascular (arterial) 
inflammation.  
 Secondary: To compare the effects on v ascular inflammation of 
achieving low disease activity or remission (LDAR) vs moderate -high 
disease activity (MHDA).  
Exploratory Aim 1: To determine  researchers’ attitudes and beliefs 
regarding their ethical obligation to return and manage incidental 
resea rch findings from who le body FDG PET/CT imaging, including w hat 
to report, whe n to report, and how to report, as well as h ow to manage 
and to what extent . 
Exploratory Aim 2: To de termine the prevalence of incidental research 
findings  on whole body FDG PET/CT in RA and detection rate of 
previously unknown malignancies . 
Exploratory Aim 3: To investigate associations between stress -associated 
neurobiological activity and articular and arterial treatment response in 
RA.   
 
  
 9 Population:  Subjects for this trial will be RA patients who are deemed methotrexate -
inadequate responders (MTX -IRs, DAS28>3.2 ) by [CONTACT_504638], and who have not yet started treatment with a biologic 
DMARD and are currently not receiving any other DMARD than MTX  or 
MTX and HCQ .  In order to enrich our trial subjects for atherosclerosis, 
male RA patients must be at least [ADDRESS_649751] 50 
years old.  Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Section 3 
of this d ocument.  
 
Phase:  Phase IV  
Number of Sites:  This will be a multicenter study. The lead sites will be Brigham & Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504600].  
Participating  sites will be selected based on the following criterion: 
adequate number of RA patients ; access to an FDG -PET scanner; 
availability of trial staff (i.e. coordinator, nurse, trained joint count 
assessor (metrologist) ; and experience enrolling and following subjects in 
previous clinical trials .    
Description of  
Intervention:  Enrolled subjects  will be asked to take 6 months of RA medication 
according to the treatment arm to which they are randomized, which will 
be either be triple therapy or a TNFi.  
 
Subjects will be evaluated every six weeks for clinical response . For 
subjects  receiving a TNFi, if good  treatment  response (CDAI ≤10) is not 
achieved by  [ADDRESS_649752]  is receiving etanercept, 
this medication will be discontinued and switched to adalimumab 40 mg 
every other week. Subjects  will remain on this new medication until the 
end of the study.  
Subjects  assigned to the triple therapy arm  will begin SSZ 500 mg  twice 
daily and HCQ 200 mg twice daily , not to exceed 6.5  mg/kg.  At 6 weeks , 
the dose of SSZ will increase from 500 mg twice daily to 1 g twice daily for 
all patients.  At 18 weeks, if a good treatment  response  (CDAI ≤ 10) has not  
been achieved, MTX will be stopped and  leflunomide 20 mg daily  started .  
The participant will remain on leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) 
for the remaining six weeks of the study.  
As part of a bioethics ancillary study,  we will survey the TARGET 
investi gators to determine researchers' attitudes and beliefs regarding 
 10 their ethical obligation to return and manage incidental research findings 
from whole body PET/CT imaging studies and determine the prevalence of 
incidental extra cardiac findings on whole bo dy PET/CT scans in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and detection rate of previously unknown 
malignancies.

processing of all sera and plasma biospecimens.  Whole  and frozen  blood will be sent directly from clinical sites to the 
biorepository.  S era and plasma will be spun and frozen in [ADDRESS_649761] CTSA, and for funded ancillary proposals in volving biomarkers.  
3)  The Harvard CTSA laboratory will perform assays of analytes collected at visits 2, 3, 5, and 6 that will be used to 
assess several CV risk factors (lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], insulin, and glucose).  These assays will take place at the end of the study  on 
batched samples.  This will assure uniformity in these measurements.   
4) Crescendo/Myriad has agreed to perform two proteomic  assay s (VECTRA DA  and RBM Discovery Panel 3.3 ) on 
aliquots from visit 2, visit 3, visit 5, and visit 6.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONA LE 
2.[ADDRESS_649762] common autoimmune rheumatic cond itions, affecting 0.5-1.0% of the adult population1,2. 
Remarkable progress in the treatment of  RA has occurred in the past [ADDRESS_649763] of CVD in RA in the US is estimated at $[ADDRESS_649764] 2 -3 decade s10.  Rates of non -
fatal CV events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, as well as the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis 
in cor onary and carotid arterial beds  are also higher in RA compared to non -RA controls11,12. Management  of CVD 
risk in RA is based on general population guidelines without tailoring.  These data emphasize the urgency of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_504601]. 
2.1.2  The increased CV risk in RA is likely due to enhanced vasc ular and/or systemic inflammation.  
Atherosclerosis in the general population is recognized as a low -grade inflammatory proces s13, as reflected by 
[CONTACT_504642], T and B cells in plaque, and the association of plaque with elevated circulating levels 
of inflammatory cytokines14. ‘Vulnerable plaque’ likely to rupture is characterized by [CONTACT_504643] , particularly macrophages .  These macrophages elaborate matrix metalloprote inases (MMPs) 
that in turn erode the plaqu e’s fibrous cap leading to extrusion of thrombogenic material into the vessel  lumen and 
acute thrombosis14.  Modest elevations of systemic measures of inflammation – such as C -reactive protein (CRP), 
interleukin -6 (IL -6) and solu ble vascular endothelial molecules – are independent predictors of future CV event s in 
the general population15-17. 
[ADDRESS_649765] been implicated in the pathogenesis and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (e.g. IL -1, TNF -α, IL -6)14. This 
highly inflammatory milieu is hypothesized to accelerate the atherosclerotic proce ss in patients with RA.   A ttempts 
to prove this hypot hesis have predominantly correlated single measures of inflammation with CV events, but only 
one CRP study approached statistical significance (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.99 -1.22)18, and two sedimentation rate (ESR) 
studies showed correlation with CVD18,19.  Other studies have correlated  clinical  indices of RA disease activity  and 
RA-associated autoantibodies with atherosclerotic plaque as well as  incident CV events20-22.  These p rior study 
approaches were indirect, non -experimental and often retrospective . 
With the advent of PET scanning and the development of radioisotopes that are avidly taken up by 
[CONTACT_51920]/macrophages (e.g., FDG), the ability to detect inflammation within vessel  walls and specifically within 
atherosclerot ic plaque has been realized23. In this proposal, we will - for the first time in the setting of a n RCT in RA – 
directly assess inflammation in the vascular walls of patients with RA, using vascular FDG PET/CT imaging.   We will 
also correlate DMARD associated changes in v ascular inflammation with changes in RA disease activity as measured 
by [CONTACT_2085] ( DAS28 ), biomarker (MBDA) and joint imaging (FDG PET/CT) measures, as well as separately with changes 
in systemic inflammation as measured by [CONTACT_244108] -6 levels.  
2.1.3  Currently available CV risk tools underperform in identifying CV risk in RA .  
In the general population, CVD risk prediction tools (e.g., Framingham , FRS,24 and Reynolds , RRS25) have been 
developed to estimate an individual’s fut ure risk for a CV event.  T hese risk tools perfo rm well at the population 
level, but they do not discriminate risk well in women and younger individuals26, groups heavily represented in RA.    
In fact, Crowson et al27 reported that the observed CVD risk in 525 RA was 2 -fold higher in women and 65% higher in 
men than the F RS predicted  risk, with similar findi ngs from the RRS  despi[INVESTIGATOR_504602].   CV risk in RA may be 
associated with lower, not higher, levels of total and LDL cholesterol, further illustrating the problems with 
conventional CV risk measures in stratifying CV risk in RA18,[ADDRESS_649766] Rheumatology (EULAR) , but its evidence base is weak and it s performance poor31.  These 
deficiencies of currently available CV risk tools in RA populations  underscore the pressing need for identification of 
biomarkers of CV risk tailored for the RA patient .     
Prior efforts aimed at developi[INVESTIGATOR_504603], coronary 
artery calcium and c arotid intima medial thickness (cIMT).  However, a recent meta -analysis of prospective RCTs 
suggested that cIMT changes did n ot correlate well with rates of future clinical C VD32. In contrast, FDG PET/CT is 
being increasingly used in RCTs because infla mmation within vascular walls and within plaque is believed to 
represent one of the critical early and reversible steps of atherosclerosis33,34. In fact, several recent studies have 
demonstrated that the presence of arterial  inflammation (measured by [CONTACT_504644]) identified  individuals at higher 
risk for future CV event s than  those without inflamma tion35,36. 
2.1.4  FDG PET/CT is a sensitive method for detecting vascular inflammation  
Although most widely used for detection of cancer, FDG PET/CT imaging represents a novel modality for direct 
detection of inflammation in the vasculature.  Cellular FDG uptake reflects the rate of tissue glycolysis, which is 
higher in areas containing inflamed tissues. Activated macrophages have remarkably elevated glycolytic flux 37,38  
and hence avidly accumulate FDG 39. Moreover , FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaques correlates with the density of 
macrophages determined histologically 23,40 -43. Indeed, FDG PET/CT is now used clinically t o evaluate inflamed 
tissues, and has recently been the focus of guidelines from American and European Societies for Nuclear Medicine 
and Molecular Imaging44. 
18 FDG PET/CT for Imaging Atherosclerosis: In atherosclerosis, disease activity can be defined as progression of 
atherosclerotic plaque or development of atherothrombotic events.  In a multi -center trial employing both PET/CT 
and MRI im aging, changes in the PET/CT signal predicted the rate of plaque expansion eighteen months later45. In 
another  study, the arterial PET signal predicted the subsequent rate of atherosclerotic plaque progression, based on 
CT imaging46. Additionally, several studies have shown an association between the FDG signal and CV risk factors or 
risk scores35,47 -49. Higher arterial FDG uptake was also associated with a substantially increased risk for subsequent 
stroke and MI36,50. Thus, there is  substantial evidenc e to support the utility of FDG PET/CT imaging to predict 
atherosclerotic disease progression and subsequent CV events.  This imaging modality is responsive to changes to CV 
risk as a result of treatment.  High dose statin therapy reduce d FDG PET/CT signal to a greater extent than low dose 
statins51,52; clinical outcome studies have found a 28% reduction  in CV events among high dose statin users versus 
low dose53.  
FDG PET/CT as a Tool to Measure Changes in Tissue Inflammation after Interventions:  FDG PET/CT imaging is a 
well-established tool for evaluating treatment -related changes in inflammation after interventions in  humans. 
Several groups have shown that statin therapy (a well -described anti -inflammatory treatment in atherosclerosis) 
results in a significant reduction in arterial FDG uptake after 3 months52,54,55. Using FDG PET/CT,  Tawakol (co-I) et al 
observed a relatively rapid reduction in arterial inflammation in individuals randomized  to atorvastatin 80 
(compared to atorvastatin 10mg)52. More recently, van Wijk et al56,57 demonstrated in individuals with familial 
hypercholesterolemia that non -pharmacologic lipid lowering by [CONTACT_504645] a rapid reduction in 
arterial inflammation within one week of the intervention.   Additionally, FDG PET/CT imaging has be en used to study 
the impact on arterial inflammation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504604]. Recently completed 
multi-center PET/CT imaging trials evaluated the anti -inflammatory efficacy of p38 MAP kinase antagonism58, a 
novel innate -immune modulator lecinoxoid59, Lipoprotein -associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) antagonist60, and a 
cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) antagoni st61. Others have reported on the impact of tumor necrosis factor 
antagonists62 and    pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 63. 
 Relationship between FDG PET/CT Imaging Trial Findings and Clinical Endpoint Trial Results:  Currently, results of 
both clinical endpoint studies and FDG PET/CT imaging trials are available  for 4 drug classes.  Such paired results 
(albeit from different RCTs) allow the evaluation of the degree to which FDG PET/CT trial results are predictive of 
clinical endpoint studies. The 4 drug classes are 1) s tatins, 2) p ioglitazone, 3) CETP antagonist , and 4) Lp-PLA2  
antagonists. As previously stated, each of the published PET/CT studies evaluating the impact of sta tins on the 
vasculature demonstrate a reduction in atherosclerotic inflammation, hence those findings parallel the well -
described reduction in CVD events associated with sta tins. Similarly, pi[INVESTIGATOR_504605] a reduction 
in arterial FDG63 and a reduced incidence of atherothrombotic events.64,65 Hence for statins and pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], 
findings of reduc ed arterial inflammation in FD G PET/CT imaging trials are consistent with the findings of clinical 
endpoint trials. On the other hand, the dal -PLAQUE imaging trial which evaluated the effect of dalcetrapib (a CETP  
modulator) on arterial plaque showed no difference between dalcetrapib a nd placebo (p=0.51) on the primary or 
secondary FDG PET/CT imaging end -point 66. The subsequently published dal -OUTCOMES trial evaluating the effect 
of dalcetrapib on major coronary events similarly demonstrated no clinical benefit.67 Likewise, an FDG PET/CT 
imaging trial evaluating an inhibitor of Lp -PLA 2, rilapladib,  showed no beneficial impact of Lp -PLA [ADDRESS_649767],  to reduce the primary composite endpoint of  CV death, MI, or stroke.68 Thus 
for all 4 drug classes for which there ar e both FDG PET/CT data and clinical endpoint data (atorvastatin, 
darapladib /rilapladib , dalcetrapib, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]), the imaging trial findings have been consistent with the results 
from clinical endpoint studies . While the FDA has not yet accepted FDG PET/CT as a  validated surrogate measure of 
CVD,  the use of FDG PET/CT imaging may provide a pathway for predicting the potential efficacy of CV therapeutics 
[ADDRESS_649768] with an outcomes trial.  
  
 Arterial FDG PET/CT studies in RA.  Recently, Maki -Petaja et al62 reported higher aortic FDG uptake  in 17 RA 
patients  compared to 34 non -RA controls with stable CAD (target -to-background ratio [TBR] 2. 02±0.22 vs 1.74±0.22, 
respectively, p=0.0001).  Moreover, open label treatment of the RA patients with a TNF i (etanercept or adalimumab) 
over only 8 wee ks was associated with a n 18% decrease in FDG uptake  (2.51±0.33 to 2.05±0.33, p<0.[ADDRESS_649769] diseased segment) that correlated with  decrease s in CRP and DAS28  levels .  A cross -sectional study of  [ADDRESS_649770] the potential value of FDG 
PET/CT to assess vascular inflammation in RA.    We have conducted a retrospective study of 33 RA patients who 
underwent PET/CT imaging for non -CVD indications  (in press ), and a cross -sectional observational study of [ADDRESS_649771] undergone aortic PET/CT imagin g.  Taken together, these  studies strongly support the fe asibility 
of enrolling adequate numbers of RA patients with elevated vascular FDG uptake for the purposes of the proposed 
RCT.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_649772] of RA treatments on CVD is unclear.  
To date, there is no level A evidence (i.e., double blind RCTs) that any RA DMARDs  reduces frequency of CV 
events in patients with RA.  However, there is a strong body of experimental data that lay the groundwork for this 
hypothesis, and these data are by [CONTACT_504646]’s at every level (in vitro, animal models, human 
obse rvational data) . 
TNFα and TNFi effects on vasculature .   Vascular endothelium is a select target for TNFα in which it induces an 
array of pro -inflammatory, pro -coagulant, and pro -apoptotic genes that damage endothelium and increases 
thrombotic potential, w hile simultaneously inhibiting synthesis of the vasodilator nitric oxide70.  TNFα also induces 
endothelial adhesion molecules which mediate attachment and transmigration of inflammatory cells to the arte rial 
walls71. The monocyte influx takes up oxidized LDL, activating release of TNFα and further promoting LDL uptake via 
induction of acyl -CoA-cholesterol transferase 172.  This feed forward loop results in foam cell accumulation, an early 
stage of atherosclerosis72. These effects can be reversed by [CONTACT_504647]’s in vitro73. Mice deficient for both TNFα and apoE 
exhibit reduced atherosclerotic lesions compared to wild type controls74. Therapy with TNFi’s as an anti -atherogenic 
strategy is strongly supported by [CONTACT_504648].  
Given these data and the observation by [CONTACT_504649]α is also the primary cytokine driving joint 
and systemic inflammation in RA75, there has been intense interest in investigating inhibition of TNF as a strategy in 
RA for reducing CVD.  In small studies of RA patients, the prevalence of endothelial dysfunctio n and aortic stiffness 
were observed to be higher than in controls. TNFi treatment transiently and partially reversed these measures76,77  
At the macrovascular level, several cohort studies suggested that TNFi’s also slow progression of asymptomatic 
carotid atherosclerosis c ompared to conventional DMARDs78,79.  As to whether TNFi’s reduced CV events in cohort -
based epi [INVESTIGATOR_504606], the data are somewhat more mixed.   For example, several large registry 
studies showed a reduction in CV events in TNFi users compared to non -users80,81, but studies from other large 
databases such as the US  VA health system and the Swedish and British Rheumatology Registries82-84 did not 
demonstrate reductions in rates of co mposite CVD endpoints with exposure to TNFi’s.  Man y of these registry and 
administrative data studies lack detailed information on traditional CV risk factors and RA characteristics. Thus, 
confounding by i ndication and other unmeasured confounders threaten the ir validity , severely limiting the causal 
inference.   The time is right therefore to move the field forward in RA via an RCT  to directly evaluate the effect of 
20 TNF inhibition on a vascular measure (i.e., arterial inflammation) that is an integral feature of atherosclerosis and 
plaque rupture.  
Effect of non -biologic DMARDs on the vasculature .  In contrast to the robust data suggesting a therapeutic  role 
for TNFi’s in treating atherosclerosis, data for SSZ and HCQ are extremely limited.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_504607] a 
treatment for RA, and  anti-inflam matory actions that have potential relevance to atherosclerosis (e.g., inhibition of 
activation of NFkB and scavenging of reactive oxygen species85,86), there is almost no information regarding a 
potential effect on reducing CVD.  A small RCT in non -RA patients with stable CAD evaluated the efficacy of SSZ vs 
placebo for improving endothelial function87 but n o significant difference was observed .  In a large multinational RA 
cohort in Europe, comparing users of various DMARDs to non -users, SSZ was associated with only a modest 
reduction in CV morbidity (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 -98) compared t o MTX (HR 0.85), leflunomide (HR 0.59), 
glucocorticoids (HR 0.95) and TNFi’s (HR 0.42)88.  
HCQ is an anti -malarial drug with modest anti -inflammatory effects in  RA but a disease modifying capacity has 
never been definitively confirmed.  It has effects on both the adaptive as well as innate immune pathways. HCQ 
raises the  intracellular  pH of lysozomes which impairs protein processing, causing downstream impairment of  
immune functions such as antigen presentation to CD4+ cells, interaction of intracellular toll -like receptors (TLRs) 
with cognate ligands, and production of proinflammatory cytokines89-91.  These mechanisms could play a role in 
treating/preventing atherosclerosis but there are no data to support this at present.  Int eresting data do support an 
effect of HCQ in reducing metabolic risk.  Gu et al92 showed that anti -malarials  suppress lipid accumulation in 
macrophages through their effect on TLR -9.  However, in a recent meta -analysis of nine studies in SLE, evidence 
suggesting that anti -malarials reduce lipid levels was weak93  although another study reported a protective effect  in 
SLE against metabolic syndrome94.  In two RA cohort studies, treatment with HCQ was associated with a decrease in 
incident diabetes95,96, while a third study did not show a significant reduction30.  There are no data on the effect of 
HCQ in reducing CV events.  
Taken together, these data strongly support our hypothesis that TNFi  therapy will have a more potent effect on 
arterial inflammation than combined SSZ+HCQ (with both given on MTX background).   While our study design does 
not allow us to investigate the effect of MTX on arterial inflamm ation, our preliminary data and that o f Maki -Petaja62 
strongly suggest that MTX -IRs will have more than sufficient arteri al inflammation to measure a drug effect.  
2.1.6  Blood -derived biomarkers of CV risk in RA are also needed.  
Blood -derived biomarkers of CV risk (e.g., SNPs, gene arrays, soluble proteins, cell subtypes) are also desirabl e 
and a focus of great interest.  Advantage s of blood -derived biomarkers of CV risk include: 1) easy accessibility, 2) lack 
of radiation exposure, and 3) ability to standardize assays  that enable widespread commercial use.   As with imaging 
biomarkers, blood -derived biomarkers would ideally identify  asymptomatic RA patients at intermediate to high CV 
risk who would not be identified by [CONTACT_504650].   This would enable a risk -
stratified approach combining conventional CV risk factors  and RA-specific factors which could substantially reduce 
CV associated morbidity and mortality in patients with RA.  
Correlations of a single non -specific biomarker of inflammation (e.g., CRP, sedimentation rate [ESR] or IL -6) with 
CVD in patients with RA have been modest97-99.  Similarly, clinical indices of RA disease activity, and RA -associated 
autoantibodies, have met  with  similarly  limited success as ‘biomarkers’ of CVD20-22. A broad array of biomarkers 
reflecting systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, lipid metabolism and pro -inflammatory cytokines have 
been shown in the general population to be associated with prevalent and/or incident CVD.   These include CRP, IL -
6, serum amyloid protein (SAA), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), apolipoprotein B and others100.   A 
substantial number of these CV risk biomarkers also reflect biological pathways that are activated in RA and 
21 correlate with RA disease activity .  For example, of the twelve proteins that comprise a commercially available 
MBDA known as ‘Vectra -DA’ (Crescendo Bioscience), all are also recognized as CVD biomarkers , such as CRP, SAA, IL -
6, TNF -R1, MMP -[ADDRESS_649773] or, and 
human cartilage glycoprotein -39 (YKL -40)101 Thus, the MBDA is a very promising biomarker for investigation of CV 
risk in patients with RA.  It was derived from studies of 130 biomarkers; of these, [ADDRESS_649774] 
strong correlation with the DAS28 -CRP (r2=0.60), significantly better than the CRP (r2=0.38)102.  In an Area Under the 
Receiver Operating Curve  (AUROC) analysis examining the ability of the MBDA  to classify patients into low disease 
activity vs moderate -high disease, the average AUROC was 0.[ZIP_CODE]. MBDA scores range between [ADDRESS_649775] that the MBDA 
‘molecular remission’ may be superior to clinically defined remission in predicting progression of radiographic joint 
damage104.  If the MBDA is also found to predict change in vascular inflamma tion in RA, this could enhance current 
CVD risk models in RA with potential clinical value . 
2.1.7  FDG PET/CT can also be used to assess treatment -associated changes in joint inflammation.  
FDG is taken up by [CONTACT_504651] , and several small pi[INVESTIGATOR_504608].  Palmer et al105 found excellent anatomical 
correlation in the wrists of [ADDRESS_649776] FDG uptake with volume of pannus 
determined by [CONTACT_504652].   Beckers et al106 foun d a strong association between  FDG uptake in 356 joints of 21 
RA patients with clinical and ultrasound derived measures of joint activity.  In a further study by [CONTACT_504653] 16 RA patients treated with a TNF antagonist107, reduction in FDG uptake in the knees a t four weeks 
was highly correlated with changes observed in all MRI parameters and with MMP -3 levels, but less well with serum 
CRP levels .  Okamura et al 108 also studied change in FDG uptake in 22 RA patients treated for 6 months with a TNFi; 
average dec rease in maximal standardized uptake value (SUV max) after six months was 22% and was positively 
correlated with change in DAS28 -CRP levels (r=0.66, p=0.001).  Roivainen et al109 examined change in FDG uptake 
after initiation of triple therapy plus low dose pr ednisone in 17 patients with RA.  76% and 81% of patients showed 
reductions in SUV max at weeks 2 and 4, respectively; mean decreases in SUV max were 22±13% and 29±13%, 
respectively. While encouraging, these studies were extremely small and open label .  In the proposed study , we will 
for the first time utilize FDG PET/CT in an RCT to evaluate change in joint inflammation between two treatment 
regimens for RA.  
2.1.8  Bioethics Ancillary Study  
There is a lack of information available on researchers’ attitudes and beli efs regarding incidental research 
findings and the prevalence of incidental research findings from state of the art imaging studies, such as whole body 
FDG PET/CT in those without known malignancy, and to our knowledge, no such information available in 
rheumatology. The Treatments Against RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) and Effect on FDG PET/CT (TARGET) study 
provides an unprecedented and unique opportunity to examine the ethics around incidental findings from whole 
body FDG PET/CT in RA patients without known ma lignancy.  
2.1.9  Neuroimaging Measures Ancillary Study  
           Neuroimaging has revolutionized the study of neuropsychiatric conditions, including conditions along the 
stress axis (anxiety, stress, PTSD, and depression). Imaging with functional MRI and FDG PET provide insights into 
regional reactivity (fMRI) or restin g metabolism (FDG PET) of regions of the brain that are critically involved in stress 
conditions (including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). FDG -PET assessments of regional brain activity has been 
performed for decades, and leverages the fact that FDG localizes to areas of active glycolysis. This signal is 
[ADDRESS_649777] for anatomical localization. Higher rAmygA 
may be a more accurate reflection of chronic stress, higher trait -anxiety, and persiste nt negative affect110, and has 
repeatedly been shown to associate with anxious temperament111 perceived stress112, and PTSD113. Furthermore, 
this signal is physiologically important, as it links to diseases that are independently associated with stress, such as 
cardiovascular disease112. Moreover, higher rAmygA was shown to link to future CVD events through upregulated 
activity in bone marrow and heightened arterial inflammation in series.   
        Rheumatoid Arthritis is associated with an Elevated Chronic Stress Burden, and an Exaggerated Stress Response.  
RA patients commonly report that disease flares occur during or after periods of increased psychological stress114.  
However, studies attempting to causally link stress with RA disease activity and/or systemic inflammation have been 
inconsistent115, hampered by [CONTACT_504654] -reported measures of psychosocial stress, difficulty establishi ng temporality, 
and the inability to evaluate the contribution of RA symptoms, pain, and disability to stress.   Few studies in RA have 
utilized neuroimaging to investigate links between the brain, immune system, and joints , and no studies have explored 
the links between neuroimaged reactivity in the amygdala and related brain structures and vascular inflammation in 
RA patients, despi[INVESTIGATOR_504609] -reported psychosocial stress and coronary calcification in 
this population.  Establish ing these associations will inform mechanistic follow -up studies, validate the performance 
of self -reported psychosocial stressors as proxy measures, and support the testable concept of psychosocial stress 
management as an intervention for reducing CVD and  disease activity in RA.  
2.[ADDRESS_649778] come to agree that it is not 
feasible.  Based on an assumed 25% difference in CV event rates and a 2% annual event rate, we calculated a sample size 
of ~10,[ADDRESS_649779] would be approximately $70M.  If we could enroll a very high -risk RA population (e.g., 
immediately post -MI), then f ewer subjects would be required.  However, since IL -6 blockers and JAK inhibitors raise LDL, 
the ethics of this trial are unclear. Thus, a surrogate endpoint trial with FDG PET/CT is the preferred design.  
We considered several potential treatment compariso ns. We pursued designing a treat to target (TTT) trial with the 
Technical Expert Panel (TEP) through a formal Delphi Panel process.  This involved extensive literature reviews, protocol 
development, and consensus voting on [ADDRESS_649780] difficult issues include: how to ensure that usual care would differ substantially from TTT; the 
clinically appropriate drug dosing and visit regimens for TTT that would facilitate separation of the disease activity curves  
for TTT versus usua l care; the use of glucocorticoids in the TTT regimen, and the strong potential for contamination 
across arms.  After considering these issues, we determined that it would be extremely difficult to conduct a rigorous 
TTT trial focused on the CV endpoint de scribed above. We considered several comparisons for a treatment trial.  
We chose to pursue a TNFi + MTX versus triple therapy for several reason s. 1) While there are strong data to suggest 
that these treatments produce similar clinical outcomes by 12 -24 months111-113, triple therapy is a strategy that is not 
being widely used in typi[INVESTIGATOR_333575].  Thus, further information comparing these s trategies may help clinicians and 
patients make treatment decisions. 2) TNFi + MTX appears to have a quicker onset of action with greater disease control 
at 6 months based on several published trials111,113.  Thus, there is ample evidence to support a superiority hypothesis 
for the proposed trial. 3) Both treatment options are considered standard of care, enhancing patient and provider 
acceptability. 4) The ability to adj ust doses over the [ADDRESS_649781], as noted above, some patients will not respond to 
treatment regimens.  We believe that it is ethical and feasible to keep patients on dose -adjusted treatments for 6 
months, but n ot longer.  Second, 6 months will allow for improvement in FDG PET/CT.  This has been demonstrated in 
prior trials using statins with an FDG PET/CT assessment after [ADDRESS_649782] associated 
changes in vascular inflammation in patient s with RA.  The overall study design is shown in Figure 1.  Two hundred 
patients with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX (MTX -IRs, DAS28>3.2)  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either a TNFi or SSZ + HCQ, while continuing background MTX  (and  HCQ if applicable) , for 24 weeks.   Although 
the joint count assessors and imaging readers will be blinded to treatment assessment, the subjects  and investigators 
will not be blinded.  
3.2 Study Population  
This will be a multicenter study with approximately 40 study sites. 400 RA patients will be recruited over a planned 
recruitment period of 24 month , 200 will be randomized . The target population consists of patients who are deemed

3.5 Recruitment and Retention  
3.5.1 Recruitment Plan  
The target population to be recruited is men aged 45 and older or women aged 50 and older with a clinical diagnosis 
of RA who are deemed methotrexate -inadequate responders (MTX -IR) by [CONTACT_504655].  Patient s 
will be recruited from participating rheumatology and arthritis clinics and practices at participating sites across the 
[LOCATION_002].  A recommended method for identifying and recruiting patients is described in the following sections 
and in more detail  in the MOOP.  Sites will generate and maintain a list of patients that may become eligible for the 
study based on a HIPAA -compliant review of medical records of existing RA patients.  The treating rheumatologists 
will alert study staff when a patient is d eemed a MTX -IR, prior to a switch or escalation of DMARDs. The Site 
Coordinator will speak with the patient to go over pre -screening inclusion/exclusion criteria, explain the trial, and 
assess interest (Recruitment training will be provided) . The Study Bro chure can be given to interested patients.  
If the patient is interested in participating, a Site PI, Co -I, or Site Coordinator must obtain informed consent prior to 
any screening procedures. The research protocol will be explained in detail, including all possible risks and benefits. 
During the consent process, the study coordinator or investigator probes the patient’s understanding of the 
[ADDRESS_649783] ample 
opportunity to ask questions prior to signing the consent form.  Eligible subjects will be allowed as much time as 
necessary to determine whether they  wish to participate in the study.  
3.5.2 Schedule of Study Events  
Consent will be obtained at the beginning of the Screening Visit (Visit 1).  Patients who meet eligibility criteria and 
provide informed consent will be considered enrolled and will undergo the additional screening procedures outlined 
above in Table 1, including completion of questionnaires, screening laboratory tests including hepatitis B and C 
screens and tuberculosis screening (if none in the past six months), hemoglobin A1c test only for T ype II diabetics if 
none from the past six months,  and chest x -ray without evidence of interstitial lung disease (if none in past 12 
months ). Subjects found at Screening to have active hepatitis or active infection (including tuberculosis) or 
interstitial lung dise ase will be excluded.  If  the additional required screening blood work was completed by [CONTACT_504658] 1 week of the screening visit  (see 3.4 above) , these tests do not need to be repeated. If the subject  
has been on stable methotrexate or pre dnisone  for the [ADDRESS_649784]’s  eligibility for study inclusion.  If these 
additional laboratory - and imaging -based eligibility criteria are met and eligibility is confirmed, the FDG PET/CT scan 
will be scheduled. For the FDG PET/CT , the subject will be given instructions for an ov ernight fast for the purposes of 
the PET/CT scan . If nothing is found on the FDG PET/CT that would preclude the subject from randomization , the 
subject will be randomized and a baseline visit will be conducted.   The subject  will complete additional 
questionnaires  at baseline . All subsequent study visits are performed at six week intervals and should be conducted 
within 14 days prior to or after the designated date  (calculated from the subject’s randomization date) .  Blood wi ll 
be drawn at each visit for safety monitoring; additional fasting blood specimens will be drawn at Visits 2, 3, 5 and 6 
for the research biospecimen repository.  Safety labs may be deferred in  extreme circumstances (i.e. COVID -19 
pandemic). During this p eriod when patients and clinicians are trying to minimize contact [CONTACT_504659], we will rely on site PIs ’ clinical judgement for the appropriate frequency of safety laboratory 
testing.   However, this should be no less than every six months a nd no greater than every six weeks.  A repeat FDG 
PET-CT scan will be performed between [ADDRESS_649785]  eligibility, the Site Coordinator will determine treatment assignment through a 
randomiza tion function of the electronic data capture (EDC).  Randomization will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_504660] a permuted block design.  Metrologists performing joint counts will be blinded to treatment assignment, as 
will the FDG -PET/CT imaging readers.  Laboratory staff who run bioassays on biospecimen samples will also be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  Subjects will be instructed NOT to discuss their treatment with the metrologist, 
and the metrologist will not be a part of the subject’s care team.  T he metrologist will also be instructed to remind 
the subject before each joint examination that treatment should not be discussed . In addition, the metrologist 
should not discuss treatment with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_504610] .   
3.[ADDRESS_649786] a 90% retention rate in order to meet the guidelines established by [CONTACT_18121]. Once enrolled, a proactive 
plan for retention will be implemented that includes elements such as regular phone and mailed reminders for each 
study visit, parking and me al vouchers, complimentary items such as pens and canvas totes with the study logo, birthday 
and holiday cards, etc.   Arguably, most importantly, we will train sites to follow major principles and commonly used 
strategies to maximize retention and minimiz e loss to follow -up.  These are outlined in detail in the MOOP and include 
[ADDRESS_649787] Withdrawal  
All subjects receive active therapy and the trial is relatively short in duration; thus, we anticipate few withdrawals and/or  
cross -overs.   Furthermore, the ability to titrate the regi mens will limit withdrawal and/or cross -over.   As noted above, 
great effort will be made to retain subjects  in the study.  Nonetheless, subjects  have the right to refuse treatment or 
completely withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. An explan ation of why the subject is withdrawing from 
the study should be recorded on the withdrawal eCRF. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects  from the 
study treatment in the event of AE, protocol violations, administrative reasons , or for othe r reasons. When applicable, 
subjects  should be informed of circumstances under which their participation may be terminated by [CONTACT_504661]’s consent.  Any administrative or other reasons for withdrawal must be documented and explain ed 
to the subject.  If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an adverse event, the principal specific event will  
be recorded on the CRF. The subject should be followed until the AE has resolved.  If it appears that a subject  is lost to 
follow-up, the investigator must attempt to contact [CONTACT_356967] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_756], to determine if 
any new AEs occurred, follow -up of any ongoing AE, and to establish as completely as possible the reason for the 
withdrawal.  
Study treatment  may be discontinued for any subject who experiences any of the following:  
• Extreme  laboratory value (see Section 4.5.1 Abnormal Lab Values ) 
• Malignancy other than basal or squamous cell  
• Repeated subject non -compliance or loss to follow -up. 
• The subject withdraws consent  
• The investigator or DSMB believes it is in the best interest of the subject  
• The study is terminated  
If study treatment is discontinued (e.g., for an adverse event) and there is no safety issue precluding it, the subject will 
be asked to return for the follow -up FDG PET/CT scan if he/she has received at least eight weeks of the randomized 
treatment prior to withdrawal.   
In addition, i f the subject decides to withdraw from  treatment assignment before trial completion,  the subject will be 
asked to come in for a follow -up FDG PET/CT scan within 2 weeks of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504611]. Subjects will only be asked to come for a follow -up FDG PET/CT if they have 
been  on the trial assigned treatment for at least [ADDRESS_649788] withdraws consent, all study related visits, exams, procedures  and data collection are terminated.  
3.8 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_504662].  Written notification, documenting the reason for  study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_504663], funding agency and regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_504612](s) for the 
termination or suspension.  
27 3.9 Bioethics Ancillary Study  
We will survey the TARGET investigators to determine researchers' attitudes and beliefs regarding their ethical 
obligation to return and manage incidental  research findings from whole body PET/CT imaging studies and determine 
the prevalence of incidental extra cardiac findings  in whole body PET/CT scans  in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and detection 
rate of previously unknown malignancies .  
[CONTACT_213234], a bioethic ist with training in survey methods, will develop the survey. The survey design will be created and 
informed using the existing literature, previously used surveys on incidental findings from research and in consultation 
with advisors who are Columbia Univ ersity faculty members with extensive experience with survey methods. The survey 
would include Likert scale, forced choice, rank order, and open -ended questions. The open -ended questions will provide 
participants an opportunity to provide additional inform ation that may not be adequately captured in the other 
components of the survey, and will also provide qualitative data.  
Once developed, the survey would be entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) for distribution. 
Responses will be collect ed anonymously via REDCap. All surveys will initially be distributed through email, which 
includes a link to the electronic version of the survey. If there is no response to an initial email, the participants will 
receive a total of [ADDRESS_649789]  will then return to the study site to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up the drug and complete a baseline visit. 
Subjects  will begin their treatment arm on the date of receipt of the medications.  
4.2 Description of Treatment Medications  
A brief description of each of the study medications (all of which, as noted above, are FDA approved) is provided below.  
More detailed descriptions of each drug are provided in th e following links to the FDA approved package inserts:  
1) Adalimumab: http://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/humira.pdf  
2) Etanercept: http:/ /pi.amgen.com/united_states/enbrel/derm/enbrel_pi.pdf  
3) Sulfasalazine: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=524  
4) Hydroxychloroquine: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/009768s041lbl.pdf  
5) Leflunomide: http://products.sanofi.us/arava/arava.html  
6) Methotrexate Injection : http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/011719s117lbl.pdf  
7) Methotrexate tablets: http://www.rheumatrex.info/pdf/RheumatrexPackageInsert.pdf  
 
Etanercept.    The standard dose of etanercept is [ADDRESS_649790] be refrigerate d. 
Sulfasalazine .   SSZ is formulated as tablets for oral use. Maximum dosing is usually 1500 mg bid. Patients with Sulfa 
allergies or G6PD deficiency should not be prescribed this medication  and are excluded from the study . 
Hydroxychloroquine.   The approved dose of HCQ is either 200 mg once daily or twice daily. HCQ dose shall not 
exceed 6.5 mg/kg to conform to current guidelines for retinal safety.   The most recent recommendations from the 
American Academy of Ophthalmology advise a baseline screening examination within the first twelve months of 
treatment115.   
Leflunomide.  Leflunomide is approved at doses of [ADDRESS_649791] common effective do se. 
4.3 Treatment Algorithm  
• See Figure 2  
 
Subjects randomized to the TNFi treatment arm will (based on randomization) receive either etanercept 50 mg SC 
weekly or adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week ( in addition to  concomitant MTX  and HCQ for subjects who ent ered 
the study on HCQ ).  Subjects  will continue the same dose of their concomitant background MTX  and HCQ, if applicable .  
If the subject’s CDAI score is greater than [ADDRESS_649792] for this trial. Subjects  who initially started etanercept will be 
switched to adalimumab 40 mg SQ every other week. Subjects  who initially started adalimumab will be switched to 
entanercept 50  mg S Q weekly.   Subjects  will remain on this new medication until the end of the study.  
Subjects assigned to the triple therapy arm will begin SSZ 500 mg bid and HCQ 200 mg twice daily, not to exceed 
6.5mg/kg HCQ (in addition to concomitant MTX). Subject s who enter the study on HCQ at a dose <200mg BID and are 
randomized to triple therapy will increase their dose to 200 mg BID HCQ, provided this new dose does not exceed 
6.5mg/kg . At 6 weeks, SSZ will be increased to 1 g bid for all subjects . If the subjec t’s CDAI score is greater than 10 a t 18 
weeks, a good treatment response116 has not been achieved,  and MTX will be switched to leflunomide 20 mg daily. The 
participant will remain on leflunomide (and concomitant SSZ + HCQ) for the remaining six weeks of the study.  
4.4 Concomitant Medications  
4.4.1  Corticosteriods  
Patien ts who are not receiving corticosteroids and those receiving low dose steroids ( ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent) will be considered eligible for the study provided other entry criteria are met.  Excessive dosages of 
steroids may suppress vascular FD G uptake independently of the randomized treatment. Prednisone (or equivalent) 
doses  should not be altered by [CONTACT_726] ±3.0 mg during the six months of the study . Two intra -articular injections 
of <40 mg triamcinolone (or equivalent) will be allowed durin g the study, but cannot be  within one month of the 
second FDG PET/CT at the final  visit.   No oral corticosteroid “bursts” will be allowed unless there is reason that an 
intra -articular injection is impossible. If a burst is required, it can be no more than 10mg per day (pr ednisone 
equivalent) at maximum  and no longer tha  
n 14 days in duration before returning to +/ - 3 mg of the original dose (or no use) . Corticosteroid bursts  cannot occur 
within one month of e ither of the FDG PET/CT scans.  
29 4.4.2  Statins  & PCSK9 Inhibitors  
High-intensity statins  and PCSK9 inhibitors  have been shown to reduce arterial FDG uptake52.  Therefore, patients 
who have been treated with a high -intensity  statin or a PCSK9 inhibitor in the past  [ADDRESS_649793] on arterial FDG  uptake due to initiation or dose change of a low-dose statin. 
Patients likely to need a statin  or PCSK9 inhibitor  (e.g., insulin -dependent or uncontrolled diabetics and those with 
prior clinical CV events) are excluded from participatio n. Initiation of  statins  or PCSK9 inhibitors  should be avoided if 
at all possible during the six month study period.  If this is not deemed safe by [CONTACT_504664] (Drs.  Tawakol and Ridker),  then the subject will be asked to come in for a 
follow -up FDG PET/CT before a statin  or PCSK9 inhibitor  is initiated . Subjects must have been  on study treatment for  
at least  8 weeks in order for the FDG PET/CT to take place. If the subject has been on stu dy treatment for less than [ADDRESS_649794] initiates 
a statin  or PCSK9 inhibitor  before  a follow -up FDG PET/CT takes place, the subject will be dropped from the trial 
without follow -up imaging.  This information will be included in the primary trial analysis.  
4.5 Medication Monitoring  
Two study investigators will take primary responsibility for Medication Monitoring (Drs. Liao and Giles).  Both are board 
certified rhe umatologists with experience using all of the study drugs.  The ongoing integrity of the Medication 
Monitoring program will be assured by [CONTACT_6283]. Liao and Gil es.  In addition, one of the two will always be on call to assist 
sites with medication related quest ions or concerns regarding side effects.   A complete list of potential side effects can 
be found in the package inserts.  
Per the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of RA4, we will obtain complete blood count, 
liver panel and basic met abolic panel on all subjects  at six week intervals.  Subjects will be instructed to bring in 
medication bottles to review medication adherence with site coordinators.  Safety monitoring for each of the prescribed 
medications is well understood by [CONTACT_504665] g rheumatologists as these medications have been on the market for over a 
decade (TNFi’s) or for several decades (SSZ and HCQ).  Since this treatment study utilizes usual and approved 
medications  for RA , standards of monitoring are well understood by [CONTACT_941] t reating rheumatologists. If the study physician 
determines that a significant medication related toxicity has occurred, the drug can be temporarily withheld and 
restarted at the same or lower dose.  If the toxicity recurs, the medication will be discontinu ed or the dose further 
lowered.  If the medication is discontinued, the subject  will be treated with the next drug listed in the treatment 
algorithm (Figure 2).  See Section 4.5.1 for guidelines regarding adjustment of study medication doses due to lab 
abnormalities.   In the case of the TNFi’s, etanercept can be switched to adalimumab and vice versa.  In the case of triple 
therapy, if one of the medications has to be discontinued, leflunomide [ADDRESS_649795] been on methotrexate and tolerated it.  Thus, abnormalities in laboratory values 
outlined in the Table below will initially be assumed secondary to sulfasalazine in the triple therapy arm.  As noted 
below in Table 3,  two leve ls of laboratory abnormalities will be defined – caution and extreme  values. Caution 
values will prompt re -testing in two weeks.  If caution values persist, the total daily SSZ dose will be reduced by 500 
mg and labs retested in two weeks; testing every tw o weeks will be continued and SSZ adjusted as needed until 
values normalize.  If they do not normalize, then other factors including methotrexate will be assessed. Extreme  
values will prompt a temporary stop of sulfasalazine with re -testing at two weeks an d be reported as an adverse 
event. If values remain in the extreme  range on re -testing the subject will be withdrawn from the study. If extreme  
values  improve  to the caution range, then sulfasalazine  will be resumed at a dose 500 mg lower than the previous 
dose and re -tested in two weeks .

4.5.2  Surgery or Infection  
The following guidelines apply for subjects undergoing surgery during the course of the trial:  
 
Emergency surgery  Temporary stop of study medications during surgery and during the 
post-operative period or until subject  is clinically stable and off 
antibiotics  
Planned surgery  Temporary stop of study medications for at least one week prior to 
surgery and during the pos t-operative period or until subject  is 
clinically stable and off antibiotics.  
 
 
The following guidelines apply for subjects experiencing infection during the course of the trial:  
 
Acute infections  Hold study medications during the antibiotic course  
Chronic infections  These subjects would be excluded, except if the chronic infection is 
diagnosed during the trial. If infection is diagnosed during the trial, 
then the risks and benefits of continuing trial treatment would be 
weighed on a case -by-case bas is. 
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_649796]’s  RA history and of CV risk factors will be ascertained at 
the Screening and Ba seline visits.  Subsequent visits will be conducted every six weeks to assess safety and to 
determine whether a chan ge in medication is indicated.  Medication adherence will also be assessed using subject  
self-report and pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. Relevant study procedu res and definitions are described below.  
4.6.2 Joint Count  
Assessment of the number of painful and swollen joints by a trained joint count assessor (an investigator or a 
trained research coordinator/nurse) is a standard element of all RA trials and of rhe umatology clinical practice.  Each 
of 44 joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_18246], hips, knees, ankles, MTPs) will be examined for tenderness 
(subject  ‘yes’ or ‘no’) and swelling (metrologist ‘yes’ or ‘no’).  Although 44 joints will be examined, only 28 joints 
(shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_18246], knee) are used to define the DAS -28 score (see below) and CDAI and will be 
used to calculate  the EULAR ‘good’ response (see below).  The information of all [ADDRESS_649797] in comparing clinically -defined level of joint disease activity vs level of FDG -PET/ CT-defined joint 
disease activity.   
31 4.6.3 RA Disease Activity  
The ‘DAS’ (Disease Activity Measure) is a combined index to assess disease activity in RA117 and is used routinely in 
clinical trials and  clinical practice.  It combines information from swollen joints, tender joints, the acute phase 
response (measured either by [CONTACT_504666]), and general health into one continuous 
measure.  A modification of this measure is the DAS -28 which includes only 28 of the total peripheral joints 
(shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_504613]) and correlates well with assessments of more  joints118.   We will 
calculate the DAS -28-CRP at screening . During follow -up visits we will calculate disease activity using the Clinical 
Disease Activity Index (CDAI)120 to evaluate treatment response. Good treatment response will be determined as 
CDAI ≤ 10, corresponding to low disease activity or remission120. 
4.6.[ADDRESS_649798]  has no self -reported, physician diagnosed prior clinical 
CV events. These include history of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, heart failure, prior vascular procedure  
(coronary artery angioplasty or stenting, carotid endarterectomy, coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], peripheral 
revascularization ).  In addition, patients with diabetes or fasting blood glucose >12 6mg/dl  or non -fasting blood 
glucose >200mg/dl , and subjects  who  are currently or within the past [ADDRESS_649799] been treated with  high -
intensity statins or PCSK9 inhibitors are excluded.  Once a patient is enrolled, the following conventional CV risk 
factors will also be assessed:  1) at each visit - blood pressure , serum glucose; 2) at the Baseline Visit – detailed 
smoking history, subject  reported history of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (if on a high -intensity statin for this, subject  would have 
been excluded), physical activity, menopausal state, family history of heart diseas e, anthropomorphic 
measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumference).   
4.6.5 Laboratory Procedures  
Screening labs (listed in Table 1) will be either performed at the study visit or abstracted from previous medical 
records if available  and perform ed within the specified timeframe (see  Section 3.5.2 Schedule of Study Procedures) .  
Follow -up labs for medication safety monitoring will be performed at each visit , unless they are deferred in extreme 
circumstances (i.e. COVID -19 pandemic), in which case site PIs should use clinical judgement for the appropriate 
frequency of safety laboratory testing.   However, this should be no less than every six months and no greater than 
every six weeks .  Additional blood will be drawn for research (biomarker) purposes  at the  Baseline visit and at Visits 
2, 3, 5 and 6; these will be collected in the fasting state.  If samples collected for research are determined to be non -
testable directly after their collection, the subject will be asked to come back in to have the res earch blood re -drawn 
as close to the original draw date as possible. Subjects must provide verbal consent for the re -draw.    
Usual care safety laboratory measures at each visit are:  complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), 
hepatic panel.  Sites may choose to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) if available, which includes 
both a BMP and LFTs.  
Research laboratory measures.   At the completion of the study, several analytes will be measured in the Harvard 
CTSA lab on batched subject  samples from visits 2, 3, 5, and  6. These include rheumatoid factor (RF), anti -cyclic 
citrullinated peptide antibody (anti -CCP), high sensitivity CRP, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total -, LDL -, HDL -cholesterol and triglycerides), 
and insulin and glucose.  The latter two analy tes will be used to assess level of insulin resistance. Measurement of 
these values in our research lab will ensure assay consistency across sites and subjects .   
Research Biorepository. Whole blood will be sent directly from Clinical Sites to the BWH Bior epository. Sites that 
have processing capabilities, will processes some blood on site which will be sent frozen to the BWH Biorepository.  
Aliquots of sera and plasma will be processed  at the Biorepository from the whole blood  and stored for the above 
research laboratory measures and for potential Ancillary Studies.  These samples will be frozen in 1 ml aliquots and 
32 stored at -80C. Samples frozen at sites will also be stored by [CONTACT_504667]. All biospecimen  
procurem ent and processing will be overseen by [CONTACT_504668] (see 
Resources) and all aliquots samples will be stored, labeled and inventoried at this facility.  A Laboratory Manual for 
the clinical sites will be prepa red to ensure uniform and high quality preparation of the samples for mailing.  The 
Biorepository will perform routine quality control on the freezers to ensure temperature control, back -up power, 
back -up cooled freezers in the event of power outage. The B iorepository will also be responsible for retrieving and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_504614] (e.g., to the Harvard CTSA and to Crescendo 
Biosciences).  
4.6.6 FDG PET/CT Scan  
The FDG PET/CT scans will assess arterial FDG uptake i n the ascending aorta and in the bilateral carotid arteries.  
Subjects  will undergo FDG -PET/CT scans at baseline and between 24 and 36 weeks at their local facility.  A detailed 
protocol prepared by [CONTACT_504669] (Drs. Tawakol and Fayad) is a vailable as Appendix B.   The 
procedure is summarized briefly here and is identical for the baseline and the follow -up scans.    Subjects  will fast for 
10 hours the night before each of the two PET/CT scans and will abstain from carbohydrates, dairy, and f ruit/candy 
at their last meal.  The allowable foods after 5PM are limited to meat/fish/soy, eggs, green vegetables, cheese, 
water/coffee/tea (no milk, sugar).  A serum glucose will be obtained at the imaging site prior to the scan and must 
be <150 mg/dL to  proceed; if ≥150 mg/dL  but <170 mg/d L, the serum glucose can be repeated in an hour to see if it 
is <150 mg/dL , if still ≥150 mg/dL  the scan should be canceled & rescheduled as appropriate ; if ≥[ADDRESS_649800] may unmask 
undiagnosed diabetes which is an exclusion criterion for TARGET (A persistently elevated glucose indicative of newly 
diagnosed diabetes, coupled with the exclusion from undergoing  the P ET/CT scan, would make these subjects  
ineligible for the TARGET study).  
If the subject’s  glucose is < 150 mg/dL, he/she then receives the FDG injection and waits [ADDRESS_649801]  will sit quietly in the imaging waiting room (or other suitable nearby [CONTACT_37264]) 
and limit muscle activity during this time.  The subject  will empty the ir bladder just before the scan is performed . At 
[ADDRESS_649802] is 
performed ( Chest CT Scan and Chest PET Scan  in the imaging protocol); this is followed by [CONTACT_504670] ( Neck CT Scan and Neck PET Scan ); this is followed by [CONTACT_504671] ( Whole Body CT Scan and Whole Body PET Scan ). 
Sites will be r equired to perform a wet read after each  FDG -PET/CT scan to look for any inc idental findings of 
concern. This should be performed as soon as possible after the completion of the FDG -PET/CT.  Sites will be 
required to report that this read took place and will need to report any findings of concern to the coordinating 
center via the EDC.  Randomization will not take place until the wet read has been completed and it  is confirmed that 
the subject can safely be randomized.   
5. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
5.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical o ccurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal 
sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the sub ject’s participation in the research.  
5.1 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
33 • Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes li sted in this definition.  
5.2 Relationship of an Adverse Event to Study Intervention  
To assess the relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used:  
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite)  
a. The event is known to occur with t he study intervention.  
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.  
d. The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention.  
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
b. An alternate etiology has been established  
5.4 Severity of an Adverse Event  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
1. Mild: no intervention required;  no impact on activities of daily living (ADL)  
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL  
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical attention, needs major 
assistance wi th ADL.  
 
5.5 Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described 
in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characte ristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_504672]); and  
34 • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
5.6 Reporting of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse  Events, and Unanticipated Problems   
The DCC and Administrative Core will submit to the central IRB all adverse events. All adverse events that are 
unanticipated and related or possibly related to the research will be reported promptly to the BWH IRB.  Sit es will be 
responsible for reporting all events to the coordinating center via the EDC. Adverse events that are anticipated or 
unrelated will be reported to the BWH central IRB at the time of continuing review for all sites relying on the Partners 
HealthCa re central IRB.  Participants that sign a consent form will be considered enrolled until their participation is 
terminated or they withdraw consent. AEs will be reported on all those enrolled .  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, relatedness, or if they meet the definition for 
unanticipated problems) must be reported to the DSMB Safety Officer, and the NIAMS through KAI within 48 hours of 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_504615]. The report should include a description of the eve nt, as well as the 
Investigator’s assessment of expectedness, relatedness and other information, as relevant.  Any action taken by [CONTACT_504673]. The DSMB Safety Officer will be provided with this information but 
will provide an independent assessment on attribution and expectedness, as well as whether further action is 
recommended (e.g. collection of follow up information).  
Anticipated adverse events are specified on the package inserts of all study drugs. Those ad verse events that occur, 
which are not specified on the package inserts, will be considered unanticipated problems and will require reporting to 
the coordinating center and the IRB.   
Sites using their local institutional IRBs will submit AE reports to the EDC, but must also report AEs to their own IRB 
according to institutional policies. Sites using the central IRB should adhere to the reporting timelines as follows:  
Reports for unanticipated adverse events are to be submitted within 5 working days/[ADDRESS_649803] becomes aware of the problem. Initial reports for SAEs should be submitted within 24 hours of initial 
awareness of the event, with a complete report to follow within 7 calendar days of initial awareness.  
All AEs (anticipated and unanticipated) will be collected, analyzed, and monitored by [CONTACT_504674], which will also be used to generate the AE tracking log. AEs and/or extreme  ‘value laboratory 
abnormalities identified in the protoco l as critical to participant safety must be reported. All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_504675]. The site staff 
will record all reportable events with start date s occu rring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -
serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will  
inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Even ts will be followed for outcome information until 
resolution or stabilization.  
Some incidental findings are likely to be identified in the PET/CT scans, or at other points throughout the study.  Sites 
will be required to have an on -site radiology interpre tation of the scan as soon as possible  for safety purposes.  The Site 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_504616]’s primary care physician.  If the 
incidental finding is of an immediate nature (a medical emergency th at requires immediate notification) such as 
suspected malignancy, notification to the primary care physician should occur within 24 hours of the availability of the 
on-site radiology report; urgent findings (abnormalities that require medical attention but  not on an emergency basis) 
should be reported within 7 business days to the primary care physician. The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_504617] e participant 
from the study.   Incidental findings will only be recorded as AEs in the data collection system if they are considered to 
be related to study treatment . 
35 The following delineates specific responsibilities of staff members:   
• The Site Research Coordinator  will complete the Adverse Event Form (and Unanticipated 
Problems on the corresponding form) in the EDC; assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_504618], and assist them to prepare SAE reports to IRB and/or the Safety Off icer. 
 
• The Site Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_504619]; be available to answer any questions that the coordinators may have 
concerning AEs; assist the DCC and Administrative Core to notify the IRB, and/or the DSMB  of all 
SAEs and AEs as appropriate. If the originating site is using their institutional IRB, the site will be 
responsible for submitting the adverse event report according to institutional policies, with 
assistance from the D CC and Administrative Core as needed.  
 
• The DCC and Administrative Core Staff  will confirm that the AEs are correctly entered into the 
EDC. They will confirm that the adverse events are consistent with the source documents and are 
reported to the appropriat e regulatory bodies, as required. If the originating site is using the central 
IRB, the DCC and Administrative Core will submit the adverse event report to the central IRB.  
Additionally, the DSMB will receive safety tables every 6 months during the study period that 
include AE and SAE reports.  
 
6. TRAINING AND MONITORING OF SITES  
6.1 Training of Site Investigators and Staff for the Study Protocol  
Site training will be done by [CONTACT_504676]. All sites will be required to complete a  set of training modules  prior to 
recruitment , on the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: Introduction  to the Study, Study Protocol, Study Recruitment and Consent, Study 
Drugs, the EDC, Imaging Protocol, Joint Assessments, Labs, Monitoring and Reporting, and Abnormal Situations. All of 
these modules will be  delivered  as live webinars.  Each webinar will be recorded and available for download from the 
trial website . Study coordinator s must attend or view all of the modules.  Site PIs and co -investigators will need to view 
several modules , including : Introduct ion to the Study, Study Protocol, Monitoring and Reporting, and Abnormal 
Situations. At the webinars,  key components of the trial design and implementation will be presented, and site staff will 
have the opportunity to ask questions.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_504620], recruitment, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, EDC training  and joint co unt assessment .  Sites will also receive additional individualized 
support while enrolling their first participants in the form of frequent phone calls from Central staff as well as the 
opportunity to complete the first visits while central staff are on th e phone to answer any questions. DCC staff will also 
be available for personal site training on the EDC as needed and to answer questions as they arise.  
The investigators and all staff involved in the study will have completed their required Collaborative IRB Training 
Initiative (CITI). Each study staff member will be trained in the protocol and specific procedures for each study visit by 
[CONTACT_30967]. New study staff members will be trained on the protocol and, if necessary, spend a visit 
shadow ing another trained staff member before carrying out protocol tasks on their own.    Prior to conducting subject  
visits, investigators will be asked to sign off that the site staff members have been appropriately trained in the study 
protocol.  
Training an d delegation of responsibility will be documented in the Delegation of Responsibility Log  and tracked via the 
trial website (where the training modules will be posted) . 
36 6.2 Training for Electronic Data Capture  
One of the key t raining modules will focus on use of the EDC.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_58367]:  
• Appropriate use of credentials to log -in  
• EDC security  
• Navigating the EDC  
• Recording information on the eCRFs  
• Screening  
• Enrollment and Baseline  
• Randomization  
• Concomitant Medication  
• Follow -up Visits  
• Source documentat ion 
• Submitting adverse event reports  
• Revising data and audit trails  
 
Additional one -on-one training will be provided to sites on an as -needed basis, as well as guidance for each site to get 
registered on the EDC.  
The EDC also includes an online EDC Manual,  which provide s information on EDC functions as well as additional 
documentation for the study forms. These will be available to study staff when logged into the EDC system.  
6.[ADDRESS_649804] will be appropriately trained 
by [CONTACT_504677] (in the imaging protocol also called the Icahn School of Medicine -[LOCATION_005] Ge neral Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504621] -MGH Imaging core (IMIC)) on all relevant aspects of this study prior to scanning study subjects. The site Imaging 
Centers are also encouraged to identify a back -up technologist who will undergo the same training. The Imaging Core 
will require PET/CT Technologists to participate in training via webinar prior to the initiation of the study. All study 
coordinators will be required to complete a training module about the imaging that will provide important information 
they will need to conv ey to the patient about scan day . Additional Investigators Site personnel will also be invited and 
are encouraged to attend the training session.  
Training will be held via online webinar.  The Imaging Core will provide login information prior to all training sessions.  
Additionally, each Site Imaging Center will be required to submit image sets of standardized PET/CT phantoms prior to 
approval for imaging.  Initial phantom data will undergo a preliminary quality control (QC) review by [CONTACT_504678], that both PET and CT series are present, and the images 
appear to be of acceptable quality.  This will ensure correct application of training principles.  
A protocol for the FDG PET/CT is provide d in Appendix  B. 
6.[ADDRESS_649805] that a site provide additional documentation and regulatory files. This documentation will 
be mailed, or faxed by [CONTACT_379918].  
The DCC will be able to track a site’s progress via the EDC. Should a site consiste ntly deviate from the protocol or not 
perform to a sufficient level, the DCC will  recommend intervention by [CONTACT_370999].  The Administrative Core 
will investigate the source of the deviations, and will provide additional training or coaching as  needed, as well as decide 
to drop an enrollment site if necessary .  While existing enrollment sites may be dropped for substandard performance, 
new enrollment sites may be added during the course of the study.  Many of the investigator trainings will be r ecorded, 
and the Administrative Core will facilitate support for one -on-one site trainings as needed.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_649806] 
immediate access to all data that is entered on the EDC, and will be alerted to any issues, including the ones listed 
below:  
• Non -compliance with protocol  
• Missing data  
• Out-of-range data  
• Out-of-window visits  
• Data clarification  
• Consistent and logical dates over time  
• All fields of a "completed form" actually completed or reason for no data noted  
• All required forms completed or reason for no data noted  
• Data consistent across forms and visits  
 
The DCC will provide regular  protocol adherence and data monitoring reports to the Administrative Core, and the 
Administrative Core will pursue corrective action from sites as needed.  As well, the EDC will be developed in such a 
way that sites will be alerted to correct out of range values or missing data as they are entering it, th ereby [CONTACT_504679].  
6.5.2  Imaging Sites  
In addition to the initial quality check of phantom images used to train and certify imaging sites, the imaging core 
has a well developed and successful protocol for monitoring im age quality.  Details are provided in the imaging 
protocol (Appendix B).  Briefly,  upon receipt of PET/CT images to the Imaging Core within 1 day of image acquisition 
(via FTP transfer), a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) confirms image set completeness a nd proper 
labeling/anonymizaton.  Quality control (QC) is performed to verify that the image acquisition guidelines were 
followed.  If the CRA identifies an artifact that could impair the ability to interpret images, the Site Imaging Center is 
notified of actions that need to  be taken.   The Site is required to resolve the query and/or send the 
38 missing/discrepant information to the Imaging Core within two business days.  Once resolved, an Acceptance 
Notification is issued.  Any deviation from the protocol, or change in parameters, must be pre -approved by [CONTACT_504680].  
 
The FDG PET/CT and image reader case report forms (CRF) will be used to assess adherence to the imaging protocol.  
These data include:  a) tr acer circulation time; b) intra -subject difference in circulation time (between scans); c) 
fasting blood glucose; d) injected minus residual FDG activity; e) scanner used; f) arm position; g) reconstruction 
method; h) time per bed position; i) acquisition mode; j) slice thickness.   
 
Image Quality will be graded as excellent, marginal , and unacceptable. Data analysis will be performed first on data 
derived from excellent quality scan only, then excellent and marginal quality scans combined.  
7. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
7.1 Primary and Secondary Objectives  
The primary objec tive is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of TNFi + MTX ± HCQ versus triple therapy in 
subjects  with RA who are inadequate responders to MTX using FDG -PET/CT as a tool for detecting vascular (arterial) 
inflammation.  
The secondary objective is to compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving low disease activity or 
remission (LDAR) versus moderate -high disease activity (MHDA).  
The exploratory objective of the TARGET Bioethics Ancillary study is to gather  data on research ers’ attitudes and beliefs 
regarding incidental findings and the prevalence of incidental findings from whole body FDG PET/CT in RA.  
 
The exploratory objective of the Neuroimaging Measures Ancillary Study  is to investigate associations between stress -
asso ciated neurobiological activity and articular and arterial treatment response in RA.    
7.[ADDRESS_649807] on FDG PET/CT (TARGET) trial is to test whether treatment 
with a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) in additio n to methotrexate (MTX) with or without concomitant HCQ (only for subjects 
entering the study on concomitant HCQ) among RA subjects who are inadequate responders to MTX reduces 
cardiovascular inflammation compared to triple therapy (MTX+SSZ+HCQ) as measured by [CONTACT_504681] -to-background ratio (TBR) of FDG uptake  at the [ADDRESS_649808] diseased segment (MDS) 
identified at baseline.  
The primary hypothesis is that TNFi  +MTX  + HCQ (only for subjects entering the study on concomitant HCQ) will 
reduce  vascular  inflammation  to a greater extent than triple therapy when measured at [ADDRESS_649809] whether the follow -up value  in cardiovascular inflammation is 
correlated with measures of disease progression. The markers of disease progression include: 1) disease activity as 
measured by [CONTACT_311972]28 -CRP score, with achievement of low disease activity or remission considered to be a D AS28 -CRP 
score of less than 3.2 at the 6 -month follow -up (all participants enter the trial with a DAS28 above 3.2); 2) a 
commercially available MBDA (Vectra -DA) which will be measured at baseline and 6 months; and 3) joint inflammation 
defined as the avera ge standardized uptake value (by [CONTACT_38967]/CT) in the same joints used in the calculation of the DAS -
28,  and measured at baseline and 6 months using the images collected for the primary endpoint as described in the 
Imaging Section.  
39 The secondary hypotheses  are as follows:  
• We hypothesize that subjects in  DAS-[ADDRESS_649810] less vascular inflammation than 
those with persistent  MHDA.  
• We hypothesize that subjects in  Vectra DA -defined  LDAR at [ADDRESS_649811] less vascular inflammation th an 
those with persistent MHDA .   
• We hypothesize that  subjects in articular FDG defined LDAR at [ADDRESS_649812] less vascular  inflammation 
than those with persistent MHDA.   We will also compare the correlations of the articular FDG uptake and DAS -
28 with  vascular inflammation to determine if they are independen t. 
• We hypothesize that the exploratory objective of the TARGET Bioethics Ancillary study will help develop clear 
policies and procedures for reporting and managing incidental findings in imaging res earch, refine the informed 
consent process and standardize reporting, evaluation, and follow up of incidental imaging findings.  
• We hypothesize that the h igher levels of stress -associated neurobological  activity, measured objectively as 
rAmygA, associate with a blunted response to RA immunomodulatory treatment in the joints and 
vasculature as assessed with measures of articular response (i.e. patient self -assessment and change 
in joint counts) and object ively with change in articular and arterial FDG uptake.   
• We hypothesize that t he link between stress and blunted response will be reflected in enhanced hematopoietic 
tissue activity in the bone marrow , and in circulating inflammatory biomarkers.  
 
7.3 Study De sign  
TARGET is a randomized, open -label, multi -center trial.  Eligible participants will be randomly allocated, 1:1, to TNFi + 
MTX + HCQ (only for subjects entering the study on concomitant HCQ) or triple therapy. Baseline imaging will be done at 
the time of randomization and subjects will be followed for 6 months, at which time the follow -up imaging will be done.  
TARGET Investigators will be surveyed via a REDCap link regarding their attitudes and beliefs surrounding the return of 
incidental findings from whole body PET/CT scans ..  
7.4 Number of Subjects  
We plan to randomize  200 participants to achieve an effective sample size of 170 people with complete follow -up and 
measurements of both the baseline and 6 -month MDS TBRmax . We estimate over 90% power to detect  a difference of 
0.15 in 6-month M DS meanmax TBR between the two arms , even allowing for a 10% dropout rate.  A between group 
difference of 0.[ADDRESS_649813] if the between group difference were 0.17 and 
there was a 10% crossover rate.  
Sample size and power were calculated using several alternative scenarios for dropout rates and cross over.  All cross 
over was assumed to be from the triple therapy arm into the TNFi  arm and these participants would be included in the 
main intention -to-treat analysis set under their assigned treatment group. Drop outs consist of participants for whom 
imaging results were unavailable at the baseline or 6 -month timepoint. These particip ants would be unable to 
contribute to the analysis and would directly reduce the sample size available. Previous data in the RA population found 
a baseline MDS meanmax TBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.46 reduction after 8 weeks of a TNFi  (correlation of 0. 5 
between baseline and 8 weeks) .  
The method that we intend to use for our primary analysis is an ANCOVA model estimating the final index vessel MDS 
meanmax TBR as a function of baseline index vessel MDS meanmax TBR and treatment group. The resulting treat ment 
group coefficient will then estimate the change in MDS meanmax TBR associated with treatment assignment after 
adjusting for baseline differences.  
Power for the ANCOVA analysis was calculated using the sampsi function in Stata. This function uses the method laid out 
[ADDRESS_649814] included the 
result s in the Tables 4A and 4B below.

Power for the secondary aims  
The secondary  aim compares [ADDRESS_649815] for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics related to LDAR achievement (age, 
gender, disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and treatment assi gnment.  Assuming  30% reaching LDAR in 
both groups111-113, and the param eters of MDS meanmax TBR from Aim [ADDRESS_649816] 90% power to detect an absolute difference between 
those reaching LDAR and those n ot of 0.18  in MDS meanmax TBR with a dropout rate of up to 10% ; this would be

Reports of adverse events by [CONTACT_504682] 6 months.  We will also present frequency analyses for withdraw als and compliance 
with protocol.  
7.7 Analysis Methods  
Aim 1:  
The main analysis for Aim [ADDRESS_649818] of any missing d ata will also be done using the 
same assigned treatment categories, but using all randomized participants with [multiple imputations using a Markov 
chain Monte Carlo technique119. We anticipate few missing data because: 1) adequate staff (2 Research Assistants) in the 
Administrative Core will closely monitor weekly data entry; 2) 24 -week trial allows for detectio n of significant 
differences in vascular FDG PET/CT but will reduce drop -out that may occur in a longer trial; 3) recruitment of 
experienced sites with site coordinators; 4) providing transportation reimbursement to subjects whenever necessary; 
and 5) prov iding reminder mailing cards to sites to send to subjects.  2 secondary analyses were added based on 
reviewers’ comments: excluding subjects who escalated dosing; and, in an exploratory secondary analysis, we will 
compare the 6-month MDS  meanmax  TBR betwee n adalimumab and etanercept users.  
 
42 Sample Size:  Power to detect alternate absolute differences in 6 month MDS 
mean max  TBR is presented in Figure 2  for a study with 100 participants in 
each arm (200 total randomized  target).  Previous data in RA pts found a 
baseline MDS meanmax TBR of 2.51 (SD of 0.33) and a 0.[ADDRESS_649819] e size of 170 (200 -30; 15% drop -out or cross -over), 
the proposed trial has a 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 
0.[ADDRESS_649820] 
observed in the prior study by [CONTACT_504683] -Petaja for TNFi’s62.  It would be a 
clinically important difference, on the same order for what was observed 
between a low -dose statin an d a high -dose statin52, a contrast with known 
clinical significance53. [Power will be sufficient for secondary endpoints.  The pre -specified secondary analysis focusing 
on approximately 75% of subjects remain on the original drug dosages will include an estimated [ADDRESS_649821] 90% power to de tect a difference of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR.  Since these are pre -specified secondary 
endpoints, p -values will not be adjusted. ] 
Aim 2a:  
This aim compares [ADDRESS_649822] 
for baseline MDS meanmax TBR as well as other baseline characteristics related to LDAR achievement (age, gender, 
disease duration, smoking status, serologic status) and treatment assi gnment.  Using a conservative estimate of 30% 
reaching LDAR in both groups111-113, and an effective sample size of 170, we ran a t -test of [ADDRESS_649823] 90% power to detec t an absolute difference between 
those reaching LDAR and those not of 0.19 in MDS meanmax TBR; this difference would be clinically significant based on 
the aforementioned statin study52. 
Aims 2b and 2c:  These exploratory aims will examine the relationship between the Vectra -DA and articular FDG uptake 
(respectively), and 6 -month change in arterial MDS meanmax TBR. The analytic strategies will be very similar to Aim 2a.  
Relationships betwe en Vectra -DA disease activity categories and articular FDG PET/CT disease activity and 6 -month 
change in MDS meanmax TBR will be analyzed similar to Aim 2a.  The statistical power for Aims 2b and 2c will be very 
similar to Aim 2a.  Exploratory analyses wil l examine: 1) alternative thresholds for disease activity using the Vectra -DA 
and articular FDG PET/CT; 2) using the Vectra -DA and articular FDG PET/CT as continuous measures; and 3) including the 
Vectra -DA and articular FDG PET/CT continuous measures as c ovariates in the ANCOVA conducted for Aim 2a.  
7.[ADDRESS_649824] study forms will be completed using an EDC system that is managed by [CONTACT_15791].  The EDC system is a web -
based software application where all study data from sites will be recor ded, managed, and stored.  Data will be 
collected by [CONTACT_67432], where possible, entered directly into the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) 
housed on the EDC.  When data are first recorded through the EDC, the EDC record shall serve as the so urce 
document.  The eCRFs will replace traditional paper CRFs, and should be used to capture data for all enrolled 
subjects. This model has been used in other trials and has resulted in low rates of data errors and protocol 
violations, and rapid resolution  of problems. The EDC will be hosted and maintained by [CONTACT_504684] (ScienceTRAX, 
Macon, GA).   In addition to security procedures including encryption, prevention of data corruption and multiple 
secure backups, the EDC will be FDA regulation [ADDRESS_649825] iant. 
Figure 2: Statistical power  estimate
[ADDRESS_649826], the EDC will track 
changes and create an audit trail for each pi[INVESTIGATOR_83131].  The Delegation of Responsibility Log will  be maintained 
through the EDC, and it will be used to designate roles and access for each study staff member.  
 
All study records will be retained for seven years (or longer if required by [CONTACT_50810]).  
 
7.8.2 Imaging Data  
Imaging data will be managed by [CONTACT_504685].  Imaging data will be  transferred to the Imaging Core over a 
secure FTP server.  All images will be  assigned a unique ID number and are anonymized at the Site Imaging Centers.  
Details are provided in the Imaging Protocol ( Appendix B). 
7.[ADDRESS_649827] of any missing data will also be done using the  
same assigned treatment categories, but using all randomized participants with all missing baseline values set to the trial 
average and all missing change values set to zero (or no change).   We anticipate few missing data because: 1) adequate 
staff (2 Res earch Assistants) in the Administrative Core will closely monitor weekly data entry ; 2) 24 -week trial allows 
for detection of significant differences in vascular FDG PET/CT but will reduce drop -out that may occur in a longer trial; 
3) recruitment of exper ienced sites with site coordinators; 4) providing transportation reimbursement to subjects 
whenever necessary; and 5) providing reminder mailing cards to sites to send to subjects.  
 
7.10 Bioethics Ancillary  
We will survey the TARGET investigators to determine r esearchers' attitudes and beliefs regarding their ethical 
obligation to return and manage incidental research findings from whole body PET/CT imaging studies and determine 
the prevalence of incidental research findings on whole body FDG PET/CT imaging in r heumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
detection rate of previously unknown malignancies. There is a lack of information available on researchers’ attitudes 
[ADDRESS_649828] ate of the art 
imaging studies, such as whole body FDG PET/CT in those without known malignancy, and to our knowledge, no such 
information available in rheumatology. The Treatments Against RA and Effect on FDG PET/CT (TARGET) study provides 
an unprecedente d and unique opportunity to examine the ethics around incidental findings from whole body FDG 
PET/CT in RA patients without known malignancy. Gathering data on researchers’ attitudes and beliefs regarding 
incidental findings and the prevalence of incidenta l findings from state of the art imaging studies will help develop clear 
policies and procedures for reporting and managing incidental findings in imaging research, refine the informed consent 
process and standardize reporting, evaluation, and follow up of  incidental imaging findings.  
7.11 Neuroimaging Measures Ancillary Study  
PET/CT Brain image analysis, is performed while blinded to subject data and temporal identifiers, using a dedicated 
workstation that enables multi -modal standard image fusion (Leonardo –TrueD, Siemens Solutions). The amygdala is 
localized on the CT images using anatomic landmarks, as described previously11218F-FDG uptake in amygdala was 
determined by [CONTACT_1299] a circular region of interest (ROI) in the defined structure bilaterally, and mean and maximum tracer 
accumulation were recorded as standardized uptake value (SUV) for each ROI. Amygdalar activit y is corrected for brain 
background activity, using cerebral (temporal lobe). The primary analysis for the study was the average of the mean right 
and left amygdalar SUVs divided by [CONTACT_504686].  
PET/CT Bone marrow and splenic activities , are m easured according to previously validated methods127. Bone marrow 
18F-FDG uptake was determined by [CONTACT_504687] T1 to L5. The maximum SUV 
was recorded for each vertebra, and bone marrow activity was calculated as the average of the registered SUVmax of all 
measured vertebrae. Splenic 18F-FDG uptake was determined by [CONTACT_1299] a ROI in each of axial, sagittal, and coronal 
sections. The SUVmax was recorded for each section, and splenic activity was calculated as the average of the three 
registered SUVmax values.  
8. REGULATORY CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.[ADDRESS_649829]’s medical records and the 
informed consent for m should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_504688].   The signed consent form will be retained according to institutional policy.  A copy of 
the signed consent form will be provided  to the subject.  Ancillary studies that require study procedures additional to  
the parent TARGET Trial will require separate consent forms.   The subject may withdraw consent to participate in the 
study at any time.  For the bioethics survey, the completion  of the survey will serve as the consent for the TARGET 
investigators  who participate . 
8.[ADDRESS_649830] (DSMB) will be appointed by [CONTACT_504689] t he study.  We anticipate that its membership will include: a biostatistician; a cardiologist with trial 
experience; 1 -2 rheumatologists with trial experience; and a bioethicist.  Persons outside of CUMC and BWH and who 
have no conflict of interest with the  TARGET Study will be chosen to assure independence.  The DSMB will meet before 
the study starts and every 6 months thereafter; additional ad hoc sessions can be convened in the event of more urgent 
issues.  The DSMB will compi[INVESTIGATOR_504622] a written char ter.  The NIH Project Officer will attend the DSMB meetings 
and will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_12675]. The biostatistician will be the DSMB Executive Secretary and one member, 
45 designated by [CONTACT_450855], will serve as DSMB chair. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_504623], adverse 
events, and consideration of protocol modifications to assure safety.   DSMB members will be blinded to treatment 
assignment when monitoring safety data , unless an event necessitating un -blinding occurs.  These blinded (and if 
necessary unblinded) reports will be provided to them quarterly by [CONTACT_15791].  
In addition to participant safety, the DSMB will also be charged with data monitoring.  For this, the DSMB must: ensure 
data integrity and confidentiality, assist NIAMS by [CONTACT_504690], 
sample size, statistics, and/or data collection; and review and evaluate requests for protocol modifications after the trial 
begins.  
8.[ADDRESS_649831] (IRB) 
(depending on the individual sites capabilities).  Partners HealthCare IRB at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504624] t he central IRB and will  oversee IRB responsibilities .  This protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_476].    
Each Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_504625], the Informed Consent form, any advertisements, 
and all other relevant study related documents to their local IRB for approval. For sites using the trial’s central IRB, these 
docum ents will be submitted through the Administrative Core. Documentation of each site’s IRB approval must be 
provided to the Administrative Core before study enrollment can commence.  All  unanticipated problems, as well as 
protocol deviations and violations , that occur during the conduct of the trial will be reported by [CONTACT_504691] .  A full list of all adverse events (most of them will not be 
unanticipated) will be submitted regularly to the DSMB and the responsible IRBs.  The IRB must approve all protocol 
changes prior to implementation unless emergency action is clinically indicated.  Site PIs will be responsible for 
preparing annual reports to the IRB (or more frequently if required locally) and  a final report upon study completion. 
Support for the Sites for these IRB functions will be provided by [CONTACT_19305].  
8.[ADDRESS_649832] receive the following 
documents:  
• Copy of stamped IRB approved consent form  
• Copy of the IRB approval letter for the protocol and consent form.  
• CV of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators  
• Signed and dated protocol signature [CONTACT_504727] a site that is re lying on the central IRB can begin enrollment  approval must be granted from the BWH central IRB 
for the addition of the site.

 ISMMS -MGH Imaging Core Charter  
 
1. Imaging protocol  
 
ISMMS -MGH Imaging core (ICL) has developed the following acquisition guidelines for standardization 
of the study imaging components across imaging centers participating in the TARGET trial. Provided 
here are image acquisition guidelines for 18 -FDG -PET/CT imaging of vascular inflammation. The 
protocol provides a guide for participating centers and acknowledges that variations in the technical 
abilities of the scanners used may introduce minor variations in the settings used for this study.   
 
Regularly scheduled imaging for this study should be acquired in strict adherence to these guidelines. 
Please ensure the blinding of all confidential subject/site information on all images. Only combination 
PET/CT scanners should be used to acquire data  for this study. Please notify ICL immediately of any 
changes (including upgrades) to the PET/CT scanner hardware or software.

1.0   IMAGE ACQUISITION GUIDELINES , PRE-IMAGING PREPARATION, 18FDG -PET/CT  
 
• All subjects need to adhere to an induction phase low -carbohydrate diet (see Attachment A: 
Dietary Instructions for Subjects), especially for their dinner meal preceding the FDG -PET scan.  
o The clinical site will provide the subject with this information.  
• Subjects should be encouraged to drink plenty of water while fasting.  
 
 Instructions  
Morning Imaging  Subjects being imaged in the morning must have fasted for at least [ADDRESS_649863] 4 hours  prior to the 18FDG injection.  
~5 minutes prior to IV injection of 
18FDG  A blood glucose (BG) measurement (mg/dl) will be taken*:   
• if BG<150: proceed with imaging  
• if BG>150 but ≤ 170: reschedule or may repeat BG within 1 
hr to see if it comes down to <150  
i.if BG is still >150, patient should not be scanned and 
should be exclude d from the study – site 
coordinator should contact [CONTACT_504698]  
• if BG>170: patient should not be scanned and should be 
excluded from the study – site coordinator should contact 
[CONTACT_504698]  
 
*Glucose measurements should be made using a CLIA approved, CLIA cleared, or equivalent glucose 
measurement technique.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
59 
  
• Synchronize clocks  
o Ensure clocks used to record times for the study procedures on the imaging day are 
synchronized with the scanner and dose calibrator clocks.  
 
• Obtain Subje ct height and weight  
o Record subject height (without shoes) at first visit  
o Weigh subject (without shoes, jackets or sweaters) and record weight at each visit.  
 
• All pre -imaging steps should be followed:  
1. Obtain IV access  
 
2. Check fasting blood glucose (mg/dl)  
• if glucose<150: proceed with imaging  
• if glucose 150 -170: reschedule or may repeat BG within 1 hr to see if it comes down to 
<150  
i.if glucose still >150: patient should not be scanned and should be excluded from 
the study  
• if BG>170: patient should no t be scanned and should be excluded from the study – site 
coordinator should contact [CONTACT_504698]  
 
3. Draw [ADDRESS_649864] Form (IRF):  
i. Assay time to the nearest minute  
ii.  Initial 18FDG dose (in mCi) to the nearest tenth.  
 
4. Inject the 18FDG through the subject’s IV line.  Record this time to the nearest minute.  
 
5. Flush the syringe and line with approx 20cc of normal saline.  
 
6. Repeat assay of syringe and measure residual activity within syringe.  
 
7. Record 18FDG injected dose (initial -residual activity) to the nearest tenth of mCi.  
 
• Target circulation time is [ADDRESS_649865] should be placed in the PET/CT scanner approximately [ADDRESS_649866] may watch television but should limit muscle activity (advi se against 
reading, conversing, chewing, etc.).  
o Place warm blanket on subject to reduce brown fat activation.  
o Scanning should commence 90 minutes after injection  
Important:  
For subsequent PET/CT visits, make sure to repeat the following parameters:  
• Same FD G dose (± 5%)  
60 
 • Same FDG circulation time (± 10 minutes)  
• Same time of imaging (time of day ± 60 minutes)  
• For the 2nd Scan (Visit 6), CT Parameters will depend on BMI at the initial imaging visit  - 
Acquisition will not change based on a subject gaining or los ing a few pounds.

within 72 hours of image acquisition  and the report submitted to the clinical investigative site 
immediately thereafter. Local radiologists should look for findings that might be of clinical significance 
that should be shared with t he site investigator – e.g., increased focal uptake of tracer that may Digital Image Transfer only:  
o The images must be contiguous (no gaps).  
o Images should be in DICOM format  
o All images must be in an uncompressed format . 
o Transfer:  
1) attenuation corrected PET data reconstructed with 128X128 Matrix, (neck, chest, and joints) plus 256 X 256 (or in 
some cases, another matrix size that is optimized for your scanner type. If 256 X 256 matrix size is not available, please 
consult with the  Imaging Core)  
2) non -corrected PET data, reconstructed with 128X128 Matrix, (neck, chest, and joints)  plus 256 X 256 (or in some 
cases, another matrix size that is optimized for your scanner type. If 256 X 256 matrix size is not available, please

3) CT -AC scans, (neck, chest, and joints)  
4) Dose report  
• Images  ( including raw/original data) should remain digitally archived at the site throughout the entirety of the 
clinical trial.  
• Retain raw data on the scanner until confirmation of acceptable data has been received  
• Keep a source disc (CD or DVD) containing imag es  at the clinical site  
• Prepare images for transfer to imaging core lab  
• See ‘Image Submission Guidelines’ for further instructions  
[ADDRESS_649871] TARGET eligibility.  
1.6 Rescanning Guidelines  
Occasionally, the quality of the scans will be inadequate to provide quantitative data and consideration 
will be given to re -scanning. The Imag ing Core will ALWAYS  determine the need for a repeat scan; the 
decision to repeat a scan should never be determined by [CONTACT_504701]. See Section 2.5.d. for 
more information about quality assessment.  
• Baseline Visit : The only time that a repeat scan may be requested by [CONTACT_504702] (neck and chest) at the Baseline visit are inadequate to provide 
quantitative data.  This determination will be made by [CONTACT_504703] [ADDRESS_649872] for a repeat scan(s) will be made by [CONTACT_504704].  If a patient had a repeat scan(s) at the Baseline 
visit, the following protocol must be followed at the Month 6 follow -up scan session:  
o No whole body scan will b e performed  
o Only one vascular (neck or chest) scan will be performed .  The scan type will 
be determined by [CONTACT_504705].  Only the vascular scan that provided 
adequate (or higher quality) quantitative data at the Baseline visit will be 
performed at Mon th 6 visit.  The local imaging site will be informed by [CONTACT_504706], in advance of the patient’s appointment, as to which scan (neck or 
chest) to perform.  
 
• Month 6 Visit :  In patients who had a technically adequate Baseline Scan ([ADDRESS_649873], and  1 Whole Body acquisition) but had a technically inadequate Month 6 vascular 
scan (either chest or neck), as determined by [CONTACT_504705], a repeat scan may be 
requested.  In this case repeat scanning will be requested of either the neck, the chest, 
or both.  As above, the whole body scan should never be repeated at this visit , 
regardless of quality.  
 
2. Site training, Image Qualification and Image Submission Guidelines  
2.0   Introduction  
This Site Qualification and Image Submission Guidelines document is provi ded by [CONTACT_504707] - [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504634] (ICL).  It is

regarding the process for qu alifying an Investigator Site for participation in the imaging component of 
TARGET and all of the accompanying start -up procedures.   
Items such as imaging training, image submission, query response and resolution, and study design will 
be covered in these  guidelines.  These guidelines will used as a supplement to regular procedures already 
in place at qualifying sites. For details regarding the imaging protocols, please refer to Image Acquisition 
Guidelines (also provided).  
[ADDRESS_649874] be qualified bef ore submitting study exams as this process ensures that sites are capable 
of following study protocol.  Careful and well -documented training of all staff is also required before 
imaging may begin at the clinical site. Details regarding Site Qualification a re discussed in Section 2.3.  
2.1  Study Design  
The objective of this Imaging Study is to determine vascular inflammation in subjects by [CONTACT_67940] 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FDG -PET/CT) imaging, 
to subjects parti cipating in this trial.  
2.2.   Definitions  
Imaging Core Lab (ICL): A collaboration between   the Icahn School of Medicine and [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504635] : Centralized coordination facility for all procedures associated with 
PET/CT image acquisition, processing and review. The facility is responsible for receiving, trackin g, and 
archiving PET/CT images that are associated with this study.  The Imaging Core Lab also performs quality 
control (QC) checks on all PET/CT examinations and related documentation received. PET/CT images are 
checked for consistency, completeness and p rotocol compliance.  
 
Investigator Sites: The institutions responsible for enrolling clinical study subjects and obtaining clinical 
data associated with study subjects. The Investigator Site is also responsible for managing imaging 
scheduling and for prepa ring and forwarding images acquired to the ICL, as per protocol. In addition, they 
are responsible to ensure responses to any queries generated.  
 
Imaging Centers:  These centers are generally either a physical part of the main Investigator Site, or 
functio n as a satellite site, and are responsible for acquiring images associated with clinical study subjects. 
PET/CT images will be obtained according to the study protocol and the study Image Acquisition 
Guidelines provided.    
2.[ADDRESS_649875] information for study staff (Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52695]). This listing will be sent on a weekly basis during start -up phase, 
and on an as -needed bas is thereafter.  
2.3.b.  Imaging Surveys  
ICL will be responsible for distributing Imaging Surveys. Imaging surveys collect contact [CONTACT_504708], scanning 
capabilities, and data transfer capabilities available at the sites.  Instructions regarding the

[ADDRESS_649876], the CRA will follow up with the Investigator Site to resolve the issue. Any issues regarding 
the site’s equipment or abilities to comply with the imaging protocol will be raised by [CONTACT_504711].  
2.3.c.  Site Initiation Tracking  
The core lab CRA will create a study -specific Site Qualification Spreadsheet , stored on an electronic 
file to track the status of all qualification steps for each Imaging Center participating in the study.  
Upon completion of each of the tasks described in this section, the spreadsheet will be updated to 
show the dates that sites completed each step in site initiation. The Imaging Center name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_504712], along with the clinical site 
PI(s) associated with each Imaging Center.  
2.3.d.  Site Radiation Safety Off icer/Committee Attestation  
The Radiation Safety Officer or Commitee at each imaging site must sign the attestion form at the 
beginning of this protocol to state that they have reviewed this Imaging Protocol and that they 
agree with the Radiation Safety Mon itoring Plan.  This must be completed before trial imaging 
commences.  
 
2.4  Study Imaging Binder  
The ICL will provide the imaging centers with forms to be kept in a Study Imaging Binder at their site for 
PET/CT imaging. Please note that the ICL will not be  providing a physical binder. These forms should be 
kept at the imaging site. Below is a description of these materials:  
• The Image Acquisition Guidelines (IAG)  are generated by [CONTACT_504713]. The standardized guidelines are distributed to each Imaging 
Facility and details the imaging protocol.  
 
• The PET Adjunctive Data Forms (ADFs) is to be completed and signed by [CONTACT_504714].  Complete ADFs can be transmitted via email at  the time images are submitted.  
 
• The Image Delivery  Receipt  is an automatically generated e -mail sent from the ICL sFTP site notifying 
the sender that delivery of images was successful. The delivery receipt lists the item downloaded, the 
download date and time, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and transferred file size. An example of a delivery receipt is 
included in the Sample Forms tab of the Study Imaging Binder.  The binder also includes a tab for 
storage of Image Delivery Receipts that are received for subjects participatin g in the trial.  
 
• The Case Acceptance Notification (CAN)  is sent from ICL to the primary contacts at the Investigator 
Site and Imaging Center.  This form serves to inform the study staff that the entire PET/CT image set 
and IRF for a subject have been received and checked for completeness and acceptable quality  by [CONTACT_504715]. A sample of the CAN is provided in the Study Imaging Binder.  The binder also includes a tab 
for storage of CANs that are received for subjects participating in the trial.  
 
73 
 • The Case Query Notification (CQN)  is sent from ICL to the primary point of contact [CONTACT_504716] 2 business days of receipt of an unacceptable/incomplete PET/CT 
dataset.  The form is sent via e -mail and will describe the query and indicate the acti on(s) required to 
be taken towards submission resolution of the issue described. A sample of the CQN is provided in 
the Study Imaging Binder.  The binder also includes a tab for storage of CQNs that are received for 
subjects participating in the trial.  
2.[ADDRESS_649877] is designated by [CONTACT_779].  Detailed instructions on submitting data via the sFTP system can be 
found in Section 2.6 of this document.  
2.5.a.   PET/CT Phantom Image Data Transfer  
Each Imaging Center will be required to submit image sets of standardized PET/CT phantoms prior to 
approval for imaging.  An Ameri can College of Radiology (ACR) phantom produced during the most 
recent quarterly assessment performed at the Imaging Center would suffice.  
 
Initial phantom data will undergo a preliminary quality control (QC) review by [CONTACT_504717], that both PET and CT series are present, and the 
images appear to be of acceptable quality. Initial phantom datasets will then be forwarded from the 
Osirix workstation to the Reader workstation for quantitative analysis. ICL CRA will e -mail the reader 
that the data has been sent and is available for review.  The reader will reply via e -mail within 3 
business days with the results of quantitative analysis of the phantom data.  Results of the review 
should be in binary form:  either positive (pass) or negative (fail). Additional recommendations on how 
to achieve auto mA based on your scanner may be provided after submission of the phantom images.  
Failure to meet any of the criteria above, or a negative review by [CONTACT_73700], wi ll result in a query to 
the site. If the initial phantom dataset received from a site is determined by [CONTACT_504718], ICL will request a rescan of phantom data and note the parameters described in 
the Image Acquisition Guidelin es that should be adjusted to optimize the quality. The date of query 
sent and reason for query are tracked in RIS and are associated to the specific phantom data timepoint 
from which they originated.  In cases where queries are necessary, the CRA will NOT  archive the study 
to ICL PACS and instead select “No Image” when prompted to link to a dataset PACS.  After tracking is 
complete, the RIS record can be closed.  
Upon determination that the dataset is acceptable, data will be archived to ICL PACS and associ ated 
with the corresponding timepoint record in RIS.  
The study -specific site qualification spreadsheet is updated to indicate the date of receipt of phantom 
data transfer.  
74 
 Once an imaging center has been approved, all subsequently received quarterly phant om data will 
undergo QC by [CONTACT_504719].  Subsequent phantom images are permitted to be done under 
the normal quality assurance (QA) procedures and protocols in place at the Imaging Center.  
Processing of these phantom scans will follow the procedu res described in this section.  Subsequent 
phantom datasets from sites can be entered under the same subject in RIS as an additional timepoint.   
2.5.b.   Imaging Training  
To ensure consistency in scan acquisitions across all imaging centers, a primary technologist will be 
appropriately trained by [CONTACT_504720]. The 
participating Imaging Center is also encouraged to identify a back -up technologist who will undergo 
the same training. ICL  will require PET/CT Technologists to participate in an online video training prior 
to the onset of the study. Additional Site personnel will also be invited and are encouraged, to attend 
the training session.  
 
Training will include reading the Imaging Pro tocol, watching a training video, and attending a Question 
& Answer teleconference with personnel from your assigned Imaging Core Lab (Mount Sinai or MGH).  
ICL will provide login information prior to all training sessions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.c.   Imaging and Data  Collection  
The figure below summarizes the expectations of the Investigator Site and/or Imaging Center in 
support of the imaging component of the trial. Following the figure are detailed instructions for 
imaging data collection.  
75 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. The Investigator Site will refer subjects to the Imaging Center for PET/CT imaging exams.  All 
imaging exams must be conducted by [CONTACT_504721].  
 
2. The Investigator Site, or a designee in the Imagin g Center, will initiate PET Adjunctive Data Forms 
(ADFs) for each subject to be imaged. The ADFs are to be completed and signed by [CONTACT_504722].  ADFs can be transmitted via fax or email to ICL (contact [CONTACT_504723]).  
 
3. Images mu st be anonymized prior to submission to ICL according to the following guidelines:  
 
i. Subject Name [CONTACT_504729] (Site (xx digit) – Subject (xx digit))  
ii. Year of birth should remain, if permitted by [CONTACT_1295], and serve as a key identifier 
for the record  
iii. Date of Scan must be included on the image  
iv. Medical Record number replaced with a [ADDRESS_649878] code of zeros (e.g. 0000000)  
v. Any other protected health information (PHI) removed from any additional fields  
 
4. The complete and anonymized PET/CT images will be sent to ICL via secure File Transfer Protocol 
(sFTP).  See Section 2.6: sFTP Data Transfer Instructions for details regarding submission of 
images. All images must be submitted in DICOM format. Images should be sent on the day of 
acquisition, or within 2 business days  should it not be possible to send on same day.  If it is not 
possible to transfer the images within that time frame and/or if there are any technical difficulties 
in transferring images, please alert ICL via e -mail or phone .    
 
Specifically, invitations will be sent to imaging sites allowing external users to utilize a web 
browser to submit data to the ICL FTP site.  The data is received at ICL, after which the data is sent 

76 
 to a RIS/PACS (Radiological Informati on System/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_115303]).  
This technical infrastructure is displayed in the graphic below.

5. After PET/CT images are received at ICL, a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will confirm image set 
completeness and proper labeling/anonymization of images.  Subject and timepoint information 
will be verified on the Image Record Form. A quality control (Q C) will be performed to verify that 
the Image Acquisition Guidelines were followed. If the imaging associate finds an artifact that 
could impair the ability to interpret images, the nature of the artifact will be discussed with ICL 
medical staff before bei ng escalated to external study personnel.  
 
6. ICL will notify the Investigator Site and Imaging Centers of the results of the QC of each image set 
submitted in the form of either a Case Acceptance or a Case Query Notification.  
 
7. The Case Acceptance Notificati on informs the Study Coordinator and Imaging Center that PET/CT 
imaging for the timepoint is complete and of acceptable quality.  Any deviation from the 
guidelines should be discussed with ICL in advance.  Any change in parameters must be pre -
approved and noted on the Image Record Forms.  
 
8. If a Case Query Notification is issued, the notification will indicate actions that need to be taken 
by [CONTACT_504724]. The site is required to resolve the query and/or send the 
missing/discrepant information to ICL w ithin 2 business days. This short turnaround time is 
necessary due to the time -sensitive nature of some imaging visits.  If resolution of the query 
cannot be completed, the site will be required to notify ICL (via email) within the two -business 
day time fr ame. This notification must include a definitive date for query resolution.   ICL 
[ADDRESS_649879] information from clinical sites and corresponding images is shown in the figure 
below.

 2.5.d   Data and Image Quality Evaluation  
(A) Data quality  will include evaluation of CRF data as well as image quality. CRF data will be used to 
assess adherence to the protocol. Data evaluated to assess adherence to the imaging protocol will 
include: i) tracer circulation time (ii) intra -subject difference in circulation time (between scans) (iii) 
fasting blood glucose (iv) in jected minus residual activity, iv) scanner used, v) arm position, vi) 
reconstruction method, vii) time per bed position, viii) acquisition mode, ix) slice thickness as well as 
other characteristics provided in the CRF.  
 (B) Image Quality  Images will be gr aded as: 1 (Excellent), 2 (Marginal), and 3 (Unacceptable) in each 
of the three vessel beds. An example of a marginal image set is one where it was deemed difficult to 
derive measurements, whereby [CONTACT_504725]. An example of an 
unacceptable image set is one where image quality precludes measuring the image (e.g. excess 
motion, artifact, spi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -over). Data analysis will be performed first on data derived from Excellent quality 
scans only, then Excellent and Marginal quality s cans combined.  
2.5.e   Radiation Dose Monitoring  
Radiation exposure for each subject will be monitored by [CONTACT_186752], the IRB, and the 
DSMB. Please see Appendix D: Radiation Safety Monitoring Plan (RSMP) for more details.

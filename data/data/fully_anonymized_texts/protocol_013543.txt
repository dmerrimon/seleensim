DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 
I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder affecting up to 1% of college -aged 
women in the US (1) and an increasing number of women over 30 years of age (2).  AN is 
characterized by [CONTACT_6270] -imposed starvation and is associated with  significant medical complications 
which lead to increased morbidity and mortality (3).  Among the many medical co -morbidities 
associ ated with AN, the most common is significant bone loss, which can persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_836726] (4).  Nearly 50% of women with AN have osteopenia with an additional 30% meeting 
WHO criteria for osteoporosis (5, 6) .  Importantly, this severe bone loss is associated with an 
increased fracture risk.  Nearly 30% of women with AN report a history of a fracture (6) and a 
prospective study demonstrated a 7 -fold increased risk of fracture in women with AN compared 
to age -matched controls (7).  Because AN is a chronic disease that can persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_836727], the bone loss and increased fracture risk can persist and lead to 
lifelong morbidity.  A population -based retrospective  study demonstrated the cumulative 
incidence of fracture, even many years after the diagnosis of AN, to be 57% (8).  Therefore, 
finding a treatment for bone loss associated with AN is of critical importance.   
 
Loss o f bone mass in AN results from hormonal alterations in response to chronic nutritional 
deprivation. The body responds to caloric deprivation by [CONTACT_836738].  During periods of decreased caloric availability, reproductio n and growth become 
less important for the survival of an organism and therefore these processes are down -regulated.  
In AN, down -regulation of the reproductive axis results in hypoestrogenemia.  Low estrogen 
states, such as menopause, result in increased bone resorption (9) and therefore the 
hypoestrogenemia characteristic of AN is a significant contributor to the loss of bone mass.  This 
is supported by [CONTACT_836739] (BMD) in AN (10).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_836728], initial studies investigating the effects of 
oral estrogen in AN  did not show benefit (11, 12) .  This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that 
oral estrogen suppresses IGF -I production (13, 14) , an important bone trophic factor.  Patients 
with AN are relatively IGF -I deficient and low syste mic IGF -I levels are an important 
mechanism of bone loss in AN.  In humans, systemic IGF -I is produced primarily by [CONTACT_836740].  Systemic IGF -I levels in 
AN are approximately 50% those of normal weight women or weight -recovered women with a 
history of AN (15).  In animal models, systemic and tissue levels of IGF -I are important for the 
acquisition of bone mass (16-18) and in humans, low systemic IGF -I levels are associated with 
low BMD in AN (19) and treatment with rhIGF -I leads to small increases in BMD in women 
with AN (12).  Therefore further suppression of IGF -I by [CONTACT_836741].  
 
Importantly, transdermal , physiologic estrogen replacement does not suppress systemic IGF -I 
production.  Oral estrogen has significant hepatic effects and these effects are by[CONTACT_836742] .  Importantly, oral but not transdermal estrogen 
suppresses hepatic IGF -I synthesis; in contrast, transdermal estrogen replacement has been 
shown to increase IGF -I levels in post -menopausal women (13, 20) .  The dose of estrogen is also 
an important factor in IGF -I suppression, such that higher doses of oral estrogen have greater Version Date : 8/30/2018

Version:  March 2007      Page 2 of 11 
 suppressive effects on IGF -I production (14) and therefore, the supraphysiologic doses of 
estrogen found in oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_836729] -I to a greater degree than physiologic 
doses of oral estrogen.  
 
Understanding the effects of transdermal estrogen on a population of older, premenopausal 
women with AN will be critical in order to provid e potential treatment options for this 
population.  Although physiologic and supraphysiologic doses of oral estrogen do not increase 
BMD in women with AN, when compared to placebo (11, 12) , physiologic, transdermal 
estrogen  replacement increases BMD in adolescent girls with AN in as little as 6 months (21).  A 
randomized, placebo -controlled study of 110 adolescent girls with AN treated predominantly 
with transdermal, physiologic estrogen demonstrated a 1.8% increase in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (LS)BMD 
after 6 months (compared to a -0.5% loss of LSBMD in the placebo group) (21).  LSBMD 
continued to increase with time, such that a 2.6% increase in LSBMD was observed after [ADDRESS_1161632] high 
levels of bone resorption (22), adolescent girls with AN are in a state of low bone turnover (23).  
Therefore, whether transdermal estrogen would have the same effect in adult women with AN is 
unknown.    
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Specific Aim 1:  We hypothesize that administration of  transdermal estrogen will increase 
bone mineral density (BMD)  and improve parameters of bone microarchitecture and 
strength in osteopenic women with anorexia nervosa ( AN) and that response to treatment 
will be predicted by [CONTACT_836743] w ill investigate in women with AN in a [ADDRESS_1161633] and improve bone strength, as estimated by 
[CONTACT_836744].  
 
Specific Aim 2: We hypothesize that administration of transdermal estrogen will decrease 
vertebral MAT in women with AN and this decrease will be associated with  increases in 
BMD  
 
We will investigate in women with AN in a 6 -month open -label study whether treatment with 
transdermal estrogen replacement will decrease vertebral MAT, as assessed by 1H-magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, and whether this decrease in vertebral MAT is associated with increases 
in BMD.  
 
Specific Aim 3: We hypothesize that MAT levels are associated with changes in 
physiological endogenous estrogen in healthy women, and that MAT levels will be the 
highest during the follicular phase of the  menstrual cycle and lowest during the luteal 
phase

Normal -Weight Subjects  
For the Screening Visit, subjects will be seen at the MGH Clinical Research Center (CRC) for an 
outpatient visit to determine eligibility. The screening visit will consist of a medical history, 
physical exam, laboratory studies, and urine pregnancy test. History taking will include complete 
weight, menstrual, medication, and fracture histories. The following will also be performed: 1) 
Blood draw for comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function studies, 25 -OH vitamin D; 2) 
Nutrition al evaluation, including weight in a gown, height, frame size, calculation of % ideal 
body weight (% IBW) and BMI; 3) Urine pregnancy test; 4) BMD evaluation by [CONTACT_11323] x -
ray absorptiometry (DXA).  
 
Subjects who qualify for the study and choose to enrol l will then present for two additional 
visits: Early Follicular Phase Visit (days 3 -5 of the menstrual cycle)  and Luteal Phase visit (days 
12-21 of the menstrual cycle). At each of these visits, the following procedures will take place: 
1) medical history,  physical exam; 2) urine pregnancy test; 3) Nutritional evaluation  including 
weight in a gown, height, calculation of % IBW and BMI, and calculation of daily intake of 
calcium and vitamin D; 4) Hormone analyses including P1NP, osteocalcin, Type I collagen C-
telopeptide (CTX); 5) MAT assessment of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L4) by 1H -MRS.  
 
 
Experi mental Endpoints:  
 
Nutritional Status : CRC dietitians will assess the nutritional status of all patients. 
Metabolic weight and height will be determined and percent ideal bo dy weight and BMI 
calculated.  Activity  will be assessed using the Paffenbarger assessment.   
  
 Markers of Bone Turnover : Sensitive blood and urine markers of bone turnover have 
been developed to assess bone remodeling in a noninvasive, reproducible fashi on.  We will 
measure both markers of bone formation and markers of bone resorption including osteocalcin, 
P1NP and serum CTX.   
 
 Marrow Adiposity : Marrow adiposity will be measured by [CONTACT_405236] (MRS).  Endpoints will include L4 marrow adiposity, and marrow adiposity of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_175364], metaphysic and diaphysis of the femur.  Imaging examinations will be performed in 
the Department  of Radiology, Yawkey 6th floor or Ellison 2nd floor, using a 1.5T or 3.0T MR 
device (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI and Siemens, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]).  Magnetic 
field strengths of 1.5T and 3.0T are approved by [CONTACT_88670]. Subjects will be 
required to lie in a magnet for about 1 hr. The  1.5T and 3.0T MR devices are FDA -approved for 
clinical use.  
 
 Bone Density : Bone density will be measured by [CONTACT_836748], hip, wrist and 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Hologic Discovery A, Hologic, Inc. Waltham, MA) to determine cortical and 
trabecular bone dens ity.  The primary bone mineral density (BMD) endpoint will be the BMD 
measurement of the PA spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  DXA is a standardized, reproducible method to determine bone 
density and has been used successfully in our previous studies.  It involves minimal radiation 
exposure to the patient.

Version:  March [ADDRESS_1161639]:   Xtreme CT of the wrist and distal tibia will be performed to evaluate bone 
density and bone quality by [CONTACT_836749].  
 
 Anxiety:  Evaluation of psychic and somatic anxiety will be performed using the 
Hamilton Anxiety Ratin g Scale.   
 
VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Change in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_836733] t his study.  The lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_836734] (6).  We will measure BMD with 
dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (Discovery A; Hologic, Waltham, MA) at baseline, month 3 
and at the final study visit.  
 
We will also be monitoring changes in parameters of trabecular and cortical bone 
microarchitecture: HR -pQCT will be used to measure volumetric density, morphology and 
microarchitecture at the distal radius and distal tibia by [CONTACT_84888] -pQCT (Scanco Medical AG®, 
Bassersdorf, Switzerland).  We will measure trabecular and cortical parameters of bone 
microarchitecture at baseline and at the final, 6 -month study visit.  
Additionally, we will assess bone strength by [CONTACT_836750] (FE) analysis: Bone strength will be 
estimated using FE analysis of HR -pQCT scan data using published, validated techniques (54).  
 
We will be measuring c hange in marrow adiposity of L4 vertebra: Marrow adipose tissue of the 
L4 vertebra will be measured using 1H -MRS at baseline, month 3 and at th e final study visit.  
Statistical Methods: The analyses of these pi[INVESTIGATOR_836735]. David Schoenfeld, Professor of Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health and 
Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical Sc hool, and a study collaborator.  
 
The primary analysis will be a paired t -test comparing the post -transdermal estrogen lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_836736].  We will study [ADDRESS_1161640] a power of over 80% at a 
two-sided p=0.05 level of significance if the true rate of bone gain is 1.2% (this value is 1/3 less 
than the percent BMD gain found in adolescent girls treated with physiologic estrogen for 6 
month s).  This calculation assumes a SD of 1.2%.  
 
The secondary analyses will be paired t -tests comparing the post -transdermal estrogen 
parameters of trabecular microarchitecture, bone strength and marrow adiposity with baseline 
values.  With [ADDRESS_1161641] 80% power at a two -sided p=0.05 level of 
significance if the true rate of difference between the treatments is 1.2%, based on an assumption 
that the SD is 1.2%.  There are currently no data looking at the short -term (6 month) effects of 
estrogen replacement on bone microarchitecture or strength in postmenopausal women or girls or 
women with AN and therefore this effect size is an estimate of what might be expected.  In post -
menopausal women, one year of transdermal estrogen replacement res ulted in a 20% decrease in 
adipocyte volume (as measured by [CONTACT_275456]) (55), therefore we believe that a change of 1.2% 
in marrow adiposity is a conservative estimate of the potential change.

 VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Transdermal Estrogen/Progesterone:  
The transdermal patch is applied weekly and administers 0.045 mg/day of estradiol along with 
0.015 mg/day of a 2nd generation progestin, levonorgestrel. We believe that a combination patch 
which includes both estradiol and a progestin is the safest way to administer estradiol to a 
population of women with an intact uterus.  Administration of progesterone is necessary to 
prevent against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer and a patch which contains both 
estradiol and a progestin will prevent the i nadvertent use of unopposed estrogen and therefore 
minimize this risk.  Transdermal patches may also be associated with skin irritation at the site of 
administration but are generally very well tolerated.  
 
The risks of exogenous estrogen and progesterone a dministration include an increased risk of 
pulmonary embolus, deep venous thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and retinal 
vascular thrombosis (24).  We will therefore exclude any subject who has a personal history of a 
venous or arterial clot, any subject with a history of an MI or stroke, any subject with a history of 
a hypercoagulable disorder and/or a history of migraine headaches (as exogenous e strogen use in 
women with migraines may increase the risk of stroke).  The Climara Pro patch contains a 2nd 
generation progestin, levonorgestrel, which has a lower thrombotic risk than the 3rd or 4th 
generation progestins (25) and rep lacement -dose transdermal estrogen patches are associated 
with a much lower risk of venous thromboembolism as compared to oral estrogen replacement 
and therefore we believe that the transdermal route will minimize the risk of venous 
thromboembolism (26).  An  increased risk of invasive breast cancer has been reported with the 
use of exogenous estrogen as well as an increased risk of abnormal mammograms requiring 
further evaluation.  We will therefore exclude any individual with a personal history or a first -
degree relative with a history of breast cancer.   
 
Blood Sampling:  
Blood sampling is performed in the study and there is always a very minor risk of infection, 
bruising, or syncope during a blood draw.  There is also the discomfort of having one’s blood 
drawn.   
 
Radiation:  
A portion of this research study involves exposure to radiation . The total radiation dose the AN 
subject s will rece ive from three or four DXA scans and two HR -pQCT  scans is 0.12 milliSievert 
(mSV ).  This am ount of radiation is approximately  4% of the yearly natural background 
radiation from the earth and the sky  (equivalent to 15 days of background radiation) .  The total 
radiation dose the normal -weight subject will receive from one DXA scan is 0.03 mSV  This 
amoun t of radiation is less than 1 % of the yearly natural background radiation from the earth and 
the sky (equivalent to 4 days of background radiation). There are no known health risks 
associated with such a dose.    
 
Confidentiality:  
The study staff will stringently protect the confidentiality and privacy of the study subjects by 
[CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_836737]/or password protected offices.  There is a rare risk of loss 
of confidentiality but study staff will do our best to prevent  
 
 
BWH/DFCI/MGH Human Subjects Research Application Form  Filename: [CONTACT_9454].doc  
Version:  March [ADDRESS_1161642] s’ bone mineral density may increase during the study, although if it does 
increase, it is not known how long it will remain increased.  We hope and anticipate that the 
information learned from this study will allow us to better understand the patho physiology of 
bone loss in AN and to improve the treatment of patients with bone loss associated with under -
nutrition.  
 
There will be no benefits to the normal -weight subject s, but we hope that information learned 
from this study will allow us to better understand the factors affecting marrow adipose tissue, its 
association with mineral metabolism , and its possible function in the bone marrow 
microenvironment.  
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
A number of procedures will be instituted to protect against the potential ri sks involved in this 
protocol.  All patients will have a pregnancy test on admission prior to being exposed to  
radiation or receiving study medication and at each study visit  thereafter. Bone density 
measurements will be made three times over the course of [ADDRESS_1161643] measurement 
will be made two times over the course of six months. The combined radiation from such 
procedures is less than 1% of the background radiation in one year.  Confidentiality of the 
patients will always be of paramount importance to study investigators.  All data on patients will 
be kept in confidential study binders accessed by [CONTACT_836751].  No 
data on study subjects w ill be shared with persons other than those directly involved in the study, 
except at the documented request of the patient.  Counseling will be made available by a study 
psychiatrist or psychologist.  
 
A Safety Monitor  will be established at MGH.  The Moni tor will consist of study investigators 
and an independent clinical expert in mineral metabolism at MGH, [CONTACT_836754].  The 
study investigators will review the safety data weekly to ensure the safety of the participants in 
the study and the Monitor  will meet every six months, or more often as needed.  The Monitor  
will review all study procedures, all adverse events, study violations, exceptions and deviations 
as well as study inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The Monitor  will review all safety monit oring 
blood tests and study data as available.  All study related serious adverse events will be reported 
to the Monitor  within 24h of occurrence.  All unanticipated problems, including  adverse events 
will be reported to the Partners  Human Research Committ ee (PHRC)  according to Partners 
reporting policy and to the FDA according to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  All  
unanticipated problems, incl uding adverse events will be reported to the Safety Monitor  and the 
report of the Monitor  meetings wi ll be submitted to the Partners Human Research Committee 
semi -annually.

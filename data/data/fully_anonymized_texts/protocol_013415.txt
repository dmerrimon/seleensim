·Confidentiality is about data.  Confidentiality refers to the researcher's plan to handle, manage,
and disseminate the participant's identifiable private information.
See OHRPP Quick Guide: Protecting Privacy and Maintaining Confidentiality
1.0 *Privacy: How will the investigator mainta in privacy in the research setting(s)?
(e.g., interviewing participant in a room or area where conversations cannot be overheard by [CONTACT_2312], orconducting medical procedures in an examination room, or behind a curtain in an emergency room).
All data files have safeguards to maintain the anonymity of participants and to bar unauthorized personnel. The
subject forms are kept in locked files according to legal requirements.
2.0 *Confidentiality:  If the protocol will collect and maintain identifiable data, explain how the planned
safeguards to maintain confidentiality of identifiable data and data security are appropriate to the degree
of risk from disclosure.
Note: Other sections of the application (e.g., Sections 9.3, 9.3a, 9.4, 9.5, and 15.3) will
request specifications such as identification of persons who will ha ve access to code keys
or measures to comply with HIPAA requirements.
All identifiable subject data will be maintained in a private office in locked file cabinets. The research office is only
accessible to research personnel.

Data & Safety Monito ring Plan (continued)
Important Note:
All interventional studies involving more than minimal risk must include a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  A
DSMP is a plan established to assure that each research study has a mechanism for appropriate oversight andmonitoring of the conduct of the study to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data.  The
DSMP should indicate specifically whether or not there will be a formal Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Data
Monitoring Committee (DMC).
Most, but not all studies (i.e., non-interventional studies) unde rgoing full board review will require a DSMP.  You will need
a DSMP if any of the following apply:1.  This is a Phase I, II or III clinical trial 2.  This is an investigator init iated trial (Section 2.1/item 3.0)
3.  This study involves treatment in an  emergency setting (Section 2.3/item 1.0)
4.  A Data/Safety Monitoring Plan is required by [CONTACT_22866] (Section 15.1/item 1.0)5.  This study is greater than minimal risk (Section 1.1b/item 1.0)

Biologics vs. Drugs: Most drugs consist of pure chemical substances and their structures are known.
Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological
products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to
microbial contamination. This requires sterile processes to be applied from initial manufacturing steps.For more information see: http://www.fda.gov/consumer/upda tes/biologics062608.html#drugs

Human Gene Transfer/ Recombinant DNA
Studies involving gene transfer and/or recombinant DNA require approval of the UCLA Institutional Biosafety
Committee ( IBC) and the NIH Recombinant DNA Ad visory Committee (RAC) . Human gene transfer is an
investigational method for correcting defective genes re sponsible for disease development through one of the
following techniques: o A normal gene may be inserted  into a nonspecific location within the genome to
replace a nonfunctional gene. o An abnormal gene coul d be swapped for a normal gene. o The abnormal gene
could be repaired through selective reverse mutation, which returns the gene to its normal function. o The
regulation of a particular gene could be altered. Reco mbinant DNA molecules, according to the NIH Guidelines,
are defined as either: (i) molecules that are constructed outside living cells by [CONTACT_209303] a living cell, or (ii) molecules that result from the replication
of those described in (i) above.

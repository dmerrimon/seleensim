    4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the potential 
for clinical dependence and withdrawal symptoms associated with valbenazine.  Approximately 
80 medically stable male and female subjects (the proportion of male s and females will be 
consistent with that of the patient population) with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) 
will be enrolled.  
Subjects will be screened for eligibility for up to 6 weeks prior to Day - 1 (baseline visit).  
On Day -1, eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of the 2 treatment arms (randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885]): 
• Valbenazine ([ADDRESS_950041] week followed by 80 mg for 3 weeks) for the first [ADDRESS_950042] 3 weeks of the double-
blind treatment period. 
• Placebo for the 7 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. 
Clinical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability will be assessed at scheduled times throughout the study. 
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1.

    4.4. Clinical Assessments  
Assessments of clinical dependence and withdrawal symptoms include:  
• Physician Withdrawal Checklist-20 (PWC-20), 
• modified Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (mCSSA),  
• Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS), and  
• Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A). 
The mCSSA  and PWC- 20 assessments are collected at baseline (Day - 1) and every visit starting 
after Week 1. The ESS and HAM -A assessments are collected at screening, baseline (Day -1), 
and every visit starting after Week 1.   AEs will also be reviewed for potential withdrawal 
symptoms.  
Efficacy assessments include:  
• Clinical Global Impression -Tardive Dyskinesia-Improveme nt (CGI -TD-I) and  
• Clinical Global Impression -Tardive Dyskinesia- Severity (CGI -TD-S). 
The CGI -TD-S assessment is collected at baseline (Day -1), Week 4, Week 5 Day 7, Week 6 
Day 7, and Week 7 Day 7 or early termination.  The CGI- TD-I assessment is collected at Week 4 
and Week 7 Day 7 or early termination. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments:  
Blood samples for plasma drug and metabolite concentration analyses are collected at Week [ADDRESS_950043] and provide dosing times on the days when these 
samples are collected.  
Safety assessments include:  
• AEs,  
• Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis),  
• Vital signs (including orthostatic blood pressure and pulse), 
• Physical examinations,  
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG),  
• Suicidal ideation and behavior, evaluated using the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS),  
• Drug -induced akathisia, evaluated usin g the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS),  
• Drug -induced parkinsonism and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), evaluated using the 
Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS), and  
• Changes in the severity of depressive symptoms using the Montgomery- Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS).  
 
See Table [ADDRESS_950044] hoc  analyses will be clearly identified 
in the clinical study report.  
6.1. General Statistical Procedures  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study.  The term 
“descriptive statistics” refers to the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (SEM), minimum, and maximum for continuous and ordinal 
categorical variables; and refers to the number and/or percentage of subjects (or events) for 
categorical variables.  
Unless stated otherwise, “treatment group” refers to the treatment the subject is randomly assigned to receive on Day -1 (ie, valbenazine or placebo).  
Select tables will include an “All Subjects” group, which combines both treatment groups and includes all subjects being summarized in the table.  
The double- blind (DB) treatment period will be further separated into treatmen t periods of 
interest for the analysis of selected variables.  The DB treatment period starting after Day -1 
through the end of the Week 4 visit will be referred to as the “Valbenazine/Placebo Period.”  The 
DB treatment period starting after the Week 4  visit through Week 7 Day 7 (final study visit) will 
be referred to as the “Withdrawal Period.”  Subsequent mention of summaries by “treatment 
period” will be defined as the aforementioned.   
Summary statistics will be displayed using the following decimal precision rules: the minimum 
and maximum will have the same number of decimal places as the data; the mean, median, SD, and SEM will have one more decimal place than the data being summarized. Percentages will be 
displayed using one decimal place; percentages  for 0 counts will be omitted. These rules may be 
modified if warranted, based on practical considerations.  
6.2. Analysis Sets  
6.2.1. Definition of Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group, take at 
least one dose of study drug, and have any postbaseline safety data. The safety analysis set will 
be used for all summaries of safety data (e.g., AEs, clinical laboratory data) and plasma 
concentration data.  For the summaries of data based on the safety analysis set, subjects who are dispensed the incorrect treatment at the time of randomization, and remain on the same incorrect 
treatment during the study, will be assigned to the treatment actually received in all summary 
tables and figures.  Subjects who are dispensed a combination of correct and incorrect treatments 
during the study will be assigned to the randomized treatment in all summary tables and figures. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.   NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-TD4001 
Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 13  
    [IP_ADDRESS].  Dependence and Withdrawal Analysis Set  
The dependence and withdrawal analysis s et will include all subjects in the safety analysis set 
who enter the W ithdrawal Period (ie, subject is dispensed a kit at Week 4).  The dependence and 
withdrawal analysis set will be used for summaries and analyses of clinical dependence and 
withdrawal sy mptoms data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Analysis Set  
The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group, take 
at least one dose of study drug, and have a CGI- TD-I or CGI- TD-S assessment at Week 4. The 
efficacy analysis set will be used for all summaries of efficacy data.   
6.2.2. Summary of Analysis Sets 
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects included in (and excluded from, as 
applicable) each analysis set will be provided for each treatment group. The number and percentage of subjects excluded from each analysis set by [CONTACT_699798]. An additional “All Subjects” column will be included. 
6.2.3. Application of Analysis Sets  
Summaries of subject disposition, randomization by [CONTACT_3885], analysis set inclusion/exclusion 
status, and IPDs will include all randomized subjects. All other summaries by [CONTACT_699799] 2 .

visit + 1. If the date of interest occurs prior to the Day -1 visit, then the study day will be calculated as: date of interest – date of Day - 1 visit.  
6.4.2. Change from Baseline 
Change from baseline is calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline value).

Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 15  
    If either the baseline or postbaseline value is missing, the change from baseline will also be 
missing.   
6.4.3. Handling of Early Termination Visit Data 
An early termination (ET) visit occurs when a subject discontinues from the study prior to 
completing the scheduled Week 7 Day 7 visit. The data collected at ET visits will be included in 
summary tables and figures in accordance with the ET visit mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] s cheme described in this 
section.  
For the purpose of data summarization, a visit window will be applied to account for ET visits.  
An ET visit will be mapped to Week 1 if it occurs within 3 days prior to or 3 days after the expected study day of the Week 1  visit.  An ET visit which occurs within 3 days prior to or 3 
days after the expected study day of the Week 4 visit will be mapped to Week 4.  ET visits occurring at a scheduled visit after Week 4 will be mapped to the scheduled visit.  If the ET visit occurs after Week 4 and between scheduled visits, the ET visit will be mapped to the next scheduled visit (with the requirement that the scheduled visit prior to the ET visit was completed by [CONTACT_423]).  
Early termination visit data which are not mapped to  a scheduled visit will not be included in by-
visit analyses and summaries. They will be included in any analyses that look across all available 
assessments during the treatment period, including unscheduled visits. They will also be included in any applic able by -subject data listings.  
6.5. Handling of Missing Data  
6.5.1. Missing Outcome Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Dependence and Withdrawal Assessments  
Missing data from clinical dependence and withdrawal assessments (PWC -20, mCSSA, ESS, 
and HAM -A) during the Withdrawal Period wi ll be handled using the following imputation 
rules:  
• If an individual item or total score from an assessment is intermediate missing (ie, 
missing between 2 observed visits), the item or total score will be imputed with the higher of the subject’s observed value immediately preceding or following the 
assessment with the missing value.  Imputed values for intermediate missing data will be 
included in by- visit summaries.  
• Missing total scores as a result of dropout will be imputed with the highest total score from subjects in the same treatment group with observed total scores at the same visit.   
This imputation method will only be used to determine the maximum (worst) total score per subject in the Withdrawal Period for dropouts and will not be included in by-visit summaries.   
Assessments missed prior to the Withdrawal Period will not be imputed.

Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 16  
    6.5.2. Missing Dates  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Start Dates for Adverse Events and Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Missing and incomplete (“partial”) dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be imputed 
for the purpose of estimating the time of the event or medication usage in relationship to study treatment. Any data listings will display the original dates as re ported in the database.   
The imputation rules for AE start dates are as follows: 
• If the date is completely missing, the date will be imputed as the date of the first dose of study drug; 
• If only the day is missing, the date will be imputed as the date of t he first dose of study 
drug if the month and year match the month and year of the first dose of study drug; otherwise, the missing day will be imputed as the first day of the month; 
• If both the day and month are missing, the date will be imputed as the dat e of the first 
dose of study drug if the date is in the same year as the first dose of study drug; otherwise, the missing day and month will be imputed as 01 January; 
• If any of the above imputations result in a start date that is later than an existing (not 
imputed) end date for the event, the start date will be imputed as the end date. 
The imputation rules for concomitant medication start dates are as follows:  
• If the date is completely missing, the date will be imputed as [ADDRESS_950046]’s screening vital signs assessment;  
• If only the day is missing, the date will be imputed as the date of the first dose of study drug if the date is in the same month and year as the first dose of study drug; otherwise, the missing day will be imputed as the first day of the month; 
• If both the day and month are missing, the date will be imputed as the date of the first dose of study drug if the date is in the same year as the first dose of study drug; otherwise, the missing day and month will be impu ted as 01 January; 
• If any of the above imputations result in a start date which is later than an existing (not imputed) medication stop date, the start date will be imputed as the stop date.

Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 [ADDRESS_950047] enrollment and disposition will display the number of subjects who 
were randomized to each treatment group, who completed through Week 4 of the study period 
(excluding ET visits mapped to Week 4), who entered the W ithdrawal Period (indicated by 
[CONTACT_699801] 4 visit), and who completed the study (ie, up to Week 7 
Day 7 excluding ET visits mapped to Week 7 Day 7). The number of subjects who did not 
complete the study will also be summarized, both overall and according to the reason for earl y 
discontinuation. 
A separate summary of randomization by [CONTACT_139563]. This summary will display 
the number of subjects randomized to each treatment group by [CONTACT_3725]. 
All of the summaries described in this section will be presented by [CONTACT_699802].  
A listing of randomized subjects will be provided and will include subject ID, informed consent date, randomization date, and randomized treatment group.  A listing of lot numbers will also be provided. 
7.2. Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations described in the study- specific Protocol Deviation Plan will be entered into 
the clinical trial management system.  Prior to database lock, all major protocol deviations that 
have been entered into the clinical trial management system will be exported to a file and 
integrated into the study data.  
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) are protocol deviations that might significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the study data or that might significantly affect a  
subject’s rights, safety, or well -being. An assessment of IPDs will be performed by a committee 
composed of NBI Clinical Development project team members prior to database lock and unblinding of the randomized treatment assignments. This committee will review a listing of all major protocol deviations reported in the study database and determine which deviations are IPDs. Important protocol deviations include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Failure to obtain informed consent from the subject prior to performing any study procedures. 
• Deviations from key inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Use of prohibited concomitant medications. 
• Error in drug dispensing which results in a subject not receiving intended randomized treatment.  
• Significant deviation from pr otocol-specified dosing regimen. 
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects with IPDs by [CONTACT_699803]. An additional “All Subjects” column will also be included.  
All major protocol deviations will be pres ented in a data listing and any that are classified as 
IPDs will be flagged in the listing.

    7.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables, and frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables. Results 
will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. An additional “All Subjects” column will also be included.  
Demographics include: 
• Age (years)  
• Sex 
• Ethnicity  
• Race  
Baseline subject characteristics include: 
• Primary clinical diagnosis  
• Age at first diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or mood disorder 
(years)  
• Age at TD diagnosis (years)  
• Height (measured at screening; cm)  
• Weight (presented in both pounds and kilograms) 
• Body mass index (BMI; calculated using height collected at the screening visit and weight collected at the Day -1 visit; kg/m
2) 
• CYP2D6 genotype 
7.4. Medical History and Medical Conditions Present at Entry  
Medical history will be summarized in a frequency table (number and percentage of subjects) by 
[CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) by  [CONTACT_1570], with SOCs and PTs within each SOC sorted 
alphabetically. An additional “All Subjects” column will also be included.  
7.5. Study Drug Dosing, Compliance, and Dose Reductions  
7.5.1. Compliance  
At the end of Weeks 1, 4, 6, and 7, subjects will return all used and unused study drug and a 
compliance check will be performed by [CONTACT_263823].  The 
site will then enter whether the subject’s dosing compliance since the previous visit was ≥80% into the eCRF. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group who are dosing compliant 
(defined as ≥80% ) will be presented for each postbaseline visit through Week [ADDRESS_950048] week of treatment 
and 80 mg until the end of Week 4 (Week [ADDRESS_950049] dose of placebo for subjects 
randomized to the valbenazine arm). If a subject is unable to tolerate the 80 mg dose, the daily dosage will be reduced to 40 mg.  Subjects unable to tolerate the 40 mg dose (or placebo) will be discontinued from the study.   
The number and percentage of subjects with dose reductions will be summarized by [CONTACT_677653] 4.  Dose reductions at unscheduled visits prior to Week [ADDRESS_950050] once during the W ithdrawal Period.  
Two versions of the frequency table will be presented: 
• Frequency of withdrawal -emergent AEs by [CONTACT_3592], with SOCs and PTs within each 
SOC sorted by [CONTACT_142538] (in the valbenazine/placebo arm);  
• Frequency of withdrawal- emergent AEs by [CONTACT_6214], with PT sorted by [CONTACT_142538] 
(in the valbenazine/placebo arm). 
8.2. Physician Withdrawal Checklist -20 
The PWC -20 is a validated 20- item physician -rated instrument that assesses potential symptoms 
of withdrawal on a severity scale in the following areas:  gastrointestinal, mood, sleep, motor, somatic, perception, and cognition.  Items are rated on a scale from 0 to 3 (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe), with the total score ranging from 0 to 60.   
The PWC -20 total score (observe d values  and intermediate missing imputed values ) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_6982] ( baseline; Week  4; Week 5 
Days 1, 3, 5, and 7; Week 6 Days 2, 4, and 7; Week 7 Days 2 and 4; and Week 7 Day 7).  The 
PWC -20 total scores will also be assessed categorically using the following ranges: total scores 
of [ADDRESS_950051]’s worst total score will be based on t he maximum of the subject’s 
highest observed total score or, in the case of dropout, the subject’s highest imputed total score  
(as described in Section 6.5.1).  The table will also include descriptive statistics for baseline and Week 4  (withdrawal baseline ) total scores and the change in the worst total score during the 
Withdrawal P eriod  from baseline and  withdrawal baseline  by [CONTACT_1570].   
Additionally, subjects will be assessed to determine if they have worsening symptoms between Weeks 5 and 7 (ie, during the W ithdrawal Period) when compared to their Week [ADDRESS_950052]’s symptoms are considered to be worsening if they meet at least one of the following criteria:  
• Subject presents with at least 5 new symptoms at any time during the W ithdrawal Period 
of moderate or severe degree (note: the new symptoms do not have to be reported at the same visit),  
• Subject reports a worsening of any of the symptoms (as recorded at the Week 4 visit) by [ADDRESS_950053] one visit during the W ithdrawal Period. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.   NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-TD4001 
Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 21  
    The number and percentage of subjects with worsening symptoms will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_121610] a table.   
8.3. Modified Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment  
The mCSSA is an 18- item instrument primarily drawn from symptoms commonly repo rted in the 
literature as being associated with early cocaine abstinence, including depression, fatigue, 
anhedonia, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance, and inability to concentrate.  The instrument 
includes additional symptoms such as paranoia, carbohydrate craving, bradycardia, and suicidality.  The scale has been modified to be specific to study drug (valbenazine or placebo) 
instead of cocaine; specifically, "cocaine" was replaced with "study drug" in question #4. Items 
are rated on scales of 0 to 7  or 0 to 8, with separate scale descriptions for each item.  The total

    10. EFFICACY  
10.1.1. Clinical Global Impression -Tardive Dyskinesia -Improvement  
The CGI -TD-I scale is a 7 -point scale (range; 1=very much improved to 7=very much worse) 
used to assess overall improvement in TD symptoms since the initiation of study drug dosing.  
For the CGI- TD-I, descriptive statistics will be presented f or observed values at Week 4 and 
Week 7 Day 7 visits by [CONTACT_1570].   
The CGI -TD-I categorical responses will be summarized in a table which will display the 
number and percentage of subjects in each category by [CONTACT_6982] (Week 4 and 
Week 7 Day 7).   
CGI-TD-I responders (number and percentage of subjects) will also be summarized in a 
frequency table by [CONTACT_6982].  A subject is classified as a responder if their CGI-
TD-I score is either a “1” (“very much improved”) or a “2” (“much improved”). 
10.1.2. Clinical Global Impression -Tardive Dyskinesia -Severity   
The CGI -TD-S scale is a 7 -point scale (range; 1=normal, not at all ill to 7=among the most 
extremely ill patient) used to assess the overall global severity of TD.  For the CGI- TD-S, 
descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline and postbaseline visits by [CONTACT_1570].  Both observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized.  An additional table will be presented with observed values and changes from Week 4 (withdrawal baseline) for assessments collected during the Withdrawal Period.   Figures showing the m ean (+/ -SD) for the 
observed and change from baseline values vs. study visits will be generated by [CONTACT_1570].   
The CGI -TD-S categorical responses will also be summarized in a table which will display the 
number and percentage of subjects in each category by [CONTACT_6982] (including 
baseline).

    11. SAFETY 
Results will be presented by [CONTACT_504983], as  described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
11.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events are recorded in the eCRF. Each AE will be coded to a SOC and PT using 
MedDRA (Version 21.0).   
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE not present prior to the initiation of study 
drug dosing, or is an already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency following 
the initiation of study drug dosing.  Investigators will be asked to respond “Yes” or “No” on the CRF as to whether the AE started after the subject took the first dose of study drug.  An AE with 
a response of “Yes” will be classified as a TEAE.  If the investigator’s response is missing, then 
the treatment emergent status will be derived based on the AE onset date and time relative to the date and time of the subject’s first dose of study drug.  If the AE onset date and time are 
unknown, it will be assumed that the AE is a TEAE.  If the AE onset time is unknown but the 
AE onset date is the same date as the first dose of study drug, it will be assumed that the AE is a TEAE.   
TEAEs will be summarized in frequency tables by [CONTACT_1570].  The frequency tables will 
include the number and percentage of unique subjects experiencing each event at least once during the DB treatment period.    
Two versions of the primary TEAE frequency tables will be presented: 
• Frequency of TEAEs by [CONTACT_3592], with SOCs and PTs within each SOC sorted by [CONTACT_142538] (in the valbenazine/placebo arm);  
• Frequency of TEAEs by [CONTACT_6214], with PT sorted by [CONTACT_142538] (in the valbenazine/placebo arm) . 
Overall summary tables will be provided which summarize the number and percentage of unique 
subjects with any TEAE, any TEAE leadi ng to dose reduction, any TEAE leading to study 
discontinuation, any serious TEAE, and any TEAE resulting in death in the DB treatment period.  
The summary tables will also include the frequency distribution of the maximum TEAE intensity (mild, moderate, s evere) reported for each subject  during the DB treatment period . 
11.1.1. Adverse Events Resulting in Premature Discontinuation from Study  
Summary tables of TEAEs resulting in early discontinuation from the study will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  The number and percentage of subjects with a TEAE resulting in study 
discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_459062] (presented in the same method as the 
primary TEAE table).   More than one AE can contribute to study discontinuation per subject. 
The first l ine of the table will display the number and percentage of subjects with at least one 
TEAE leading to study discontinuation.   
A listing of TEAEs resulting in premature study discontinuation will be provided which includes 
subject ID, treatment group, last treatment received prior to the onset time of the TEAE(s) leading to discontinuation, study day of the discontinuation, and other relevant information from

    the AE eCRF. Note that “last treatment received prior to the onset time of the TEAE[s] leading 
to discontinuation” reflects the actual dose level received prior to the AE.  
11.1.2. Adverse Events Resulting in Study Drug Dose Reductions  
Summary tables of TEAEs resulting in study drug dose reductions will be presented by [CONTACT_6490]. The number and percentage of subjects with a TEAE resulting in a dose reduction will be 
presented by [CONTACT_459062] (presented in the same method as the primary TEAE table). More than one AE can contribute to a dose reduction per subject. The first line of the table will display the number and percentage of subjects with at least one TEAE leading to dose reduction.  
11.1.3. Deaths and Other Serious Adverse Events  
Summary tables of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  The 
number and percentage of subjects with an SAE will be presented by [CONTACT_459062] (presented 
in the same method as the primary TEAE table).  The first line of the table will display the 
number and percentage of subjects with at least one SAE.   
Separate listings of SAEs and fatal TEAEs will also be provided. Each listing will include 
subject ID, treatment group, last treatment received prior to the onset time of the SA E or fatal 
TEAE, study day of the SAE or fatal TEAE, and any additional relevant information from the 
AE eCRF.  
11.2. Clinical Laboratory Data  
The hematology and clinical chemistry data will be summarized with descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_522704] , Week 4, and Week 7 Day 7. Both observed values and changes from 
baseline will be summarized.  
Shift tables will be presented for selected clinical laboratory variables based on the reference 
range -based categories of “Low,” “Normal,” or “High.” A clinical laboratory variable value will 
be assigned to one of these three categories according to the reference ranges provided by [CONTACT_679074].  
Two shift tables will be presented by [CONTACT_25991]: shifts from baseline to Week 4 (or last available assessment in the V albenazine/ Placebo Period) and shifts from baseline to Week 7 Day 
7 (or last available assessment in the W ithdrawal Period).  Each shift table will have three rows 
and three columns, with rows reflecting the reference range categ ory at baseline, and columns 
reflecting the reference range category at the specified postbaseline visit. A “Total” row and “Total” column will also be included. Subjects with a missing baseline value or who do not have postbaseline data will not be included in the tables for that variable. The number and percentage of subjects in each shift category will be displayed in the table; percentages will be based on the number of subjects included in the table. 
Shift tables will be presented for the following cli nical laboratory variables:  
• aspartate aminotransferase (AST),  
• alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  
• alkaline phosphatase (ALP),

    • gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT),  
• total bilirubin,  
• creatine kinase,  
• creatinine,  
• blood urea nitrogen,  
• white blood cell count,  
• absolute neutrophil count,  
• hemoglobin, and  
• platelet count.  
Summaries of sponsor- defined potentially clinically significant (PCS) values will be presented 
for the following clinical laboratory variables: ALT, AST, creatine kinase, GGT, total bilirubin, 
white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, creatinine, and BUN. The number and 
percentage of subjects with PCS values that are reported at any postbaseline visit (scheduled or 
unscheduled) within each treatment period will be summarized by [CONTACT_699804]. The criteria for identifying PCS clinical laboratory values are provided in Table 3. 
Table 3: Potentially Clinically Significant Criteria for Clinical Laboratory Variables  
Variable  PCS Threshold  
ALT  >[ADDRESS_950058] (upper limit of normal) 
AST  >[ADDRESS_950059] 
Creatine kinase  >[ADDRESS_950060] 
GGT  >[ADDRESS_950061] 
Total bilirubin  >1.[ADDRESS_950062] 
White blood cell count ≤2.8 x 1000/µL  
Absolute neutrophil count  <1.5 x 1000/µL  
Creatinine  >1.5 x baseline value or > 1.[ADDRESS_950063] 
BUN  >30 mg/dL (> 10.71 mmol/L) 
 
Repeat clinical laboratory samples may be collected at any time during this study due to either 
missing or abnormal results. The general rule for summarizing these data is to include the original sample results in summary tables. Exceptions to this rule ar e: (1) all available lab values 
will be used in the PCS tables and (2) if there are missing results from the original lab samples at screening, the results of a repeat screening sample will be substituted for the missing results in summary tables.

    11.3. Vital S igns 
The vital signs data, including orthostatic blood pressures and heart rate (calculated as standing 
value minus supi[INVESTIGATOR_699793]), will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_699805] 7 Day 7.  Observed values, changes from baseline, and changes from Week 4 (to post Week 4 visits) will be summarized.  
Summaries of sponsor-defined PCS values will be presented for systolic blood pressure, diastolic 
blood pressure, and heart rate. The number and percentage of subjects with PCS values that are 
reported at any postbaseline visit (scheduled or unscheduled) wi thin each treatment period will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_699804]. The criteria for identifying PCS vital signs values are provided in Table 4.

Both supi[INVESTIGATOR_699794]. 
11.4. Body Weight  
The body weight data (in units of kilograms) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_699806] 7 Day 7. Both 
observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized.  
11.5. Electrocardiogram  
The triplicate values of the quantitative ECG variables (heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and Fridericia’s correction of QT interval [QTcF]) measured at each visit will be averaged (and rounded to one decimal place) for the purpose of analysis. For the categorical ECG interpretation variable (the investigator’s assessment of the ECG as “Normal”, “Abnormal, not Clinically Si gnificant”, or “Abnormal, Clinically Significant”), which is also reported in 
triplicate, the value that represents the greatest degree of abnormality will be used in all summary tables. If less than three values are recorded at an assessment, then the average/greatest abnormality of the available value(s) will be used.  
The quantitative ECG variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_522704], Week 1, Week 4, and Week [ADDRESS_950064]’s highest reported postbaseline value (including values reported at unscheduled visits) within each treatment period will be used to determine in which category(s) the subject will be counted. The averaged triplicate values will be  used when 
determining each subject’s highest reported values. 
Two categorical summaries will be presented for the QT and QTcF intervals (each interval will 
be summarized separately) for each treatment period. For the first summary, the number and percenta ge of subjects in each treatment group whose highest reported QT or QTcF postbaseline 
value meets the following thresholds will be summarized: 
• Greater than 450 msec 
• Greater than 480 msec 
• Greater than [ADDRESS_950065] QT or QTcF increase from their baseline value meets the following thresholds:  
• Increase greater than 30 msec 
• Increase greater than 60 msec 
11.6. Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS data will be presented in the following summaries:  
• Screening/lifetime assessment by [CONTACT_28459] “All Subjects”  
• Screening/past 3 months assessment by [CONTACT_28459] “All Subjects” 
• Baseline (Day -1) assessment by [CONTACT_28459] “All Subjects” 
• Each treatment period by [CONTACT_1570].  
Each summary will display the number and percentage of subjects who report “Yes” to specific C-SSRS items or categories of items (a category is assigned a “Yes” value if a “Yes” is reported 
for any item in the category). These C- SSRS items and categories are as follows:  
• Suicidal Ideation Items  
(1) Wish to be dead 
(2) Non-specific active suicidal thoughts  
(3) Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act 
(4) Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan  
(5) Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent 
• Suicidal Ideation Category: Any of items (1) through (5) 
• Suicidal Behavior Items (not reported for the screening/past 3 months assessment)  
(6) Preparatory acts or behavior  
(7) Aborted attempt 
(8) Interrupted attempt  
(9) Non-fatal suicide attempt 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.   NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-TD4001 
Statistical Analysis Plan   09Oct2019 
 30  
    (10) Completed suicide 
• Suicidal Behavior Category: Any of items (6) through (10) 
• Suicidal Ideation or Behavior Category: Any of items (1) through (10) 
For the “all postbaseline assessments” summary, each subject’s C -SSRS responses for all 
postbaseline assessments during the treatment period will be evaluated, and a “Yes” response for 
any assessment will be considered as a “Yes” for  the subject.  
In addition to the summaries described above, shift tables comparing postbaseline suicidal ideation scores to baseline scores will be presented. The shift table scores are defined as the following: 
0 = No suicidal ideation 1 = Wish to be dead 2 = Non- specific active suicidal thoughts  
3 = Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act 4 = Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan  
5 = Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent 
The shift tables will display the number and percentage of subjects within each cell of a 6 x 6 table for each treatment group, with the rows representing the baseline score and the columns representing the maximum score recorded across all postbaseline assessments (including both scheduled and unscheduled visits) within each treatment period. Subjects missing either a baseline score or all postbaseline scores will not appear in the table.  
11.7. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale  
The BARS is a 4 -item scale to assess the presence and severity of drug -induced akathisia.  This 
scale includes both objective items (eg, observed restlessness) and subjective items (eg, subject’s 
awareness of restlessness and related distress) rated on a scale of 0 to 3, together with a global 
assessment of akathisia.  Global assessment is rated on a scale of 0 to 5 (0=absent; 1=questionable; 2=mild akathisia; 3=moderate akathisia; 4=marked akathisia; 5=severe 
akathisia).  The total score is calculated as the sum of the objective and su bjective items (items 1 -
3 of the assessment) and ranges from 0 to 9.  If any one of these 3 items is not scored (ie, has a 
missing value), the associated total score will be set equal to missing.  
The total score and the global assessment score at each visi t (baseline, Week 4, and Week 7 Day 
7) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Changes from baseline at 
each postbaseline visit will also be summarized . 
11.8. Simpson -Angus Scale  
The SAS is a 10 -item scale to evaluate the presence and severity of drug -induced parkinsonism 
and other extrapyramidal symptoms.  Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 scale of increasing severity 
with definitions given for each anchor point.  The global score is calculated as the average of the 
10 items.  If any one of these 10 items is not scored (ie, has a missing value), the associated 
global score will be set equal to missing.

    The global score at each visit (baseline, Week 4, and Week 7 Day 7) will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Chan ges from baseline at each postbaseline visit will 
also be summarized . 
11.9. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale  
The MADRS is a 10 -item scale designed to measure changes in severity of depressive 
symptoms.  Each item is scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) w ith increasing number value 
indicating increasing severity for each item with anchor points provided at 2-point intervals. The 
total score ranges from 0 to 60.  If any one of these 10 items is not scored (ie, has a missing 
value), the associated total scor e will be set equal to missing.  
The total score at each visit (baseline, Week 4, and Week 7 Day 7) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570]. Changes from baseline at each postbaseline visit will 
also be summarized . 
11.10.  Prior and Concom itant Medications  
Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_202024] (WHO) Drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) Level 3 category (or Level 2 if there is not an applicable Level 3 category) and  preferred name.  
Medications will be assigned to one, two, or three study periods based on the medication start and stop dates relative to study drug dosing and W ithdrawal Period: 
• Pre-study/screening: medications with a start date prior to study drug dosing  
• During the V albenazine/ Placebo P eriod: medications ongoing at the time of first 
dose of study drug or with a start date after the first dose of study drug, 
excluding medications started after the first dose of study drug in the W ithdrawal 
Period (Week 5 Day 1) 
• During the W ithdrawal Period: medications ongoing at the Week 5 Day 1 visit 
(first dosing day in the W ithdrawal Period) or with a start date on or after the 
Week 5 Day 1 vi sit. 
A given medication can be assigned to multiple study periods in the tabular summaries, 
depending on its start and end dates. 
The number and percentage of subjects using medications in each WHO Drug ATC category 
(Level 3/preferred name) will be summari zed by [CONTACT_324428]. A subject 
may take the same medication more than once or multiple medications for a subject may be 
classified under the same ATC level or preferred name. A subject is counted only once for each 
level of medication classification within a summary. An “All Subjects” column will be included in these summaries.

MIneralocorticoid  Receptor Antagonism for Cardiovas cuLar hEalth in HIV 
The MIRACLE HI V Study  
 
Deta iled Protocol Version 17:11/8/[ADDRESS_1054687] shown increased activation 
of the renin -angiotensin –aldosterone system (RAAS). The availabilit y of newer 
antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ART) with improved efficacy, safety and tolerance has allowed 
HIV patients to achieve good virologic [ADDRESS_1054688] revealed that cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
accounts for approximately 10% of all deaths1,2 and CVD is 1.5 -2 fold higher in the HIV 
population compared to a matched non -HIV population.3,4 This proposal will provide 
evidence supporting mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade as a novel strategy for 
CVD risk reducti on in HIV. We present significant data demonstrating for the first time 
impaired physiological regulation of RAAS leading to excess RAAS activation among 
HIV patients. We demonstrate significant increases in aldosterone linked to metabolic 
abnormalities, i ncluding visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance and inflammation in 
HIV and further hypothesize that RAAS activation has critical effects on CVD in HIV.  
 
Unique RAAS physiology may modulate increased burden of CVD in HIV. The 
RAAS is an important h ormone system, which classically regulates blood volume and 
sodium balance through MR activation in epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771]. Compelling data from animal 
and human studies suggest that RAAS activity may also contribute to the development 
of vascular and myocardi al injury, largely through stimulatory effects on inflammation 
and fibrosis. These data and new observations by [CONTACT_768850] a compelling management strategy aimed at reducing CV 
related morbidity and mortalit y in this at -risk HIV population, for whom comprehensive 
strategies to reduce CVD are lacking.  
 
HIV patients have increased risk of vascular inflammation and subclinical 
atherosclerosis, which may be addressed by [CONTACT_768851]. Using aortic FDG -PET, 
we have shown direct evidence of increased arterial inflammation among HIV patients.[ADDRESS_1054689] often to 
be noncalcified with high risk features, including positive remodeling and low 
attenuation —plaque characteristics more vulnerable to rupture.[ADDRESS_1054690] established a significant link between noncalcified plaque and specific markers of 
inflammation and immune activation, soluble CD163 and CD14 and Lp -PLA 2, in HIV as 
opposed to traditional risk factors.11-13 Moreover, progression of carotid intima -media 
thickness over 24 months was associ ated with increased baseline urinary aldosterone 
excretion (preliminary data r=0.67, P=0.049) in HIV. Taken together, these data suggest 
inflamed coronary vasculature and high risk plaque in HIV, in whom our preliminary data 
suggest a potential linkage of inflammation and atherosclerosis to RAAS activation. In 
this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that M blockade addresses these unique

Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is a physiologic marker of vascular function of the 
coronary be d, which is reduced in HIV. CFR, the ratio of maximally stimulated to rest 
coronary blood flow (CBF), is well -validated to characterize coronary vasculature 
function.14-16 Both large vessel coronary lesions (i.e. coronary artery disease [CAD]) and 
microvascular dysfunction may lead to impaired CFR.  Our group and others 
demonstrated that impaired CFR predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in non -
HIV po pulations. Specifically, we found impaired CFR (median 1.9) to be associated with 
a 4.9 -fold increase in CV mortality among non -HIV patients.17 Furthermore, CV mortality 
is increased among non -HIV patients with impaired vs. normal flow reserve (4.2 vs. 
0.4%/yr).17 In addition, 59% of patients with non -obstructive  CAD have a reduced CFR 
<1.[ADDRESS_1054691] examined CFR in HIV. A short 5 week study reported reduced CFR in HIV 
patients after initiation of ART.19 In this proposal, we present new preliminary data 
demonstrating greater impairment of CFR in HIV compared to non -HIV 
subjects20(1.74±0.73 vs. 3.88±0.70) assessed by [CONTACT_768852], the gold standard for 
evaluation of CFR. These data highlight CFR as a diagnostic tool to uniquely capture 
those asymptomatic patients of inter mediate CVD risk with potential limitations to flow 
reserve of the coronary microvasculature, which may contribute to ischemia, a clinical 
scenario relevant to HIV patients with increased subclinical plaque progression. 
Importantly, we show that MR blockad e improves CFR, suggesting it may be a useful 
strategy to improve vascular dysfunction in HIV.  Reduced stress my ocardial blood flow 
on cardia c MRI may be a nother marker of reduced myocardial  perfusion  and has been 
independently  associated with major advers e cardiovascular  events among those 
without known CVD .  
 
In addition to reduced CFR, HIV patients demonstrate myocardial fibrosis and 
diastolic dysfunction which may also uniquely contribute to CVD in HIV. 
Myocardial fibrosis is characterized by [CONTACT_768853][INVESTIGATOR_768832].21,[ADDRESS_1054692] validated 
to qua ntify myocardial extracellular volume ( ECV) and is a standard method for non -
invasive assessment of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in lieu of an 
endomyocardial biopsy. Data suggests a relative increase in ECV by 10% is linked to a 
50% increase in adv erse CV events.[ADDRESS_1054693] et al. demonstrated that a majority (76% ) of ART treated 
HIV patients had evide nce of myocardial fibrosis on cardiac MRI compared to only 14% 
of well -matched non -HIV patients.28 Furthermore, a meta -analysis reported that diastolic 
dysfun ction is prevalent in approximately 43% of HIV patients.[ADDRESS_1054694] there been any interventional studies of strategies to regress 
changes in cardiac remodeling to prevent CV events in HIV.

account for 25% of the increased risk of CVD in the HIV compared to the non -HIV 
population.3,[ADDRESS_1054696] or removing the aldosterone source through adrenalectomy reduces 
vascular damage and myoc ardial inflammation . These beneficial effects of MR blockade 
are independent of changes in blood pressure (BP).[ADDRESS_1054697] (eplerenone or spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]) improves coronary vascular function marked

Increased RAAS activation contributes to inflammation and metabolic 
complications in HIV, suggesting the utility of MR blockade for CVD in HIV. 
Together the Co -PI’s Grinspoon and Adler conducted the first c omprehensive 
investigation of the RAAS in HIV. Initial data revealed increased urinary aldosterone in 
HIV vs. controls in association with increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and 
HbA1c.[ADDRESS_1054700] time in HIV the specific contribution of MR signaling to multiple

vascular dysfunction, abnormal collagen deposition, vascular and myocardial 
inflammation, and increased oxidative stress65. The burden of structural and functional

which substantially reduces the post -processing time for quantification of myocard ial

Nutritional Analysis and Dietary Protocol  
Protein, carbohydrate, fat, micronut rient, die tary supplements and alcohol intake will be 
determined  from 4 -day food records (Nutr ition Data systems). For 6 days prior to 
Basel ine Visit 2 (RAAS characterization), subjects will be provided low sodium meals 
and snacks (10 mEq daily sodium, 100  mEq potas sium,  1000 mg calcium, water intake 
ad lib) and they w ill be asked not to consume an y food not provided to them, in cluding 
no caff eine or alcohol.  For 3 days prior to Baseline Visit 1 and 12 M onth Visit, subjects 
will be provided sodium supplemen ts through  broth packets as needed to achieve 
urinary Na >200mmo l/24 hr, and they will be aske d not to consume any food not 
provided to them , including no caffeine or alcohol. Urine aliquots for sodium and 
creatinine and 24hr urine sodium will be measured for the pe riod immediately prior to 
each visit to ensure complia nce with the diet.

Optiona l Substudy:  
Cardiac 2 -deoxy -2-18F-Fluorodeoxygluc ose Positron Emission Tomograp hy/ 
Computed Tomography  (18F-FDG -PET/CT)  
An approach to detecting macrophage activity in atherosclerotic plaques uses FDG as 
the contrast radiotracer for positro n emission  tomo graphy (PET). FDG competes with 
glucose for uptak e into metabolically active ce lls, including macrophages in 
atherosclerotic plaques, and is trapped inside cells after phosphorylation. FDG -PET can 
image metabolic activity (as a marker of pla que inflam matio n) quantitatively in 
atherosclerotic plaques71,72, has been shown to have high reproducibil ity73, and 
correlates with histologic data72. Taki ng advantage of the myocardium’s preference fo r 
free fatty acids over glucose as an energy source, to minimize myocardial glucose 
uptake in order to better visual ize corona ry plaque activity, patients will be asked to 
adhere t o an Atkins style diet for the  evening prior to imaging and then to fast ove rnight.  
A fasting glucose will be checked prior to the start of the study.  Cardiac PET/CT imaging 
will be performed two hours following intravenous administrati on of approximately 10mCi 
of 18F-FDG. Imaging will  be performed using a Siemens Biograph PET/CT system 
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, [LOCATION_013]) . Semi automated co -registration of 
PET and CT images will be accomplish ed us ing the Siemens MultiModality WorkPlace 
TrueD (Fo rchheim, [LOCATION_013]).  Once co -registered, the standardized uptake value 
(SUV) of FDG will be measured in various arteries. The SUV is the decay -corrected 
tissue concentration of FDG (in kBq/ml) divided by  [CONTACT_434993] 
(kBq/g). Target -to-background ratio (TBR) will be  calculated for each vascular segment 
as the s egment SUV divided by [CONTACT_768872].  All images will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_768873] -PET/CT  blinded t o treatment assignment.  
 
 
VI.  Biostatistical Analysis   
Statistical Consideration:  Aim I:  The primary endpoint is change in CFR a ssessed 
by [CONTACT_768874] . Secondary endpoints will include 
the following: ch ange in sICAM and s VCAM. Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test  will be used to assess 
for nor mality of distribution, and variables that are not n ormally dis tributed will be 
appropriately transformed prior to inclusion in multivariable models. We will compare 
the change in CFR  from mo nths 0 to 1 2 between treatment gro ups (eplerenone vs. 
placebo) us ing student’s t -test for variables that are normally  distribute d or Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for variables that are not normally distributed. We will also compare 
changes in sICAM and s VCAM over [ADDRESS_1054725] end  of study testing. The analysis  
will be intention to treat (ITT). In order to prope rly handle subjects with missing 
outcomes (those who withdrew before 12 months), we will apply longitudinal linear 
mixed effects mo del analysis with r andom subject level int ercepts and time slopes by

at random co ndition, which will  be carried out by [CONTACT_57971] g augmented data sets created b y 
multiple imputation. A sensitivity analysis will b e performed  to include only those 
subjects who completed the study. Baseline variables will be compared between 
treatment groups, a nd any variable tha t is statistically diff erent between groups will be 
controlled for using multivariable modeling. It may be  that subje cts with more significant 
RAAS activation and dysregulation in aldosterone at baseline) are more responsive to 
eplerenon e. We will phenotyp e the RAAS in subjects at the low sodium visit and, 
guided by [CONTACT_627747], may use aldosterone levels prior to interven tion as an index of 
RAAS activation and a covariate in assessing treatment response, to determine if 
eplerenone is more effective in the su bpopulation with greate r baseline aldosterone 
dysregul ation and RAAS activation. Covariates that will be c onsidered f or inclusion in 
modeling, include variables that differ at baseline and those variables that may affect 
vascular dysfunc tion, inflammation,  fibrosis and plaque (a ge, race, gender, BP, 
tobacco/i llicit drug use, family history of CVD, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and glucose), H IV parameters (viral 
load, CD4, and duration of HIV and ART use) and compliance. This will permit us to 
assess relevant factors that may me diate the effect of epl erenone on CFR in HIV and 
interactions between HIV and traditional risk factors con tributing t o eplerenone effects. 
Moreover, we will compare changes in CFR and vascular biomarkers over 12 mo nths 
using regression a nalysis. We will pe rform Pearson’s correla tion for variables that are 
normally distributed and Spearman’s correlation for var iables that  are non -normally 
distributed. If we see significant changes in specific biomarkers that correlate with 
changes in CFR, then we will run th ose specific biomarkers  from stored serum at earlier 
time points (e.g. 6 mo nths) to see if early changes i n biomarker s can predict changes in 
CFR, as well as predict response to MR blockade. Biostatistician Role:  The 
biostatistician  will monitor data colle ction, quality and comp leteness of the study 
throughou t all years of the grant. The biostatistician will c reate the r andomization plan, 
using a permuted block algorithm, stratified for gender , statin use , and presence of 
plaque  and provi de the list to the study pharmacist (inves tigators will remain blinded). 
Identical placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_1714]. Sample Size  Determination: 
Preliminary data from HIV subjects presented in this grant demonstrate a CFR

Based on this data, we now provide  a range of detecta ble differences using 8 5% power 
and a revised increase d sample size of 80 subjects, with an attrition rate  of 15%,

plasma IL -6, MCP -1, sCD163, sCD14 and serum hsCRP, galectin -3, cardiotrophin 1, 
lipocalin, PI[INVESTIGATOR_680], PI[INVESTIGATOR_120861], BNP . Statistical algorithms as detailed in Aim I will be applied to

biomarkers over 12 mos comparing eplerenone vs. pla cebo will be assessed using ITT 
and longitudinal linear effects modeling with imputation and sensitivity analyses. By 
[CONTACT_768878] , we will also a ssess whether 
improvements in ECV from MR blockade will relate to improvements  in diastolic strain. 
Sample Size Determination: Thiara et al. show mean±SD ECV 0.28±0.04 vs.

Aim III:  For this aim, t he endpoint  is change in noncalcified plaque volume assessed by 
[CONTACT_768879]. Secondary endpoints will include: change in high risk plaque morphology 
(num bers of l ow attenuation and po sitively r emodeled plaque) by [CONTACT_768879] . 
Statistical algorithms as detailed in Aim I will be applied to these specific endpoints. 
Moreover, the relationship between baseline CFR and non -calcified plaque volume will 
be asses sed. Last ly, we will also dete rmine whet her longitudinal changes in coronary 
plaque are associated with changes in biomarkers of inflammation and immune 
activation to understand the potential relationship of these inflammatory indices as 
markers of improve d indices  of the coronary vasc ulature in  response to MR blockade in 
the HIV. Sample Size Determination: In our prior studies assessing plaque in HIV, the 
median [IQR] change of noncalcified plaque volume over 12 mos was 6.7[ -6.5, 29.8] 
mm3.13  We assumed a conservative SD of 18mm3 taking the mean of the IQR. This 
study enroll ing 80 subjects with 68 evaluab le subjects will attain 85% power at a two 
sided α of 0.[ADDRESS_1054734] a difference in noncalcified plaque volume of 13.3mm3 between

power  at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1054735] 0.74 SD after treatment 
with eplerenone vs. placebo.  
 
Aim IV:  For this aim, t he endpoint  is change in MCP -1 between the low sodium and 
liberal sodium diets. Secondary endpoints will include: change in hs CRP, p entraxin3, 
IL6, Lp-PLA 2, sCD14, sCD163. We will test the change in biomarkers between the RAAS 
activated (sodium restricted) and RAAS suppressed states (sodium loaded) using the 
paired Student’s t -test for normally distributed variables or Wilcoxon s igned -rank test for 
non-normally distributed variables. We will apply Pearson’s correlation for variables that 
are normally distributed and Spearman’s correlation for variables that are non -normally 
distributed to determine whether there is a significant c orrela tion between al dosterone 
during the RAAS activated state and TBR. Covariates considered for inclusion in 
modeling include variables that may affect vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and 
plaque (age, race, sex, BP, tobacco/illicit drug use, family h istory  of CVD, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , 
glucose), and HIV parameters (viral load, CD4, duration of HIV and ART use). This will 
permit us to assess relevant factors that may mediate the effect of aldosterone on 
inflammation in HIV and interactions between HIV and traditiona l risk factors contri buting 
to inflammation. Sample Size Determination: Preliminary data in HIV presented in this

Aim V : For this aim, t he endpoint  is change in TBR assessed by [CONTACT_80622] 18F-FDG -
PET/CT. Secondary endpoints include: change in hsCRP, pentraxin3,  IL6, Lp -PLA2, 
MCP -1, sCD14, sCD163. Statistical algorithms as detailed in Aim I will be applied to 
these specific endpoints. Similar to Aim I, changes in TBR and inflammatory biomarkers 
over 12 mos comparing eplerenone vs. placebo will be assessed using I TT and 
longitud inal linear effects modeling with imputation and sensitivity analyses. We will also 
determine whether longitudinal changes in arterial inflammation are associated with 
changes in biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation to understand  the 
potential relationship of these inflammatory indices as markers of improved indices of 
the coronary vasculature in response to MR blockade in the HIV. Sample Size 
Determination: In our prior studies assessing arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG PET, the 
mean±SD  (95% CI ) TBR at baseline among HIV subjects was 2.23 ± 0.45 (2.07, 
2.40)mm3.[ADDRESS_1054738]

Aim VI:  In an exploratory analysis, s ubjects will be enrolled using  a factorial sampling 
strategy into 4 analytic strata (low VAT/absence of plaque, low VAT/ presence of pla que, 
high VAT/absence of plaque, high VAT/presence of plaque). Using this design, we will 
first analyze whether there are differences in markers of inflammation and heart disease 
by [CONTACT_768880] (main effects model comparing presence and absen ce of exc ess VA T) 
using student’s t -test for variables that are normally distributed or Wilcoxon rank sum 
test for variables that are not normally distributed. Based on the ex clusion criteria excess 
VAT is determined to be >110cm2.  After assessing for dif ferences in VAT  in the main 
effects model, we will examine the degree to which markers of inflammation and heart 
disease are related to coronary plaque in both the high and low VAT groups, and 
whether this relationship is stronger in the coronary plaque g roup as a result  of 
increased VAT  using ANOVA for variable that are normally distributed and Kruskal -

VII.  Risks and Discomforts  
Blood Drawing : The total blood drawn for subjects completing the study is equiva lent to 
approximately  560 ml (over a period of 12 months).  This quantity of blood drawing does 
not pose excessive risk to subjects. By [CONTACT_2163], the Red Cross allows a healthy 
adult to donate [ADDRESS_1054741] s with a 
hemoglobin <  10 mg/dL w ill be excluded from the study.  There will be minimal risk and

The MIRACLE HI V Study  
 
Deta iled Protocol Version 17:11/8/[ADDRESS_1054742] clean insertion techniques will be utilized to minimize risk of 
infection.  
 
Intravenous Catheter Placement : There are minor risks and discomforts associated 
with having an intravenous line and with injection o f contras t agen t through the 
intravenous line, including the possibility of bleeding, pain, inflammation (redness and 
swelling), and leaking of contrast agent outside of the vein at the site of the IV.  These 
problems usually self -resolve or only require m inor trea tments , such as application of an 
ice-pack or slight pressure for a few minutes.  
 
CT Abdomen : This study is obtained once during the screening process to evaluate for 
visceral adipose tissue area. The radiation risk associated with the single slic e CT scan  
of the abdomen is approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1054743] study . If any of these findings are clinically significant, the subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study and referred to the primary care physician for further 
evaluation.  
 
Coronary CTA and Radiation : With the implementation of m easures t o limi t radiation 
exposure, the total dose of the coronary CTA examination will be approximately 4 mSv, 
depending on the weight, gender and heart rate. The added radiation from the two CTA 
scans (screening and follow -up) will be 8 mSv. This is equ ivalent t o the amount of 
radiation an individual would normally get in 2 years and 7 months from natural 
background sources from the earth and the sky.   State -of-the-art dose reduction 
techniques at MGH allow the dose to be substantially lower than histori cally rep orted 
median coronary CTA doses. Iterative image reconstruction algorithms allow for further 
reductions in radiation dose.  These techniques allow for up to a 50% reduction in 
radiation dose compared with previous generation protocols. Massachusett s General  
Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_768844] -generation dual -source [ADDRESS_1054744] with evidence of seve re 
corona ry art ery stenosis, defined as ≥50% stenosis in the left main coronary artery or 
>70% stenosis in the other major coronary arteries will be withdrawn from the study prior 
to further evaluative imaging and procedures and prior to randomization to s tudy drug . 
Subjects with evidence of clinically significant atherosclerosis will be referred to a 
cardiologist for appropriate evaluation and treatment.  
 
CTA contrast medium : CTA requires the intravenous administration of iodinated 
contrast medium. These contrast media have been known to cause renal failure, 
particularly in subjects with a pre -existing renal impairment. Adequate hydration will also 
be emphasized to each study participant. The contrast dose in coronary CTA has 
decreased with the introductio n of fast er sca nners. The dose required will be between [ADDRESS_1054745] media may cause skin reactions or in 
very rare occasions result in breathing difficulty and hypotension. Subjects will be closely

Additional s afety criteria will be implemented by [CONTACT_768881] >1.5 mg/ml or estimated GFR<60

acidosis will b e avoided .  
 
Nitroglycerin : Nitroglycerin is commonly used in subjects with angina pectoris and is 
generally considered safe. The side effects and risks of nitroglycerin are generally mild 
and of short duration and include hypotension, tachyarrhythmia, hea dache, 
lighthea dedness, and visual disturbance. Subjects who are on sildenafil, tadalafil, or 
vardenafil (PDE5 inhibitor) will need to stop these drugs at least 5 days prior to receiving 
nitroglycerin on the day of the coronary CTA scan. If baseline systol ic blood pressu re is 
below 90, nitroglycerin will not be given. If a participant’s blood pressure were to drop 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_768845], standard clinical care will be 
provided. Other contraindications to nitroglycerin include severe ao rtic s tenosis or 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  
 
Cardiac PET and Radiation : The two cardiac PET scans will involve exposure to 
radiation for research purposes.  Subjects will receive a research related rest and stress 
13N-ammonia PET sca n before and af ter a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist . 13N-
ammonia (20 mCi) will be injected twice prior to rest and stress scans. Each PET scan 
will expose subjects to 3.36 mSv of radiation. The added radiation from the two PET 
scans (b aseline and fo llow-up) will b e 6.[ADDRESS_1054747] regadenoson /adenosine -stimulated coronary blood flow study for this 
condition. Any subject with evidence of clinical significant ischemia will be withdrawn 
from the study prior to furt her evalu ative studies and prior to randomization to study 
drugs. Subjects with evidence of ischemia will be referred to a cardiologist for 
appropriate evaluation and treatment. In addition, there may be incidental findings on the 
PET study.  If any of thes e finding s are clinically significant, the subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study and referred to the primary care physician for further 
evaluation.  
 
Regadenoson/ Adenosine : Regadenoson or a denosine will  be administered during the 
cardiac PET and MRI st udies. Regadeno son stress and adenosine stress have been  
used routinely for many years for evaluating patients with known or suspected CAD.  
Regadenoson and/or adenosine will be administered at the radiologist’s discretion.  The 
most common side effects asso ciated wi th the  Regadenoson or adenosine infusion 
include: flushing, chest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], headache, mild 
hypotension and heart block. These side effects are usually mild and self -limiting. If they 
are severe in intensity,  aminophy lline IV (1 mg/kg) will be given as per standard protocol. 
Subjects will have their blood pressure and heart rate monitored closely by a physician 
and/or nurse in attendance at all times. The protocol will be immediately discontinued if 
clinically  signific ant at rial or ventricular arrhythmias are observed.   
 
MIneralocorticoid  Receptor Antagonism for Cardiovas cuLar hEalth in HIV 
The MIRACLE HI V Study  
 
Deta iled Protocol Version 17:11/8/2022                    - 20 - Radiation Exposure : The total estimated radiation exposure from Aims 1 and  3 is 
approximately 15.27  mSv.  Aim 2 has no specific radiation associated.  This is 
equivalent to the amount of radiatio n an indi vidual  would normally get in 4  years and 
11 months from natural background sources from the earth and the sky.  To minimize 
radiation exposure, coronary CTA dose reduction techniques including ECG -triggered 
tube modulation and automatic exposure co ntrol wil l be a pplied when possible . Larger 
patients  can get higher doses (up to twice that of an average size patient) from any CT 
exam compared to the mean dose.  If a patient has received previous radiation 
exposure prior to participation in the study, w e will al so cal culate the total radiation 
exposure and if prior cumulative exposure during the 12 months prior to the study 
exceeds 15 mSv (which is 30% of the maximum recommended annual dose for 
research subjects set by [CONTACT_768882]) , then th e subj ect will 
be excluded from participating. Pregnancy test will be performed prior to CT or PET 
scanning in women. (See also sections for coronary CTA and cardiac PET above for 
specific radiation exposure.)  
 
Abdominal MRI and Cardiac MRI : Subjects will  be ca refully screened for metal 
implants such as surgical clips or pacemakers prior to MRI scanning. Sources of 
discomfort during the MRI study may include noise and possible claustrophobia.  
Subjects will be given earplugs due to the loud noises during th e test .  Subjects who feel 
uncomfortable in confined spaces may have difficulty in the narrow cylinder of the MRI, 
and the MRI can be stopped at any time at the subject’s request. There are no known 
hazards for pregnant women; however, pregnancy i s an excl usion for this study. The 
MRI has the potential, during normal routine use, to cause localized warming of the skin 
and the underlying tissues. If the subject experiences discomfort due to warming, the 
procedure will be stopped.  Radio -frequency pow er deposi tion i s strictly controlled by [CONTACT_768883], in conformance with the applicable FDA guidelines, and cannot be 
overridden by [CONTACT_28024]. An IV line, placed just prior to the MRI exam, may cause 
tenderness, swelling, warmth at the injection si te, and r arely infection. There is no 
radiation exposure other than exposure to the magnetic and non -ionizing radio -
frequency fields, which meet FDA guidelines.  All pulse sequences used for this study 
have been approved by [CONTACT_768884] M RI studie s, and  received FDA 
clearance, except for the sequence that is used for perfusion imaging, which is a “works -
in-progress” package that has undergone safety testing by [CONTACT_768885], 
and been licensed for use to Brigham and Women’s Hospit al. A sin gle ax ial slice of the 
abdomen will be obtained with MRI. The total amount of time in the  magnet will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_1054748] : Gadolinium contrast has been wide ly used a nd is very well 
tolerated. Gadolinium will be administered with the cardiac MRI studies. No contrast is 
administered with the abdomen MRI. The most common adverse reactions of gadolinium 
are transient headache (3.6%), injection site coldness (3.6% ), and na usea ( 1.5%).  
There is a very rare occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis after gadolinium, but 
this has only been reported in subjects with impaired renal function.  All subjects will 
have a serum creatinine assessed prior to each MRI and subjects wi th ser um creatinine 
>1.5 mg/ml or estimated GFR<[ADDRESS_1054749] agent will be used (Gadoterate meglumine, DOTAREM,

gadolinium -bound contrast agents to reduce the chance of any exposure to Gd3+ ions.  
 
Incidental Findings : Incidental non -coronary and coronary findings may be obtained, 
and significant non -coronary and coronary findings will be communicated to  the subj ect 
and provider  as appropriate .  
 
Standardized High Sodium Diet : Select subjects will be receive broth packets for 3 
days. Increases in dietary sodium may cause mild elevations in blood pressure, but 
usually only by a small amount depending upon the subje cts’ s alt-sensitivity status. 
Blood pressure will be monitored frequently during study visits. Procedures will not be 
initiated if the subject’s blood pressure is too high or symptoms are present. When 
subjects resume their usual home diets, blood  pressure  is expected to return to baseline.  
 
Medications : Administration of all medications will be conducted by [CONTACT_768886]. A physician will be available on -call 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 
to all study participants for any questions  or co ncerns.   
 
Eplerenone : The eplerenone dose of 50mg daily has been used safely in previous 
studies to improve coronary circulation in individuals with Type [ADDRESS_1054750] 
with serum K > 5.5 mEq/L at screen will be excluded . During t he study,  a sub ject who 
has an elevated K of > 5.5 mEq/L at any study visit will have a recheck; if the K remains 
elevated after recheck, the dose will be decreased to 50mg daily. If the K remains 
elevated> 5.5 mEq/L, the subject will be excluded from the study.  A dditio nally, subjects 
who experience symptoms of hyperkalemia and have a K > 5.0 mEq/L will be excluded 
from continued participation in the study.  Subjects who have hypotension (SBP<90 
mmHg) at any study visit after titration to full dose epleren one 50mg twice daily will be 
given a dose reduction to [ADDRESS_1054751] remains hypotensive (SBP <90 
mmHg) or symptomatic of hypotension at the reduced dose they will be dropped from 
the study.  Since subjects with renal insufficiency may require reduced d osing based on 
creatinine clearance, subjects with serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl will also be excluded.  
Other rare side effects include dizziness, fatigue, and diarrhea; these will be assessed 
for throughout the study. The effe ct of eplerenone on an embryo , fetus, or on a 
breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be harmful.  Because of these unknown risks, 
women cannot take part in this study if they are: pregnant, trying to beco me pregnant, 
breastfeeding. If  wome n become pregnant or think they  are pregnant  durin g the study, 
they must stop taking the study medication and will be withdrawn from the study.  We 
have received FDA IND exemption for the use of eplerenone in HIV for insulin resistance 
and recently received an FDA IND exemption for applicat ion in CV D indi ces in HIV.  
Protease inhibitors with the most significant effect on CYP3A4 will be exclusionary as in 
our prior trials of HIV patients. We will also exclude subjects using other strong inhibitors 
of CYP3A4, as well as CYP3A4 inducers. Furthe rmore, al l subj ects will be carefully 
monitored for side effects, including frequent potassium and BP monitoring. A 50mg 
twice daily  dose of eplerenone has been chosen, such that even if concentrations do 
increase somewhat through pharmacokinetic interacti ons, we e xpect the drug to be well 
tolerated. The dose of 100 mg/day has been effective in numerous studies of non -HIV 
patients and is expected to be effective in the proposed studies.

Optional Substudy --Cardiac 2 -deoxy -2-18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron 
Emission Tomogr aphy /Computed Tomography  (18F-FDG -PET/CT) and Radiation: 
The two cardiac PET /CT scans will involve exposure to radiation for research purposes.  
Subjects will receive a scan before and after a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. For 
18F-FDG-PET/CT,  the a dministered dose from 18F- FDG for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_768846] 370 
MBq (10 mCi=7.03 mSv) and the effective dose for an attenuation correction scan of 
head/neck/chest/upper abdomen is about 1.58 mSv . The total effective dose from two 
FDG -PET/C T studies  would  be 17.[ADDRESS_1054752] will be performed on 
the day of pri or to com mencem ent of the study. In addition, there may be incidental 
findings on the PET study. If any of these findings are clinically significant, subjects will 
be informed, referred to their primary care physician for further evaluation, and 
withdrawn as approp riate from the study.  
 
Optional Substudy --Radiation Exposure  The total estimated radiation exposure for 
the entire study  (main study+substudy)  would be 32.49 mSv. This is equivalent to the 
amount of radiation an individual would normally get in 10  years an d 6 mo nths from 
natural background sources from the earth and the sky. (See also sections radiation 
exposure for other precautions and cardiac 18F-FDG -PET/CT above for specific radiation 
exposure related to the substudy.)  
 
Optional Substudy --Blood  draw  The total amount of blood drawn for the substudy will 
be approximately 4 mL over 1 year for females only. This will be a minimal amount 
added to the main study. The total blood drawn for subjects completing the entire study  
(main study+substudy)  is equivalent  to ap proximately 564ml (over a period of 12 
months).  
 
Optional Blood Sampling Visit (for those that do not qualify after completion of 
both screening visits) --Blood draw  The total amount of blood drawn for the Optional

inflammation as a result of treatment with eplerenone and/or lifestyle modification.  In 
addition, all subjects will be provided with tools to help them meet the pre scribed g oals, 
including a core curriculum binder. Clinically interpretable information on metabolic 
parameters will be provided to the subject and may help subjects and their clinicians to 
better understand their metabolic risk if they choose to obtain su ch inform ation.  Any 
abnormal testing will be conveyed to the subjects’ primary care physicians with their 
permission. In addition, information obtained from this study will benefit HIV patients in

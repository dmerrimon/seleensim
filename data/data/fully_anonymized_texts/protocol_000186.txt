 
Comparison of Standard PET/CT Versus Digital PET/CT  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
January 12, [ADDRESS_497795], [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary 
This is a comparison study of two types of scanners: we want to compare the results of 
the standard -of-care PET/CT scanner with a new digital PET/CT scanner and we plan to 
do this on the same day using a single dose of a radioactive drug that is FDA -approved to 
be used for the PET/CT scan (FDG, NaF, DOTATATE) or radioactive drugs not FDA-
approved but for which we hold INDs (Ga68 PSMA and Ga68 RM2 used in prostate 
cancer).   
 We hope to learn if the lesions seen using one standard of care  scanner (PET/CT) are also 
seen using the novel scanner (digital PET/CT).    
The goal of this study is to acquire matched sets of imaging in order to compare the 
standard PET/CT and digital PET/CT. 
b. Objectives  
Understanding the imaging characteristics of these two scanners can potentially improve the patient care, improving the image quality, by [CONTACT_395927]. Understanding what patients will benefit from digital PET/CT 
instead of standard PET/CT will have the  potential to improve patient care.  
c. Rationale for Research in Humans  
The scanners are designed for detection of disease in human subjects; therefore, comparing the image quality of the two requires human participants.  
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  
Patients who are referred to Nuclear Medicine and are scheduled to undergo standard or 
research (68Ga PSMA or 68Ga RM2) PET/CT on the Discovery [ADDRESS_497796] or research 
(68Ga PSMA or 68Ga RM2) PET/CT on the Discovery MI scanner will be asked to have 
the scan repeated on the Discovery [ADDRESS_497797] PET/CT scan and immediately 
after by [CONTACT_395928]/CT scan. A very small amount of radiation (3 mSv) will be given by [CONTACT_395929]/CT.  
 PET/CT images will be obtained using the GE PET/CT 600 or 690 scanners (GE 
Healthcare) per standard oncologic protocols. In brief, PET/CT images will be acquired 
in 3D mode at 45-60 minutes after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. We plan to enroll 
100 patients per year for both SOC and research tracers, for 3 years (total of 300 
patients). The PET emission scan is corrected using segmented attenuation data of the CT scan. ToF will be used for patients with BMI>25 (on the 690 system only). The PET 
images are reconstructed both with a standard iterative algorithm (OSEM, two iterative 
steps, 28 subsets), as well as a regularized reconstruction algorithm provided by [CONTACT_395930]. All images are reformatted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and viewed 
with the software available in the Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinic (MIM 
Vista).  
 
Immediately after completion of the standard PET/CT exam, the patients will be 
transferred to the adjacent digital PET/CT suite and undergo the second PET/CT image 
acquisition with the least delay. In brief, PET/CT images will be acquired in 3D mode. 
ToF is standard on the digital PET/CT system. Data driven gating will be acquired 
according to the vendor’s protocol (once commercially available). The PET emission 
scan is corrected using segmented attenuation data of the CT scan. The PET images are 
reconstructed both with a standard iterative algorithm (OSEM, two iterative steps, 28 
subsets), as well as a regularized reconstruction algorithm (Q.Clear®) provided by [CONTACT_395930]. All images are reformatted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and viewed 
with the software available in the Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinic (MIM 
Vista).  
 The above sequences will be done as well if the digital PET/CT is done first, followed by 
[CONTACT_1602] [ADDRESS_497798] or research (68Ga PSMA or 68Ga RM2) 
PET/CT. No other alternate procedures are available. The subject can choose not to 
participate in the project. 
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
No therapy is used in this study. The protocol will not affect any therapy the patient might receive outside this research. 
g. Study Endpoint(s)  
No alternative treatments are proposed.  
3. BACKGROUND  
a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
More than a decade ago, multimodality imaging was introduced into clinical routine with the development of the PET/CT. Since then, PET/CT has been widely accepted in clinical 
imaging and has emerged as one of the main cancer imaging modalities. With the re cent 
development of combined PET/MRI systems for clinical use, a promising new PET detector technology using silicon photomultiplier tubes has become available. The 
combination of functional information delivered by [CONTACT_395931]. However, the differences between standard and digital PET detectors are fundamental. Digital PET/CT is expected to show advantages over stand ard 
PET/CT by [CONTACT_395932], higher sensitivity and temporal resolution. However, as of now, only assumptions can be made about the future 
clinical role of digital PET/CT, as data about the performance of digital PET/CT in the 
clinical setting are still limited (1). We recently installed at Stanford University the first 
ever GE -made digital PET/CT worldwide and we plan to compare image quality with 
that from standard PET/CT as part of an investigator initiated research  study.

 To summarize the results of the published human studies, there were no observed 
adverse events to the radiopharmaceutical. The measured dosimetry showed that the 
critical organ with 68Ga-PSMA is the spleen, followed by [CONTACT_152414], pancreas 
and bladder wall. The effective dose of 68Ga-PSMA reported (0.0236 mSv/MBq) is 
similar to that of 68Ga -DOTA-TOC (0.023 mSv/MBq), 68Ga -DOTA-NOC (0.025 
mSv/MBq), 68Ga -DOTA- TATE (0.021 mSv/MBq) and 68Ga -NOTA-RGD (0.022 
mSv/MBq). 
 RM
2: 
January 12, [ADDRESS_497799] -in-human study investigated the safety, tolerability, metabolism, 
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of 68Ga -DOTA-
Bombesin (BAY 8 6-7548). Five healthy men underwent dynamic whole -body 
PET/CT after an intravenous injection of 68Ga -DOTA-Bombesin (138 ± 5 MBq). 
Besides total radioactivity, plasma samples were analyzed by [CONTACT_186355]– high-
performance liquid chromatography for metabolism of the tracer. Dosimetry was 
calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software. The organs with the highest absorbed 
doses were the urinary bladder wall (0.62 mSv/MBq) and the pancreas (0.51 
mSv/MBq). The mean effective dose was 0.051 mSv/MBq. 68Ga -DOTA-Bombesin 
was wel l tolerated by [CONTACT_35668]. The authors concluded that the intravenously 
injected 68Ga-DOTA- Bombesin is safe, and rapid metabolism is demonstrated. A 
140-MBq injection of 68Ga -DOTA-Bombesin results in an effective dose of 4.76 
mSv after voiding at 1 hour. . 
 Measured human dosimetry data are available from published data (30) and presented 
below.  
 The 68Ga radioactivity was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_395924]. Maximum peak 
uptake of the total injected radioactivity was seen in the urinary bladder contents and 
the liver, with approximately 36% and 14%, respectively.  
 The mean normalized number of disintegrations in units of hours of the source organs 
and remainder of the body  are listed in Table 1. The largest mean normalized number 
of disintegrations for the subjects was found in the remainder tissues (0.67 h), urinary bladder contents (0.53 h), and pancreas (0.11 h).

Table 1: Normalized number of disintegrations (hours) of source organs after injection 68Ga -DOTA-Bombesin.  
 The estimations of the absorbed doses ar e reported in Table 2. The organ with the 
highest absorbed dose was the urinary bladder wall at 0.61 mSv/MBq, followed by [CONTACT_152412] 0.51 mSv/MBq. The mean effective dose (14) was 0.051 mSv/MBq. 
Thus, the effective dose from a 150 -MBq injected radioactivity is 7.7 mSv, which 
could be reduced to roughly 5.7 mSv with frequent bladder voiding (1-h voids).

To summarize the results of the published human dosimetry study, there were no 
observed adverse events to the radiopharmaceutical. The measured dosimetry showed 
that the critical organ with 68Ga -DOTA -Bombesin is the urinary bladder, followed 
by [CONTACT_152413]. The effective dose of 68Ga-DOTA- Bombesin reported (0.051

a. Planned Enrollment  
[ADDRESS_497802] of care or research PET/CT.  
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background 
All age ranges of adult population (> 18- years old) will be recruited. Both men and 
women will be recruited. All ethnic background will be recruited. No healthy volunteers 
will be recruited. Pregnant women will be excluded because pregnancy is a 
contraindication for a PET/CT study.  
c. Vulnerable Populations 
No potentially vulnerable patients will be entered into this study.  
d. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Populations  
We are not excluding any minorities; we are not excluding women due to their gender, 
only if they are pregnant or breastfeeding, to protect the fetus or baby.   
e. Stanford Populations  
No laboratory personnel, employees, and/or  students will be recruited for this protocol.   
f. Healthy Volunteers  
No healthy volunteers will be included into this study.  
g. Recruitment Details  
Potential participants will be identified from the PET/CT schedule in Nuclear Medicine (patients referred for standard or research PET/CT). Therefore a Waiver of Authorization 
for Recruitment will be applied for in the relevant section.  
 3 days+ in advance of scan, fellows/coordinators would identify patients that qualify 
based on data in the medical record.  
[ADDRESS_497803] or Nuc Med physician call patients to prep patients for 
the scan and ask whether a fellow/coordinator can contact [CONTACT_395936].  
January 12, 2021  Page 9 of 13 1 day in advance, if they agree to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], a fellow or coordinator would discuss the 
study with them.  
Day of the scan, if they are still a candidate, fellow/coordinator will discuss further with them, answer questions, and sign infor med consent.  
h. Eligibility Criteria  
i. Inclusion Criteria  
• Patient is ≥ 18 years old at the time of the scan  
• Patient provides written informed consent  
• Patient is referred for standard or research (68Ga PSMA or 68Ga RM2) PET/CT  
• Patient is capable of compl ying with study procedures 
• Patient is able to remain still for duration of imaging procedure (approximately 60 
minutes total for both PET/CT) 
ii. Exclusion Criteria  
• Patient is < 18 years old at the time of the drug administration  
• Patient is pregnant or nursing 
i. Screening Procedures  
Patients will be identified from the PET/CT schedule in Nuclear Medicine. Therefore a 
Waiver of Authorization for Recruitment will be obtained in the relevant section.  
j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  
As part of the consent form process the patient will be asked if they are participating in a concurrent research protocol. Those enrolled in the Ga68 PSMA or Ga58 RM2 protocols 
will be allowed to participate.  
k. Payments to Participants  
Patients will be paid $  for participation in this study.  
The second PET/CT will add up to 60 minutes to the patients' scheduled PET/CT visit. 
Given the construction delays and parking situation at Stanford, the investigators felt that 
the participants need to be compensated for their time and eff ort. We consider $  an 
appropriate amount given the above reasons, in line with other studies and not undue pressure on participants  
l. Costs to Participants 
There will be no costs for participating in this study.  
m. Planned Duration of the Study  
The screening  part of the study will involve a phone call. This will take approximately [ADDRESS_497804] PET/CT will take up to 90 minutes of the subjects time. This includes 1 hour tracer uptake time and the 30 minutes scan. The second scan will take up to anothe r 
60 minutes. (iii) Analysis of the participant data may take up to 6 months.  
9. RISKS 

January 12, 2021  Page 10 of 13 a. Potential Risks  
i. Investigational devices  
N/A 
ii. Investigational drugs 
This research study involves exposure to radiation.  
 
The effective dose from one typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 140 MBq administration of 68Ga -PSMA is 4.36 
mSv, approximately equal to 10% of the limit that radiation workers (for example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] x -ray technician) are allowed to receive in one year.  
 The amount of radiation from one 68Ga -RM2 PET is 4.76 mSv, approximately equal to  
10% of the limit that radiation workers (for example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] x-ray technician) are allowed to receive in one year.  
 This amount of radiation involves minimal risk and is necessary to obtain the research 
information desired. This is captured in the ICF  for the PSMA and RM2 protocols.  
iii. Commercially available drugs, biologics, reagents or chemicals 
The administration of the radioactive substance will feel like a slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_395925]. The subjects will not feel anything relate d to the radioactivity of 
the substance in their body. Because the radioactivity is very short-lived, the radiation exposure is low. The substance amount is so small that it does not affect the normal 
processes of the body.  
iv. Procedures 
No procedures will be performed. 
v. Radioisotopes/radiation-producing machines  
Patients who are claustrophobic may feel some anxiety while positioned in the scanner. Also, some patients find it uncomfortable to hold one position for more than a few 
minutes.  
 This research study i nvolves exposure to radiation from one additional CT for attenuation 
correction in the digital PET/CT. This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only. The additional amount of radiation 
exposure is about 3 mSv, which is approximately equal to 6% of the limit workers 
exposed to radiation are allowed to receive in one year. This amount of radiation involves 
minimal risk and is necessary to obtain the research information desired.

c. Procedures to Minimize Risk  
We do not anticipate hazardous situations for the subj ects as a result of this protocol. 
However, procedures will be in place for verification of correct radiopharmaceutical dose 
and route of administration (i.e., each dose will be double checked for dosimetry and 
quality by a researcher and technologist). The Protocol Director may withdraw subjects 
from the study for one or more of the following reasons: failure to follow the instructions 
of the Protocol Director and/or study staff; determination that continuing the participation 
could be harmful to the subje ct; the study is cancelled or other administrative reasons.  
 The studies will be performed in a medical setting, under researchers' supervision. Crash 
cabinets will be available for emergencies.  
 All computers, external hard disks, USB thumbs, tablet computer, smart phone - any

d. Study Conclusion 
The experiment will terminate when all subjects will have the scans done.  
 
The Protocol Director may withdraw subjects from the study for one or more of the 
following reasons: failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and/or study 
staff; determination that continuing the participation could be harmful to the subject; the 
study is cancelled or other administrative reasons.  
The studies will be performed in a medical setting, under researchers' supervision. Crash cabinets will be available for emergencies.  
e. Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMC)  
i. Data and/or events subject to review 
Informed consen t was properly obtained, any required pre -study tests and procedures 
were obtained within the designated pre -treatment time interval, Eligibility criteria 
were accurately met, Appropriate and timely reporting of adverse events (AEs) and 
January 12, 2021  Page 12 of 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) to the IRB, Adherence to subject follow -up 
requirements.  
ii. Person(s) responsible for Data and Safety Monitoring  
GE is the monitoring entity because GE is the Study Sponsor. The monitoring visits 
will be conducted by a GE Clinical Research Associat e (CRA).  
iii. Qualifications of person(s) responsible for Data and Safety Monitoring  
The GE Clinical Research Associate (CRA) has extensive experience in overseeing such trials. 
iv. Safety Reporting  
PD must notify the Sponsor and FDA of any study -related death or l ife-threatening 
event via telephone or email within 24 hours of learning of the event,  
The GE Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will determine frequency of visits and 
meetings depending on accrual.  
 
Data and safety monitoring activities and continuing study reviews take place until 
all subjects have been accrued. 
v. Specific triggers or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_395926]. Studies that received a rating less than satisfactory during the initial auditing review a re reviewed again by [CONTACT_395937] a case-by -case basis. Any follow-up 
recommendations such as a corrective action plan or re-auditing are based upon the results of the auditing review. For example, additional patient eligibility monitoring 
is performed if one or more of the patients were found to be ineligible. Findings such 
as the type and degree of protocol deviations or violations, unreported serious 
adverse events, and investigational drug medication errors may also warrant further 
review. A corrective actio n plan requires a prompt response by [CONTACT_978]. Once the ME 
determines that the corrective action plan is adequate to ensure subject safety, re-auditing is determined by [CONTACT_395938].DSMB Reporting  
Internal Reporting  
When the GE Clinical Research Associate (CRA) recommends suspension or study closure, they will notify principal investigators, study coordinators, and other 
organizations such as the IRB, as appropriate.  
 Confidentiality Procedures

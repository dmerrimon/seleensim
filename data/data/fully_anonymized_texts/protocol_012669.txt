Haploidentical Donor Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell and Natural Killer Cell Transplantation with a  TLI 
based Conditioning Regimen in Patients with  Hematologic Malignancies  
 
Principal Investigator:  
[INVESTIGATOR_45475] M. Triplett, MD 
 
Brief Overview  Study Population:  
Patients with high -risk hematologic malignancies who would likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT).  Patients wh o do not have a suitable HLA matched related or unrelated donor will 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_175611].  Those 
with a suitable HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor identified will be el igible for participation ONLY if 
the donor is not available in the necessary time. 
In general, patients who have a suitable HLA matched haploidentical donor (matched ≥ 3 of 6), will be 
preferentially offered enrollment on HAPNK1.  If the patient is medically eligible, but there is no suitable 
KIR mismatched haploidentical donor available, suitable cord blood units are available, and the patient is 
eligible for an institutional cord blood protocol, then the patient will be prioritized for enrollment on the 
current institutional cord blood transplant protocol. 
Participant must be less than or equal to 21 years old.  Additional eligibility criteria are specified to assure 
sufficient multi-organ system function. 
 
Intervention, Brief Outline, and Objectives of Tr eatment Plan:  
In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related/sibling 
donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) identified, will receive a haploidentical donor HCT with 
additional natural killer (NK) cells.  
The assessments and follow-up evaluations noted in the protocol follow the St. Jude standard operating 
procedures (SOP) for all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175612] . 
The primary objective of the study is to estimate the rate of successful engraftment at day +[ADDRESS_204899] 
disease (GVHD), transplant related mortality (TRM), transplant related morbidity, and immune 
reconstitution.

Safety:   
The primary measures of safety will be the rate of therapy related death and the rate of severe graft versus 
host disease.  
Ongoing assessment of toxicity will be done using the NCI CTCAE version 3.[ADDRESS_204900] disease will be evaluated using established staging criteria and expert 
consensus guidelines.    
Efficacy :  
The primary measure of efficacy will be rate of successful engraftment.    
Neutrophil and platelet engraftment will be determined using the parameters put forth by [CONTACT_175701].  Assessments will be made upon review of daily complete blood 
count and serial chimerism studie s.  
Bone marrow studies for disease status evaluation will be performed at approximately [ADDRESS_204901] blood testing of T- and B cell subsets.  
Research tests required for participation will examine NK and T -cell function and reconstitution.

Possible benefits of participation include obtaining and/or sustaining disease remission.  In addition, 
there is the possibility of psychological benefit from knowing participation has helped researchers gain more understanding about the efficacy of haploidentical HCT.  
Alternatives to participation are identified as chemotherapy and/or irradiation without transplant, 
research treatment if available, and/or supportive therapy.  
The possible benefits, alternatives to participation, and side effects, including that there may be 
unknown side effects of treatment, are detailed in lay language within the respective informed consent document.

were disappointing due very high rates of graft failure and infections.28  Significant 
progress was achieved with the use of mega -dose of T -cell depleted HPC after high -
intensity conditioning.26 Aversa and colleagues reported successful long -term engraftment 
with minimal GVHD in 43 patients with leukemia (including 15 children) using high doses 
of CD34+ enriched haploidentical cells, purified by [CONTACT_95570] (CD34+) and negative (CD3 -
lectin agglutination) selection.29,30 Utilizing haploidentical grafts and megadose cell 
therapy ( >1 x 107 CD34+ cells/kg), Handgretinger and colleagues reported similar results in

and influence outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies after haploidentical HCT.
7,3742 In addition to the anti -leukemia effects, NK cells are capable of reducing the 
incidence of graft rejection and GVHD in animal models; the former is in part based on the 
mechanism of donor NK cells against patient’s T cells, and the latter on donor NK cells 
against patient’s antigen presenting cells.7,[ADDRESS_204917] multiple advantageous effects, including reduction in (1) relapse 
(2) graft rejection (3)  
GVHD and (4) viral infections.43  
The NK cell alloreactivity depends on the balance of signals mediated through activating 
and inhibitory KIRs on the NK cell.  KIRs recognize their ligands, HLA Class I molecules on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175616].  Some of the inhibitory KIRs recognize  specific HLA 
class I ligands including the well -defined specificity of KIR2DL2/[ADDRESS_204918]. Therefore, KIR mismatched donors will be prioritized when available.

  2.4  Rationale for immunom agnetic T cell depletion of hematopoietic progenitor cell graft   
Improvements in engraftment were achieved when Handgretinger et al demonstrated that 
HLA barriers of engraftment in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175617] a large number of CD34+ cells (>107 CD34+ cells/kg).26 Collection of megadose 
CD34+ has become feasible with the implementation of treating donors with G -CSF before 
donation, which has been shown to increase the number CD34+ cell collected.44    
Donor T cells in the haploidentical graft play a major role in mediating GVHD - as few as 3 
x 104 Tcells/kg can cause GVHD.[ADDRESS_204919] removal of T cells (negative selection) or selection of CD34
+ progenitors (positive selection).  The transplantation program at St. 
Jude has had success using either method of T -cell depletion in haploidentical donor 
transplantation.  In this study, CD34+ selection by [CONTACT_175702] T -cell depletion of the HPC graft.  This was used successfully in INFT2 in which 
the HPC graft was often collected early and frozen until day 0 followed by [CONTACT_175703].  
Although positive selection allows for extensive T -cell depletion (TCD), the graft is devoid 
of other important cell populations such as NK cells and myeloid cells such as dendri tic 
cells and monocytes.

repertoire capable of effectively rejecting a variety of pathogens, as well as malignant cells. 
It is hypothesized that the elimination of only CD45RA+ naïve T cells from an infused cell 
product would not significantly negatively impact memory responses to infection. Among CD4+ T cells, the CD45RA - subset has equivalent “helper” functions as CD45RA+ cells in 
the generation of alloreactive cytotoxic T cells.

CD4 cells are

alloreactive than all memory subsets tested.63 In animal models, infusions of fractionated 
memory T cells do not cause physical or histologic evidence of GVHD, independent of T reg 
numbers. Naïve T cells, conversely, are potent inducers of GVHD, even despi[INVESTIGATOR_175618]25 depletion before infusion.
55 Moreover, in similar models, lymphocyte infusions specifically 
depleted of naïve T cells do not cause GVHD.64 Allografts containing high numbers of 
CD45RA+ naïve T regs may be associated with lower risk of acute GVHD in haploidentical 
transplantation using unmanipulated, fully T cell -replete products.[ADDRESS_204924].   
After showing such promise in animal models, selective CD45RA depletion has begun to 
be studied in human marrow transplantation, including at this institution. CD45RA depletion by [CONTACT_175704]ïve T -cell depletion. Data 
provided by [CONTACT_175705], with greater than 3 -fold reduction in number of CD45RA+ cells. Experiments were performed 
in the Human Applications Laboratory to qualify the CD45RA+ depletion procedures. Hematopoietic progenitor cell produc ts were purchased that were obtained from G -CSF 
mobilized normal donors by [CONTACT_16166]. The HPC,A products were depleted of CD45RA+ cells following a procedure provided by [CONTACT_175706]. Briefly, the cells were incubated with the CD45RA Microbead reagent followed by [CONTACT_175707]. The 
labeled cells were then applied to the CliniMACS device (Depletion Tubing Set) and the 
CD45RA+ cells removed using the Depletion 3.1 program. Flow cytometric analysis before and after depletion was performed following procedures provided by [CONTACT_175708]. The results of the experiments are presented in the table below. An example flow cytometric analysis of CD3+ cells is also included.

For the 26 patients enrolled on this protocol prior to amendment 2.0, there was no 
maximum naïve T -cell (CD3+CD45RA+) dose.  Although there is no correlation with 
naïve T -cell dose and the occurrence of GVHD so far in this or a ny other institutional 
CD45RA- depleted transplant protocol, rare patients have received naïve T -cell doses in 
excess of 105/kg.  In HAPREF, which utilized CD3+ depletion, the conventional T -cell 
dose cap was raised to 1.5 x 105/kg, and the rate of acute GvHD was noted to be increased. 
Returning the maximum dose down to 1 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg in HIFLEX again provided an 
acceptably low rate of acute GVHD. Because approximately ½ of circulating T cells are 
naïve (and therefore 1 x 105 conventional T cells would contain approximately 0.5 x  105  
naïve T -cells), in this trial the naïve T -cell (CD3+CD45RA+) dose in the CD45RA -
depleted product will be capped at 0.5 x  105/kg (0.05 x 106) starting with amendment 2.0.

Twentyseven patients with high risk hematologic malignancies were transplanted on one of these two protocols with OKT3 as in vivo T -cell depletion, followed by [CONTACT_145162] a CD3
+ 
TCD graft.  The one -year EFS was 5 1.9% ± 9.6%.  These studies have demonstrated the 
EFS and TRM in TCD RIC HCT from mismatched haploidentical donor compare favorably with reports from MUD.    
Importantly however, OKT3 was an important component of the preparative regimen for 
these transplants, and it is no longer commercially available.  Our most recent front -line 
haploidentical donor HCT trial (HIFLEX) has substituted Campath for OKT3.  Early 
results indicate that survival is similar between patients on HIFLEX treated with OKT3 
versus Camp ath (data not shown).  However, requirement for the use of therapeutic DLI 
has risen substantially.  Only [ADDRESS_204932].  
This is likely due to Campath’s anti -NK cell effects, leading to an increased clinical need 
for early T -cell add back in the form of DLI.  Unfortunately, with OKT3’s withdrawal from 
market, there is no commercially available T -cell specific (NK cell sparing) antibody.

  Therefore, in this protocol, we plan to use total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in the 
preparative regimen to provide bidirectional tolerance in substitution of OKT3.  
TLI was initially developed with curative intent in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma, and 
it was its use in these patients that led to the discovery of TLI’s alteration of T -cell specific 
immune responses.  Years of pre -clinical research on TLI have shown that the use of TLI 
promotes engraftment and reduces GvHD.[ADDRESS_204933] significant 
institutional experience using TLI -based regimens for allogeneic  transplantation (n=29 as 
of June 2012).  Importantly, TLI -based conditioning has allowed successful salvage 
haploidentical transplantation in patients who failed previous allo- HCT.  Nine patients have 
received TLI -based conditioning with haploidentical donor HCT after experiencing 
previous allograft failure (3 had primary graft failure, 4 had initial engraftment with acute 
rejection, and 2 had late graft failure).  The same haploidentical donor was utilized in [ADDRESS_204934], with 4 patients receiving a new (haploidentical) donor.  Eight of 9 patients (89%) experienced durable engraftment at a median of 12 days (range 10 – 27 
days).  The remaining patient had primary graft failure due to progressive disease.  This experience indicates that TLI is ef fective for facilitation of engraftment, even in patients 
receiving a mismatched haploidentical donor graft and with a history that indicates a very 
high risk of graft failure.  There is additional published experience from [LOCATION_013] in which 
TLI – given as a single 7Gy fraction – was utilized in 14 adult and pediatric patients for 
reconditioning after graft failure/rejection.
[ADDRESS_204935] of the patient having 
haploidentical donors, engraftment was obtained in all evaluable patients.  In addition, TLI 
was well tolerated in this pediatric population that had recently received another (typi[INVESTIGATOR_175621]) preparative regimen.  Finally, [ADDRESS_204936].  Donor lymphocyte

Donors on this study will therefore undergo additional leukapheresis on (or around) patient 
day +5 to obtain the cells for the TC -NK.  (See section 4.4).  This will be 5 days after the 
completion of G -CSF mobilization and hematopoietic progenitor cell collection if a fresh

quantities are not significantly altered with G -CSF mobilization and leukapheresis

this schedule) have met target cell doses for the TC -NK products.  The TC -NK will be 
isolated from the obtained donor mononuclear cells (MNC) in a two- step process. Initially, 
the MNC will be CD3+ TCD followed by a CD56+ NK enrichment using the CliniMACS

protocol who are unable to proceed to posttransplant immunomodulatory protocols, we will 
gather the MRD information together with hematopoietic chimerism in a descriptive manner to study the relationship between MRD and chimerism in this large cohort of

2.[ADDRESS_204944] (range in survivors 180 – [ADDRESS_204945]). Seven patients developed grade II -IV acute GVHD (1 - II, 4 - III, 2 - IV). GVHD prophylaxis was sirolimus in the 
first 9 patients, and MMF for the remaining patients. The median duration of GVHD prophylaxis was 18 (range 0 – 154) days. One patient had upper GI symptoms a few months posttransplant in conjunction with a rash and was diagnosed with grade II acute 
GVHD.  The six patients with severe (III-IV) GVHD presented more atypi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  One 
patient initially developed diarrhea with frank blood. Endoscopy showed severe mucosal injury with a broad differential diagnosis, and her prophylactic MMF was stopped.

Diarrhea and rash followed a few days later with a rise in CRP to 15mg/dL. Systemic steroids and infliximab were initiated, and GVHD prophylaxis was changed from sirolimus to tacrolimus. Due to very aggressive malignancy at diagnosis, steroids were weaned aggressively in these three

  patients as tolerated (courses were 65, 56, and 61 days respectively). GVHD prophylaxis 
was also stopped prior to Day +100 in all. Perhaps due to this aggressive weaning schedule, in these 3 patients, 1 patient developed recurrent acute GVHD and the other two developed 
chronic GVHD.  The fourth patient was plagued by [CONTACT_175714], and was never 
diagnosed with GVHD nor treated with prolonged systemic therapy for GVHD and yet recovered completely, however the consensus of extramural reviewers was that she had grade III acute GVHD. Another patient was diagnosed by [CONTACT_175715], but external auditors suggested that isolated GI GvHD as a possible etiology, so the coding was changed to acute GvHD. The final patient was diagnosed as 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN), but consensus of external reviewers felt that acute 
GvHD was the more likely etiology, therefore the coding was changed to acute GvHD. Of these [ADDRESS_204947] remain alive as of December 2015.  
  
Although the rate of moderate to severe acute GVHD was similar to the rate on the 
previous study HIFLEX, maraviroc was added in Amendment 3.0 in an attempt to 
reduce the inci dence of significant gut and liver inflammation without further inhibiting 
T-cell activation and proliferation, which had the potential to reduce acute GVHD. However, 4 of 5 patients who received maraviroc developed acute GVHD grade III or IV; this is comp ared to only 7 patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_175623] 36

General comments:  
The Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell, Apheresis (HPC,A) infusion may be delayed by 
[CONTACT_3450] 24 hours in order to accommodate prog enitor cell collection with the 
donor, the Blood Donor Center and/or HAL as well as the research participant clinical 
condition.  
The administration of the TC -NK infusion may also be adjusted in order to 
accommodate NK -cell collection with the donor, the Blood Donor Center and/or HAL as 
well as the research participant clinical condition.  Depending on date of NK -cell 
collection, it will be acceptable for the TC -NK infusion to occur between and including 
days +5 and +[ADDRESS_204954] progenitor cell infusion.  In the  event that the date of NK -cell 
infusion is adjusted, the mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) would typi[INVESTIGATOR_175624]-cell infusion.  
The term “every” used in tables is an approximate term meaning that  these medications 
noted will be administered approximately “every” 12 hours.  The drug administration 
timing in the case of “every 12 hours” may be modified by [CONTACT_3450] +/ - [ADDRESS_204955] delivery, or procedures (such as a needed CT scan). The term “day” does not refer to an absolute calendar day.  It refers to a general 24 -hour 
period. Dosing for the medications cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, and 
melphalan may be modified for research recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175625]. Mesna will be administered for 
prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis from the medication cyclophosphamide.  In general, 
mesna is administered at 15 mg/kg/dose prior to cyclophosphamide and at approximately 3, 6, and 9 hours after the cyclophosphamide infusion, to give a 1:1 ratio of 
mesna:cyclophosphamide.  Mesna dose and administration schedule may vary based on 
physician recommendation.

  scheduling, the general procedure for administering TLI has been defined here and in the 
above table.  It should be noted that TLI can be administered at any point during the 
preparative regimen prior to the progenitor cell infusion, and over as many days as 
needed to further accommodate scheduling issues in collaboration with the Division of Radiation Oncology and will not be considered a variance in protocol if the total dose of 
800 cGy is met.  
G-CSF will generally start on Day +7, but initial dose may be moved to an earlier or 
later day as to not interfere with NK cell infusion. G -CSF may also be dose adjusted or 
stopped early if rapid engraftment is considered to be potentially harmful to the patient (such as with engraftment syndrome) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_175626].  
MMF for GVHD prophylaxis: MMF will start one week after the NK cell infusion. In 
the event NK cells cannot be given, MMF may start Day 0, or as soon as it is known that the NK cell graft is unavailable (if later than Day 0). MMF is typi[INVESTIGATOR_175627], but may be converted to oral dosing when the patient is tolerating oral medications.  In 
the absence of GVHD, MMF will be discontinued approximately Day +60.  However, 
this regimen may be modified as clinically indicated in the presence of other factors including but not limited to persistent neutropenia, mixed or decreasing donor 
chimerism, graft rejection/failure or persistent/recurrent malignancy.  In the event the 
participant develops GVHD, treatment will be according to the SOPs of the St. Jude Department of BMT&CT.  
 4.2  Donor Selection  
If more than one family member donor is acceptable, then donor se lection will be based 
on the preference of the primary transplant attending.  Factors in selection will include 
donorrecipi[INVESTIGATOR_175628], donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175629], 
degree of HLA matching, size of the potential donor, previous use as a donor, presence 
of donorspecific antibody, and overall health of the potential donor.  
Donor eligibility for cell collection will be determined through the guidelines outlined in 
21 CFR 1271 and the Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue -Based Products (HCT/Ps).  Potential 
donors will undergo an initial screening process that will include at least a complete physical exam, history and testing for relevant communicable diseas es.  Physical exams 
to evaluate donor candidacy will be conducted by a non- Department of BMTCT 
physician (St. Jude or non- St. Jude).  For subsequent therapeutic cell collection 
procedures, if a complete screening procedure has been performed within the previous [ADDRESS_204956] determine and document any 
changes in the donor’s medical history since the previous donation that would make the 
donor ineligible, including changes in relevant social behavior.  
If a donor is determined to be ineligible, the donor is not automatically excluded. Part 21 
CFR 1271.65 (b)(1)(i) allows use of ineligible donors who are first or second degree blood relatives. In this situation, the physician will document the necessity of using the 
ineligible donor by [CONTACT_1541] a statement of "Urgent Medical Need" as explained in the

 4.3  Donor Mobilization and Graft Collections  
A G- CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) product (identified as HPC,A) is 
the preferred progenitor cell graft source.  Our desired target goal will be 3- 5 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg.  This number of cells will be necessary to provide an adequate graft, 
following the various ex vivo manipulations, for prompt reconstitution. Two days  of 
collection are typi[INVESTIGATOR_175631].  However, on rare occasions, additional days may be necessary.  Donors will undergo a standard hematopoietic stem 
cell mobilization regimen consisting of 6 days of G -CSF given subcutaneously at 10 
micrograms/kilogram. The graft will be collected by [CONTACT_175720] [ADDRESS_204957] will always be collected, processed, and infused

The daily leukapheresed volumes for PBSC collection is generally 3–4 total blood 
volumes based on CD34+ cell counts.  Two additional days of leukapheresis may be 
performed at the physician’s discretion (no more than 4 total) to reach the cell dose 
target, however, this is expected to be rare.    
The TC -NK will be collected by [CONTACT_175721].  
However the donor will not undergo a mobilization procedure for this product collection.  
NK cell product collection will be limited to one day.  Collection will typi[INVESTIGATOR_175633] +5, but may occur anywhere from day +4 to day+[ADDRESS_204959] of donor, or when deemed 
medically necessary per the judgment of the treating sub- investigator physician or 
principal investigator.  All PBSC products will be collected as per Foundation for the Accreditation of Cel lular Therapy (FACT) guidelines. Donors will be monitored during 
the period of the mobilization and leukapheresis procedure with appropriate laboratory evaluation (Appendix D).  
If we are unable to collect the minimum dose of 2 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg of reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_175634], and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175635], then an alternative family member may be used if he/she fulfills all the donor 
criteria described in section 3.2.  If the donor is unwilling or unable to complete the mobilization process or leukapheresis procedure, a BM product may be used.  The BM 
product will be processed using the same cell selection methodology on the CliniMACS

  Cryopreservation will be performed per SOPs of the Human Applications Laboratory.  
Target cell doses are listed in the following table:  
HPC Graft  Target Dose  Minimum Dose  Maximum Dose  
CD34+ cells/kg   ≥ 2 x 106  2 x 106  50 x 106  
CD3+ cells/kg   ≤ 0.05 x 106  0.001 x 106  0.1 x 106  
If the target dose is not achieved in a single collection, up to two additional collections 
will be performed for CD34+ enrichment (see Section 4.3).  Once the target dose  is 
obtained for the CD34+ enriched product, one additional day of apheresis will be 
performed.  This HPC product will be processed for CD45RA+ depletion using the 
investigational CliniMACS device as directed by [CONTACT_3455] (Miltenyi Biotech). See section 5.2 for additional CliniMACS device information.  Briefly, therapeutic cells collected by [CONTACT_16166] (HPC,A) from the mobilized donor will be initially assessed in the 
HAL and stored overnight at [ADDRESS_204962] will be washed to 
remove platelets and adjusted to an appropriate cell concentration for incubation with the 
CliniMACS CD45RA Microbead reagent in the manufacturer provided media.  The cells will be washed to remove unbound microbeads. These cells will be applied to the 
CliniMACS device and the depletion will be performed using the "Depletion 3.1" software as described by [CONTACT_3455].  There is no target CD34+ dose for the 
CD45RA depleted product.  Given that the previously infused CD34+ enriched 
product(s) will provide a  minimum dose of 2 x 10
6/kg, once the CD45RA depleted 
product is infused, the patient is likely to have received  3-5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.   
There is no CD3+ cell target dosing on the CD45RA+ depleted product, the goal of this 
depletion is a ≥ 2 log 10 depletion of CD45RA+ cells, however a depletion that does not 
achieve this target level may still be released to the patient as long as the maximum CD3+CD45RA+ dose is not exceeded. The maximum dose of CD3+CD45RA+ cells 
will be limited to no greater than 0.05x10
6/kg.

In rare instances, the progenitor cell dose from the first day collection may be so high 
that it is feasible to split that product in two aliquots such that one aliquot may undergo 
CD34 enrichment, and the second aliquot may undergo CD45RA -depletion, thereby

be washed to remove unbound microbeads. These cells will be applied to the 
CliniMACS device and the depletion will be performed using the "Depletion 2.1" software as described by [CONTACT_3455].  In the second purification step, the CD3+ depleted product will be enriched for CD56+ cells using the CliniMACS 
immunomagnetic enrichment program 1.1 with the CliniMACS CD56 Microbead 
reagent.  
For this protocol, our goal will be to infuse immediately after processing (Day +6) all the 
NK cells collected to give >2x10

 4.5  Additional Progenitor Cell Graft Administration  
Infusion of an additional HPC graft from the original or an alternative haploidentical 
donor may be performed for participants when clinically indicated for graft failure, poor immune reconstitution, or poor hematopoietic recovery. The use of and content of a conditioning regimen is left to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or primary transplant 
attending such that the most appropriate therapy is chosen for the clinical situation.  
The HPC graft will typi[INVESTIGATOR_175636] (HPC,A) and be infused fresh.  
The target dose for this additional CD 34
+ infusion is ≥5 x 106 cells/kg.  If the participant 
has quiescent or active BOOP, acute Grade III -IV GVHD, or any other reason that a 
severely T -cell depleted graft may be indicated, then a graft from the donor process ed on 
the CliniMACSTM device using either CD34+ selection (using established SOPs) or 
CD3+ depletion methodology may be utilized. The boost target dose for these patients is ≥10 x 10
6 CD34+cells/kg with a CD3+ cell/kg dose of ≤ 0.5 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg.    
 4.6  Donor Lymphocyte Infusions  
Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) may be given with or without preceding 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175637].  In such patients, lymphodepleting chemotherapy may be needed for effective 
DLI activity.  Regimen will vary based on patient condition, underlying disease, etc.  Regimen will be determined by [CONTACT_175723]/or PI, but in general would be low 
dose, expected to have minimal direct toxicity, and have limited or very transient effects on 
ANC.  Regimens for lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be defined in a separate document (non- protocol treatment plan -NPTP) and will require additional consent to the 
NPTP.

Amendment 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018    
Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
  DLI may be administered from the original donor for decreas ed donor chimerism, 
serious viral reactivation or infection, or any evidence of disease.   
• Decreased donor chimerism is defined as any  single  chimerism test that is 
not 100% donor 
• Serious viral reactivation is defined as any virus detected in the blood by 
[CONTACT_954], with a 1 log increase in viral load despi[INVESTIGATOR_175638] . 
• Serious viral infection is defined as any infectious disease from an 
identified virus that has progressed in severity despi[INVESTIGATOR_175639] (if 
available)  or shows no improvement despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 1 week of antiviral therapy (if 
available)  
• Any evidence of disease is defined as any flow cytometry, PCR, NGS  
(such as RNAseq ), cytogenetic, or any other validated molecular  testing 
that detects the presence of the original hematologic malignancy  within the 
limits of that particular test.  
The DLI may be collected as a whole blood unit donation or by [CONTACT_74886] . If 
the DLI is collected by [CONTACT_175724], the volume to be collected would be 
approximately [ADDRESS_204964] no active GVHD.  The initial dose will typi[INVESTIGATOR_175640] 2.5 x 10
4 CD3+/kg.  Subsequent doses will be administered at approximately 2 to 4-
week intervals with escalating doses of T cells if no moderate or severe GVHD 
occurs with the prior DLIs.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_175641]:

Initial Do se  2.5  Approximately 2 -4 week interval  
If no moderate or severe GVHD   Dose #2  5

Although this algorithm will be appropriate for a majority, the treating transplant 
attending physician may alter the dose and/or interval of DLI based on response to previous DLI, the severity of the clinical situation, and the condition of the 
patient.  There is a low threshold for providing an initial dose of 2.5 x 10
4 
CD3+/kg.  DLI at this dose level have not been associated with GVHD.  
Therefore, DLI may be initiated for any chimerism less than 100% in a patient 
who is off immune suppression.  The risk of GvHD increases with increasing 
doses.  In the last 5 years, no patient has developed moderate or severe GVHD after haploidentical DLI dosed at 5 x 10
4 CD3+/kg, though mild GVHD has 
occasionally occurred.  Doses of 10 x 104 CD3+/kg should be considered to carry 
a risk of severe GVHD.  Therefore dose escalation to this level must incorporate the appropriate risk/benefit analysis by [CONTACT_175725].

viral infections that are not responding to antiviral therapy or historically have a 
poor response to antiviral therapy; 2. Patients who have evidence of relapse, 
particularly molecular or MRD levels of relapse; 3. Patients who are severely lymphopenic, such as ALC <500/uL and/or T -cell count <300/uL. These patients 
will be allowed to receive CD45RA -depleted DLI in the following doses:

amount to be processed would be approximately 2 total blood volumes. The 
collected donor lymphocytes would then undergo CD45RA depletion as decribed for the HPC,A graft (section 4.4).  
The release criteria of the CD45RA -depleted DLI will include at least a ≥ 2 log

5.0  MEDICATION AND DEVICE INFORMATION  
 5.1  Medications  
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)   
Source  &  
Pharmacology   Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard de rivative.  It acts as an 
alkylating agent that causes cross -linking of DNA strands by [CONTACT_175726], thus interfering with the 
normal function of DNA. It is cell cycle, phase non- specific. 
Cyclophosphamide is  well absorbed from the GI tract with a 
bioavailability of >75%.  It is a prodrug that requires activation. It is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_175727] 4-
hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with aldophosfamide. Aldofosfamide s
pontaneously splits into nitrogen mustard, which is 
considered to be the major active metabolite, and acrolein. In addition, 
4hydroxycy- clophosphamide may be enzymatically metabolized to 
4ketocyclophosphamide and aldophosfamide may be enzymatically 
metabol ized to carboxyphosphamide that is generally considered inactive. 
Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Dose adjustments should be made in patients with a creatinine clearance 
of <50 ml/min.   
Formulation 
and Stability   Cyclophosphamide is available in vials containing 100, 200, 500, 1000 
and 2000mg of lyophilized drug and 75 mg mannitol per 100 mg of 
cyclophosphamide.  Both forms of the drug can be stored at room 
temperature. The vials are reconstituted with 5, 10, 25, 50 o r 100 ml of 
sterile water for injection, respectively, to yield a final concentration of 20 
mg/ml.  Reconstituted solutions may be further diluted in either 5% 
dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing solutions.  Diluted solutions are 
physically stable for 24 hour s at room temperature and 6 days if 
refrigerated, but contain no preservative, so it is recommended that they 
be used within 24 hours of preparation.

Toxicities   Dose limiting toxicities of cyclophosphamide includes BM suppression 
and cardiac toxicity.  Cardiac toxicity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_175643], cardiac necrosis or hemorrhagic myocarditis and 
can be fatal.  Hemorrhagic cystitis may occur and necessitates 
withholding therapy. The incidence of he morrhagic cystitis is related to 
cyclophosphamide dose and duration of therapy. Forced fluid intake 
and/or the administration of mesna decreases the incidence and severity of 
hemorrhagic cystitis.  Other toxicities reported commonly include nausea and vomi
ting (may be mild to severe depending on dosage), diarrhea, 
anorexia, alopecia, immunosuppression and sterility.  Pulmonary fibrosis,  
SIADH, anaphylaxis and secondary neoplasms have been reported rarely.

 Fludarabine (Fludara)  
Source  &  
Pharmacology   Fludarabine phosphate is a synthetic purine nucleoside analog.  It acts by 
[CONTACT_175728], ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase 
by [CONTACT_175729], deoxyadenosine 
triphosphate, r esulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis.  In addition, 
fludarabine can be incorporated into growing DNA chains as a false base, 
thus interfering with chain elongation and halting DNA synthesis.  
Fludarabine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_175644] a carrier -mediated process. It is then phosphorylated 
intracellularly by [CONTACT_175730].  
Approximately 23% of the dose is excreted as the active metabolite in the urine (with dosages of 18- 25 mg/m
2/day for 5 days).  Renal clearance 
appears to become more important at higher doses, with approximately 41-
60% of the dose being excreted as the active metabolite in the urine 
with dosages of 80 -260 mg/m2.  
Formulation 
and Stability  Fludarabine i s supplied in single -dose vials containing [ADDRESS_204968] vials 
should be stored under refrigeration.  Each vial can be reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 2 ml of sterile water for injection resultin g in a final concentration 
of 25 mg/ml. Because the reconstituted solution contains no antimicrobial preservative, the manufacturer recommends that it should be used within 8 
hours of preparation.  The solution should be further diluted in 5% 
dextrose or 0 .9% NaCl prior to administration.

Source   &  
Pharmacology   Melphalan, a derivative of nitrogen mustard, is a bifunctional alkylating 
agent.  Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4 -[bis(2 -chloroethyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine, 
and it has a molecular weight of 305.20.  Melphalan is active against 
tumor cells that a re actively dividing or at rest.  Its cytotoxicity is thought 
to be due to inter -strand cross -linking with DNA, probably by [CONTACT_175731] N7 position of guanine.  Melphalan is highly protein bound and does 
not penetrate well into the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. Elimination half -life after 
intravenous administration in adults is approximately 75 minutes. 
Elimination appears to be primarily by [CONTACT_175732], but caution 
should be used in patients with renal impairment.  Plasma concentrations 
of melphalan af ter oral administration are highly variable, possibly due to 
incomplete absorption, variable “first pass” hepatic metabolism or rapid  
 hydrolysis. Area under the plasma concentration -time curves for orally 
administered melphalan is approximately 60% of i ntravenously 
administered melphalan in adult studies.   
Formulation 
and Stability  Available as [ADDRESS_204971] be reconstituted immediately prior to 
infusion by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_175645] (10 ml) to the 
freeze dried powder with a 20 gauge or larger sterile needle and 
immediately shaking vigorously until a clear solution is obtained.  This 
results in a 5 mg/ml solution.  The dose should then be diluted in 0.9% NaCl for injection to a final concentration of not greater than 0.45 mg/ml.  
The resulting admixture should be infused over a minimum of 15 minutes.   
The infusion should be completed within 60 minutes of reconstitution.  Do 
not refrigerate the reconstituted melphalan.

Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
   5.2  CliniMACSTM System    
The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on 
magneticactivated cell sorting (MACS).  The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for 
the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis 
products).  These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunom agnetic 
label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.  
The cells to be isolated are specifically labeled with super -paramagnetic particles by [CONTACT_175733] a cell surface antigen.  After magnetic labeling, the cells are separated using a high- gradient magnetic separation column as described below.  The 
magnetically labeled cells are retained in the magnetized column while the unlabeled cells flow through the column for collection.  The retained cells are eluted by r emoving 
the magnetic field from the column, washing the cells out and collecting them in a separate container from the unlabeled cells.  
The super -paramagnetic particles are small in size (about 50 nm in diameter) and are 
composed of iron oxide/hydroxide and dextran conjugated to monoclonal antibodies.  These magnetic particles form a stable colloidal solution and do not precipi[INVESTIGATOR_175649].  The antibody conjugated beads used in this system are 
highly specific (e.g. CD3+ cells via OKT3 conjugated beads). High- gradient MACS 
technology has been shown to achieve rapid and highly specific depletion or enrichments of large numbers of target cells from BM, cord blood, and normal peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells.   
The CliniMACS device in corporates a strong permanent magnet and a separation 
column with a ferromagnetic matrix to separate the cells labeled with the magnetic 
particles . The high- gradient system allows the application of strong magnetic forces and 
a rapid demagnetization. Small  ferromagnetic structures, such as the column matrix, 
placed in a magnetic field concentrate this homogenous field and thereby [CONTACT_175734]. In their immediate proximity, the ferromagnetic structures generate magnetic forces 10,000-fold greater than in the absence of those structures enabling the 
retention of magnetically labeled cells. After removing the column from the magnet, the 
rapid demagnetization of the column matrix allows the release of retained cells.   
The CliniMACS device is comprised of a computer controlled instrument incorporating 
a strong permanent magnet, a closed -system sterile tubing set containing columns with a 
coated ferromagnetic matrix and a paramagnetic, cell specific, labeling reagent. The 
instrument will separate the cells in a fully automated process yielding a cell population 
highly depleted of CD3
+ cells. The CliniMACS device is not licensed by [CONTACT_175735].  
The CliniMACS device has separate programs that allow cell selection procedures 
optimized for either depletion (e.g. CD3+ or CD45RA+) or  selection of a target cell 
population (e.g. CD34+ or CD56+ cells). The basic mechanism is the same for either 
application; target cells are "tagged" with super -paramagnetic particles and event ually 
separated from the unlabeled cells using the CliniMACS device as described above. The 
desired target cells can either be infused or discarded appropriately.

Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
  6.0 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS AND EVALUATIONS  
 6.1  Pre/peri/post -transplant evaluations  
All pre/peri/posttransplant and long- term follow -up evaluations for these participants 
will be carried out as outlined in Appendix D, and guided by [CONTACT_175736] (SOPs) of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Department of BMTCT, for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175650].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_175651]: http://home.web.stjude.org/bone_marrow/clinicalHome.shtml.
  
Furthermore, to accommodate the research studies, flexibility in the date is allowed 
without a deviation from protocol.  The degree of flexibility in the timing is als o 
provided in Appendix  
E.     
6.[ADDRESS_204977]. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BMTFU protocol).  
6.3 Evaluation for Chimerism and Engraftment  
Evaluation for chimerism and engraftment will be performed on bone marrow or 
peripheral blood samples according to the timelines noted in Appendix E. Bone ma rrow 
chimerism studies will be conducted on or about the following time points: day +21, day 
+100, and year one posttransplant. However, for research participants who have less than 
100% donor chimerism at or about day +21 posttransplant, a repeat bone marrow study (to include chimerism) may be performed approximately one week after the initial 
procedure.    
The time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment will be recorded.  Neutrophil 
engraftment will be defined as the first of 3 consecutive days of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 500/mm
3. Time to platelet engraftment will be 
designated as the time to platelet count exceeding 20,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3 without 
a platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days.  
Chimerism studies u sing peripheral blood will be obtained on an approximate weekly 
basis according to the evaluation schedule noted in Appendix E.  Additional bone marrow and/or peripheral blood chimerism studies may be performed throughout the 
course of this study when clinically indicated.  Chimerism studies derived from bone marrow may be used in lieu of a specified peripheral blood sample if a bone marrow sample is available.  In the event of graft failure/rejection, subsequent chimerism studies 
may be held as they would not be clinically indicated at that time.  
If there is an initial decrease in donor chimerism to less than 90% at any time on 
peripheral blood studies, a bone marrow examination will subsequently be performed

100% donor chimerism. Chimerism studies will be performed in the St. Jude Department of Pathology using standard DNA techniques [i.e. VNTR (variable number tandem repeat)] and/or FISH (fluorescent in -situ hybridization) analysis.  Chimerism studies will 
be reported in the database as donor per centages.  
6.[ADDRESS_204979] immune reconstitution studies of lymphocyte subsets 
(i.e. cells, B cells, and NK cells).  These studies may be performed more often than what is outlined in Appendix E depending on the clinical status of the research participant.    
Immune analysis as described (Mnemonic listed in 6.4.1 through 6.4.4) will be 
performed according to the schedule outlined in Appendix D until the immune parameters recover to normal level or do nor pattern:   
6.4.1
  Lymphocyte subsets study: Flow cytometry enumeration.    
 6.4.2   VBETA/TREC Research: Thymic output and T- cell repertoire.   
 6.4.3   Lymphocyte Phenotypes Research: T- cell and NK -cell number and function.   
6.4.4   Quantitative immunog lobulins: IgG, IgM, and IgA  levels.  
6.4.5 IR-Phenotype: Immune reconstitution of memory and naïve T cells will be 
investigated in depth in the Youngblood Lab.  This may include phenotypic subset 
characterization, functional correlates, and analysis of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_175652].   
6.4.6 T -Function: T -cell function will be investigated in depth in the Thomas Lab. This 
may include antigen -specific T -lymphocyte response to viral infections, such as 
herpes viruses (CMV, HSV and VZV) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398] (influenza and RSV).   
6.5 General Viral Surveillance  
Serial PCR testing for CMV, adenovirus, and EBV will be done weekly to day 100 and 
then on an as needed basis.  In research participants with progressive or active infection, samples may be obtained more frequently (St. Jude test mnemonic BMTPCR).    
   
 6.6  Minimal residual disease evaluation  
Minimal residual disease (MRD) assays in peripheral blood and/or BM by [CONTACT_175737]. Jude only or those for who 
samples of diseased marrow were available to identify a leukemic marker for MRD 
testing.  BM (3ml) and/or peripheral blood (5- 10 ml) will be obtained from the 
participants at pre -transplant evaluation, at or about day +21, +[ADDRESS_204980] assays may be performed more frequently in participants with

laboratories.  
 6.7  Research tests on haploidentical donor (optional)  
Donors will be offered the option for participation in research studies of immune 
reconstitutio n.  These tests will be obtained after consent and preferably prior to growth 
factor administration.  Lymphocyte subset analysis of the donor appears to allow for the prediction of the reconstitution of the lymphocyte subsets in the research participant af ter 
transplantation.  Data in larger donor/research participant pairs will help to verify these observations. A list of these optional research studies are noted in Appendix D and detailed below:  
6.7.1  Lymphocyte subsets study  
     Flow cytometry enumeration.  
6.7.2  VBETA/TREC Research  
     Thymic output and T- cell repertoire.  
6.7.3 Lymphocyte Phenotypes Research  
Lymphocyte number and function.

 lymphocytes   
  
7.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 7.1  Adverse event monitoring   
Adverse event (AE) monitoring for on- study research participants will be assessed using

≥ grade III. Although we and others96 have noted that GVHD syndromes appear to be 
biologically different in Naïve T -cell depleted transplantation such as this, with

are known to occur in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Interstitial pneumonitis syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolit is obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) are two relatively common 
examples. These disorders are often associated with acute GVHD, but are not considered to be acute GVHD, and are often treated with steroids. These and similar disorders will 
be captured as  
AE’s and will not be considered to be acute GVHD. The risk of non- GVHD disorders of 
immune dysregulation in naïve T -cell depleted transplantation is unknown. In the [ADDRESS_204986] been diagnosed with toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387] (TEN) (n=2) or Steven -Johnson syndrome (SJS) (n=1).  TEN and SJS are 
considered to be variants of a disease continuum that is often triggered by [CONTACT_175738], and is mediated by [CONTACT_28746] T cells.
97  All three patients experienced 
resolution of their TEN/SJS with brief immunosuppressive therapy.98 It can be difficult 
due to overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_89377], but given that therapeutic recommendations are dif ferent, 
it is important to distinguish such diseases from acute GVHD if possible. Any toxicity that fits criteria for a well described disorder of immune dysregulation (such as the examples above) will be recorded no matter the CTC CAE grade. This allows a  full 
accounting of the incidence of these disorders in naïve T-cell depleted transplantation.  
Appendix C contains a summary of the NIH consensus development project on criteria 
for clinical trials in chronic GVHD.
99 This table will be used for staging/grading of 
chronic  
GVHD.  
7.3 Performance status   
Performance status will be assessed by [CONTACT_175739]/Lansky Performance Scores found in 
Appendix A.  
7.4 Hematologic recovery  
Posttransplant hematologic recovery will be determined using the engraftment criter ia as 
follows:   
7.4.[ADDRESS_204987] of 3 consecutive tests performed 
on different days of an ANC ≥ 500/mm3 with evidence of donor cell engraftment.

different days of a platelet count ≥ 20,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusions in 
the preceding 7 days.  
7.5 Graft failure  
Primary graft failure will be defined as an ANC never meeting or exceeding 500/mm3 
for 3 consecutive tests performed on different days and no evidence of donor chimerism 
(<5%) before  day +[ADDRESS_204989].  
Secondary graft failure will be defined as a decline in ANC to<500/mm3 with a decline 
in donor chimerism to <5% in research participants with prior engraftment.  
7.6 Chimerism  
Mixed hematopoietic chimerism will be defined as between 10% and 95% donor 
chimerism in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical Design and Analysis for the Primary Objectives and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175668] a phase II study. The primary objective of this study is to 
evaluate the rate of successful engraftment at day +42.  Successful engraftment for the 
purposes of this objective will be patients who do not experience graft failure as defined 
in section 7.5.  
As detailed in section 2, the use of alternative donors such as haploidentical donors and 
unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) ar e frequently needed and largely successful.  
However, the use of these alternative donors is typi[INVESTIGATOR_175669], particularly poor hematopoietic recovery and graft failure.
100  Handgretinger 
et al found that improved engraftment  was obtained in haploidentical donor 
transplantation with the use of a megadose (high donor CD34+ cell) T -cell depleted graft 
and administration of OKT3 instead of ATG.26  This combination has since been the 
foundation of haploidentical donor transplantation at this institution.  However, OKT3 is no longer clinically available.  This protocol includes a novel preparative regimen using TLI instead of anti -T-cell antibody to facilitate engraftment.  Therefore, the primary 
objective of this study is to assess  donor engraftment, ensuring that this novel regimen 
facilitates donor engraftment at an acceptable rate.  
The majority of published experience with alternative (HLA -mismatched) donor 
transplantation in children is with umbilical cord blood grafts.  The CO BALT study 
included 191 children with hematologic malignancies who received UCB transplantation with TBI based (1350Gy) myeloablative conditioning.
101  The cumulative incidence of 
neutrophil engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42 was 80%.  The [LOCATION_001] Blood Center published outcomes on 1061 patients (78% pediatric) with hematologic malignancies who received myeloablative UCB transplantation with units from their bank.
102  The cumulative 
incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 74% by [CONTACT_4475] 77.  The CIBMTR published a 
comparis on of UCB transplantation with HLA -matched unrelated donor transplantation, 
in which [ADDRESS_205003] blood 
HAPNK1 41 
Amendment 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018

  transplantation.103  They confirmed that although the leukemia -free survival was similar, 
the rate of neutro phil engraftment (and TRM) were significantly worse with HLA -
mismatched UCB grafts than with HLA -matched bone marrow grafts.  For UCB 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the best engraftment was obtained in the rare 6/6 matched UCB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175670] 85% of the 35 patients achieving neutrophil recovery at day +42.  In addition, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175671] a single antigen mismatch UCB unit with an appropriately high 
cell dose (n=154) had a neutrophil engraftment rate of 80% at day +42.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175672].  
Given the data from the paragraph above, we consider a rate of successful engraftment of 
less than 80% by [CONTACT_4475] +42 to be unacceptable for alternative donor transplantation.  The goal of our study is to develop a novel conditioning regimen to facilitate successful 
engraft ment of haploidentical donor grafts at a rate of ≥91%.  We do not anticipate 
censoring during the 42 day time period and we can approximate the rate of successful 
engraftment at day +42 using a Binomial distribution. (However, patients lost for follow up will be counted as a failure to engraft in order to keep the validity of Binomial 
distribution approximation). Therefore, in this study, we propose to test the null 
hypothesis H
0: P≤0.80 versus H1: P>0.80, where P is the proportion of research 
participants successfully engrafted at day +42 posttransplant. With type I error of 10% 
and type II error of 20%, Simon’s two stage optimum design powered at alternative successful engraftment rate P

If we observe 43 or more participants successfully engrafted at day +[ADDRESS_205006] 80%

  toxicity after engraftment but before day +42 will count as a successful engraftment.  
Any patient who dies prior to engraftment will count as a graft failure. Any patient who 
rejects the initial graft but is successfully engrafted with another graft will still count as a 
graft failure.  
Participants who enroll but do not initiate the treatment (receive conditioning and 
infusions) due to withdrawal of participant, health status change to make the treatment not to the participant’s best medical interest, withdrawal of donor participant, etc. will be replaced.    
After the study is finished, for the first primary objective, the rate of engraftment at day 
+42 and its 95% Blyth- Still- Casella confidence interval will be estimated based on the 
binomial approximation.   
As of 1/31/17, [ADDRESS_205007] from the same donor. This indicates that the primary objective is likely to be satisfied (42 successful engraftment) prior to completion of original protocol enrollment goal of 49 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. To fulfill a 
critical patient need, Amendment 4.0 expands the intended enrollment beyond the 
primary objective enrollment goal. Because this protocol provides specialized T -cell 
depletion and graft manipulation techniques, a therapy that is only available under the protocol IDE, future patients would not be able to potentially benefit from this therapy 
once the protocol completes. Preliminary analysis (data censored 10/31/16) show the 1 
year EFS (events: death, relapse) in patients with non- refractory (e.g. <5% blasts) 
hematologic malignancy receiving first allogeneic HCT from a TCD haploidentical 
donor to be 86.6% (SE:8.2%) on this study compared to 55.6% (SE:8.1%) on the 
previous two trials (HAPREF, HIFLEX). Therefore, future patients could benefit from this therapy with the expanded enrollment goal of [ADDRESS_205008] 
accrual at 12 to 15 patients per year, the study should be extended approximately 2 years. 
This provides the time necessary t o develop and implement a replacement therapeutic 
protocol that builds upon the progress of this study.  
Secondary benefits to the expanded enrollment on this study include increased precision 
of the clinical outcome estimates for the primary and secondary  objectives, and the 
ability to compare these outcomes based on whether the donor is KIR matched or 
mismatched. Tertiary benefits to the expanded enrollment include increased depth of the 
biologic characterization of immune reconstitution, particularly of donor memory T -
cells. Enhanced understanding of memory T -cell function has the potential to lead to the 
development of new successful therapeutics.  
        
In addition to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175677], we will closely 
monitor the tria l for early excessive toxicities in terms of severe acute GvHD (aGvHD), 
and therapy related death. Therapy related death is any death in remission and related to protocol therapy.  Therapy related death will be monitored for [ADDRESS_205009] acute GVHD is expected to

10.2 Statistical Analysis for Secondary Objectives    
10.2.1   Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, EFS and OS at one- year 
posttransplantation  
The estimate of cumulative incidence of relapse will be estimated using 
Kalbfleisch -Prenti ce method. Death is the competing risk event. The analysis 
will be implemented using SAS macro (bmacro252-Excel2007\ cin) available in 
the St. Jude Department of Biostatistics. The Kaplan -Meier estimate of OS and 
EFS with relapse, death due to any cause and graft failure as events along with 
their standard errors will be calculated using the SAS macro (bmacro251-
Excel2007\ kme) available in the Department of Biostatistics at St. Jude, where 
OS = min (date of last follow -up, date of death) – date of HCT and al l 
participants surviving after [ADDRESS_205016] -transplant will be considered as 
censored, and EFS = min (date of last follow -up, date of relapse, date of graft 
failure, date of death due to any cause) – date of transplant, and all participants 
surviving at the  time of analysis without events will be censored. The analysis 
for this objective will be performed when the last evaluable participant has been followed for one-year post transplant.     
 10.2.2   Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD  
The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD will be estimated using 
Kalbfleisch -Prentice method. Death is the competing risk event. The SAS 
macro (bmacro252-Excel2007\ cin) available in the Department of Biostatistics 
at St. Jude will be used for such analysis. The severity of acute GVHD and 
chronic GVHD will be described. The analysis for this objective will be performed when the last evaluable participant has been followed for [ADDRESS_205017] transplant.

assess protocol and regulatory compliance as well as the accuracy and completeness of 
all data points for the first two participants enrolled, th en 15% of study enrollees (and 
their corresponding donors) every six months.  The protocol will be tracked continuously for the accrual of donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].    All AE and SAE reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_34355] [INVESTIGATOR_175679], grade, attribution, duration, timeliness and 
appropriateness on all study participants and their corresponding donors.  All SAE 
reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_175744] 6 months.     
Protocol compliance monitoring will include participant status, eligibility, the informed 
consent process, demographics, staging, study objectives, subgroup assignment, treatments, evaluations, responses, participant protocol status, off-study, and off-therapy criteria.  The Monitor will generate a formal report which is shared  with the Principal 
Investigator (PI), study team and the Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).  Monitoring 
may be conducted more frequently if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_175745].  
Continuing reviews by [CONTACT_175746] -SRC will occur at least annually .  In addition, SAE reports in TRACKS 
(Total  
Research and Knowledge System) are reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_1201].  The 
Regulatory Affairs Office will assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_175680], as necessary.  
This plan is supplemented by a focused audit plan as submitted to the FDA on 9/21/15.

Table [ADDRESS_205035] criteria for GVHD organ staging. However, confounding clinical syndromes 
(such as non- GVHD causes of hyperbilirubinemia) may make staging GVHD in a given organ 
difficult. In addition, timing of organ specific symptoms affects whether that symptom is more or less 
likely to be true GVHD. Please refer to Tables [ADDRESS_205036] Disease

Stage as liver GVHD  Stable or improving bilirubin after 
diagnosis of skin or GI GVHD, irrespective of treatment:  
Do not stage as liver GVHD  
  For GI staging: The “adult” stool output values should be used for patients > 50 kg in weight.  Use 3 day 
averages for GI  staging based on stool output. If stool and urine are mixed, stool output is presumed to be 50% 
of total stool/urine mix (see 3.2 below).    
  
For Stage 4 GI:  the term “severe abdominal pain” will be defined as:  
  a) Pain control requiring institution of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], or an increase in on-going opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], PLUS  
b) Pain that significantly impacts performance status, as determined by [CONTACT_87333].  
  If colon or rectal biopsy is +, but stool output is < 500 mL/day (< 10 mL/kg/day), then consider as GI stage 0.    There is no modification of liver staging for other causes of hype rbilirubinemia.  
Overall Clinical Grade (based on the highest stage obtained):   
HAPNK1 58 
Amendment 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018    
Protocol document date: 09/06/[ADDRESS_205037] without increase in stage until 
other disease process resolves (e.g., if TTP is diagnosed in the presence of stage [ADDRESS_205038] despi[INVESTIGATOR_175695].  If there is no liver GVHD – stage 0 – and new onset TTP, the stage [ADDRESS_205039] 
until TTP is resolved).  
Skin and/or GI GVHD 
worsening  Liver GVHD is staged according to the Glucksberg criteria. The 
elevated bill is attributed to GVHD alone .  
  
Thus, when skin or GI GVHD is worsening, there is no downgrading of 
liver GVHD staging for other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. (e.g., if 
TTP is diagn osed in the presence of stage 2 liver GVHD and worsening 
skin or GI GVHD, the liver is staged according to the actual bilirubin level even if some of the rise in bilirubin is attributed to TIP).  
  
Similarly, even if there is no liver GVHD at onset of a ne w process, 
(such as TPN cholestasis), but skin or GI GVHD worsen during that process,  then liver GVHD is diagnosed and staged according to the height of the bilirubin.  
  
There is one exception to this : the diagnosis of TTP, with high LDH 
and unconjugated bilirubin precludes the diagnosis and staging of new 
liver GVHD in the absence of a confirmatory liver biopsy.

Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
  Differentiating Acute  GVHD, Chronic GVHD, and Overlap Syndrome:  
There is often confusion differentiating acute from chronic GVHD, especially in the setting 
of reduced intensity transplants, DLI and new prophylactic treatments. The NIH Working 
Group recently published new clas sifications for GVHD:  
  
Table [ADDRESS_205040] or DLI  Presence of Acute 
GVHD features  Presence of Chronic 
GVHD  features  
Acute GVHD        
Classic acute GVHD  <100 d  Yes  No  
Persistent, recurrent, 
or late -onset acute  >100 d  Yes  No  
GVHD Chronic GVHD  
         
Classic chronic GVHD  No time limit  No  Yes  
Overlap syndrome  No time limit  Yes  Yes  
   
• Scoring of acute GVHD may need to occur past day 100.  In particular, patients should continue to be scored for acute GVHD when classic acute GVHD symptoms  
(maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, profuse  diarrhea - particularly if 
bloody and ileus) persist past day [ADDRESS_205041] day 100.  
  
• Those patients being scored as having acute GVHD should NOT have diagnostic or distinctive signs of chronic GVHD.  
  
• Patients with both acute and chronic symptoms should be diagnosed as having 
Overlap Syndrome and scored according to their chronic GVHD score.  
  
Further Explanation of Criteria presented in Tables 2 and 3  
  
1.0 Assessment of Skin GVHD  
  
1.1 Presence or Absence of Skin GVHD : Skin GVHD will be con sidered present if a rash 
characteristic of acute GVHD develops after allogeneic marrow transplantation 
involving more than 25% of the body surface not clearly attributable to causes such as drug administration or infection.  The extent of the body surface area involved can be estimated by [CONTACT_941] "Rule of Nines". In estimating the extent of skin GVHD, the area 
involved is calculated for individual anatomic areas, such as the arm or leg, and then the 
total is derived from a simple summation.  Areas that are non -blanching should not be 
considered involved regardless of the overlying color of the rash (red, brown, etc.).

  Limited distribution erythema (with the exception of palms and soles) in the absence of 
associated rash elsewhere on the body will not be conside red GVHD.  
  
2.0 Assessment of Liver GVHD   
  
2.1 Assessing for the Presence or Absence of Liver GVHD  
  
A. Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL) in the absence of other signs of 
acute GVHD in the skin or GI tract:  
  
i) Day 0 -35: If hyperbilirubinemia alone is present with no other signs of acute 
GVHD in other organ systems, acute GVHD will not be diagnosed based solely 
on laboratory abnormalities.    
  
Acute GVHD will be diagnosed if findings on histopathology studies of liver 
from a biopsy or autopsy are confirmatory.  
  ii) Day 35-100: If hyperbilirubinemia (must be conjugated bilirubin) is not 
improving or is exacerbated (especially if serum alkaline phosphatase is 
increased), in the absence of acute GVHD in other organ systems, no other 
etiologies are identified, and does not improve with discontinuation of hepatotoxic drugs, acute GVHD will be diagnosed.  However, it is distinctly 
unusual to develop ascites or a coagulopathy in the early stages of acute GVHD 
of the liver alone.  In the absence of histopathology studies of liver from a biopsy or autopsy specimen, ascites or a coagulopathy  secondary  to liver dysfunction  
will be considered  to indicate  the  presence  of  another  disease process  (e.g., 
veno-occlusive disease).  Recommended  non- invasi ve studies to define an 
etiology for hyperbilirubinemia are:  
  
a. Imaging of liver (CT or ultrasound)  
b. Hepatitis screen (only if ALT is elevated)  
c. PT  
d. Blood cultures  
e. Review of medication list for potentially hepatotoxic drugs  
f. Review of risk factors for viral liver infection (HSV, CMV, VZV, 
adenovirus, EBV, HBV, and HCV)  
g. Hemolysis screen  
  
B. Pre-existing hyperbilirubinemia clearly attributed to an etiology other than acute 
GVHD in the presence of signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems.  
  
i) If pre -existing  non-GVHD liver disease (documented clinically, by [CONTACT_175750], or by [CONTACT_20521]) is stable or improving at the onset of signs of 
HAPNK1 61 
Amendment 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018    
Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
  acute GVHD in other organs, then acute GVHD of the liver will not be 
considered to be present unless proven by [CONTACT_175751].  
  
ii) If hyperbilirubinemia worsens several days before or at the time of onset of signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems, GVHD will be considered to be present unless histopathology studies of liver are available and negative on a biopsy during that time interval or autopsy results exclude GVHD.
  
  
iii) If hyperbilirubinemia persists and is not improving after resolution of a pre-
existing non-GVHD liver disease process (e.g., localized infection of liver, 
systemic sepsis, biliary tract obstru ction) when signs of acute GVHD are present 
in other organ systems or no other intervening cause has been diagnosed, then 
acute GVHD will be considered to be present in the absence of a new, clearly 
identifiable cause of nonGVHD liver disease or unless a l iver biopsy or autopsy 
specimen is negative.   
 Prior acute GVHD in liver with new onset of a disease process that exacerbates preexisting or 
recently resolved hyperbilirubinemia:  
  
i) If an etiology other than acute GVHD is clearly identified as causing or exacerbating hyperbilirubinemia and acute liver GVHD has been diagnosed and has been stable, improving, or resolved, then the liver will not be restaged for acute GVHD until the resolution or stabilizing of the concurrent disease process 
(i.e., the liver st age prior to the onset of the new disease process will be carried 
forward until the new disease process resolves).  Example: Acute GVHD of the 
liver and gut is diagnosed on day 20. Treatment of acute GVHD results in falling bilirubin levels to liver stage 1. Sepsis or TTP develops with transient worsening of the hyperbilirubinemia. The liver stage is not increased, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a higher 
bilirubin level, because the cause of worsening hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to 
sepsis or TTP.  
  
ii) If an etiology other than acute GVHD is clearly identified as causing or 
exacerbating hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of already worsening acute liver GVHD or  GVHD of the skin or GI tract is simultaneously worsening, then the 
liver GVHD will be staged according to the actual bilirubin level, even though another cause of hyperbilirubinemia is present.

A. Diarrhea ( >500 mL/day in adults or > 10 mL/kg in pediatric patients) in the absence 
of other signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems

Amendment 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018    
Protocol document date: 09/06/2018      
  i) Day 0 -engraftment: If diarrhea alone is present without other signs of acute 
GVHD in other organ systems, acute GVHD will not be considered present. 
Diarrhea will be attributed to acute GVHD if histopathology studies of 
gastrointestinal tract from a biopsy or autopsy are diagnostic.  
  
ii) Engraftment-day 100: If diarrhea persists and is not improving, is exacerbated, or 
develops de novo in the absence of acute GVHD in other organ systems, 
histopathology studies of gut biopsies or from autopsy specimens are not available, and no other etiologies are clearly identified, acute GVHD will be considered to be the cause. A stool specimen should be examined to rule out infectious causes (e.g., rotavirus, adenovirus, and C. difficile toxin). It is 
recommended, if at all possible, that biopsies be obtained for diagnostic 
purposes.  
  
B. Pre-existing diarrhea clearly attributed to an etiology other than acute GVHD in the 
presence of signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems:  
  
i) If pre -existing diarrhea caused by a process other than GVHD has been 
documented clinically or by [CONTACT_175752], then ac ute GVHD of the 
intestine will not be considered to be present in the absence of biopsy 
confirmation or autopsy report.  
  
ii) If diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms are already present, but worsen 
significantly at the time of onset  of signs of acute GVHD in the skin or liver, 
GVHD will be considered present, unless biopsy or autopsy are negative.  
  
iii) If diarrhea persists after resolution of a pre -existing disease process with signs of 
acute GVHD present in other organ systems, GVHD will be considered present, 
unless biopsy or autopsy are negative.  
  
C. Prior or present acute GVHD in other organ systems with new onset of diarrhea:  
  
If diarrhea is clearly attributable to an etiology other than acute GVHD (e.g., 
infection) and a history of acute GVHD exists or acute GVHD is present in other organ systems and is stable, then the gastrointestinal tract will not be evaluable for acute GVHD until the resolution or stabilizing of the other disease process (e.g., infection) in the absence of biopsy or autopsy confirmation.   
  
D. Persistent anorexia, nausea or vomiting in the absence of signs of acute GVHD in other organ systems:  
  
Persistent anorexia, nausea or vomiting in the absence of other known causes of these 
symptoms will be considered stage I acute GVHD if confir med by [CONTACT_175753].

If a biopsy is not possible (e.g. secondary to thrombocytopenia) but the clinical 
findings are compatible with acute GVHD, then the patient will be treated and 
recorded as having acute GVHD.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_205043] observation. Abdominal cramps are considered significant for staging if the severity results in a clinical intervention (e.g. analgesia, fasting, etc.). Blood in the stools is considered significant if the blood is visible or hematochezia/melena is present and not clearly attributed to a cause other than GVHD (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]/hemorrhoids).

assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established. The percent predict ed FEV1 and 
DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: >80% = 1; 70-79% = 2; 60-69% = 3; 50-59% = 4; 40- 49% = 5; <40% = 6.  The LFS = FEV1 score + DLCO score, with a possible range of 2- 12.  GVHD indicates

  (nonresearch), variations in frequency (more or less frequent) of these evaluations can occur due to the participant’s curren t clinical condition and will not be noted as protocol 
deviations.  
• Disease status evaluations/BM testing results obtained prior to enrollment may be used for the baseline/pre -infusion assessments.  
• Additional chimerism testing may be required as clinically indicated and described in Section 6.3.  
• Lymphocyte subset studies may be omitted without variance when the abso lute lymphocyte count (ALC) is zero.  
• In the event of graft failure/rejection, the post failure/rejection bone marrow, chimerism and several applicable immune stud ies would not be clinically indicated and these 
studies may be held.

Research Study Evaluation Target Windows  
Several laboratory tests can only be processed on weekdays; therefore, if the scheduled evaluation 
falls on a weekend, or during a holiday period, an adjustment in the follow -up visit is expected 
and would not be noted as a protocol variation.  Additionally, in order to accommodate such 
logistical constraints, evaluation/collection dates of all protocol assessments (re quired and 
optional research), may be performed within a reasonable window of the intended date following the guidelines provided in the table below:

HAPNK1 Audit Plan with Amendment 2.0  
  
I. All new enrollments will monitored and audited by a designated experienced moni tor from 
our CPDMO (i.e., Protocol Office) . Following our institutional process, each new participant 
data will be reviewed as follows :  
  
1. On the same day of enrollment the CPMDO staff will review the completed eligibility 
checklist and informed consent document for completeness and accuracy (100% of 
enrollments) .  
  
2. In support  of compliance with Eligibility and Informed Consent document and process 
there will be verification  of supporti ng source documents early post  enrollment, within 5 
days (100% of enrollments) .  
  
3. For the initial six subjects enrolled on Amendment 2.0 (or later protocol versions until [ADDRESS_205051]  activation of  Amendment 2.0)  the CPMDO monitor 
will evaluate the following components in each patient within 10 working days of the 
participant reaching the day +100 milestone :  
  
a. compliance with treatment including protocol directed GVHD prophylaxis   
b. adverse events and grade 3- 4 toxicities inclu ding those contributing to the protocol 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]   
c. assessment and coding of acute GVHD   
d. evaluation of and reporting of deaths on study (including treatment related 
mortality, TRM)   
e. status of participant at day +100  
f. documentation of engraftment and,  
g. review of source data elements related to assessments for GHVD (for example, 
pathology biopsy results) .  
  
4. In each case the monitor will compare patient data in the protocol database with source 
documents . The monitor will utilize the defined criteria as indicated in the HAPNK1 latest 
protocol version for consent, eligibility, and toxicity assessments and grading, including 
the newly incorporated COG GVHD Guidelines.  
  
II. A patient specific audit summary will be generated with findings from each of the components. Results of the patient -specific audit will be provided to the study Principal 
Investigator (PI) for comment and independently to the VP Clinical Trials Administration.  
In case of discrepancies related to under reporting of GVHD and TRM, those cases will be 
interpreted as assigned by [CONTACT_175756][INVESTIGATOR_004] , 
and will remain as such (i.e . coded as GVHD) until the opi[INVESTIGATOR_175700].  
 
Revision 5.1, dated: 06/13/2018   IRB Approval date: 10/11/2018    
Protocol document date: 09/06/[ADDRESS_205052] six subjects enrolled on Amendment 2.0 reveal no major 
compli ance concerns , the study will continue with an every six month review cycle as 
required by [CONTACT_175757] (with a modification that every 
other new enrollment will have data audits). In addition to the review elements noted a bove 
other components that occur after day +100 (chronic GVHD , other AEs , deaths , status, 
regulatory documents , etc.) will be reviewed. An overall study monitoring report will 
generated every six months , and will be reviewed independently at such time by t he 
Institutional Monitoring Committee .

Protocol N o. FH IRB Files  8543 and 8543 -A and Clinical Trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Sponsor  National Cancer Institute  
Trial Type  Randomized clinical trial of a counseling/educational intervention  
Clinical 
Indication  Survivors of childhood cancer are known to be at higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_30182], serious 
cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. Hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
and diabetes increase this risk beyond that attributable to one’s original cancer therapy 
exposures. Research has shown that childhood cancer survivors also have a high burden of 
underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these potentially modifiable conditions.  
Study 
Objecti ves 1. To determine the prevalence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common 
cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes) in survivors of 
childhood cancer at high -risk of future serious cardiovascular disease.  
2. Among survi vors who are found to be underdiagnosed or undertreated, to determine (via 
randomized clinical trial) the efficacy of a counseling/educational intervention to improve 
control of these cardiometabolic conditions.  
3. Determine barriers on among survivors en rolled on the randomized trial and their primary 
healthcare providers that contribute to undertreatment of the study’s targeted 
cardiometabolic conditions.  
Study Design  Aim 1 is an observational study. Aims 2 and 3 are based on a randomized clinical trial design.  
Population  Participants in the existing Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort who are classified as high -
risk for future cardiovascular disease based on their  demographic and cancer therapy 
exposures.  
Primary 
Endpoints  Aim 1: Prevalence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and 
diabetes.  
Aim 2: Probability of having an undertreated condition  
Secondary Endpoints  Aim 3: Determine whether intervention and control arms  differ in terms of survivor 
knowledge, self- efficacy, and medication adherence, as well as differences in their providers’ 
knowledge and self -efficacy related to the care of childhood cancer survivors.   
Type of control  Delayed intervention control (i.e., can choose to receive the intervention at the end of the 
study period).  
Trial Blinding  Study staff performing home visits and study statisticians will be blinded. Participants and 
study staff deliver ing the counseling intervention cannot be blinded given the nature of the 
study.  
Treatment Groups  Group A: upfront intervention group  (30 minute counseling session focused on survivorship 
care plan, personalized action plan; 15 minute booster session at 4 months)  
Group B: delayed intervention control group ([ADDRESS_29524] ion plan)  
Treatment Schedule  Baseline: educational materials (survivorship care plan, personalized action plan, and 30 
minute counseling intervention

Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/[ADDRESS_29528] on average >80% 5 -year survival. However, 
premature cardiovascular (CV) disease has become the leading non -cancer cause of late mortality 
among childhood cancer survivors. Our existing work has shown that traditional CV risk factors such as 
hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], insulin resistance/diabetes remain very important, by [CONTACT_30212] (in synergistic fashion) the risk of major CV events such as ischemic heart disease and heart failure. However, the existi ng research has been limited by [CONTACT_30213] (i.e., when 
defined by [CONTACT_6270] -report or medication usage alone), including issues with both underdiagnosis (i.e., 
people with these risk factors present but who are unaware) and uncer tainty of disease control (i.e., 
potential undertreatment).   
This NCI -funded prop
 osal will utilize the largest, best characterized childhood cancer survivor cohort in 
the world, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS; n=24,466). The CCSS, known to stud y participants 
as the “Long Term Follow -Up [LTFU] Study”, is a N ational Cancer Institute (NCI) funded resource  with its 
data coordination center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30183] .1 
CCSS promotes the development of “an cillary” studies that obtain supplemental funding to extend 
cohort research beyond what the parent grant can accomplish. Thus, for the proposed CHIIP Study, w e 
will use CCSS- derived validated risk prediction algorithms to select CCSS survivors at high risk  of serious 
heart disease (n~ 800) based on past cancer treatment exposures. Among these 800 survivors, we 
propose to determine the magnitude of underdiagnosis  and undertreatment of hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes via in -person (home -based) measure ments supplemented by [CONTACT_30214]. We predict that around 60% of survivors (n~480) will be underdiagnosed or undertreated with respect to one of these three CV risk factors. Survivors who are underdiagnosed or undertreated will then be eligible to participate in a 1-year long randomized controlled trial , where we will measure the 
efficacy of an Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended personalized survivorship care plan (SCP) 
emphas
izing CV risk, supplemented by a remotely delivered clinician-led self- management counseling 
intervention, to improve control of these three CV risk factors (i.e., reduce rates of undertreated hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes). Survivors randomized to the control arm can receive the 
intervention on a delayed basis. Finally, our proposal seeks to better understand barriers among survivors and their primary healthcare providers that contribute to CV risk factor undertreatment.  
 Knowledge derived from this study will improve the assessment and treatment of important CV risk factors in this high risk population. The proposed intervention, if successful, will be diss eminable and 
low cost, and will have the potential to improve health and reduce mortality in these younger adults who live the majority of their lives as cancer survivors at increased risk of serious CV disease.  The 
protocol described below is classified as clinical research and will be conducted in compliance with the 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  / Cancer Consortium’s approved policies/procedures, and in 
compliance with all associated Federal regulations.

corresponding to ~5% cumulative incidence by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_29531] been 
exposed to cardiotoxic cancer treatments (i.e., anthracyclines and chest radiotherapy), this risk can be markedly greater ( Table 1 ).

and 0.66 -0.82 (external validation cohorts ).  
 Multiple studies in childhood and adult cancer survivors also have shown that even after considering treatment exposures, the presence of conventional CV risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes , and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_30184], and 
may further increase the risk of serious CV disease in more than additive fashion.
7,16,17 Among CCSS participants, 
hypertension was associated with significantly increased 
relative excess risks due to interaction [RERI] for ischemic 
heart disease (after chest radiotherapy) and heart failure (after anthracyclines; Figure 1); RERI was also significantly 
increased for dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_30185].
7 Furthermore, 
survivors predicted to be at high risk for isch emic heart 
disease and heart failure, on the basis of their cancer treatment exposures alone, also had higher self- reported 
rates of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes vs. survivors predicted to be at low risk  (Table 2 ). Among childhood cancer 
surviv ors, the development of these conditions also tends to 
occur at younger ages compared with siblings or the general population.
18-[ADDRESS_29533] examined the relationship between hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, and subsequent more serious outcomes in survivors of childhood cancer, 
including some of our own work, is reliance on self- report and/or the use of medications as surrogates 
for these risk factors, in lieu of physiologic or more objective clinical data. Where such data have been available, they often have been collected retrospectively, in a non -standardized fashion, or are only 
available in cross -sectional an alyses with either relatively limited sample sizes, recruited from a single FIGURE 1.  Relative risk of serious CV

examine CV risk factor undertreatment among childhood cancer survivors, and such studie s are rare 
among survivors of adult cancers.27-31 Our prior research showed that survivors with these CV risk 
factors, defined on the basis of medication use, were at significantly greater risk of more serious CV 
events (e.g., ischemic heart disease, heart failure) vs. other survivors.7,17 Thus, we hypothesize that 
survivors may be significantly undertreated even when diagnosed. The drivers of undertreatment may be related t o healthcare providers not intervening sufficiently and/or non -adherence to appropriate 
interventions among survivors themselves.

 The study’s intervention will feature an IOM -recommended survivorship care plan [SCP], which is 
designed to promote knowledge/awareness of personal health risks among survivors and to help dissem inate that information to primary healthcare providers.

by [CONTACT_30216] ( Tables 1, 2 ). Although the SCP is by [CONTACT_5071] a tool to foster self-
management, we will further supplement it with well- established, focused chronic disease self -
management strategies now being applied to improve coordination of cancer survivorship  care  (Figure 
2).36-39 Collection of directly  measured data also offers an opportunity to further refine risk prediction in 
the future, beyond using self -report alone ( Table 2 ).  
 
In summary, our proposal will systematically assess the magnitude of underdiagnosis and undertreatment, along with contributing survivor - and provider -specific barriers, among adult -aged 
CCSS participants predicted to be at high risk of future serious CV disease. Results from this proposal may significantly advance our understanding of CV disease risk among childhood cancer survivors of all ages, given that many of the cancer treatments CCSS participants received remain in common use 
today.
40,41 If successful, our IOM -based personalized intervention will increase the proportion of 
survivors and healthcare providers who are aware of current screening guidelines , who receive/deliver 
more appropriate CV treatment, and who adhere to these guidelines and treatments. The cumulative effect will be a mitigation of survivors’ long -term CV risks.  
 2.2 Clinical Data to Date  
The home sampling methodology 
prop
osed is based on the NHLBI -
supported Women’s Health 
Initiative’s (WHI) recently completed Long Life Study, where women (age ≥63 years) underwent home-based sample collection using Examination Management Services, Inc. (EMS I). 
Among 14,000 eligible women, 66% consented, and 85% of those who consented had a biospecimen 
collected with excellent results (≥95% 
successful collection). With WHI investigator input, CCSS conducted an EMSI pi[INVESTIGATOR_30186] 2014 to Spring 2015, a pproaching 200 
randomly selected CCSS participants living within a 50 -mile radius of 2 
metropolitan areas (Minneapolis & Philadelphia) to complete a home visit featuring a 12 -page 
questionnaire, followed by [CONTACT_30217] a fasting blood draw. Participants received a $[ADDRESS_29536] after  study completion and prompt notification (<72 hours) of 
any clinically meaningful lab results (standard metabolic panel, lipid profile, hemoglobin [Hb] A1c). After 6 months, 60% of participants had consented (11% active refusals). The median age of participants was 
43 years (range 30 -57). Among those who consented, 90% completed home -based data collection (all 
with viable samples, n=107) as of April 2015. Although women were more likely to participate than men (58%  vs. 42%), participation did not differ significantly by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity, age, or treatment era. Overall, FIGURE 2. Survivorship self -management model (adapte d from 
Schulman -Green, McCorkle, and colleagues.46 
 
 
 

Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/[ADDRESS_29537] lower participation rates than women.42 Given concerns that more urban CCSS 
participants may differ from others, we found that those who lived <50 vs. >50 miles from an existing CCSS center (all major metropolitan areas) were similar with respect to demographic and treatment 
characteristics, exc ept that racial/ethnic minority status was more  common among participants residing 
<50 miles (18% vs. 11%).  
 Direc t 
 measurement of participants from 
the EMSI pi[INVESTIGATOR_30187] 2013 found that abnormal blood pressure, fasting lipid, or blood glucose values were common (median age 42; 45% male). 37% of 
participants had ≥1 value (blood pressures ≥140/90 mmHg, LDL cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL or triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL, blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%) meeting commonly accepted clinical standards for therapeutic intervention (i.e., lifestyle prescript ion and/or medication 
management). This included 23% of 
survivors who did not have a self -reported history of any of these 3 conditions (i.e., potential 
underdiagnosis). If thresholds included higher pre -hypertension values (≥130/85 mmHg) and pre-
diabetes (glucose ≥100 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥5.7%), the prevalence of those with an abnormal value 
increased to 50% ( Figure 3). Specifically, among 52 high CV risk survivors, ~60% had an abnormal CV 
measurement, with the prevalence of individual risk factors ranging 20 -40%. Among those with 
abnormalities, ~40% were undertreated (prevalence of individual undertreated conditions 5 -20%) and 
~80% had a potentially underdiagnosed condition (prevalence of individual underdiagnosed conditions 15-30%). 20% of survivors also had underdiagnosis of [ADDRESS_29538] CCSS intervention studies that incorporated distance -based delivery of SCPs (led by [CONTACT_6283]. Oeffinger & Hudson, both co -
investigators).  
 
PROJECT VISION  (PI: O
 effinger; Livestrong; 2003- 05) enrolled 62 (86% participation rate) adult -aged 
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors at increased risk for either breast cancer or cardiomyopathy to test the acceptability of an IOM -based SCP supplemented by a study website and an effort to engage 
participants’ primary care providers.
43 92% of participants completed a 6- month post -intervention 
survey; 75% remembered r eceiving, reading, and understanding the SCP. Among participants, prior 
knowledge of mammogram and echocardiogram screening recommendations was low (32% and 12% respectively). During the 6 -month study period, 41% and 20% of eligible respondents obtained a 
mammogram and echocardiogram, respectively, with another 35% (for both tests) planning to do so FIGURE 3.  Yield of directly measured data in relation to self -

months between assessments. Similar to other studies,44 website usage was limited among these young 
adult survivors (29% v isit rate). Primary care providers demonstrated limited engagement: only 19% of 
providers volunteered to participate; none visited the study website or contact[CONTACT_30218].43  
 
The ECHOS  trial ( c o-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_30189]; R01 CA136912; 2009- 13) extended the methods in VISION to directly 
test the efficacy of a SCP supplemented by 2 nurse practitioner -led phone self -management counseling 
sessions on cardiomyopathy screening (vs. mailed SCP alone).45 After 1 -year, the randomized 
intervention group had higher rates of obtaining recommended echocardiograms per self- report 
validated by [CONTACT_30219] (52% vs. 22% SCP alone [p<0.001]; RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 -3.1). The intervention 
group also was less likely to report lack of physician recommendation as a reason for not obtaining an echocardiogram, suggesting that the counseling further enhanced communication between recipi[INVESTIGATOR_30190] a SCP alone would have acc omplished.
46 The study had an 
87% retention rate at 1 -year follow -up (n=411 of 472).45  
 2.3 Risks/Benefits  
The proposed home visits and biosample  and data collection itself pose minimal risk to participants. 
Anthropometric measurements are all non -invasive. There would be a blood draw (thus potential for 
brief mild pain) associated with any home visit (1 to 2 over the course of the study for any gi ven 
participant). The study team will ensure that the amount drawn at any visit is safe from a blood volume standpoint. It is possible, but unlikely, that some survey questions may cause participants to feel uncomfortable. All instruments proposed have been previously used in other research.  
 For participants selected to participate in the randomized intervention trial, it is possible that receipt of 
clinical lab results may cause some participants to feel uncomfortable or anxious. Similarly, receipt of a 
SCP with an individual’s predicted cardiovascular risk may cause anxiety or discomfort. We will be monitoring self-reported anxiety and depression as part of our study. Nevertheless, we feel that providing such information, even when unexpected, may be important and have important future health consequences, as the research data to be provided to participants are all results with clinical interpretation and significance. For participants on the intervention arm, they will get a telephone or 
web video  session by [CONTACT_30220] a survivorship trained 
clinician, approximating a normal clinical exchange. Participants on the control arm will only get a letter summarizing clinically relevant results, and will be encouraged to discuss any abnormal results with their primary healthcare provider. The study has in place, a process by [CONTACT_30221], in which case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_28678], can notify the participant 
more quickly to seek medical follow -up. This process is similar to and adapted from that used by [CONTACT_30222]-sponsored NHANES for their in -person mobile assessments. For participants (either intervention or 
delayed control) with clinically actionable results b ut who have no current healthcare provider, the 
study team has access to resources to aid participants in finding providers in their area who have expertise in treating survivors of childhood cancer. This will be clearly explained on their results letter.  
 Control participants will get access to the SCP with personalized recommendations and a self-management counseling session with formal written summary “action plan” following the [ADDRESS_29539] results. Providers of intervention study participants also 
will receive a copy of the SCP with personalized recommendations following both home visits. SCPs are  
IOM -recommended documents now felt to be integral to cancer care, but whose efficacy in modifying 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/[ADDRESS_29540] not previously received a S CP. 
  
3.0 OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIAL  
 
3.1 Study Objectives  
We propose to determine the magnitude of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes underdiagnosis  
(i.e., people with these risk factors but unaware) and undertreatment  (i.e., previously diagnosed but not 
achieving standard treatment goals) among a national sample of childhood cancer survivors. We will 
then test, in a randomized controlled design, the efficacy of an Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended personalized survivorship care plan (SCP) intervention  designed to improve control (i.e., 
reduce undertreatment) of these three CV risk factors. SCPs contain a summary of one’s past cancer treatment and an evidence -based follow -up plan. They are devised to bridge the knowledge gap 
regarding cancer treatment late effects among both survivors and primary healthcare providers. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_30191], few studies have examined the efficacy of SCPs in modifying clinical endpoints. Finally, we will attempt to understand barriers to CV risk factor undertreatment among both survivors and healthcare providers – an understudied area among 
cancer survivors. home) assessments.

  the initial home -visit, ~60% (n~480) will have a blood pressure, 
lipid, and/or glucose value that meets clinical thresholds for intervention. Among those with abnormalities, 40% will have a known pre -existing CV risk 
factor diagnosis but are undertreated, and 80% will be newly diagnosed.  
 
3.1.2 Pr
imary Aim 2 
Among survivors found to be underdiagnosed or undertreated (Aim 1), in a rand
omized controlled design, compare changes in blood pressure, lipid, and blood 
glucose values from baseline to 1 -year between those receiving the intervention  
(providing clinical results and survivorship care plans [SCPs] to participants and 
their healthcare providers, supplemented by [CONTACT_30223] -led remote counseling 
sessions with participants to review SCP contents and teach CV risk factor self-
management strategies) vs. control  (providing clinical results without SCP to 
participants and their healthcare providers; with delayed access to the intervention).  
• Hypothesis : At th e
  1-year follow -up home visit, survivors randomized to the 
intervention arm will have a lower probability of having an undertreated CV risk factor compared with survivors in the control arm.  
 
3.1.3 Pr
imary Aim 3 
Determine barriers among (Aim 2) surv ivors  (at baseline and 1 -year: knowledge of 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/[ADDRESS_29541] cancer treatment, self -efficacy, health- related attitudes, medication 
adhe rence) and their primary healthcare providers  (at 1 -year only: knowledge and 
self- efficacy towards childhood cancer survivorship care) that contribute to 
undertreatment of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes.  
• Hypothesis 1 : At bas e line, underdiagnosis and undertreatment will be 
associated with lower knowledge, self -efficacy, and medication adherence, as 
well as a “self-controlling” health attitude among survivors.  
• Hypothesis 2 : At 1 -ye ar follow -up, intervention- arm participants will report 
improved kno wledge, self -efficacy, and medication adherence vs. controls; 
healthcare providers who received the SCP will report improved knowledge and 
self- efficacy towards CV risk and survivorship care vs. providers of controls.  
 
3.2 Study Population 
The study would seek  to enroll ~800 current  participants of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) 
cohort, an existing NIH-funded resource study with >24,000 cohort members that has been actively funded for >20 years. The study would secondarily also survey participants’ designated primary healthcare provider regarding knowledge and self- efficacy related to care of childhood cancer survivors.  
 3.3 Study Design  
The study’s first primary aim will be answered by [CONTACT_30224] a cross -sectional sample of predicted high 
CV risk patients. Those who meet eligibility criteria will then be randomized to a controlled intervention with delayed intervention controls to answer the study’s second and third primary aims.  
 
3.3.1 Primary Aim 1 Endpoint: Prevalence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the 
following target CV conditions. Underdiagnosis  defined for each as:  
• Hypertension:  Join
 t National Committee (JNC7/8)47,48 considers s ystolic 
120-139 and diastolic pressures 80 -89 mmHg to be suggestive of pre -
hypertension; lifestyle intervention  is recommended.47,49 Hypertension is 
suspected if systolic ≥140 or diastolic ≥90 mmHg, and in addition to lifestyle modification, pharmacologic treatment  is recommended for adults 
<60 years (treatment threshold ≥150 systolic if ≥60 years).
48 We will 
ascertain the prevalence of pre -hypertension and hypertension; both may 
be eligible for Aim 2.  However, with the introduction of the 2017 ACC/AHA 
hypertension guidelines, the classification system has shifted such that systolic ≥130 or diastolic ≥80 mmHg are now considered Stage 1+ hypertension (with treatment threshold reduced accordingly).
50 As such, 
with our 12/2017 protocol modification, we will ad opt these slightly more 
stringent  thresholds for eligibility and drop the prior “pre -hypertension” 
category .   
• Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]:  Americ an Heart Association and American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommend intervening (lifestyle modification first; if unsuccessful,  consider pharmacologic therapy)  among childhood cancer 
survivors for LDL ≥160 mg/dL or fasting triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL.
[ADDRESS_29542] primary care settings now for initial screening, for non -fasting (<10 hours) samples, a 
triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL is considered high. This study will use these cut -
points to define dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_30192]. These thresholds were largely in- line with 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 13 of 40 those defined by a recent NIH -sponsored expert panel,52 and largely similar 
to prior NCEP Adult Treatment Panel recommendations.53  
• Diabetes:  Ame rican Diabetes Association classifies fasting blood glucose 
100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c 5.7- 6.4% as suggestive of impaired glucose 
tolerance (pre -diabetes). Similar to dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], as fasting blood draws are 
not as commo nly done in most primary care settings now for initial 
screening, for non -fasting (<8 hours) samples, blood glucose 140 -199 
mg/dL will be classified as suggestive of pre -diabetes if HbA1c was <5.7%. 
Lifestyle intervention  is recommended (metformin preventi on considered 
for select high risk populations).54 Diabetes requires fasting blood glucose 
≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%. If not -fasting, random blood glucose ≥ 200 
mg/dL would be concerning for diabetes if HbA1c was <6.5%. In addition to 
lifestyle modifications, metformin  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_30193]. We will ascertain the prevalence of pre -diabetes and 
diabetes; both may be eligible for Aim 2.  
 
Under t
reatment defined for each as:  
• While any participant who was previously undiagnosed is also technically undertreated, we will reserve this definition to those who previously or currently reported to CCSS as being diagnosed with hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], or diabetes (either managed by [CONTACT_30225]), if their home -sampled value falls outside the 
recommended therapeutic range: blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mmHg, LDL ≥160 
mg/dL, triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL  (if fasting <10 hours: ≥ 200 mg/dL) , or HbA1c 
≥7.0% (different than the HbA1c d iabetes diagnosis threshold
65). 
 
3.3.2 Primary Aim  2 Endpoint: Probability of intervention subjects having an 
undertreated CV condition compared with the control group at 1 -year follow -up. 
 
3.3.3 Primary Aim 3 Endpoint: Barriers among survivors and their primary healthcare providers that contribute to undertreatment of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and 
diabetes.  
 
3.4 Estimated Accrual  
The proposal would seek to enroll up to 800 participants to answer Primary Aim 1. If 60% of those 
participants are found to have an abnormal CV condition, up to 480 would then be eligible to participate in the randomized controlled trial as part of Primary Aims 2 and 3 (n=240 in each  study arm).  
 3.5 Sponsor/Funding Source  
The study is funded by [CONTACT_30226] (National Cancer Institute).  
 
 
4.0 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
We believe this protocol/study will be minimal risk. The proposed home visits and biosample and data collection pose minimal risk to participants. Anthropometric measurements are all non -invasive. There 
would be a blood draw (thus potential for brief mild pain) associated with any home visit (1 to 2 over the 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 14 of 40 course of the study for any given participant). The study team will ensure that the amount drawn at any 
visit is safe from a blood volume standpoint. It is possible, but unlikely, that some survey questions may cause participants to feel uncomfortable. All instruments proposed have been previously used in other research. For participants selected to participate in the randomized intervention trial, it is possible that 
receipt of clinical lab results may cause some participants to feel uncomfortable or anxious. Similarly, 
receipt of a SCP with an individual’s predicted cardiovascular risk may cause anxiety or discomfort. We will be monitoring self-reported anxiety and depression as part of our study. Prior CCSS studies have not  
shown that receipt of such survivorship care plans to be a source of significant anxiety.[ADDRESS_29543] results will be 
reported to the study team in real time, in which case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_28678], can notify the participant more quickly to seek medical follow -up. This process is similar to and adapted from that used by [CONTACT_30222]-sponsored NHANES for their in -person mobile assessments. For participants (either intervention or 
delayed control) with clinically actionable results but who have no curre nt healthcare provider, the 
study team has access to resources to aid participants in finding providers in their area who have expertise in treating survivors of childhood cancer. This will be clearly explained on their results letter.

5.2.1 Individuals with known cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease based on prior 
CCSS surveys are excluded . While not likely to be common, participants who newly 
report in our study’s baseline survey that they have cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease can have a home visit completed but will then be done with the study regardless of their home visit results .  
 
5.2.2 No
t currently known to be pregnant; individuals known to be pregnant and 
otherwise eligible for the study can be enrolled once no longer known to be pregnant. Participants who report being pregnant AFTER randomization can remain in the study.

6.[ADDRESS_29553] . Jude  will be responsible for  sending out approach packets to these patients 
(introductory letter, Consent, Healthcare Provider Form,  HIPAA, study questionnaire, and upfront 
honorarium). We will also have  the Consent/  Healthcare Provider Form/ HIPAA  Form  and the study 
questionnaire available online . For non -responders, St. Jude interviewers will follow -up with phone calls 
using their standard process. As part of St. Jude’s standard CCSS process for other CCSS activities, participants will have the option of  indicating consent by [CONTACT_30228], signing an online 
consent, or  by [CONTACT_30229] a CCSS St. Jude interviewer.  Similarly, questionnaires can also 
be completed by [CONTACT_30230].   
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 16 of 40 With our 12/[ADDRESS_29554] less of participants upfront can improve accrual. Specifically, in addition to the existing approach process, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a 2
nd process by [CONTACT_30231]  (an option to complete this on -line will still be mentioned in 
the cover letter). Participants who consent in this fashion but who do not complete the on -line 
questionnaire will then be sent a paper version. A 3rd proc ess will also be pi[INVESTIGATOR_30194] a 
tiered consent process by [CONTACT_30232]. For those participants who consent in this  
fashion, after they complete the initial home visit and are found to be eligible for the randomized intervention trial, they will then receive the second consent form that describes the trial. If one of these alternative approach processes results in a substantially higher enrollment rate, that process will then be adopted as our standard approach.  
 Contact [CONTACT_30233] a
 designated exam service 
provider  (e.g., EMSI) who may  then directly communicate and schedule a home visit with the 
participant. As part of the home visit, for those participants who did not provide a paper -signed copy of 
their HIPAA authorization / Medical Record Release form (since we are unsure electronic or verbal signatures will be acceptable for primary care providers’ offices), staff will also ask participants for their willingness to sign a HIPAA authorization and Medical Record Release (to enable the study to obtain 
their primary care provider’s medical records).  
 Based on the study’s eligibility criteria, we do not believe patients who are approached will be subsequently found to be ineligible. It is possible (although unlikely) that we may identify someone who has died since their last CCSS contact.  CCSS staff at St. Jude are trained to deal with this situation and 
CCSS records will be updated accordingly. Also unlikely but possible, an otherwise eligible participant may have moved and may now live in at an address outside the exam service provider area. Should this 
occur, the study will send the participant a thank you/acknowledgment letter indicating that they will not be able to participate this time ( Appendix).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_29555] Release will also be sent to the Fred Hutch study coordinator.

g participants who meet eligibility for primary aim 2, there this will be a computer randomization 
on a 1:1 basis to intervention: control assignment, with the control group eligible to receive the intervention on a delayed basis (following the 2
nd home visit). The study’s goal will be to review in-
person collected test results in real- time (within [ADDRESS_29557]. Jude) and determine 
eligibility with randomization assignment the same day. Given the intervention, it cannot be blinded to 

Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 18 of 40 either participant or study clinician. Staff who perform  the home visits and the study biostatisticians will 
be blinded to the study group assignment.    
 
7.3 Intervention Group 
The intervention is a personalized clinician -led S C P-focused self -management counseling session that is 
generalizable to a real clinical setting. A printed SCP with personalized health history, recommendations, 
and clinically meaningful results from the initial home visit (i.e., average blood pressure, lipid profile, diabetes screening, BMI) will first be mailed to survivors on the intervention arm. We will then schedule 
participants for a remote counseling session via telephone  or HIPAA -compliant web video if the  
participant prefers . The 1
st session with a study clinician will ideally be ≤30 min utes  to review the SCP 
and make mutually agre ed upon goals  and an action plan  (see Appendix). We will ask scripted questions 
designed to address understanding of the SCP, elicit intentions to act on the SCP information, and elicit potential barriers and their solutions related to any planned actions.  After the session, the personalized 
action plan will be mailed to the participant.  
 Appro
ximately 4 -months after the initial counseling session, participants will schedule a  2nd session by 
[CONTACT_756], or HIPAA -compliant web video  if the participant prefers , with  the study clinician to follow -up 
on the action plan, address any barriers to the plan and mutually agree on a revised plan if needed (ideally ≤15 min). The clinician will also rate the survivor’s completion of the action p lan from 0 (none of 
the plan completed and no apparent intention to complete the plan) to 10 (action plan complete; see Appendix).  
 For the both the baseline and 4 -month follow -up sessions, the duration of the sessions will be recorded 
to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention within the time allotted ( ≤30 and ≤15 minutes, 
respectively). The session s also will be audiotaped for process evaluation of content and fidelity of the 
clinician adherence to the intervention manual.  This is further described in Section 8 .  
 7.4 Delayed Intervention Control  
Survivors in the control arm will receive a copy of clinically meaningful baseline home visit results, with a gene
ral recommendation to seek medical follow -up in instances where any of those values are abnormal 
since we consider it unethical to withhold su ch information. A copy also will be sent to their designated 
healthcare provider. As such, the control group’s health may be improved simply by [CONTACT_28224]. At 4-months , participants will receive a generic thank you letter by [CONTACT_30234]. This will 
include a reminder of the 2nd home visit, and to enhance control group retention, control participants 
will be told that they can receive the study intervention (minus the 4 -month booster session) after 
completing the 2nd home visit and any ass ociated surveys. This will include reviewing an SCP and self-
management strategies with the study clinician, but we will avoid using those exact terms to minimize control group contamination.  
 7.[ADDRESS_29558] (within the last 2 years) 
primary  healthcare provider(s). Current designated providers will receive a copy of all materials sent to 
study participants. Thus, h ealthcare providers of particip ants randomized to the intervention arm will be 
mailed a print copy of the SCP with home visit results and the survivors’ personalized action plan. We 
will directly send the SCP to providers because studies have shown that reliance on survivors alone to 
disseminate a copy of their SCP to their provider is problematic.46,[ADDRESS_29559] the research team with

• Following the 1st home visit, h ealthcare providers designated by [CONTACT_30235] a print copy of the home visit results only.  
 
• Following the 2nd home visit, healthcare providers of participants on both study arms will be 
surveyed  with regards to their self-efficacy (including self- reported knowledge) towards 
providing care for childhood cancer survivors. The survey will be accompanied by a cover letter, copi[INVESTIGATOR_30195] (both groups), a SCP (intervention group only), and  the patient’s signed  
HIPAA authorization and Medical Record Release  (if available) , requesting records from the past 
3 years . If the budget permits, the study will provide an upfront honorarium to providers  (not 
exceeding $20) . Non -responding providers wi ll receive a 2
nd survey packet (inclusive of clinical 
results, SCP if applicable, and the signed HIPAA authorization and Medical Record Release if 
available ) approximately a month  later with an alternative cover letter. N o honorarium will 
accompany the 2nd packet . This will be faxed to the provider’s office if a fax number is available, 
and/or mailed. We will repeat this process two more times if no response is received after another month.   
For participants (either intervention or delayed control arm) with clinically actionable results but who have no current healthcare provider,  the study team has access to resources to aid participants in finding 
providers in their area who have expertise in treating survivors of childhood cancer. This will be clearly 
explained on their results letter and by [CONTACT_30236] -video .

*These also will be drawn at the 2nd home visit; remaining tubes would NOT be drawn at the 2nd home visit unless 
they could not be successfully drawn at the first visit.  2nd home visit only: blood spot offered for failed venous 
draw s. 
 
With our 7/2020 protocol modification, in response to the unexpected closure of the study’s original exam servic e provider (EMSI), replacement service providers may include those that do not provide 
home -based services but rather fixed laboratory / service centers that the participant travels to in order 
to obtain the specified research blood draw. In these instance s, only tubes 1 -2 (Table 5 ) will b e drawn 
and processed on -site (i.e., tubes 3 -6 will not be drawn).  
 Rarely, in past experiences with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_30196] -based studies, exam service 
staff will be unsuccessful in obtaining blood given technical issues. In this situation, the participant will 
be offered the choice of having the procedure be rescheduled to another date. If the participant refuses 
and the primary study endpoints (lipid profile, blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1c) cannot be collected, then the patient will not be eligible to continue on the study. Any partial results will still be sent back to the participant and their designated primary care provider.  
 8.3 Baseline Counseling Session (Intervention Group)  
A printed SCP with personalized health history, recommendations, and clinically meaningful results from the home visit (i.e., average blood pressure, lipid profile, diabetes screening, BMI) will first be sent to 
survivors on the int ervention arm. Interpretation of these results is as defined in Section 3.3.1.  We will 
then schedule participants for a remote counseling session by [CONTACT_30238] , per participant 
choice). This will be scheduled as soon as possible following the initial home visit with a goal of having 
this being completed within 2 months of the home visit. Sessions completed outside of the 2 -month 
window will be flagged (but remain eligible for analysis). The following outcomes will be measured at this time point:  
 
• Creation of a personalized goals and action plan (Appendix).  
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 22 of 40 • Counseling session completion rates, with goal of obtaining ≥85% completion within 2 months 
of the initial home visit.  
• Call duration, with goal of achieving ≥85% being ≤30 minutes in duration.  
• Study clinician fidelity to the intervention. Fidelity will be scored using standard methods across 8 levels with the 8
th a global rating ( Appendix). Trainers will review audiotapes of sessions, with 
fidelity ratings and feedback to the clinician until the mean of 4 consecutive global ratings are ≥3.5 (scale: 0 [poor] to 5 [very good]). Once certified, trainers will review audio recordings and complete fidelity ratings for 15% of sessions, more if fidelity dips below a global rating of 3 (satisfactory) for [ADDRESS_29563] attempts. We will cease scheduling attempts if no session has been scheduled by 3 months after the 
initial home visi t. These participants will not be eligible for the 4 month booster session (discussed 
below). However, we will still attempt to re -assess their health status at the 1 -year time point with a 2
nd 
questionnaire and home visit.  If a participant has to cancel and reschedule , the rescheduled date can fall 
outside the 3 month deadline  and we will attempt to do the booster session within the target time range 
still. 
 
8.4 Baseline Return of Results (Control Group)  
Survivors in the control arm will receive a copy of clinically meaningful baseline home visit results, with a general recommendation to seek medical follow -up in instances where any of those values are abnormal 
since we consider it unethical to withhold such information. Interpretation of these results is as defined in Section 3.3.1.  A copy also will be sent to their designated healthcare provider. These will be issued 
within one month of the home visit.   8.5 Handling of Critical Results  
 Staff will be asked t o ship out blood samples within 24 hours (could be slightly longer on weekends) of 
collection, and data forms will be faxed, both to the CCSS data coordination center at St. Jude. Once received, labs will be processed in real- time (i.e., not batched) by [CONTACT_3433] e CLIA -certified lab at St. Jude. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_30197]. 
In the event that a critical test result is  found (see Table 6), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_28678], will attempt to  notify 
the part icipant more quickly by [CONTACT_30239] -up (rather than waiting for a letter to be 
generated and mailed to the participant). This process is similar to and adapted from that used by [CONTACT_6750]-sponsored NHANES for their in -person mobile assessmen ts.

Page 23 of 40 8.6 Four -month Booster  Session  
Among the intervention group, the study will attempt to schedule the participant for a brief 15 -minute 
check- in by [CONTACT_30240] -video 4 -months (±1 month) after the initial counseling session. For 
intervention subjects who have such booster sessions outside  the 3 -5 month window, their data will be 
flagged but would still remain eligible for analysis. The following outcomes will be captured at this time 
point:  
 
• Study clinician rating of participants’ action plan completion, ranging from 0 (none of the plan 
completed and no apparent intention to complete the plan) to 10 (action plan complete; see 
Appendix).  
• Similar to the baseline session, we will cease try ing to schedule this booster session if no session 
has been scheduled by [ADDRESS_29564] approximately 1 -year after the initial 
questionnaire and home visit . The study will send pa rticipants  an abridged version of the baseline 
questio nnaire  (by [CONTACT_2319], with phone/email follow -up as necessary) with a reminder that a 2nd home visit 
is also due soon. After the participants complete the follow -up questionnaire, the study  will work with  
the exam service provider  to contact [CONTACT_3433] e participant to arrange for the 2nd home visit. The study will 
attempt to have all 2nd home visits occur within 3 months of the 1 -year anniversary, and visits that occur 
outside that 3- month window will be flagged (but remain eligible for analysis). The fol lowing outcomes 
will be measured at this time point:  
 
• Same physical measurements  as before : standing height, weight, blood pressure at rest (3 
times), and waist circumference . 
• Blood draw ( no fasting required ): lipid profile, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin ( Table 
5; other assays will not be drawn unless they could not be drawn at the first home visit).  
• If the exam service provider  is unsuccessful in obtaining blood due to a technical issue, or the 
participant refuses the venous blood draw at the second visit, we will offer the participant the 
option of  a finger poke to obtain a blood spot sample  (i.e., dried blood spot, DBS) . Blood spots 
will only be offered as a back -up option  at the second visit.  
• Handling of any critical results will be conducted similarly as per the baseline home visit (see 
Sect
ion 8.5  above). In contrast to venous samples, DBS -based measurements of the lipid profile, 
glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c will not  be released back to participants or their providers. 
This is because such measurements are not performed in a CLIA -certified setting and are 
currently designed for epi[INVESTIGATOR_30198] (and not for clinical care), and also will be batched (in contrast to venous samples which are processed in nea r real- time).  
 Shou
ld home visits be completely declined or impossible to conduct (e.g., due to COVID -19 or other 
public health issues where social distancing is encouraged/mandated), the protocol will permit 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 24 of 40 substitution of a completely remote assessment procedure for the follow -up visit. This would necessarily 
be slightly modified from the exam service provider- obtained home visit in the following ways:  
 
• Physical measurements will only include: weight and blood pressure at rest (3 times). These will 
be c
ollected using a scale and blood pressure cuff that the study can provide to study 
participants. If participants already have a digital scale at home, they can use their own scale in 
place of a scale the study provides.  Blood pressure cuff and scale can b e kept by [CONTACT_30241] t need to be returned to the study team.  These results can be returned to participant 
and their primary healthcare provider, but would be clearly noted as participant -collected.   
• Blood draw will be replaced by [CONTACT_30242] d sp ecified above, with the same caveat that DBS 
results cannot be returned to participants.  
 
8.8 Primary healthcare provider measurements  
Following the 2nd home visit, accompanying the mailing of a copy of participant materials (intervention 
group: clinical results and SCP; control group: clinical results only), all designated providers will be asked to answer questions adapted from the NCI/ACS SPARCCS (see Appendix ).
[ADDRESS_29565] outpatient clinical records (clinician notes, medication lists, laboratory results) spanning the study period (and up to [ADDRESS_29566] home visit) from all participants’ primary 
healthcare providers. We will abstract records for: 1) documentation of the participant’s prior cancer 
history and CV risk status in relation to past cancer exposures; 2) any reference to a SCP or long -term 
follow -up guideline; 3) any CV 
screening planned or undertaken [coded separately]; 4) presence of any  
 of the three target CV risk factors as a 
diagnosis/problem; and 5) interventions to address any CV risk factor [coding lifestyle or drug prescription separately]. Medications will be reviewed to examine whether, among those undertreated at the 1
st 
home visit, there is subsequent treatment intensification (e.g., going from lifestyle prescription alone to adding medication; from lower to higher drug doses; from single to multiple drugs; Table 7), and whether treatment intensity differs 
across study arms after the intervention.  
 Description of how the study will engage with primary healthcare providers is otherwise described in Section 7.5.  
 8.9 Materials returned to participants and primary healthcare providers  
Information the study will send (by [CONTACT_2319]) back to study participants and their designated current primary 
healthcare provider are summarized in Table 8.

8.10 Remote blood pressure monitoring pi[INVESTIGATOR_30199], we will also approach participants regarding their w illingness 
to perform home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) via mHealth (i.e., Bluetooth -enabled) devices. The 
rationale for this is that compared with our standard measurement approach, home monitoring is likely 
to be more accurate, both in ruling out “wh ite coat” hypertension as well as ruling in “masked” 
hypertension.[ADDRESS_29567] completed their 2nd home 
visit (or 1st home visit if all values were normal and they were otherwise not eligible to participate in the 
randomized controlled trial)  and ask them to collect home blood pressures [ADDRESS_29568] to study participants. 
Participants would be requested to download the blood pressure manufacturer’s mHealth a pplication 
(app) which will collect measured blood pressure values as well as a 2nd study -specific mHealth app 
(Eureka,  UC San Francisco), which is designed to facilitate mHealth research and transmit research -
specific reminders (e.g., phone notifications or texts) and instructions to participants, as well as provide investigators the ability to access the blood p ressure values collected on the monitors.  
 The primary goals of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_30200], including participation rate and the proportion of participants who transmit >75% of requested data (>9 measurements in one 
month). Secondary goals would be to determine the pro portion of individuals who may have “white 
coat” hypertension (i.e., in -person collected values are systolic ≥130 or diastolic ≥ 80 mmHg but HBPM 
average is lower) or “masked” hypertension (i.e., in- personcollected values are systolic <130 and 
diastolic <80 mmHg, but average HBPM is greater). Data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_30201] a future follow -up study tha t involves using HBPM as part of the study assessment and 
intervention.  
 Participants would be approached as part of their final home visit results mailing, and those interested would be instructed to download the Eureka app onto their smartphone and prov ide informed consent 
on that app. The study team would follow -up by [CONTACT_648]  (including text messaging) and/ or email among 
non-responders to determine interest. Participants would be eligible for an additional incentive upon 
completing this 1 -month pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] ( choice of either keepi[INVESTIGATOR_30202] a $ [ADDRESS_29569]). As all blood pressure measurements will be visible to participants on both the monitor as well as 
the m anufacturer’s app on their phones, they will be encouraged to share any valu es with their 
healthcare provider if they have concerns.  
 
Specific eligibility for this follow -up pi[INVESTIGATOR_30203]:  
• CHIIP study participant who has completed their 2
nd home visit (or 1st home visit if all values 
were normal and they were otherwis e not eligible to participate in the randomized controlled 
trial);  
• Has access to an internet -connected smart phone capable of downloading apps from either 
Apple or Android -based “app stores”;  
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 26 of 40 • Consents to this follow -up study, which includes being willing to download both the blood 
pressure monitor manufacturer app as well as research Eureka app, and being willing to receive 
study -specific reminders (phone notifications and/or text reminders);  
• Arm circumference is within the parameters of the home blood pres sure monitor manufacturer 
specifications.  
 
 
9.0 OFF STUDY CRITERIA  
 
This would occur if:  
 
• A participant withdrew consent for any further data submission, or  
• The participant was unable to complete the initial home visit procedures (e.g., unsuccessful blood draw), or  
• Once a participant has completed all study assessments.  
  
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
10.1 Expected Adverse Event s  
The CHIIP study is considered a low -risk  educational and behavioral intervention study. The proposed 
home visits and biosample and data collection itself pose minimal risk to participants. Anthropometric 
measurements are all non- invasive. There would be a blood draw (thus potential for brief mild pain) 
associated with any home visit (1 to 2 over the course of the study for any giv en participant). The study 
team will ensure that the amount drawn at any visit is safe from a blood volume standpoint. It is possible, but unlikely , that some survey questions may cause participants to feel uncomfortable. All 
instruments proposed have been  previously used in other research.  
 For participants selected to participate in the randomized intervention trial, it is possible that receipt of 
clinical lab 
 results may cause some participants to feel uncomfortable or anxious. Similarly, receipt of a 
SCP with an individual’s predicted cardiovascular risk may cause anxiety or discomfort. We will be 
monitoring self-reported anxiety and depression as part of our study. Prior CCSS studies have not shown 
that receipt of such survivorship care plans to be a source of significant anxiety.[ADDRESS_29570] results will be 
reported to the study team in real time, in which case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_28678], can notify the participant more quickly to seek medical follow -up. This process is similar to and adapted from that used by [CONTACT_30222]-sponsored NHANES for their in -person mobile assessments. For participants (either interv ention or 
delayed control) with clinically actionable results but who have no current healthcare provider, the study team has access to resources to aid participants in finding providers in their area who have expertise in treating survivors of childhood cancer. This will be clearly explained on their results letter.   
 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/[ADDRESS_29571] individually identifiable private information. These include: appropriate human subjects research training for all staff with potential access to private information; technological safeguards such as use of encrypted data transmission 
between sites, secure password protection on computer servers; removal of identifiers at the earliest 
possible time and using separate unique study IDs instead; keepi[INVESTIGATOR_30204] -walk files separate from 
the main analytic dataset(s); and avoiding showing individual data in any presentation or publication.  
 
10.2 Monitoring and Recordings Adverse Events  
As the CHIIP study is considered a low -risk e d ucational and behavioral intervention, the FHCRC Data 
Safety Monitoring Committee, during the study’s grant application, made an initial determination that overall data and safety monitoring can be overseen by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30205]. All adverse events 
(expected or unexpected) will be reported to the FHCRC and St. Jude IRBs in accordance with the 
respective IRBs’ policies.  
 
 
11.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
The study will use the FHCRC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC will review the summary of all adverse events collected as part of a protocol’s data safety monitoring plan and reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30206], any expedited reports made to the IRB, and may refer 
protocols to the IRB for evaluation when modifications might be required to mitigate risks. The DSMC may also suspend or close the study based on review of the above information. The DSMC will review the accrual, patient safety, and other data at pre -specified intervals (at least annually), and make any 
determinations regarding interim analyses and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. On the basis of its review, the DSMC will provide a study with full approval (accrual continues, no changes), conditional approval (accrual continues but protocol changes required), suspension (accrual is stopped until protocol changes have been made but previously enrolled patients may continue the intervention), or closure (accrual is  
stopped and all interventions must stop).  
  
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
The investigator s will ensure that data collected conform to all established guidelines. Each participant 
has a pre -assigned CCSS ID number that will be used  to protect subject c onfidentiality. Subjects will not 
be referred to by [CONTACT_9127], by [CONTACT_2300], or by [CONTACT_30243] . Subject research files will be  stored in a secure place (or database). Access is 
restricted to authorized personnel, with supervision by [CONTACT_30244] (Chow) and St. Jude 
(Armstrong). An existing data transfer/sharing agreement between FHCRC and St. Jude covers the 
exchange and shar ing of existing and newly collated CCSS data. Data will not be shared with any other 
entity or outside investigators (external to those approved by [CONTACT_30245]) without approval by [CONTACT_30246].  
 
 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 28 of 40 13.1 Aim 1 Analytic Plan 
Hypothesis : Approximately 60% of participants will have an abnormal CV risk -fact or finding that meets 
clinical intervention thresholds, and among those with abnormalities, 40% will be undertreated and 80% 
newly diagnosed.  
 Primary analyses : We w
 ill calculate the prevalence of hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes by [CONTACT_6270] -
report and by [CONTACT_30247]. We will then calculate the proportions (with exact 95% confidence intervals) of participants who may be underdiagnosed as well as the proportions undertreated (like Figure 3 ). We will calculate the prevalence of directly measured pre -diabetes 
separately. Secondary analyses : We will examine whether rates differ by: [CONTACT_4321]; current age; time since 
cancer diagnosis; obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) vs. not; health in surance vs. not; recent history of being seen in 
a dedicated long- term follow -up clinic for survivors vs. not; and lifestyle factors (smoking, low 
fruit/vegetable intake, low physical activity).  
 
Sample size considerations: Base d on prevalence 
estimates from CCSS surveys and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] ( Table 
2, Figure 3), we expect ~60% of high CV risk 
participants (n~480) to have an abnormal CV risk factor measurement; prevalence of individual risk 
factors ranging 20 -40% (less when stratified by 
[CONTACT_30248]/undertreatment status ). With an 
overall sample n=800, we expect reasonable precision for our primary prevalence estimates ( Table 9). 
Power to detect d ifferences <10% in secondary analyses may be more limited.

 SI pi[INVESTIGATOR_30208] 60% enrollment. Funding from this proposal will 
enhance recruitment rates by [CONTACT_1541] a n upfront (rather than conditional) participation incentive, 
which has been associated with higher rates of study participation.62,[ADDRESS_29572] to 
assess the sensitivity of our estimates.  
 
13.2 Aim 2 Analytic Plan 
Hypothesis : survivors randomized to the intervention will have a lower probability of having an 
undertreated CV risk factor compared with the control group at 1 -year follow -up. 
 Primary analyses : We will 
 describe baseline characteristics (including mean/median values of our target 
CV parameters) and proportions of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of our 3 CV risk factors. Our primary analysis will focus on the difference in the probability of having a CV risk factor undertreated after the 2
nd home visit across the 2 study arms. As in Aim 1, undertreatment of hypertensio n, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes at the 2nd home visit will be defined as blood pressure ≥130/ 80 mmHg, LDL 
≥160 or triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL  (if fasting <10 hours: ≥ 200 mg/dL) , or HbA1c ≥7%, respectively. 
Survivors with pre -diabetes at baseline  will be undertre ated at the 2nd home visit if fasting glucose ≥100 
mg/dL (non- fasting ≥14 0 mg/dL ) or HbA1c≥5.7%. As some survivors may contribute up to 3 outcomes 
(persistent hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes/pre -diabetes), we will use generalized estimating 
equations (GEE), accounting for intra- individual correlation of the [ADDRESS_29573] as a single parameter (3 -element vector). If multiple survivors share the same 
primary healthcare provider (unlikely), we will apply random effects models in lieu of GEE given multiple TABLE 9. Estimated power for Aim 1 analyses.

Page 29 of 40 cluster types. Analyses will be conduc ted per intent- to-treat, and include all survivors with available end 
points.   
 
Secondary analyses : In ca se survivors who were newly diagnosed (i.e., underdiagnosed) following their 
1st home visit differ in their response to the intervention vs. those prev iously diagnosed but 
undertreated, we will examine estimates stratified by [CONTACT_30249] 1st home visit. For similar 
reasons, we also will examine estimates if pre -diabetes are excluded. In our primary model, we also will 
explore whether differen ces vary by [CONTACT_4321], current age, time since cancer diagnosis, obese (BMI ≥30 
kg/m2) vs. not, health insurance vs. not, and recent history of being seen in a dedicated long- term 
follow -up clinic for survivors vs. not. We also will explore, among intervention p articipants, whether 
action plan scores from the 4 -month session are associated with differential undertreatment rates (as a 
single parameter). Finally, we plan to also compare across the study arms, the measured CV risk factor 
values from the 2nd home vis it separately: 1) average systolic pressure, 2) average diastolic pressure, 3) 
LDL, 4) triglyceride, 5) blood  glucose, and 6) HbA1c. For this subanalysis we will use linear models, 
adjusting for the value at the 1st home visit as a covariate.  
 Sample size  consi
 derations: Assuming 60% of Aim 1 participants (n=800) meet Aim 2 eligibility with a 
subsequent conservative 20% drop -out rate, ~380 survivors (190/arm) would have complete data. The 
study would be 80% powered (α=0.05) to detect RRs ≤0.88 (i.e., ≥12% reduction in the intervention vs. control group) if the prevalence of having an undertreated CV risk factor among controls after the 2
nd 
home visit was 90% (10% reduction from baseline). If controls had an unlikely 50% reduction, we can still detect RRs ≤0 .71. Analyses stratified by [CONTACT_30250] (~75 -150/arm) 
will be able to detect RRs ≤0.79 to ≤0.86, respectively. Systematic reviews have reported RRs 0.6 -0.8 for 
strategies similar our proposed interventions in the general population.
64,65 For continuous outcomes 
(secondary analyses), we will be powered to detect change equaling ~30% of [ADDRESS_29574] deviation, which equates to 5 mmHg systolic blood pressure, 3 mmHg diastoli c pressure, 10 mg/dL LDL, 30 mg/dL 
triglyceride, 10 mg/dL glucose, and 0.3% HbA1c. Differences within these ranges have been reported by [CONTACT_30251].
66-68 
 Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207] / solutions : We will c
 losely monitor rates of abnormalities identified in Aim 1, as that 
influences the number of survivors eligible for Aim 2. As discussed earlier, we will oversample survivors known to have rarer target conditions (e.g., diabetes) such that the power to detect differences in Aim 2 is enhanced. Separately, given the nature of the intervention, participants and the study clinician cannot be blinded. However,  exam staff will be blinded to randomization status.  
 13.3 A
im 3 Analytic Plan 
Hypotheses : 1) at baseline, underdiagnosis & undertreatment are associated with lower knowledge, self -
efficacy, and medication adherence (if applicable), as well as a “self -controlling” health attitude among 
survivors; 2) at 1 -year follow -up, compared with the control arm, the intervention arm will be associated 
with improved knowledge, self -efficacy, and adherence rates among survivors, and improved knowledge 
and self -efficacy among healthcare providers.  
 Baseline survivor -spec
 ific factors : Using data from all Aim [ADDRESS_29575] lower knowledge  (i.e., less 
accurate recall of prior anthracycline or chest radiotherapy exposures [chi- square test]) and lower 
health -related self- efficacy  [t-test or Wilcoxon rank -sum] compared with those not affected. Similarly, 
among those who report medications for the CV risk factors of interest, determine whether those undertreated have lower medication adherence  (i.e., lower mean MMAS -4 scores [t -test or Wilcoxon 
Protocol 8543: Version 7/10/20  
Page 30 of 40 rank -sum]) v s. those not undertreated. Finally, determine if different health -related behavioral attitudes  
(“worried”, “collaborative” and “self- controlling”)69 are associated with differential rates of 
underdiagnosis and undertreatment [chi -square test]. A priori,  we hypothesize that the proportion 
undertreated will be greatest among “self- controlling” survivors vs. “collaborative” and “worried” (least 
undertrea ted) survivors. In subanalyses , we will analyze underdiagnosed participants (i.e., newly 
diagnosed per 1st home visit) separately from those undertreated (i.e., existing diagnosis but not 
meeting standard therapeutic goals) relative to the referent group ( those without any abnormal CV risk 
factor). We also will use a combined logistic regression model to determine if knowledge, medication 
adherence, and health -related behavioral attitudes remain associated with underdiagnosis and 
undertreatment (combined an d separately) after multivariate adjustment. Exploratory covariates are 
similar as before, and include sex, current age, insurance status, healthcare utilization, self- perceived CV 
risk, and family history of CV disease.  
 Post -intervention analysis: Among  Aim 2
  participants (and their designated healthcare provider), we 
will examine the differences between intervention and control groups following the 2nd home visit with 
respect to 1) survivor knowledge [chi -square test], 2) survivor self-efficacy [t -test or Wilcoxon rank -sum], 
3) survivor -reported medication adherence [t- test or Wilcoxon rank -sum], and 4) provider -reported 
knowledge and self -efficacy [chi- square tests] related to the care of childhood cancer survivors. All 
analyses will be intent -to-treat and include all survivors and providers with available end points. 
Subanalyses can stratify these outcomes by [CONTACT_30252]. undertreatment status. We also 
will analyze practice changes over the 1 -year intervention period using clinical records . This includes 
comparing [chi -square test] whether documentation rates differ across study arms of: 1) any CV -related 
screening, 2) CV- related interventions [both lifestyle and drug prescriptions], and 3) treatment intensity 
(Table 7 earlier). If any surv ivors share the same healthcare provider, we will apply bootstrap methods 
to account for the effects of clustering. In secondary analyses , we will determine, via logistic regression 
adjusting for randomization status, whether providers of survivors who remain undertreated have lower self- reported knowledge and self -efficacy related to the care of childhood cancer survivors vs. providers 
of survivors no longer undertreated.  
 Sample size : For c
 ovariates assessed at baseline in Aim 3, we will be able to detect differences ≥5%, RRs 
≤0.8 / ≥1.2, and ≥20% of [ADDRESS_29576] deviation ( Table 10). Among randomized participants  (240/arm) and 
subanalyses (e.g., analyzing undertreatment, underdiagnosis separately: ~75 -150/arm), detectable 
differences will be less.

integrated health systems given the relative rarity of childhood cancer survivors. Given upfront 
randomization, any reporting biases should be similar across study arms. Should our study uncover a 
suggestive association with adherence, this would provide data to support the use of more expensive 
medication monitoring devices in a follow -up study.100 We also anticipate some missing healthcare 
provider responses. It is possible that providers on the intervention arm who receive the SCP could be more motivated to respond (all providers will get clinically relevant results from home visits). We will 
closely monitor response rates for providers across the study arms, and will compare the characteristics of responding vs. non -responding providers using American Medical Association  databases (physicians 
only) and publically available information from state licensing boards and the internet (physicians and other providers).
28,102 In sensitivity analyses, we can examine the differences across study arms after 
adjustment for characteristics that appear to differ between responding and non -responding primary 
healthcare providers.

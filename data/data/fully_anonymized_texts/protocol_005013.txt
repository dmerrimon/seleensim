Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  All treatments will be administered via a  jet nebulizer using the  
compressor. 
Subj
ects who are currently on a stable dose of inhaled steroids will continue the use of these 
medications throughout the course of the study. 
Subjects who are currently using LABA monotherapy (other than formoterol) will be 
switched to formoterol for the duration of the study . Those subjects on ICS/LABA fixed 
dose combinations must be able to switch to an identical dose of ICS monotherapy 
(or equivalent) to be eligible to enroll in the study.  
Screening wi ll involve either one or two visits, depending on whether a washout period is 
required. The first visit will be an Initial Screening Visit (Visit 1A) when informed consent will be obtained and the subject’s existing COPD medication will be assessed to decide whether any adjustments are required to comply with the requirements of the protocol. The 
subject will start a washout period only after signing the informed consent form.  
After completing the washout (if required) , the subject will return for further screening 
assessments, including an Ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_276998] (Visit 1B), electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) and vitals. It is only necessary to conduct the Initial Screening Visit (Visit 1A) and 
Ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_276998] (Visit 1B) as separate visits if a washout is required. If a 
washout period is not required, these two visits may be performed as one visit.  
If a washout period is required, the time from the Initial Screening Visit (Visit 1A) to 
Visit 1B will be at least 48 hours and no longer than 7 days.  
At the Ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_276998] (Visit 1B), the FEV
1 response to a nebulized dose of 
ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (500 mcg) will be tested to determine  the subject’s reversibility  status and  
GOLD category for airflow limitation.   
All remaining inclusion and e xclusion criteria will be reviewed at this Visit 1B  
All subjects will be issued study -specific rescue medication (albuterol metered -dose inhaler 
or MDI) for use throughout the screening period. Subjects will be advised to avoid use of 
their rescue albutero l medication for at least 6 hours prior to each v isit. 
Subjects will come in 2 to 7 days after Screening for Visit 2 (Day 1 of dosing). E ligible 
subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in the study.  
The treatment period will involve 3 visits: 
• Visit 2 (Day 1)  
• Visit 3 (Day 2 1) 
• Visit 4 (Day 42)  
On visit days , subjects will attend the clinic for assessment of pre -dose vital signs, labs, 
ECGs,  and review of AEs and concomitant medications. Subjects 
will admin
ister study medication under supervision at all clinic visits to assess nebulizer 
technique and to correct and retrain as required. ECGs and vital s igns will be measured 
[ADDRESS_337941]-dose at these visits.

Subjects will return to clinic for Visit 4 (Day 42) for in -clinic supervised dosing  
.  Visit [ADDRESS_337944] a visit window o f ±7 days. ECGs will be 
performed after the supervised final dose of the combined administration of revefenacin (or 
placebo) plus formoterol at [ADDRESS_337945] 7 ( ±2) days after Visit 4 (Day 42) to 
assess the subject for any adverse events or changes in concomitant medications.  
Subjects who experience moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) will 
not be allowed to continue and will be withdrawn from the study.  
Duration of Study Participation : Up to 63 days  (including screening and any required 
washout period).  
Number of Subjects per Group: Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled into  each of 
two treatment groups in a blinded 1:1 ratio (total of approximately 120 subjects).

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  1. INTRODUCTION 
Pharmacologic t reatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with 
bronchodilators is central to the management of both the symptoms and the long term risks of 
the condition. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are convenient and may be more effective 
for long-term symptom relief than short-acting bronchodilators; accord ingly, 
widely-accepted treatment guidelines such as those produced by [CONTACT_277034] (GOLD)  recommend the use of long- acting muscarinic 
antagonist (LAMA) bronchodilators as first- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_277007] s with persistent COPD 
symptoms1.  
The use of dual bronchodilation has increasingly been recommended for the treatment of 
COPD. Recent GOLD guidelines have advocated steppi[INVESTIGATOR_277008]. More recently, 
the IMPACT study has demonstrated that triple therapy may have benefit above either 
ICS/LABA therapy or LAMA/LABA therapy.

1.2. Nonclinical Profile  
Revefenacin  is a novel, long- acting, anti -muscarinic agent being developed as an inhalation 
solution for administration via standard jet nebulizer for the treatment of COPD.  A review of 
the nonclinical profile of revefenacin  can be found in the current version of the revefenacin  
Investigator’s Brochure (I B). A brief summary of the pertinent findings follows this section. 
 is a long-acting beta- [ADDRESS_337962] that is [LOCATION_002] Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved for the nebulized treatment of COPD. For 
additional information on the efficacy and safety of Inhalation Solution refer to 
prescribing information.

 Over
all, the pharmacology of revefenacin , when 
administered into the lungs, is consistent with that of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist and 
demonstrates good selectivity for lung versus systemic effects .  
Safety pharmacology studies for  revefenacin  included assessments of potential effects on 
cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_277009] f or potential neurobehavioral effects. These 
studies are summarized in the IB. 
1.2.2. Toxicology 
The toxicology assessment of revefenacin  included single- dose toxicity, repeated -dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance studies. The results of these studies are summarized in the IB.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  1.4. Risks and Benefits  
Subjects participating in this study may be at risk of experiencing adverse events related to 
muscarinic antagonism, including headache, mouth dryness, constipation, blurred vision, 
dizziness and urinary retention.  
Subjects participating in this study may experience discomfort  due to blood draws for 
laboratory testing.     
Clinically significant bronchodilation has been observed in each of the study populations of 
COPD subjects thus far in the development program. Two replicate phase [ADDRESS_337963] demonstrated that the 88 mcg  and 
175 mcg doses of revefenacin were generally well -tolerated, with comparable rates of 
adverse events and seri ous adverse events across all treatment groups (active and placebo). 
The most commonly reported adverse events, across both trials and across all revefenacin 
treatment groups were COPD exacerbation, nasopharyngitis, cough, dyspnea and headache. 
There were no reports of blurred vision, narrow- angle glaucoma or worsening of urinary 
retention, all of which are commonly reported adverse events for this class of medication. I n 
addition, reports of dry mouth were < 0.5% in the revefenacin treatment arms.  A long term 
safety study with a 1- year treatment period revealed a similar safety profile to what 
was observed to the efficacy studies.  
Further detail regarding the safety profile for revefenacin is available in the revefenacin  IB.

The primary and secondary endpoints of this study will assess the long- term safety and 
tolerability of revefenacin in the treatment of COPD: 
• Frequency and severity of adverse events, including COPD exacerbations 
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations  
• 12-lead ECG changes from baseline   
• Heart rate (as measured by [CONTACT_90660])  
The exploratory endpoints of this study  
 
  
3.5. Minimization of Bias   
Bias will be minimized through the use of randomization and a double-blind study design , 
with respect to revefenacin and placebo.    
3.5.1. Blinding 
All study subjects, study investigators and their staff, and the Sponsor’s staff involved in the 
conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment assignment with regard to revefenacin and placebo.  Subjects will be assigned in random ord er to revefenacin  or placebo according to 
the randomization schedule. The only personnel who will have access to the randomization schedule before database lock are:  
• The nominated personnel at the Contract Research Organization responsible for 
generation o f the randomization schedule. 
In the event of an untoward safety observation, the investigator may unblind a subject’s 
treatment assignment using the randomization and treatment supply management (RTSM). 
If possible, the investigator should first contact t he Theravance Clinical Study Director 
before unblinding. The blind should be broken only if knowledge of the subject’s study medication would affect subsequent treatment and such knowledge is required for the clinical management of the subject. Any investigator unblinding will be documented within the 
appropriate section of the subject’s case report from (CRF) and will be captured in the 
RTSM.  
Unblinding of individual study subjects or site staff on the basis of results from the study 
procedures (i.e., self -unblinding) is not considered to be either an expected or likely event.

use. 
Refer to the package insert for further information. 
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance will be assessed in study subjects when accountability is performed as described 
in the next section. Compliance will be defined as subjects who are considered to have 
received 80 -120% of the total number of doses that should have been administered in 
between study visits.  
Compliance outside the 80-120% range will be documented in the e lectronic CRF (eCRF) as 
to reasons why, the number of doses that were outside this range, and whether any adverse 
event occurred as a result of the non -compliance.   
5.4. Drug Accountability and Reconciliation  
The investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accountability records for all study drug(s) received from the Sponsor, in accordance with applic able government 
regulations and study procedures. The accountability record will include entries for receipt, distribution or dispensing, and the on- site destruction or return of the material(s) as specified 
by [CONTACT_456]. Unused and expi[INVESTIGATOR_277012]. 
Study drug accountability will be performed at Visit 3 (Day 21), Visit 4 (Day 42) and any 
unscheduled visit or early termination visit where study drug is returned, to document 
compliance with the dosing regimen. Subjects will be instructed to bring back all remaining 
study drug and all study drug packaging at each study visit for drug accountability. 
Treatment compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_277039] (for revefenacin and 
formoterol).  I f a subject does not return the unused foil pouches, it will be assumed that the 
subject administer ed the study drug . If a subject misses recording  any dose of study drug 
based on the subject’s diary, the site personnel should discuss the missing entries to 
determine if the missing entries are due to not recording the administration in the diary and make any necessary corrections to the diary while the subject is on site. Discrepancies 
between the subject’s diary and the count of returned study drug should be documented in the 
source documents. 
Albuterol count will be not be captured for this study.  Subjects should return their albuterol 
inhaler(s) a t each study visit, and returns should be documented on the accountability logs.  
Subjects will be allowed to retain their albuterol MDI at the end of the study for their 
own use.

6.1. Schedule of Study Procedures  
The schedule of study procedures is summarized in ( Table 1). 
Throughout the study, investigators should conduct the order of the assessments for each 
study visit as indicated in the study procedures and strive to maintain consistency in this 
order. All study procedures for a visit must be completed on the same day. Any missed visits, test not done, or procedures that are not conducted must be reported as such on the eCRFs.  
The scheduling of Visit 3 (Day 21 ± 7  days) and Visit 4 (Day 42, ± 7  days) is based on the 
date of occurrence of Visit  2 (Day [ADDRESS_337974] is randomized). 
The follow-up phone call should be scheduled 7 days after Visit 4, with a ± [ADDRESS_337975] for safety laboratory assessments

Subj
ects on LABAs (e.g., salmeterol, indacaterol, vilanterol, formoterol, arformoterol, 
olodaterol) must be prepared to stop these medications and switch to nebulized formoterol 
for the duration of the study. There is no washout period for LABAs, but the last dose of these medications should have been taken no sooner than 12 hours (for BID medications such

and indacaterol) before the randomization visit.  
Subjects on LABAs in combination with an ICS (e.g., fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], fluticasone 
fuorate, budesonide, ciclesonide, beclomethasone) will need to be switched to ICS monotherapy at the same or equivalent dose. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of ICS 
for at least 30 days prior to study entry. (A change from ICS/LABA to an equivalent ICS 
dose does not require this 30 day stability period). As with LABA monotherapy, if the subject is going to switch to an equivalent ICS monotherapy dose, this can occur on the day 
of randomization, assuming the last dose of LABA occurred as described above 
(12 or 24 hours prior to the visit as appropriate). 
Subjects on TRIPLE therapy would need to follow rules for washing out of the LAMA 
primarily, switching to a LABA and an ICS during this period of time, and then switching to 
study medication for the LABA on the day of randomization as described above. 
The first visit will be Screening Visit 1A.  Informed consent will be obtained and the 
subject’s existing COPD medication will be assessed to decide whether any adjustments are 
required to comply with the requirements of the protocol. If required, subjects will start a washout period only after signing the informed consent form. After completing the necessary 
washout period (if required) subjects will return for Screening Visit 1B within [ADDRESS_337978] two screening visits (Visit 1A and Visit 1B) 
may be conducted as one visit.  The time period from Visit 1B (whether this is combined 
with Visit 1A or not) to randomization at Visit [ADDRESS_337979] should be screen failed.  Repeat screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_277013] a technical issue (e.g.,  with

6.4.3. Safety Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reviewed and recorded from the signing of the informed consent 
through the last day  of the follow-up visit. Adverse events may be observed by [CONTACT_277043]. Subjects will be reminded to call the site 
to report AEs that occur between visits. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical History  
Complete medical history at screening will include evaluation for past and present 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, 
lymphatic , hematologic, immunologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, genitourinary, substance

[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs  
Blood pressure (BP), and heart rate ( HR), will be recorded  only once in the eCRF for each 
protocol specified time point ; at screening only, a second  measurement  may be obtained to 
rule out sustained elevation/decrease of either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Subject need to be resting in a semi- recumbent position for approximately 5 minutes prior to 
assessment of vital signs.  BP will be measured manually using a mercury 
sphygmomanometer or calibrated automatic blood pressure device. HR will be measured by [CONTACT_277044] a 60-second period or by [CONTACT_277045].

[IP_ADDRESS]. ECG – 12-lead  
ECGs will be done singly following a 5- minute semi-recumbent  rest at: 
• Screening Visit 1B  
• Visit 2 (Randomization Visit):  [ADDRESS_337981]-dose. 
• Visit 3 (Day 21) and Visit 4 (Day 42):  [ADDRESS_337982]-dose.  
The time window for the 1 hour pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_76248] ± [ADDRESS_337983]- dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_76248] + 10 minutes only (with no – window). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed in women of child bearing potential. A positive 
urine pregnancy test will be confirmed with a second urine test. If the subject is an early termination or withdrawal, a urine pregnancy test will also be performed at the early termination visit.  
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
6.5. Concomitant Medications  
Inhaled maintenance steroid therapy will be continued at the allowed maintenance dose 
throughout the treatment and washout periods. Albuterol will be allowed as required 
(or “PRN”) during the study. Albuterol should be withheld for at least 6 hours before the 

Protocol 0167, Amendment 1  Version 1.0, 16APR2018  
Revefenacin  Page 43 of 70 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  ECG   
Only study supplied albuterol should be used during the subject’s participation in the study. 
If subjects have used albuterol within 6 hours of the ECG at the Visit 2, the visit should be 
rescheduled.  At each of the remaining visits, if this occurs, the visit will still be conducted, however this will be considered a protocol deviation. 
Subjects who are receiving a LABA or LABA/ICS (either QD or BID) may be enrolled into 
the study provided that the dose has been stable for at least 30 days prior to Screening and the steroid component is ≤1000 mcg /day equivalent to fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847].  
Subjects on LABAs (e.g., salmeterol, indacaterol, vilanterol, formoterol, arformoterol, olodaterol) must be prepared to stop these medications and switch to nebulized formoterol for the duration of the study. There is no washout period for LABAs, but the last dose of 
these medications should have been taken no sooner than 12 hours (for BID medications such 
as salmeterol, formoterol or arformoterol) or 24 hours (for QD medications such as vilaterol 
and indacaterol) before the randomization visit. 
Subjects on LABAs in combination with an ICS (e.g., fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], fluticasone 
fuorate, budesonide, ciclesonide, beclomethasone) will need to be switched to ICS 
monotherapy at the same or equivalent dose. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of ICS 
for at least 30 days prior to study entry. (A change from ICS/LABA to an equivale nt ICS 
dose does not require this 30 day stability period). As with LABA monotherapy, if the 
subject is going to switch to an equivalent ICS monotherapy dose, this can occur on the day 
of randomization, assuming the last dose of LABA occurred as described above (12 or 
24 hours prior to the visit as appropriate). 
The triple therapy will need to be switched to a LABA and ICS therapy during the [ADDRESS_337984] 
of their LABA.  The ICS monotherapy should be continued for the duration of the treatment 
period.   
LABA and LABA/ICS drugs include the following examples:   
• fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/salmeterol combination product  
• budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate combination product  
• fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination product 
• mometasone /formoterol  
The initiation of new treatment for COPD during this study is strictly prohibited. If the 
subject experiences worsening of symptoms that requires additional therapy other than 
increased use of study supplied albuterol (i.e., an exacerbation of their COPD) they should be 
withdrawn from the study and, if the event qualifies, report this event as a serious adverse 
event.  
 
Subjects will be permitted to 
restart their routine medications after the completion of Visit 4.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Table 3: Severity Criteria for COPD Exacerbations  
COPD exacerbation is defined as a complex of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (increase or new onset) 
of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with 
a duration of at least 3 days requiring t reatment with SABAs, antibiotics, systemic steroids, 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
Severity of COPD exacerbation  Criteria  
Mild  A deterioration of COPD symptoms, in the judgment of 
the investigator, managed with an increased use of 
SABA but not requiring the use of antibiotics or oral or 
systemic corticosteroids.  
Moderate  A deterioration of COPD symptoms, in the judgment of 
the investigator, based on any one of the following criteria:  
• An acute change in symptoms with purulent sputum requiring treatment with a cours e of 
antibiotics for lower airway disease  
• An acute change in symptoms requiring 
treatment with a course of oral steroid for lower airway disease 
• Subjects meeting the above criteria may receive treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277020] <1 day  
Severe  A deterioration of COPD symptoms that results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277021] ≥1 day.  
Subjects who experience a mild or moderate COPD exacerbation (one or more) may continue 
in the trial.  However, COPD exacerbations that are severe or result in a serious adverse event, will be discontinued from the trial.   
The Sponsor will be notified of all subject withdrawals.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early because of an adverse reaction should be 
encouraged to continue their participation in the follow- up safety assessments . If a subject 
fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine the reason.

discontinuation of the trial, as for example, when  several cases of similar serious adverse 
events (SAEs) considered related by [CONTACT_277046] s. The 
Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study at any time for any reason.   
6.8. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the clinical study director (or designee) must be notified immediately  and the subject discontinued from the study.  
The Investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Reporting Form 
within [ADDRESS_337985] be completed and submitted within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s becoming aware of any new information. The Investigator is required to follow up on the pregnancy until it has completed.  
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. The outcome of the pregnancy and the status of the newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s becoming aware of that information. 
6.9. COPD Exacerbations 
Exacerbations of COPD that are considered severe or result in a serious adverse event are cause for withdrawal from the study and will be capture d as a reason for study termination.

7.1. Definitions 
The definitions below are based on International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
guideline E2A, “Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting”. 
7.1.1. Adverse Events (AE) for the Purposes of This Study  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
• AEs may be new events  
• Preexisting e vents that increase in frequency, severity or change in nature or 
seriousness during or as a consequence of participation in clinical studies. 
• Pre- or post-treatment complications that occur as a result of a protocol-mandated 
procedure (such as a biopsy). 
• AEs may be clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory results, x- ray 
findings). 
• AEs may result from an overdose of the study medication.  
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  
An AE does not include the following: 
• All COPD exacerbations (mild, moderate and severe) will be qualified as an 
Adverse Event. Please see definitions of COPD exacerbations in Table 3. 
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event 
• Preexisting diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an informed consent form that do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277022]/or convenience admissions) 
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms, unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277023] c onsent form is considered to be preexisting 
and should be documented in the medical history CRF. 
Protocol 0167, Amendment 1  Version 1.0, 16APR2018  
Revefenacin  Page 51 of 70 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct 
of the study, Theravance Biopharma will be notified according to the procedures for SAE 
reporting as outlined in Section  7.4.3.  Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the 
pregnancy and any fetal or neonatal sequelae will be obtained and documented. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence occurring at any dose that results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening situation.   “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Note:  “Inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency 
department. A scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not 
worsened during participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208350]/surgical procedure, scheduled 
treatments, or routine check-ups do not meet this criterion. C omplications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
drug 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. Examples of such events are as follows: 
− Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm 
− Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
− Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
7.1.3. Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an adverse event and not an adverse event in itself. Deaths of unknown cause for which the investigator cannot identify a cause of death will 
be captured as death of unknown cause or death not otherwise specified. 
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs 
while the subject is participating in the study.  
Protocol 0167, Amendment 1  Version 1.0, 16APR2018  
Revefenacin  Page 52 of 70 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  • “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at 
the time of th e event; dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or 
interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to 
the event.  
7.2. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Eve nts 
Abnormal laboratory findings (such as clinical chemistry  or hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (such as ECGs, X -rays, or vital signs) that are considered clinically significant in 
the judgment of the investigator must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition 
of an adverse event (or serious adverse event), as described in Sections  7.1.1 (Adverse Event) 
and 7.1.2 (Serious Adverse Event). 
If there are any AE questions, t he investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_277047]. 
7.3. Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_277048], including 
the dates of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with study medication. 
7.3.1. Severity 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe nausea).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  The severity of AEs will be assessed according to the following definitions:   
• Mild:  the AE is noticeable to the patient and/or the Investigator, but does not 
interfere with routine activity.  
• Moderate:  the AE interferes with routine activity, but responds to symptomatic 
therapy or rest.  
• Severe:  the AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795].  
7.3.2. Causal Relationship to Study Medication 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality is based on clinical judgment regarding t he 
reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the event and may include 
consideration of some or all of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, 
co-morbid conditions, other drugs, and environmental factors. 
• The temporal  association between drug exposure and onset of the AE.  
Protocol 0167, Amendment 1  Version 1.0, 16APR2018  
Revefenacin  Page 53 of 70 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  • Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with 
known actions or toxicity of the study medication. 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98177] (“dechallenge”) or recurred or worsened upon re-exposure to the 
study medication (“rechallenge”).  
The causal relationship between the study medication and the AE will be described using one of the following categories: 
• Not Related:   Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than 
the study drug (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
• Related: A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of the study drug. It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_277024]. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon rechallenge. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of adver se 
event reporting. 
7.4. AE Reporting and Recording  
7.4.1. AE Reporting  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials is crucial for the protection of patients and is mandated by [CONTACT_17513].  
Sponsor has established standard operating procedures in compliance with regulatory 
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information.  All clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_98211].  
7.4.2. AE and SAE  Recording 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to study medication, will 
be recorded from signing informed consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact [CONTACT_98212] a follow -up telephone call) .  AEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  
SAEs, regardless  of relationship to study medication will be recorded from signing informed 
consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact [CONTACT_98212] a follow -up 
telephone call).   Additionally, inves tigators may report SAEs assessed as related to study 
medication through [ADDRESS_337986] study visit (or last subject contact [CONTACT_277049] a follow-up telephone call). All SAEs will be recorded on both the SAE Report Form and the AE page of th e CRF and should include the following:   
  
Protocol 0167, Amendment 1  Version 1.0, 16APR2018  
Revefenacin  Page 54 of 70 
 
Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Description of event :   
• Signs and symptoms due to a common etiology should be reported as a single 
diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head 
congestion would be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”.   
• A diagnosis or description must be as specific and as complete as possible 
(e.g., “lower extremity edema” instead of “edema”).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277025] (e.g., if a subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277026], the 
adverse event term should be recorded as cholecystitis, and not as the procedure, cholecystectomy).   
• “Death” should not be used as an adverse event term unless the cause of death is 
unknown.  For events with a fatal outcome, the cause of death should be the 
adverse event term  (e.g., if a subject died of an acute myocardial infarction, the adverse event term should be recorded as “Myocardial Infarction” and the event 
outcome as fatal).     
− Relationship to study medication : The Investigator will make an assessment of 
the causal relationship of the study medication to the AE using the guidelines 
in Section  7.3.2.  
− Severity: The severity of the AE will be assessed using the guidelines in 
Section 7.3.1. 
− Outcome:  The outcome of AEs will be recorded.   
− Therapeutic measures:  Measures taken for the treatment or management of 
the AEs will be recorded.  
7.4.3. SAE Reporting  Timeline  
SAEs will be reported to Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the time the Investigator or his/he r designee becomes aware that an SAE has occurred, whether or not 
the event is considered to be related to study medication.  If the initial SAE is reported by 
[CONTACT_756], a written report signed by [CONTACT_277050] [ADDRESS_337987] be completed in accordance with the SAE Report Form 
Completion Guidelines.  If all information on the SAE Report Form is not available at the 
time of the initial report, follow -up SAE reports will be completed and submitted.   
To report an SAE, complete and email or fax the Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the 
following:

An SAE may qualify for reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is possibly attributable to the study drug and is unexpected/unlisted based on the current revefenacin  IB. In this case, 
all investigators will receive notification of the event. The inv estigator is responsible for 
notifying the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee and documenting the notification, as required by [CONTACT_277051].  
7.5. Adverse Event Follow -up 
A subject  experiencing an AE or SAE will be followed by [CONTACT_15009]/her trained 
delegate(s) through the follow-up visit or until the investigator and/or the Sponsor has determined that the AE or SAE has resolved or a stable clinical endpoint is reached,  
whichever is longer. The Sponsor may request follow-up of certain adverse events until resolution and documentation of assessments made during this period. 
The investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of an SAE. 
Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded in the concomitant 
medication section of the case report form.

8.3. Analysis Sets 
The Safety analysis set will include all randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of 
study drug summarized by [CONTACT_277052]. These subjects will be analyzed according to 
their actual treatment received, regardless of their randomized treatment. The Safety analysis 
set will be the primary analysis for safety analyses.  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized subjects.  Subjects in this 
set will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignments, regardless of treatment received.   
A per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be implemented and be considered supportive to the 
ITT analysis. The PP analysis set included all subjects in the ITT analysis set who did not violate the key inclusion/exclusion criteria through Day 42. S ubjects who received the 
incorrect treatment (compared to their randomized treatment) at any time point will be 
excluded from this subset. For subjects who received proscribed medications during the 
42-days treatment period, all data collected after the first occurrence of receiving proscribed 
medication will be excluded from the PP analys is. The key inclusion/exclusion criteria 
pertaining to the PP analysis and the list of proscribed medications will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

For all safety analyses, the safety analysis population will be used. 
Safety variables to be summarized include vital signs, adverse events, clinical laboratory 
results (hematology  and chemistry), and corrected QT interval (QTcF) from standard safety 
digital ECGs. Vital signs will be summarized in terms of observed va lues and changes from 
baseline. 
8.5.1. Extent of Exposure 
A subject’s data for the extent of exposure to study drug will be generated from the study 
drug administration page of the CRF.  Dosing information for individual subjects will be listed.  Using drug administration data, estimates of exposure to revefenacin and /or 
formoterol  will be summarized.  Dose discontinuations and reasons for study drug 
discontinuation will be listed and summarized. 
8.5.2. Adverse Event Data  
Adverse events will be coded to the preferred ter ms of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA®). Summaries will present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred 
term (PT) and severity, the frequency and percentage of subjects reporting each observed event. 
Adverse events observed during the period from obtaining informed consent to the start of administration of study drug will be regarded separately from adverse events observed after 
study drug administration (i.e., treatment- emergent adverse events [ TEAEs]). 
A TEAE will be defined as any  AE that begins on or after the date of first dose of study drug 
up to the date of last dose of study drug plus the number of days in the follow-up period.  AEs observed during the period from obtaining informed consent to the start of 
administration of study drug will be regarded separately from TEAEs. 
All AEs and all TEAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  The frequency of subjects who experience 
TEAEs will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  AE s will also be summarized by

When multiple values exist for the same nominal time point (e.g. , triplicate reading), the 
average of the readings taken for ECG parameters wi ll be used in the data analysis, including 
the outlier analysis stated below.  
There will be no imputation of missing data. Subjects without post- baseline measurement for 
a given treatment period will be excluded from the summary statistic  (e.g., denominator of 
the summary statistic)  for that time point.   
All recorded values for the ECG parameters will be presented in a by -subject listing.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before beginning study- specific research, the investigator will obtain written confirmation 
that the IRB, IEC , or Research Ethics Board (REB) is properly constituted and compliant 
with ICH and good clinical practice ( GCP) requirements, applicable laws, and local 
regulations. A copy of the confirmation from the IRB/IEC/REB will be provided to the 
Sponsor or its de signee. The protocol, informed consent form (ICF), IB, and any other 
appropriate written information provided to the subjects that the IRB/IEC/REB may require to fulfill its responsibilities will be submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB in advance of the study . 
The Sponsor or its designee must approve the ICF and all subject recruitment materials 
before they are submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB . The study will not proceed until appropriate 
documents from the IRB/IEC/REB confirming unconditional approval of the protocol and the ICF are obtained by [CONTACT_98217][INVESTIGATOR_277028]. If possible, the approval document should refer to the study by [CONTACT_277054], identify the documents reviewed, and inc lude the date of the 
review and approval. The written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB will be retained as part of 
the study file . The study may proceed before approval of consent forms and other study 
documents translated to a language other than the native la nguage of the clinical site, 
provided that written IRB/IEC/REB approval of the translated documents is obtained before they are used . Any amendments to the protocol should be reviewed promptly. 
The investigator must provide the appropriate periodic reports on the progress of the study to 
the IRB/IEC/REB and the Sponsor in accordance with local IRB/IEC/REB requirements and 
applicable governmental regulations, whichever is strictest.  
9.3. Informed Consent  
A properly written and executed ICF, in compliance with ICH E6 (GCP Guideline, 
Section 4.8), 21 CFR  §50, and other applicable local regulations, will be obtained for each 
subject before enrollment of the subject into the study. The investigator will prepare the ICF or revise the template ICF and provide the documents to the Sponsor (or designee) for 
approval before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB. The Sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB must approve the documents before they are implemented.  
The investigator will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_98183] (or the subje ct’s 
legally authorized representative) and will maintain the original in the subject’s record file.  
9.4. Data Recording and Quality Assurance  
As used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used. 
A CRF (approved by [CONTACT_1034] ) is required and should be completed (in English) for each 
randomized subject. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, 
authenticity, completeness, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms . The investigator 
must review and sign the CRFs to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are correct.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  Electronic data capture (EDC) technology will be used for this study. All clinical information 
requested in this protocol will be recorded on the electronic case report forms approved by 
[CONTACT_1034], or via other data collection methods, e.g., electronic laboratory data transfer . 
Study site personnel will enter (in English) study data into the CRFs for each randomized 
subject. Training on the EDC application will be completed and documented before access to 
the EDC system is given.  
In the event of a CRF data change ( e.g., correction of an error or addition of new 
information), corrections will be made to the CRF. Corrections to the CRFs, including the 
reason for change, will be automatically documented through the EDC system’s audit trail. 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing all CRFs, verifying them for accuracy, and 
approving them via an electronic signature. The investigator is designated as the signatory 
coordinating investigator. 
An electronic copy of the CRF casebooks will be sent to the site for retention with other 
study documents after full completion of the study, i.e., after database lock.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, authentic, complete, and up- to-date 
records for each subject. The investigator is also responsible for ensuring the availability of any original source documentation related to the study (including any films, tracings, 
computer discs, tapes, and worksheets). In most cases the source is the subject’s medical 
record. Data collected on the CRFs must match the source documents. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document . In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator’s site and clearly identify those data that will be 
recorded in the CRF and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
9.5. Document Retention  
Until otherwise notified by [CONTACT_1034] , an investigative site must retain in a controlled 
manner all study documents required by [CONTACT_98219]. The investigative site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation 
of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_98184] ( e.g., subject charts) and any original source documents that are electronic, as 
required by [CONTACT_5279]. 
The investigator must consult the Sponsor representative before disposal of any study records 
and must notify the Sponsor of any change in the location or disposition of the study files. If 
an investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_98185], custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the 
responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_98228].

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9.6. Confidentiality  
The investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that, for evaluation of study results, the subject’s confidential medical information obtained 
during the study may be shared with the study sponsor, the study sponsor’s affiliated 
companies, the study sponsor’s designated service providers, regulatory agencies, and the institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) . The investigator 
(or designee) is responsible for obtaining written permission to use confidential medical information in accordance with country- specific regulations (such  as the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act in the United  States) from each subject or, if appropriate, 
the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use confidential medical 
information is withdrawn, the investigator is  responsible for documenting that no further data 
from the subject will be collected.  
Subject medical information obtained during this study is confidential, and disclosure to unauthorized third parties is prohibited. The pertinent sections of data protect ion laws will be 
complied with in full. Study records containing subject information will only be identified by 
[CONTACT_98220], subject initials, date of birth, and study number, and not by 
[CONTACT_423]’s full name, except the subject con sent form, which is archived at the study center 
only. The subject’s name [CONTACT_277058]. 
During the course of the study, a confidential subject identification list will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_277055].  
Before and during the conduct of the study, no study- related details may be  disclosed, 
i.e., placed on the internet, published, or otherwise publicized, or provided to a third party 
without prior written permission from the Sponsor. The policy for publication of data after 
completion of the study is described in Section  9.9 (Publication). 
9.7. Access to Data and Documents  
Upon receipt of the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her 
personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare. 
Study data recorded on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data. All original 
recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records generated by [CONTACT_277056] , representatives of the Sponsor, the IRB/IEC/REB, and applicable regulatory 
authorities, and they may be used for submission to regulatory authorities . In addition, all 
source data should be attributable (signed and dated), consistent with local medical practice. The investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects 
(or their legally authorized representatives) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed 
consent.

Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.  9.8. Quality Control: Study Monitoring and Auditing  
Qualified individuals designated by [CONTACT_277057] (SOPs) for compliance with applicable 
government regulations. The investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the 
clinical data and supplies, dispensing, and storage areas and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for 
consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_98224].  
Members of the Sp onsor’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or designees may conduct an 
audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Inspections and audits are typi[INVESTIGATOR_277029], documented, and reported 
in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs and applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies, including IRB/IEC 
representatives may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the 
investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately . The investigator will ensure that the 
auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, laboratory and all data 
(including original source documentation) and all study files are available, if requested. 
Noncompliance with the protocol, ICH, GCP, or local regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_98225], institution, institution staff, or representatives of the Sponsor will lead to prompt 
action by [CONTACT_98226]. Continued noncompliance may result in 
termination of the investigator’ s involvement in the study. The IRB/IEC/REB and relevant 
regulatory authority will be informed. 
9.9. Publication  
The Sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore 
encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and presentation at seminars or 
conferences . The Sponsor will retain the ownership of the data collected in this study . The 
investigator will provide any proposed manuscript or abstract to the Sponsor before 
submission for publication or presentation of any results or data obtained in this study. 
Additional details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this study will be described in the Clinical Study 
Agreement between the Sponsor  and the investigator.

Title:  How do the neck muscles influence head acceleration during sport -
associated  impact events in high school athletes?   
Study Des cription : Sport -related concussion is a common injury associated with significant 
short - and long- term disability in high school athletes.  This project will 
study up to 72 healthy male and female soccer athletes to determine how 
neck strengthening exercise affects head acceleration during sport -
associated impacts (AIM 1) and define the mechanism relating neck strength and neck muscle volume to head acceleration under differ ent 
impact conditions (AIM 2).  The long term goal of this project is to optimize neck strengthening exercise programs to decrease the risk of concussion in 
high school athletes.  
  
Objectives:  Primary Objective  (AIM 1) :  To determine the effect of manual resistance 
neck strengthening exercise on net head acceleration during simulated 
sport -associated impacts to the head  (direct loading condition) .  
Secondary Objective (AIM 1):  To determine the effect of manual 
resistance neck strengthening exercise on net head acceleration during 
simulated sport -associated impacts to the body (indirect loading 
condition) .   
Exploratory Objective (AIM 1):  To  determine the effect of manual 
resistance neck strengthening exercise over time on neck strength, cervical 
muscle volume, neuromuscular recruitment, and net head acceleration 
under direct and indirect loading as well as during voluntary soccer 
heading.  
 Exploratory  Objective (AIM 2) :  To determine the relative influences of 
baseline neck strength and cervical muscle volume on net head 
acceleration during simulated sport -associated impacts to the head and 
body with and without volitional, anticipatory cervical muscle pre -
contraction to brace for the impact.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
Neck strengthening exercise represents a simple and practical intervention to reduce the risk of sport -
related concussion (SRC) in the millions of student -athletes who play a high school sport in the US each 
year.  Athletes whose necks are  less able t o attenuate for ces acting on their heads  during an impact  will 
experience greater head acceleration and therefore be at higher risk for sustaining SRC.  In fact, the only 
study to directly assess the neck’s influence on concussion risk was a pr ospectiv e epi[INVESTIGATOR_647941]- pound i ncrease in neck s trength there was a  5% red uction 
in the odds of sustaining SRC .12  However, neck strengthening exercise remains under -utilized in the 
high school athlete population, and there is a gap in our understanding of how the neck influences an athlete’s head acceleration under different impact conditions, as well as how these relationships may be modified by [CONTACT_14759].  There is a critical need to define these relationships and to develop optimal neck strengthening exercise protocols for high school athletes to reduce their risk of SRC.  
This work is expected to have a positive translational impact in the field because evidence- based 
prescription of neck strengthening exercise represents a significant advancement over the existing status quo, which ranges from an uninformed “shooting in the dark” approach to neck strengthening exercise prescription to no neck strengthening exercise at all.  Based on our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_647942], we estimate that neck strengthening exercise may have the potential to prevent as 
many as 47,[ADDRESS_867819] events in high school athletes?  Version 2.3

Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  5 2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
Clinical and Societal Significance  
Sport and recreation- related concussion (SRC) is a common injury estimated to affect as many as 3.8 
million Americans each year, and is now recognized as a major public health concern in the U.S.45, 50  In 
the short -term, SRC causes a constellation of physical, cognitive, affective, and sleep- related signs and 
symptoms limiting an athlete’s ability to participate in academic, vocational, and recreational pursuits for a period of days to months.  A history of SRC increases an athlete’s risk for sustaining subsequent concussions in the short term,
88 as well as for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9103],30 dementia,29 and 
neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy later in life.52  Given the myriad 
of negative short - and long- term consequences of SRC, developi[INVESTIGATOR_647943].   
 The ~7.[ADDRESS_867820] one prior concussion.82  Further, concussions represent 
approximately 13% of all athletic injuries in this population.[ADDRESS_867821] a greater physiological susceptibility to concussion than adults.
38   
 Overall Scientific Premise This proposal is built upon the overall scientific premise that concussion occurs as a result of rapid head acceleration following external force application. An early explanation of the positive association between head acceleration and the risk of brain injury was provided by [CONTACT_647973] (WSTC), which demonstrated that injury risk increased with greater magnitudes and durations of linear head acceleration.

Telemetry (HIT) System] further supporting the relationship between head acceleration and the associated risk of SRC.
5, 7, 18, 23, [ADDRESS_867823] increases with increasing linear and angular head acceleration magnitudes and durations .
66 
 Head acceleration causes concussion by [CONTACT_647974].
53  Since greater head acceleration magnitudes and durations both increase brain 
tissue deformation, this provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed relationship between head acceleration and concussion.   
 
Scientific Premise for AIM 1: AIM 1 is based on the scientific premise that attributes of an 
athlete’s cervical muscles (i.e., neck strength, cervical muscle volume and neuromuscular recruitment patterns) influence their risk of SRC for a given impact by [CONTACT_647975].  Therefore, neck strengthening exercise has the potential to mitigate head acceleration during sport -associated impacts to reduce an athlete’s SRC risk.  The strongest evidence that the neck can 
influence an athlete’s risk of SRC comes  from a large epi[INVESTIGATOR_647944] 6,704 high school 
male and female soccer, basketball, and lacrosse athletes.
12  In that study there was a 5% decrease in

Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.[ADDRESS_867824] of motion, we found greater neck strength and circumference were both significantly associated (r= .42 to r= .76) with lower head acceleration, quantified in that study as the changes in linear and angular velocity (ΔV in m/s and Δω in °/s) to account for both acceleration magnitude and duration given their mathematical equivalence to the areas under the linear and angular acceleration curves.  Other groups have used similar laboratory -based methodologies to administer 
sagittal -plane standardized test loads to subjects’ heads in pursuit of complementary study aims with 
similar results.
63, 70, [ADDRESS_867825] adopted this approach to either directly or indirectly assess relationships between various cervical attributes and head acceleration during lab -based soccer heading 
tasks, typi[INVESTIGATOR_647945]/or circumference and lower head acceleration.
3, 9, 32, [ADDRESS_867826] support for the premise that neck strengthening exercise will decrease head 
acceleration during sport -associated impacts comes from our own group’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_246363] [ADDRESS_867827] of neck 
strengthening exercise on head acceleration in response to standardized loading.47  In that study, Mansell 
et al. randomly assigned 36 male and female collegiate soccer athletes to an 8- week flexion/extension-
based isotonic neck strengthening exercise program or a control program not including cervical resistance exercises.  The neck strengthening exercise group demonstrated increases in neck strength and circumference, but without a corresponding decrease in peak angular head acceleration during standardized loading in flexion and extension.   
 
Unfortunately, there are limitations associated with both of those interventional studies.   A 
limitation of our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_647946]
[ADDRESS_867828] events in high school athletes?  Version 2.3 
Protocol HUM00152807 15 May  2023 
Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.[ADDRESS_867829] angular head 
acceleration magnitude was considered as a kinematic outcome.  Finally, neither study’s laboratory -
based standardized test loads were representative of head impact events encountered by [CONTACT_647976].  There remains a knowledge gap in how neck strengthening exer cise 
influences an athlete’s head acceleration during sport -associated impacts.    
 
AIM [ADDRESS_867830] force application to the head, force application to the body with inertial force transmission to the head via a simulated checking/blocking task, and voluntary soccer heading.  In designing AIM 1, we have addressed each of the limitations in the previous studies described above.   
 
Scientific Premise for AIM 2: AIM [ADDRESS_867831] influences head acceleration.  Furthermore, cervical muscle attributes (i.e., neck strength and cervical muscle volume) influence head acceleration 
differently with vs. without cervical muscle pre- contraction.  This premise is supported by [CONTACT_647977], again reported as ΔV and Δω, decreased by 12.3% and 9.7%, respectivel y, during anticipatory cervical muscle pre-contraction as compared to relaxed, upright sitting.
[ADDRESS_867832] also reported decreased head acceleration in response to various forms of loading during trials with vs. without anticipation and/or cervical muscle pre- contraction.
34, 41, 44, 57, 63, 70, [ADDRESS_867833] responsible for controlling head acceleration with vs. without anticipatory pre- contraction.  While not the 
primary objective, our previous work  demonstrated greater neck strength and circumference were each 
significantly associated with lower ΔV and Δω across all directions of head motion under both anticipation conditions (r= .42 to r= .60 for neck strength; r= .60 to r= .76 for neck circumference).
22  In that study, 
more of the variability in head acceleration was explained by [CONTACT_647978] 6 of the 7 models under the anticipated condition, but by [CONTACT_647979] 6 of the 7 models without anticipation.  That finding suggests neck strength and cervical muscle volume may influence head acceleration differently depending on cervical muscle pre- contraction status.  We are unaware of other reports to directly quantify 
the relationships between individual cervical muscle attributes and head acceleration with vs. without anticipatory cervical muscle pre- contraction.   
 
The premise that neck strength and cervical muscle volume may exert differential influences on 
head acceleration during anticipated vs. unanticipated impacts is further supported when considering each potential cervical contributor to head acceleration.  Previous work concluded that since the mechanical properties of the neck’s non- contractile tissues (e.g., bone, ligament) are not affected by 
[CONTACT_647980], and because peak head acceleration is reached before either a reflexive or voluntary muscular response has had time to occur, head acceleration is primarily influenced by [CONTACT_647981].
[ADDRESS_867834], the stiffness of actively contracting muscle increases 
proportionally with muscle activation and torque.2, 37, 84  Therefore for any volume of cervical muscle, 
greater neck strength (i.e., torque generation) associated with improved neuromuscular recruitment is expected to confer greater muscle stiffness during maximal anticipatory cervical muscle pre- contraction to 
brace for the impact. While muscle strength and volume co- vary, these characteristics are known to 
change independently from one another with aging,

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Potential risks associated with each component of the study include: 
 
Collection of demographic and historical information:   Loss of privacy and/or 
confidentiality is the main potential risk associated with this component of the study .  
This risk is considered non- serious.  Likelihood:  rare (< 1%) .   
 
Collection of anthropometric data:   Subjects may feel embarrassed if they consider their 
height or weight to be outside of their self -perceived desirable range.  There is also 
potential loss of privacy and/or confidentiality associated with anthropometric data collection.  These risk are collectively  considered non- serious.  Likelihood:  infrequent (1-
10%).    Cervical muscle volume (MRI) and cross sectional area (ultrasound) assessments:   
There is no radiation exposure associated with either MRI or ultrasonography and there are no known adverse long term effects associated with either imaging modality.  It is 
possible that subjects may feel uneasy while confined to the small space inside the MRI 
scanner.  It is also possible that during sonographic assessment of the neck muscles the 
carotid baroreceptors could be stimulated by [CONTACT_647982] a syncopal 
or near syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (fainting/near -fainting) .  These risks are considered non -
serious.  Likelihood:  rare (< 1%).   Not all subjects will undergo an MRI scan.  
 
Neck strength assessment:   Subjects may feel muscular discomfort associated with 
maximal isometric contraction of their cervical muscles.  This risk is considered non -
serious.  Likelihood: infrequent (1- 10%).   
 
Assessment of the head’s dynamic response to direct force application:   Subjects may 
initially be concerned about how the direct force application loads will feel.  This risk is 
considered non -serious.  Likelihood:  likely (10- 25%).  Subjects could potentially 
experience neck pain or a headache associated with this loading condition.  The most 
likely etiology fo r neck pain is anticipated to be mild cervical muscle strain and the most 
likely etiology for headache is anticipated to be cervicogenic headache.  The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_647947]- serious.  Likelihood:  rare (< 1%).  
It is not expected that any more serious neck or neurological injury (concussion, radiculopathy, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], or vascular injury) will result from this procedure.     
 
Assessment of the head’s dynamic response during the standardized checking/blocking 
and voluntary soccer heading tasks:  Subjects could again potentially experience neck 
pain or a headache associated with these loading conditions.  Again, these risks are considered non -serious .  Likelihood: rare  (< 1%).  Specific to the simulated 
checking/blocking task, subjects could also potentially experience musculoskeletal back, 
chest, or shoulder pain or “have the wind knocked out of them” due to the impacts 
delivered to their torsos by [CONTACT_647983].  The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_647948] “having the wind knocked out of them” is also considered non -serious.  
Likelihood:  rare (< 1%).  It is not expected that any more serious injuries such as fracture or joi nt dislocation will result from these  procedures.  Both  tasks were designed 
to simulate the low -end of forces experienced by [CONTACT_647984] a soccer

risky than their routine participation in sport  and no more risk than they experience in 
normal, everyday recreational activities. In addition, the controlled laboratory conditions under which the headers will be performed will allow ample time to properly align the 
head with the ball to ensure correct heading technique. The proposed soccer heading 
task, which involves less than 10 headers performed with an incoming ba ll velocity of 
less than 10 m/s, represents fewer headers at a lower velocity, and with a less -inflated 
ball than would be expected to occur during a high school soccer practice or a physical 
education class activity focusing on heading skills. Furthermore, this protocol represents 
an overall smaller combination of repetitions and bal l velocities than has been used in 
existing research studies involving standardized soccer headers. Similar studies in the 
past have included as many as 20 headers and ball velocities up to 25 m/s. The soccer 
heading and checking/blocking tasks were developed with input from our expert soccer advisor, [CONTACT_648013], the former University of Michigan Women's Varsity  Soccer 
coach, who  has extensive soccer coaching experience at the high school level  is also of 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_647949] , and will be no greater risk than youth members of the general population are 
exposed to during normal recreational activities . 
 Kinematic measurements:  Light emitting diodes used with a high speed  kinematic 
camera system may become hot to the touch when left to record continuously.  Subjects could experience a minor superficial skin burn if a light emitting diode became too hot 
and was left in place, although this would be unlikely as the diodes ar e not affixed 
directly to the skin, but rather to a plastic plate surface affixed to the skin.  The risk 
associated with this is considered non- serious.  Likelihood:  rare (< 1%).   
 
Skin preparation/application of skin adhesives:   Subjects may experience minor skin cuts 
or irritation associated with skin shaving or the adhesive backing on the surface EMG 
electrodes or other superficially adherent sensors.  The risk associated with this is considered non -serious.  Likelihood:  infrequent (1- 10%).  
 Fitting of boil -and-bite mouth guards :  Subjects could receive minor burn to their hands 
or mouths while using boiling water to fit mouth guards to their mouth if direct contact 
[CONTACT_647985].  The risk of burn is considered non- serious.  Likelihood:  
rare (< 1%).

final in -person eligibility determination in the PI’s absence.  Potential subjects with any historical 
or physical examination findings felt by [CONTACT_978], or his designee, to place them at potentially elevated risk for injury will be excluded.   
 Subject privacy will be protected during laboratory assessments by [CONTACT_647986] a private environment closed to the outside in the presence of study personnel only.  To ensure the 
confidentiality of data and personal information, all electronic data will be coded.  Only the PI

password- protected secure computer maintained by [CONTACT_17901].   
 Prior to each laboratory testing and exercise session, subjects will complete a brief warm- up 
routine including static and dynamic neck stretches.  All exercise sessions will be administered by a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) so the risk of sustaining any 
exercise- related injury is felt to be lower than that typi[INVESTIGATOR_647952].   
 
Additionally, the following test -specific safety measures will be employed to minimize risk to 
subjects during laboratory testing:  
  
Neck MRI and cervical muscle cross sectional area measurements with ultrasound:  
Subjects will undergo ultrasound testing while seated in a chair with bilateral armrests.  
The tester will be seated immediately adjacent to the subject during the assessment.  In the unlikely event of a syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the subject will be prevented from falling to 
minimize potential risk of i njury.      
 
Assessment of the head’s dynamic response to direct force application:  During our 
experience using this technique, concerned subjects have been uniformly relieved after 
experiencing the first load applied to their head.  The testing apparatus is designed to limit forced displacement of the head and the dr op height of the weight is set so  that no 
more energy is delivered to the subject’s head than is necessary to generate a reliable, measurable  dynamic response.  In our experience using the direct force application 
model, measured head accelerations are  approximately 10- fold less than the minimum 
values typi[INVESTIGATOR_647953] .    
 
Assessment of the head’s dynamic response during the simulated checking/blocking and voluntary soccer heading tasks:   Subjects will wear a mouth guard during these tasks  for 
dental protection .  Both tasks were designed to simulate the low -end of forces 
experienced by [CONTACT_647984] a soccer header or being checked/blocked during live soccer play and are therefore felt to be no more risk  than their routine

Protocol HUM00152807 15 May  2023 
Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  11 participation in everyday recreational activities .  In addition, the controlled laboratory 
conditions under which the tasks  will be performed will allow ample time to properly align 
the head /body  with the ball /punching bag to ensure correct heading /blocking technique.  
The proposed soccer heading task represents fewer headers  of lower magnitude than 
would be expected to occur during a high school soccer practice or a physical education 
class activity focusing on heading skills.  Furthermore, this protocol utilizes an overall 
smaller combination of repetitions and ball velocities than has been used in previous 
research studies involving standardized soccer headers.3, 14, 15, 23, 30, 31, 47, 55, 62  We are not 
aware of any existing research using a similar checking/blocking task that can be compared to our proposed protocol, but the subjective experience of the volunteers who 
were involved during protocol development was that no discomfort occurred.  During the 
simulated checking/blocking task, the distance the boxer’s punching bag swings before 
contact[CONTACT_13742]’s body is set  sufficiently low so as not to displace the subject’s 
feet upon contact [CONTACT_647987] a reliable, measurable dynamic head response.  The soccer heading and 
checking/blocking tasks were both developed with safety  input from a collegiate soccer 
coach with extensive experience working with high school soccer athletes.  
 Kinematic measurements:   Kinematic recording will be paused between trials to 
minimize the chances of light emitting diode heating.  
 
Fitting procedures for boil -and-bite mouth guards:   While fitting the boil -and-bite mouth 
guards, after removing the unit from the  boiling water  subjects will fully submerge  it in 
cold water before placing it in their mouths.  
 
The risk level for all study activities is no more than minimal because subjects will not be 
performing any activities riskier than those they routinely experience in their day -to-day lives.  
All eligible subjects are high school athletes who are expected to routinely experience minor, 
and in some cases major, trauma to the head, neck, and body during sport participation, such 
as regular voluntary heading of a soccer ball.  Routine sport  participation is felt to be associated 
with a much greater potential for injury than the controlled experimental procedures associated with this study.  In addition, participation in a resistance training exercise program under the 
direct supervision of a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist is felt to be safer than 
participation in an unsupervised or indirectly supervised resistance training program, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_647954].  As such, we feel the potential benefits to subjects, as well as 
the potential future benefits of this work to athletes like those participating in this study, 
outweigh the minimal risks to subjects.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
In this single -site randomized clinical trial, 72 high school soccer athletes will complete a series of 4 
laboratory assessment sessions before, during, and after a 12 -week resistance training program 
including either high intensity neck strengthening exercises or control exercises not targeting the neck .  
During each laboratory assessment, measurements will be performed to assess key cervical muscle attributes, as well as the head’s net acceleration under multiple loading conditions designed to reflect the range of impact scenarios encountered by [CONTACT_647991] s during sport participation.  The primary loading 
conditions will be direct force application to the head using the customized loading apparatus designed by [CONTACT_647992]
19, 22 and a standardized checking/blocking task involving impacts 
to the body with inertial force transmission to the head.  In addition, a voluntary soccer heading task will be used as an exploratory loading condition.   
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
 The control exercise group will perform only “shoulders -down” resistance exercises not directly 
targeting the neck so that the effects of the high intensity neck exercise program can be distinguished from changes associated with normal age -related growth and development or generalized effects of 
resistance training not specifically targeting the neck.

For both dumbbell shrugs and manual resistance exercises, the total cumulative exercise volume load will be defined as the sum of the individual session volume loads over all exercise sessions completed by [CONTACT_423].  Since subjects assigned to the control group will not perform neck strengthening exercise, their exercise volume load will remain zero throughout the study.

determined during the initial phone screening assessment or initial in -person screening evaluation . A 
minimal set of screen failure information will be retained  to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants , to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, and eligibility criteria.  Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a time 
sensitive  factor  (e.g., diagnosed concussion within the past 6 months)  may be rescreened. Rescreened 
participants will  be assigned the same participant numbe r as for the initial screening.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
High school -aged soccer athletes will be recruited primarily through the athletics programs at local high 
schools, following local approval at each individual institution.  Coaches, managers, athletic trainers, or other team/athletic s personnel will be asked to  post and/or  distribute paper and/or electronic 
recruitment materials  to those athletes who are members of the school’s soccer teams.   In addition, we 
will also recruit through other non- school -based local soccer clubs, camps, and programs in a similar 
manner, including recruitment through local soccer and /or fitness facilities.  Lastly, we will advertise  on 
the Michigan Institute of Clinical Health Research (MICHR) UM Health Research website (https://umhealthresearch.org), in UMHS clinics, and through public advertisements  and outreach  as 
necessary.  UM Health Research is a secure registry database that matches people to clinical research 
studies, and is supported by [CONTACT_50223].   
 Interested individuals (and/or their parents/guardians if minors) will complete an initial self- reported 
screening evaluation  (either electronically with phone review or during a  single phone session, per 
individual preference and availability)  with a member of the study  to assess study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and to describe the details of the study.  Those who pass the initial screening 
assessment and are interested in participating after hearing full study details will be scheduled for a final in-person eligibility assessment by [CONTACT_978], or his designee, which will include a targeted screening 
physical examination.   
 
Potential  subjects  passing both components of the screening assessment  will then  be invited to enroll in 
the study and those wishing to do so will  complete the informed consent process (assent for minors 
with accompanying parent/guardian consent).   All subjects will provide written informed consent using 
UM IRB -MED approved informed consent documents  with a qualified member of the study team .  Minor 
children under the age of 18 will provide written assent and a parent/guardian will provide written 
consent.  During the in -person consent process the consenting study team member  will review the 
entire informed consent document with the subject (and parent/guardian when applicable), including all potential risks associated with the study and will provide an opportunity to ask any questions they may have.  
   
To promote study recruitment and retention, subjects will be compensated for their participation in this study.  Compensation will be incrementally disbursed upon successful completion of each of the four laboratory testing sessions, with greater amounts p rovided for each successive testing session to 
incentivize full study completion.   Subjects will also receive a [ADDRESS_867847] events in high school athletes?  Version 2.3

 Subjects will be randomized using a centralized electronic randomization tool with equal allocation  to 
the control  and high -intensity neck strengthening groups .  Balanced block randomization will be used  to 
ensure equal sex and age category balance between the groups.  Age category will correspond to high school under -class (i.e., age 13.0 - 16.49 years at the time of randomization) vs. upper- class (i.e., age 
16.50 – 19.99 years) status given the typi[INVESTIGATOR_647958]. Subjects will be considered enrolled in the trial upon randomization and available data will be included in the intention to treat analysis.  The Study Statistician, Strength Coach, Study Coordinator, 
and PI (or his Co -I designee when necessary to make a determination of AE relatedness to the study) will 
not be blinded to subject group allocation.   Other members of the study team, including tho se 
responsible f or performing the laboratory - and radiology -based assessment will be blinded to  group

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Methodology for measuring kinematic outcome: Net head acceleration  will be measured under direct 
force application, as well as standardized checking/blocking and voluntary soccer heading tasks at 4 time 
points  (see Section 1.3).  Our rationale for including loading conditions involving direct force application 
to the head as well as force application to the body with resultant transmission of inertial forces to the head (the simulated checking/ blocking task) is that concussions  can, by [CONTACT_108], occur as a result of 
both of these mechanisms.
[ADDRESS_867853] loading condition.  The order of testing will be randomized across subjects  and practice trials 
will be performed for each task prior to data collection to familiarize subjects with each procedure .  
 
Loading conditions:  
Standardized direct force application to the head in forced flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and 
axial rotation.     We will use a customized laboratory testing apparatus to deliver controlled forces to 
the head via headgear connected to cable with in -line weight -drop, similar to as previously  described 
by [CONTACT_27156] .19, 22  The results of three trials will be averaged, in each direction during active 
isometric neck muscle pre- contraction (as if bracing in anticipation of being struck in the head during 
live play) as well as during relaxed upright sitting (to simulate an unanticipated blind -side impact)

hanging at rest.  The punching bag will be drawn back in a standardized manner and released to elicit 
lateral flex ion of the head and neck in the coronal plane upon impact to the shoulder (monitoring to 
ensure they are not displaced from the force plate).  The results of three trials will be averaged during active pre -contraction of the neck and torso muscles (as if bracing in anticipation of being 
checked or blocked by [CONTACT_647996]) as well as a relaxed upright standing (to simulate an unanticipated blind -side collision) conditions.  An effort will again be made to prevent subjects’ 
knowledge of the precise timing of force application during the unanticipated condition using strategies such as wearing blinders and being exposed to ambient white noise. sEMG will again be used to ensure appropriate neck muscle activation under both conditions, as above.  
 Standardized voluntary soccer headers  will also be performed in the sagittal plane.  One heading task 
will involve an active heading strategy with the goal of returning a soccer ball directly back in the direction from which it was pi[INVESTIGATOR_647960], as if performing an attacking/offensive soccer header.  A second heading task will be similar, except with a goal of gently directing the soccer ball to the ground in the direction from which it was pi[INVESTIGATOR_647961] a glancing he ader to pass the ball to the foot of a teammate.  For both tasks, a standard soccer ball 
inflated at the low end of the recommended inflation range) will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_647962] a soccer machine using similar methodology as has been applied in previ ous soccer heading studies.
33, 
35, 60, 74  The results of three trials will be averaged under both heading strategies.  
 Net head acceleration measurement: For each loading condition, net head acceleration will be measured using a kinematic camera system 
in a similar manner as previously described by [CONTACT_27156].
19, 22  Subjects will wear optoelectronic 
markers (infrared emitting diodes) to allow tracking of head position in space and relative to the torso.  Signal processing will be performed in a similar manner as previously described by [CONTACT_647997].
19, 22  For the checking/blocking and soccer heading tasks, subjects will 
wear a thin force sensor on their shoulder (for checking/blocking) or forehead (for soccer heading) to identify the time of impact between their shoulder/forehead and the  punching bag/soccer ball, 
respectively.   In the unlikely event that head kinematics patterns are not sufficiently stereotyped 
under a given loading condition for between -subject comparisons of AUC for the net head 
acceleration vector, which does not directly account for directionality, then we wo uld decompose 
the net acceleration vector into its individual linear and angular components.  Participants will also wear a second inertial measurement unit (body -worn sensor) on their heads to provide redundant 
head acceleration data as a back -up in the unlikely event that the kinematic camera data cannot be 
adequately resolved.  Additionally, if the force sensing resistor used to identify the onset of head acceleration during the checking/blocking and soccer headi ng tasks unexpectedly fails for a given 
trial, we would alternatively use a similar technique to the one we have previously employed to identify the onset of head acceleration from the kinematic dataset via a trailing window.
20, 46   
 Methodology for measuring cervical muscle attributes: Given that muscular adaptation to resistance exercise results in strength gains attributable to both improved neuromuscular recruitment and muscle hypertrophy, we will assess neck strength as well as cervical muscle volume and neuromuscular activation.

Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  21 Neck strength will be measured both in terms of the peak force/ moment  and rate of force/ torque 
development  in cervical flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral flexion using a customized 
laboratory testing apparatus similar to that previously described by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vasavada.80  Measured force 
values will be converted to moments, in N·m , by [CONTACT_647998]’s estimated 
moment arm.   
 
Cervical muscle volume  
The total cervical muscle volume  will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  without 
contrast  in a similar manner as  previously described by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vasavada.89 The volume of individual 
cervical muscles will be calculated by [CONTACT_647999] (CSA’s) across slices multiplied by [CONTACT_648000]- to-center spacing and total cervical muscle volume will be calculated as the 
sum of volumes of the indiv idual muscles.    
 Estimated cervical muscle volume  will also be calculated at each assessment using a predictive 
regression equation developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vasavada’s lab, which has been shown to accurately account for 87% of the variance in MRI -based total cervical muscle volume based on overall neck

assessment time point, with validation  of the expanded model using our MRI -based cervical muscle 
volume measurements.  We will assess the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius (TRAP), splenius capi[INVESTIGATOR_17727] (SPL), and semispi[INVESTIGATOR_647963] (SEMI) muscles, which we have previously studied with acceptable test- retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients, ICC= .91 to ICC= .99) and validity

Potential participants meeting any exclusion criteria (See Section 5.2), either during the  initial phone 
screen  or the final in -person screen ing assessment which includes a brief screening physical 
examination, may potentially be at slightly increased risk for injury as a result of study participation and so out of caution will be excluded from study participation.  
 Potential participants with disqualifying findings on the screening physical examination  (and their 
parent/guardian if they are a minor)  will be notified verbally at the time of the sc reening examination, 
and will subsequently be notified in writing, of the specific disqualifying physical exam finding.  They w ill 
be advised to follow up with their primary care physician.  
 Participants will be asked at the beginning of each study -associated exercise and testing session whether 
they have experienced any AE’s as described below in Section 8.3.4 .  Participants will also be observed  
by [CONTACT_648003]’s .   
 Any moderate or severe AE’s will be reported to the PI, or his designee, for determination of the need 
for medical follow up.  If immediate emergent medical care is deemed necessary 9 -1-1 will be called.  If 
urgent, non -immediate, medical care is deemed necessary the participant will be referred to a local 
Emergency Department or Urgent Care Center via their own private transporta tion.  If non -urgent 
medical care is deemed necessary, the participant will be referred to their own physician’s office.   If no 
medical care is deemed necessary, the participant will be advised to monitor their condition and contact [CONTACT_648004].  
 
All study MRI’s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_648005], as well as to 
screen for incidental findings of clinical significance.  If incidental clinically significant findings are identified, the Study Radiologist will note them in the research M RI report and will alert  the PI (or his 
designee if he is unavailable)  to their presence.  The PI (or his designee) will subsequently contact [CONTACT_1560] (and their parent/guardian if they are a minor)  by [CONTACT_648006].  In addition, a written notification of the incidental finding, including a copy of the research MRI report, will be sent to the subject, as well as to their primary care physician, or an alternative physician providing them medical care if this is their preference.   
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).   
 Note:  delayed onset muscle soreness is a normal, anticipated occurrence following resistance exercise training and is therefore not considered an AE for the purposes of this study.  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
How do the neck muscles influence head acceleration during sport -associated  impact events in high school athletes?  Version 2.3 
Protocol HUM00152807 15 May  2023 
Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  23 An adverse event (AE ) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of the 
investigator or his designee , it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 For adverse events (AEs ) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_978], or his 
designee,  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories below. The study -assigned exercise program will always be 
considered suspect.  
 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be  ruled out. The clinical event  occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_648007] /event  (e.gs., drug, chemical, toxin, pathogen, activity, environmental factor, traumatic 
event). The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible. If medically appropriate, a rechallenge procedure may be employed, with a positive 
response to rechallenge considered as confirmation of definite relatedness . 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other or other 
exposure/event, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition , other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it

Protocol HUM00152807 15 May  2023 
Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  24 can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event  whose temporal relationship to study intervention 
administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study intervention ) and in which other disease or 
exposure/event provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 The PI, or his designee,  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE ) is expected or 
unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described in Section 2.3.1 , or if it is not known to be 
associated with any non -disqualifying underlying disease, disorder, or condition affecting  the 
participant. 
8.3.3  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits  or if communicated to the study team between visits .  The study 
team will not prompt participants for any specific solicited AE’s, but will ask about unsolicited AE’s at each study visit using the following general question: “Have you noticed any new
 illness, injury, or other 
health -related concerns since your last study visit?”  
 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention  (assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_647965] a diagnosis), and date  of resolution/stabilization of the 
event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All 
AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The study coordinator or project manager will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any 
time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last 
day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire abo ut the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information unt il resolution or 
stabilization.

Note that if a series of related, expected AE’s of moderate severity appear to be occurring at a frequency greater than previously known or expected, the study team will report this to IRBMED and 
the DSMB within 14 calendar days of identifying t he trend . 
 
Unrelated, non -serious AE’s (expected or unexpected) will not be reported to IRB MED or the DSMB 
unless there appears to be a trend of events occurring at a frequency greater than previously known or 
expected, in which case the study team will also report this trend to IRB -MED as well as the DSMB within 
14 calendar days of identifying the trend.  
 
8.3.5  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Related, unexpected  SAE’s resulting in death or any life -threatening outcome will be reported to 
IRBMED and the DSMB within 7 calendar days of becoming aware of the event.  Other related, 
unexpected SAE’s will be reported to IRB -MED and the DSMB within 14 days of becoming aware of the 
event.  
 Unrelated, unexpected SAE’s will be reported per standard IRBMED guidelines and in conjunction with regularly scheduled DSMB meetings.  
 Note, there are no related, expected SAE’s associated with this study.  
 
8.3.6  REPORTING EVENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
If the study team becomes aware of new knowledge regarding related, unexpected AE’s/SAE’s that may 
affect other current or future study participants, the study team will seek input from the DSMB as to whether/how to communicate this information to other current participants and/or whether/how to amend the IRB -MED approved informed consent documents for future participants.   Re-consenting will 
be performed for subjects actively involved in the study if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978], IRMBED, or DSMB.

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
 
The study team  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to IRBMED . The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are  actual  AEs or SAE s will be reported to IRB -MED as described above in Section 8.3.5 -
8.3.6.  
• Any other U Ps representing newly identified possibility of previously unsuspected harm  will be 
reported to IRB -MED  within 14 days of the study team  becoming aware of the problem.  
• If IRB -MED concurs that a  UP exists, the UP will be  reported to appropriate institutional and 
external  officials as required under IRB -MED’s  reporting policies and procedu res.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint :  
 
There will be evidence of a dose-response effect for neck strengthening exercise on net head acceleration under direct load application proportional to the volume load of exercise .   
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint : 
 There will be evidence of a dose-response effect for neck strengthening exercise on net head acceleration under indirect load application proportional to the volume load of exercise.    
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 Our power calculation is based on AIM 1.  Assuming net head acceleration (on the logarithmic scale) 
will follow linear trends over time, then our power calculation is based on comparison of the slope of this change, which has 9/14 of the variance, i.e., 36% less variance, than the underlying log(net head 
acceleration) measurements.  As a result, the standardized effect size (Cohen’s d value) of the slope is 
approximately 1.25 times greater than that of the underlying log(net head acceleration) measurements.  Based on  our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299],
[ADDRESS_867864] sizes to be 
between .6 and 1.0 for log(net head acceleration), depending on the variability of the individual measurements across the 4 directions of motion.  These values correspond with a 20% overall reduction in u n-transformed net head acceleration.  A total of 30 subjects in each exercise group 
(control and high intensity), will provide power of between .83 [for standardized effect size for log  (net 
head acceleration) of .6 and 1.0 [for standardized effect size for log(net head acceleration) of 1.0] depending on the actual observed standardized effect size in the population.  To account for the possibility of a drop -out rate of up to 20%, we will plan to enroll up to a total of 72 subjects.   
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 All participants will be included in the analysis, including participants contributing only a partial data set.  The only exception would be in cases where the PI, study statistician, and Exercise 
Physiology/ Engineering/Radiology study CoI-lead (for  volume -load vs.  lab-based vs. imaging-based data) 
agree there is legitimate threat to  the valid ity of data collected in any individual participant due to 
technical error not identified at the time of assessment that cannot be resolved through post- processing 
(e.g., incorrect gain settings leading to signal saturation or failure of MRI field of view not cov ering the 
full extent of cervical musculature to be measured).

9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
Prior to the analysis, all data will be examined and transformed as necessary to achieve approximate 
normality.  Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the distribution, central tendency (mean, median), and variability (standard deviation, range, interquartile range) of each continuous variable.  All subjects will be included in the analysis and an alpha of .[ADDRESS_867866] a constant change .  For example, a 20% reduction in net head 
acceleration corresponds to a difference of log(.8) on the log- scale, regardless of the initial value of net 
head acceleration. W e will use linear mixed models to describe the longitudinal changes in log(net head  
acceleration) over the volume loads of exercise performed at each of the four study time points, and to test the significance of this change across the three exercise groups.   
 
9.4.3  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
AEs and SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_926], relatedness, and expectedness using counts, with each AE counting only one time for a given participant, and will be presented in a table format.    
 
9.4.4  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 
Intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics (including demographics, cervical muscle attributes, and net head accelerations under each loading condition) to assess for the presence of any baseline differences between the groups before participation in the study -assigned exercise 
intervention.  Categorical and continuous variables will be assessed using chi- square tables and ANOVA, 
respectively.

Protocol HUM00152807 15 May  2023 
Eckner 1 R01 HD093733 Clinical Trial Protocol – v2.3 15 May 2023  29 In the event that an immediate DSMB review is required in response to  any AE(s), SAE(s), or UP(s) (see 
Sections 8.3.5 -8.3.6 and 8.4.2), new study enrollment will temporarily be suspended until the DSMB has 
met and assessed the need for ongoing modification to study enrollment and/or study intervention 
activities.  Ongoing study activities will co ntinue without interruption unless an unexpected, study -
related SAE occurs, in which case ongoing study activities associated with the portion of the study protocol  deemed to have caused the SAE will be temporarily suspended  pending DSMB review and 
recommendations.   
 
9.4.6  SUB -GROUP ANALYSES  
 
We will include sex as a covariate in the statistical models, as well as explore possible interactions between sex and other independent variables, to identify any sex -based differences in the relationship 
between exercise volume load and the net head acceleration outcome.  
 
9.4.7  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA 
 
N/A 
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_867868] linear models with net head acceleration as the outcome and combinations of neck strength and/or cervical muscle volume as the predictor(s) for direct and indirect force application under both the anticipated and unanticipated conditions.  Rather than comparing the B coefficients of the neck strength and cervical muscle volume terms, which are scale-dependent, we will instead quantify the impact of each cervical covariate on net head acceleration by [CONTACT_648008] R
[ADDRESS_867869] 95% confidence intervals around the differential R2 
values of both cervical variables during the anticipated and unanticipated conditions. If the confidence intervals are non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], we will conclude that the cervical variable associated with a greater 
decline in R
2 value upon its removal from the full model is significantly more impactful on the net head 
acceleration for the given anticipation condition.   
 We will compare the magnitudes of the Β coefficients associated with each cervical independent variable at each time point in the linear mixed model analyses predicting log(net head acceleration).  The effect of neck strengthening exercise on the exploratory
 net head acceleration during soccer 
heading outcomes will be analyzed  using a similar statistical analysis plan as described above in Section

10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS 
 
IRB-MED -approved informed consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study 
procedures, and risks will be  given to each  participant and written documentation of informed consent  
(or assent with parent/guardian consent)  will be obtained  prior to starting intervention/administering 
study intervention.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
A waiver of informed consent for screening purposes will be obtained from IRB- MED to allow potential 
participants to be screened for study eligibility prior to undergoing the informed consent process in an 
effort to save ineligible individuals from the inc onvenience of unnecessary study -related procedures if 
they are not eligible to participate in the study.  Those individuals who are eligible and interested in 
participating in the study will complete the informed consent (or assent with parent/guardian con sent 
for minors) process in person with the PI, or a designated member of the study team.  
 Informed consent  (or assent with parent/guardian consent for minors)  is a process that is initiated prior 
to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.
 Consent /Assent  forms will be  UM Institutional Review Board ( IRBMED )-approved and the 
participant  (and parent/guardian for minors)  will be asked to read and review the document. A member 
of the study team  will explain the research study to the participant  (and parent/guardian for minors ) 
and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s  (and parent’s/guardian’s for minors)  comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and 
potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants  (and 
parent/guardian for minors)  will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and

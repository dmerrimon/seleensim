RESEARCH AIMS & ABSTRACTS  
 
Research Question(s)/Hypothesis(es):  This study aims to determine the efficacy of 
neuraxial (either epi[INVESTIGATOR_384212]) preservative -free morphine to prevent headache after 
accidental dural puncture in parturients . 
Our hypothesis is that 2 doses of neuraxial morphine (epi[INVESTIGATOR_384212]) will be 
superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of postdural puncture headache.  
 
Scientific Abstract:  Neuraxial analgesia (most commonly continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_384213]) is the most effective modality available for pain relief during labor. 
Accidental dural puncture (ADP) with a large bore epi[INVESTIGATOR_384214] -dural 
punctu re headache (PDPH) is one of the most significant sources of anesthesia -related morbidity 
in parturients. The incidence of ADP in this population is between 0.04 and 6% (most common 
cited is ~ 1%), and PDPH occurs in up to 80% of patients with an ADP. For many patients, the 
headache is debilitating, interfering with the ability to care for a new infant, and may be 
associated with other unpleasant symptoms, including diplopia, tinnitus, hypoacusis, 
photophobia, nausea, and dizziness. In the most severe cases , subdural hematoma can occur. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384215], and although almost always 
effective, can result in another ADP, as well as low back pain and lower extremity pain. For this 
reason, effective measures to preve nt PDPH when ADP occurs would be highly valuable. One 
small study by [INVESTIGATOR_21026] -metwalli, et al. in which [ADDRESS_480824] of epi[INVESTIGATOR_384216]. This study aims to determine the efficacy of 2 doses of 
neuraxial (either epi[INVESTIGATOR_384212] ) preservative -free morphine (PFM) to prevent headache 
after ADP in parturients.  
 
Lay Abstract:  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384217] (pain relief) is the most 
effective modality available for the treatment of pain during labor. The most frequent, 
bothersome complication of performing these procedures is accidental dural puncture (ADP) 
with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_270388], commonly called a “wet tap.” The dura mater is the membrane that 
surrounds the fluid that cushions and bathes the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. If the dura mater is 
punctured by [CONTACT_45092][INVESTIGATOR_270388], some of the fluid may  leak out through the puncture. When 
ADP occurs, the anesthesiologist, at his/her discretion, may either withdraw the needle and place 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_384218], or the 
anesthesiologist may decide to plac e the epi[INVESTIGATOR_384219] (known as an intrathecal catheter). Following ADP/wet tap, up to 80% of 
patients get a headache, known as a post -dural puncture headache (PDPH). The headache usually 
begins 2 4 – 72 hours after ADP/wet tap occurs. For many patients, the headache is very painful 
and interferes with care of their newborn. The headache may also be associated with other 
unpleasant symptoms, including blurry vision, ringing in the ears, muffled hear ing, sensitivity to 
light, nausea, and dizziness. In the most severe and rare cases, bleeding in the brain can occur. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384215], and although almost always 
effective, can result in another ADP, as well as low back pain and lower extremity pain. For this 
reason, effective measures to prevent PDPH when ADP occurs would be very useful. One recent 
study in which [ADDRESS_480825], will prevent headache in women who experienced 
ADP in during labor.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
Study Purpose and Rationale : Neuraxial (epi[INVESTIGATOR_20845]) 
analgesia is the most effective modality available for pain relief during labor. For obstetric 
patients who choose to undergo neuraxial analgesia, accidental dural puncture (ADP) with a 
large bore epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] n eedle and the resulting post -dural puncture headache (PDPH) is the most 
significant source of morbidity. The incidence of ADP in this population is between 0.04 and 
6%, with most estimates between 1 -2% (1), and PDPH occurs in up to 80% of patients with an 
ADP (2). For many patients, the headache is debilitating, interfering with their ability to care for 
a new infant, and it may also be associated with other unpleasant symptoms, including diplopia, 
tinnitus, hypoacusis, photophobia, nausea, and dizziness. I n the most severe cases, subdural 
hematoma can occur.  When ADP occurs during the provision of neuraxial labor analgesia, 
management includes placement of an intrathecal catheter or placement of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_384220]. The data that exists is conflicting regarding what 
techniques or factors may reduce the risk for PDPH. A meta -analysis, which reviewed data from 
nine studies, found that insertion of an intrathecal catheter produced a significant reduction in the 
need for epi[INVESTIGATOR_122501] (EBP), although the incidence of PDPH was not significantly 
different (3). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384221] (EBP) is the gold standard for treatment of PDPH, and 
although almost always effective, it is not without the potential for complications. EBP can result 
in another accidental dural puncture, as well as low back pain and lower extremity pain. For th is 
reason, effective measures to prevent PDPH when ADP occurs would be useful. At the present 
time, the efficacy of measures such as continuous intrathecal analgesia, intrathecal saline 
injection, and prophylactic EBP, to prevent PDPH remain unclear . 
One small study by [INVESTIGATOR_21026] -metwalli, et al. (4) in which [ADDRESS_480826] -operative analgesia after cesarean delivery, and in patients who experience 
ADP, cesarean delivery is associated with a lower incidence of PDPH than vaginal delivery (5). 
This study aims to determine the efficacy of neuraxial (either epi[INVESTIGATOR_384222] l) 
preservative -free morphine (PFM) to prevent headache after ADP in parturients.  
 
Study Design:  This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial. 
Subjects will be postpartum ASA I and II women aged [ADDRESS_480827] 
eithe r an intrathecal catheter or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. Patients will be randomized to either receive 
PFM or placebo (sterile normal saline).  For patients with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], the group “EPID 
PFM” will receive 3 mg (6 mL) of PFM, followed by 3 mL of sterile normal saline (NS) to be 
administered through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. The placebo group, “EPID NS”, will receive 6 mL of 
NS, followed by [CONTACT_20904] 3 mL of NS via the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. For patients with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13829], the group “EPID PFM” will receive 3 mg (6 mL) of PFM, followed by 3 mL of sterile 
normal saline (NS) to be administered through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. The placebo group, “EPID 
NS”, will receive 6 mL of NS, followed by [CONTACT_20904] 3 mL of NS via the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. For 
patients with an intrathecal catheter, the group, “IT PFM” will receive 200 micrograms (mcg) 
(0.4 mL) of preservative -free morphine, followed by a flush of the catheter with [ADDRESS_480828], the patient will then receive the identical study 
drug (for a total of two doses). T he epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]/intrathecal catheter will be removed immediately 
after the second administration of the study drug.  After discharge, the patient will be followed up 
once daily by [CONTACT_384228] a minimum of [ADDRESS_480829] dose of the study 
drug if they remain headache free, and for a minimum of 3 days after resolution of PDPH.  
 
Statistical Procedures:  This will be a prospective randomized double blind clinical trial. 
The primary outcome of the trial will be the incidence of PDPH at 48 hours after ADP. A study 
by [INVESTIGATOR_21026] -Metwalli et al. 2008 (4), utilizing 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_75427], reported a PDPH 
headach e rate of 12 % in the treatment arm and 48% in the saline arm. Estimates of PDPH rate 
after ADP range from 50 - 85%. Our internal QA data indicates our PDPH headache rate after an 
ADP with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_384223] ~66%. We will con sider a difference 
in incidence of PDPH between the placebo and treatment groups of 25% to be significant, based 
on the findings of Al Metwalli et al. (4) and the meta -analysis by [CONTACT_384229]. (3). For 
calculation of our sample size, we determined that an  absolute 25% decrease in PDPH would be 
clinically significant (i.e., 66% - 40%). For a power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05%, this requires 
83 subjects per group (2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_384224], 2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_384225]). We are not s pecifically powering this for comparison of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_384226], although we will likely be able to do so. We therefore aim to recruit 100 subjects per 
group (for a total of 400 across all centers) assuming 10 - 15% of subjects may be lost bec ause of 
inadvertent withdrawal of the catheter, subject withdrawal or loss to follow up after discharge. 
This is intended to be a multicenter study involving 5 or more academic tertiary -care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 
having >2,000 vaginal deliveries per year. Since the r ate of accidental dural puncture is between 
1 and 2%, we estimate we should be able to recruit 100 patients per year. Categorical data 
(presence of absence of PDPH, need for EBP) will be analyzed using Chi -square analysis. The 
two main campuses of NYP will be included (CUMC (including Allen) and Weill -Cornell); 
additional centers will be enrolled.

Title A randomized sham -controlled double -masked Phase 2a study 
of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the intravitreal plasma 
kallikrein inhibitor,  KVD001, in subjects with center -involving 
diabetic macular edema  (ciDME) who have had prior 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF ) treatment  
Sponsor Study No.  KVD001 -201 
Phase  2a 
Sponsor  KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd . 
Study Center(s)  Ophthalmology  clinics in the [LOCATION_002]  (US) with experience 
in the conduct of diabetic macular edema (DME) clinical studies  
Objective(s)  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of monthly dosing of 
intravitreal (IVT) injection of KVD001 in subjects with 
ciDME who have had prior anti-VEGF treatment  
Secondary Objective:  
 To evaluate the local and systemic safety and 
tolerability of monthly dosing of KVD001 Injection  in 
subjects with ciDME who have had prior anti -VEGF 
treatment  
Design  This is a phase 2a, randomized, double -masked ,  
sham -controlled, [ADDRESS_1137064] 
will be up to 28 weeks  (including up to 4 weeks  for screening, 
12 weeks  treatment period, and 12 weeks  follow -up). 
The study will be conducted on an out -patient basis.  
The study schedule of even ts will be  as follows:  
Screening Phase:  The screening period will be up to 4 weeks. 
All subjects will sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any 
study related procedures being performed. Subjects will be 
[ADDRESS_1137065] a 
diagnosis of ciDME with prior anti -VEGF treatment . 
Treatment Phase:  On the day of first study drug administration 
(Day 1 ), the subject’s eligibility will be reconfirmed and baseline 
assessments will be performed. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to receive KVD001 Injection  (6 μg or 3 μg 
KVD001 ) or a sham procedure during a 12-week , double -mask ed 
treatment period ( a total of 4 doses given at approximately 
monthly  intervals) .  
Subjects will visit the study clinic on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 
12 during the Treatment Phase for study drug administration or 
sham procedure, safety, and ophthalmic assessments (see 
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  5 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  Table  2). The subject will remain in the clinic after study drug 
administration or sham procedure until all post -dose procedures 
and observations have b een completed and the Investigator 
confirms that the subject may be discharged . Investigators 
should schedule visits at Week 4, 8, and 12 to provide 28 days 
between visits. The visit window for these visits is -3 days to +7 
days.  
Approximately twenty -four (24) hour s after each study drug 
administration or sham procedure  on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 
12, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_820421]  (AEs)  and changes in concomitant 
medications . In the event of any reported ocular or systemic AEs 
that are considered by [CONTACT_63033] a possible cause for 
concern , the subject s will return to the clinic for assessment  as 
soon as possible . 
Follow up Phase:  All subjects will visit the clinic at Weeks  16, 
20, and [ADDRESS_1137066] study drug administration or sham 
procedure for safety  and ophthalmic assessments (see Table  2). 
The visit window for Weeks 16, 20, and 24 is ±7  days.  
Early Discontinuation:  If any subject discontinues the trial early, 
every effort should be made to complete the Week  24/early 
discontinu ation (ED) evaluations as soon as possible  and, 
whenever possible , prior to starting an y new medication or 
treatment. All attempts will be made to not discontinue the 
subject unless necessary.  
Rescue Treatment:  Rescue intervention (e.g., anti -VEGF, 
focal/grid macular laser photocoagulation, (IVT)  steroids  ) may 
be administered due to worsening DME (i.e., attributable to 
worsening DME and not another cause ;) if either of the following 
occurs and, where possible, after consultation with the Medic al 
Monitor:   
 During Treatment Phase  
o Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) deteriorates 
3 lines (15 letters)  or more from baseline  
o Central Subfield Thickness  (CST)  worsening of 
>100  µm from baseline  
 During Follow up Phase  (i.e., after week 16)  
o BCVA deteriorates 3  lines (15 letters)  or more

General Statistical 
Methods  and 
Types of Analyses  Analysis Populations : 
 Full Analysis Set (FAS ) – All randomized subjects 
following the principle of intention -to-treat (ITT). 
Subjects will be included in the analysis according to 
the treatment to which they were randomized . 
 Per Protocol Set (PPS) – All randomized subjects who 
are compliant with the study protocol, i.e., who do not 
experience any major protocol deviations .  Subjects 
will be included in the analysis according to the 
treatment received . 
 Safety Set (SAF) – All randomized subjects who 
receive at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects 
will be included in the analysis according to the 
treatment received .  
Sample Size : 
The proposed sample size ( 41 per treatment group)  will provide 
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  10 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  approximately 80% power to detect a difference in change from 
baseline of [ADDRESS_1137074] deviation 
(SD) of 7.5 letters .  
Multiplicity Considerations : 
No multiplicity adjustments are planned in this exploratory Phase 
2a study.  
Primary Efficacy Analyses : 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in 
BCVA letter count in the study eye at Week 16.  Change from 
baseline in BCVA letter count will be calculated as Week 16 
BCVA letter count minus  Day 1  BCVA letter count such that a 
negative difference in dicates a worsening in vision. In addition, 
treatment comparisons between  each dose of the KVD001  
Injection  and the sham procedure will be calculated as KVD001  
Injection  minus sham,  such that a positive result indicates more 
letters gained  in the KVD001 Injection treatment group.  
The study eye ETDRS letter scores including changes from 
baseline will be summarized using cont inuous descriptive 
statistics. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be 
used to compare the change from Day [ADDRESS_1137075] -
squares means (LSMeans) for each treatment group, th e 
LSMeans difference between each  dose of the KVD001 Injection 
group and the sham procedure group, the corresponding 
confidence intervals (CIs) and the p -value s will be presented. 
The primary analysis  
in the FAS population at the Week 16 visit, as described in 
Section 8.2. 
As a sensitivity analysis, treatment group differences for changes 
from baseline in BCVA letter count will be evaluated using a 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) ANCOVA fitted w ith 
treatment group, visit and  the treatment by [CONTACT_820428] s with contrasts included for each visit. 
LSMeans  and 95% confidence intervals for each treatment 
group, the LSM eans  difference between each  dose of the 
KVD001 Injection and the sham , the corresponding confidence 
intervals, and the p -value s will be presented for each visit.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses : 
Change from baseline in BCVA letter count in the study eye at 
Week [ADDRESS_1137076] at Week 16 and Week 24 will be 
analyzed , separately,  using the same method described for the 
primary efficacy analysis.

Final  11 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  The proportion of study eyes with improvement of 2 or more 
steps from baseline on the ETDRS DRSS score between the 
sham procedure group and each of the KVD001 Injection group s 
will be summ arized by [CONTACT_820429], 
including 95% asymptotic normal CIs for each treatment group. 
The difference in proportions between each of the KVD001 
Injection group s and the sham procedure group will be a nalyzed 
at Week 16 and Week 24 using a Pearson’s chi -squared test. 
The 95% asymptotic normal CIs for the difference s in propor tions 
will also be calculated. Fisher’s exact tests and exact CIs will be 
employed in cases of expected counts <5.  
The proportion of study eyes  with ≥5, ≥10 and ≥15 BCVA letter 
change  from baseline  (gain and loss) at Weeks 16 and 24 will be 
analyzed using the same method described for the proportion of 
study eyes with improvement of 2 or more steps from baseline on 
the ETDRS DRSS score.  
Safety Variables : 
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies 
and percent ages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs and TEAEs causing premature 
discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is 
treatment emergent if it o ccurs or worsens after the first dose of 
randomized study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be 
given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT); by [CONTACT_2946], PT and maximal severity; by [CONTACT_2946], 
PT and strongest relationship; by [CONTACT_820430]; and by 
[CONTACT_2946], PT and day of onset. Separate analyses will be performed 
for ocular specific and all AEs (including systemic).  
Other safety endpoints including manifest refraction/BCVA , slit 
lamp biomicroscopy, dilated ophthalmoscopy , IOP, SD-OCT, 
ETDRS DRSS, physical  exam  findings, laboratory test results, 
and vital signs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_561339]. Changes or shifts from baseline will 
also be summarized where appropriate. For assessmen ts 
performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow eye will be summarized 
separately .

Final  19 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  1 INTRODUCTION  AND BACKGROUND  
Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus  (GS, N et 
al. 2017 ). It leads to vision loss, if untreated , and becomes increasingly prevalent with 
progressing diabetes . In 2015, over [ADDRESS_1137086] 10 million by [CONTACT_820431] ; 1.5M were estimated to have 
vision -threatening diabetic retinopathy and  908,[ADDRESS_1137087]  DME  (Lee, 
Wong et al. 2015 ). DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss among working 
age adults in most developed countries  (Diabetes, Complications Trial/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_820410]. 2009 ).  
The clinical  signs of diabetic retinopathy begin with retinal hemorrhages and 
micro -aneurysms, usually associated with areas of retinal pericyte loss  and loss of the 
endothelial cell barrier function  (GS, N et al. 2017 ). The resulting leakage can lead to 
macular edema , consisting of an accumulation  of fluid and lipoprotein s in the retina . 
Visual acuity decline s dramatically  when the central macula is affected .  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_820411] (anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
have made a significant difference in the treatment of DME  (Campochiaro, Aiello et al. 
2016 ). The treatments currently in use , aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab , were  
shown  in clinical trials to be more effective than laser  therapy after one year. While laser  
therapy  is expected to improve vision by 3 or more lines in one in 10 people with DME, 
about three in 10 people are expected to gain vision with anti-VEGF treatment: risk ratio 
(RR) versus laser 3.66 (95% CI: 2.79 to 4.79) for aflibercept;  2.47 (95% CI 1 .81 to 3. 37) 
for bevacizumab;  2.76 (95% CI 2.12 to 3.59) for ranibizumab  (Virgili, Parravano et al. 
2017 ). However, a significant proportion (up to 50%) of patients with DME does  not 
achieve vision gain under anti -VEGF therapy  (Nguyen, Brown et al. 2012 ).  
Resear chers associat ed with Kalvista have  shown that retinal vascular permeability can 
also be induced by [CONTACT_820432] , which would be a complementary 
pathobiologic explanation for the macular edema observed in patients with DME  (Gao, 
Clermont et al. 2007 ). Observations on human vitreous samples confirmed activation of 
carbonic anhydrase I, possibly through hemolysis, to be a physiologic trigger of the 
plasma kallikrein (PKal) – kinin system cascade. Release of the vasoactive peptide 
bradykinin upon cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen by [CONTACT_820433]. Animal 
experiments confirmed that it is possible to abrogate the vascular permeability induced 
by [CONTACT_820434]  (Gao, Clermont et al. 2007 ).  
Further experiments in diabetic rats confirmed the presence of bradykinin mediated 
edema in the eye subsequent to induced diabetes  (Clermont, Chil cote et al. 2011 ). 
Inhibition of plasma kallikrein activation either via a small -molecule plasma kallikrein 
inhibitor or physiologic C1 -esterase inhibitor significantly reduced edema generation and 
confirmed PKal  inhibition as a potential treatment target for DME.   
Plasma kallikrein and its cleavage products were also highly elevated in samples of 
vitreous from human subjects with diab etes (Kita, Clermont et al. 2015 ). Moreover, 
many human samples with clear signs of PKal  activation were low in VEGF stimulation, 
and vice versa, confirming PKal  inhibition as a therapeutically independent target in 
patients with DME.

Final  20 of 65 Version date 09APR2018   
  
The proposed study is a phase 2a, randomized, double -mask ed, sham -controlled , 3-arm 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of KVD001 Injection as 
monotherapy in adult subjects with center -involving DME  (ciDME ) who have had prior 
anti-VEGF treatment.  
 Rationale  for the Study  
Strong pathobiologic data support activation of the PKal – kinin cascade as a VEGF -
independent explanation for DME . This mechanism is amenable to intervention with  
PKal , both intravitreally and systemically in animal models, and intravitreally in humans. 
Relevant investigations were performed with KVD001.HCl in animals and humans to 
justify proceed ing with a phase 2a dose -finding study . The aim of this study is  to confir m 
the therapeutic rationale through  multiple injections and over a longer time horizon.  
 Benefit  Risk  Assessment  
Patients with DME who have been treated with anti-VEGF therapy and continue to 
experience impaired vision can potentially benefit from a therapy  that targets a different 
pathobiologic mechanism.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137088] had prior anti –VEGF treatment . 
 Secondary Objective(s)  
To evaluate the local and systemic safety and tolerability of monthly dosing of KVD001 
Injection  in subjects with ciDME who have had prior anti –VEGF treatment . 
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137089] will be up to 28  weeks 
(including up to 4 weeks for screening, 12  weeks treatment period, and 12  weeks  
follow -up). 
The study will be conducted on an out -patient basis.  
The study schedule of events will be as follows:  
Screening Phase:  The screening period will be up to 4  weeks  prior to study Day 1 . All 
subjects will sign an Informed Conse nt Form (ICF) prior to any study related procedures 
being performed. Subjects will be [ADDRESS_1137090] a diagnosis of ciDME with prior anti -VEGF treatment.  
Treatment Phase:  On the day of first study drug administration (Day 1), the subject’s 
eligibility will be reconfirmed and baseline assessments will be performed. Eligible 
subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive KVD001 Injection (6 μg or 3 μg KVD001) or 
a sham procedure during a 12 -week, double -masked treatment period (a total of 
4 doses given at approximately monthly intervals ).  
Subjects will visit the study clinic on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 during the Treatment 
Phase for study drug administration or sham procedure, safety, and ophthalmic 
assessments (see Table  2). The subject will remain in the clinic after study drug 
administration or sham procedure until all post -dose procedures and observations have 
been completed and the Investigator confirms that the subject may be disc harged. 
Investigators should schedule visits at Week 4, 8, and 12 to provide 28 days between 
visits. The visit window for these visits is -3 days to +7 days.  
Approximately twenty -four (24) hours after each study drug administration or sham 
procedure on Day  1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 12, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_820435]. In the event of any 
reported ocular or systemic AEs that are considered by [CONTACT_63033] a possible 
cause for c oncern, the subjects will return to the clinic for assessment as soon as 
possible.  
Follow up Phase:  All subjects will visit the clinic at Weeks 16, 20, and [ADDRESS_1137091] 
study drug administration or sham procedure for safety and ophthalmic assessments 
(see Table  2). The visit window for Weeks 16, 20, and 24 is ±7 days.  
Early Discontinuation:  If any subject discontinues the trial early, every effort should be 
made to complete the Week  24/early discontinuation (ED) evaluations as soon as 
possible and , whenever possible, prior to starting any new medication or treatment. All 
attempts will be made to not discontinue the subject unless necessary.  
Rescue Treatment:  Rescue intervention (e.g., anti -VEGF, focal/grid macular laser 
photocoagulation, IVT steroi ds) may be administered due to worsening DME (i.e., 
attributable to worsening DME and not another cause) if either of the following occurs 
and, where possible, after consultation with the Medical Monitor:  
 During Treatment Phase

 Justification of the Study Design  
This phase 2a study is the first clinical investigation of  the potential efficacy of KVD001  
Injection  in the treatment of DME. The randomized, double -mask ed design has been 
chosen to allow an unbiased  and controlled  assessment of the safety and efficacy of the 
drug. The control group will receive a sham injection  procedure  rather than placebo to 
avoid unnecessary breaching of the integrity of the eye  and risk of endophthalmitis, 
retinal detachment, cataract, etc . 
The study population is representative of the  likely  target population for the product. The 
sample size of 123 subjects is appropriate for this stage of development.  
The dosing schedule for KVD001 Injection (4 doses at approximately monthly intervals  
intervals ) is supported by [CONTACT_820438]-in-man study to be well tolerated and to result  in potentially beneficial 
pharmacodynamics effects.  
The endpoints are commonly -measured in DME and are clinically relevant.

Final  28 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  4.3.1  Withdrawal from Participation  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdraw n from the study will complete the ED visit as 
soon as possible.  The reason for discontinuation  / withdrawal will be documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) and the Medical M onitor must be informed 
immediately. If the reason for withdrawal is the occurrence of an AE, the subject  will be 
followed up until the AE has resolved or is considere d chronic and stable or the AE has 
been clearly shown to be unrelated to the investigational product . 
Subjects  will also be withdrawn if the entire study is terminated prematurely as 
described in Section 9.10. 
Subjects who are randomized and subsequently withdraw from study participation  will 
not be replaced.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_1137101] to F ollow –up 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made at least 
once every month to contact [CONTACT_820439], including mandatory 
telephone contac t and written letter. All efforts should be documented in the subject’s 
medical source record.  A subject is considered lost to fol low–up if subject cannot b e 
reached after 3  months from the scheduled visit. However, if the subjec t re–initiates 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_35604] [ADDRESS_1137102] immediately n otify the medical monitor . 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time and for any reason . In the 
event, the Investigators will be informed of the reason for study termination  by [CONTACT_820440] . 
 Planned Sample Size  
Ophthalmology clinics in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  will randomize  approximately [ADDRESS_1137103] s who are screen 
failures and are not randomized  will retain their screening ID number.  
4.5.2  Randomization Scheme  
Subjects  will be randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to KVD001 Injection 60 µg/mL or 30 µg/mL 
(6 μg/eye or 3 μg/eye in a 100 μL  dose volume ) or a sham procedure . Randomization 
will be centralized with  stratification by [CONTACT_820441] 1 . 
4.5.3  Allocation/Randomization of Subjects  to Treatment  
Subjects must not be randomized unless all eligibility criteria have been met.  
Subjects who satisfy all the entry criteria will be centrally assigned to study medication 
by [CONTACT_15017] (IRT) , according to the randomiza tion scheme 
generated by [CONTACT_261245]. Each randomized subject will receive a unique randomization 
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  29 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  number. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 60 µg/mL or 30 µg/mL KVD001 
Injection  or sham procedure .  
The actual treatment given to subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_820442]. The randomization scheme will be produced by a computer software program  
that incorporates a standard procedure for generating randomization numbers.  One 
randomization list will be produced containing sufficient random numbers for both 
randomization strata.  
The dose and regimen of randomized therapy to be administered is as follows:  
 KVD001 6 μg by [CONTACT_576499] ; 
 KVD001 3 μg by [CONTACT_576499] ; 
 Sham proce dure. 
Subjects will be identified using subject initials, randomization number , and date of birth. 
Subjects will be randomized sequentially  within their stratification category , as subjects 
are eligible for randomization. The IRT will inform the Investigator of the kit identification 
(ID) number to be allocated to the subject at each dispensing visit.  
First dose of study drug administration or sham procedure will be administered  on 
Day 1, after completion of all pre–dose assessment s.  
Randomized subjects who are discontinued from further study drug administration or are 
terminate d from the  study for any reason, regardless of whether study drug was taken or 
not, will not have their screening/randomization code be reused.

 Identity  
For clinical trial use, KVD001.HCl has been formulated as KVD001 Injection.  
 
 
 
 
Further information about KVD001 Injection can be found in the current IB (Gardner and 
Antonetti 2007 ). 
 Administration  
KVD001 Injection  or sham procedure will be administered to the study eye on Day 1  and 
Weeks  4, 8, and 12 during the Treatment Phase . At each scheduled visit, the date and 
time of study medication administration will be recorded in the eCRF.  
The injecting physician cannot be the Investigator as they should remain masked 
throughout the study. In order to avoid breaking the mask, real and s ham injections will 
be performed by [CONTACT_820443] (note that post -injection IOP evaluations must be performed by [CONTACT_820444]) . For sham injections, t he subjects  will be prepared exactly as for a 
real injection (i.e., including but not limited to: insertion of lid speculum, application of 
povidone -iodine and subconjunctival injection of an anesthetic) following which an empty 
syringe with no needle will be pressed against the eye  to mimic the pressure of an 
injection.  
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions on administration.  
 Packaging, Labe lling and Storage  
The st udy packaging and labe lling of drug p roduct will be performed by [CONTACT_261245]. The 
storage and distribution supply of drug product will be performed by [CONTACT_261245]. All packaging 
and labelling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practice for 
Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements.  
 
 
 
 All boxes will remain closed 
except while being accessed by [CONTACT_820445].  
The I nvestigator will ensure that the drug p roduct is stored in appropriate conditions  
 
 
 Upon compl etion of dosing, the used drug product may be 
destroyed with routine medical waste at the clinical site.  The I nvestigator ( or designee) 
will dispense the drug p roduct only to the identified subjects of this study following the 
procedures described in this study protocol and documented in the subject  dispensing 
log. 
Drug Product inventory/dispensing will be documented in the source documentation and

KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137104] will 
be returned to the location designated by [CONTACT_820446] . 
 Masking  and Breaking the Masking  
The stud y will be performed in a double –mask ed manner. The study is masked by [CONTACT_820447] . The sham procedure will be identical to injecting study 
drug, except as described previously , thereby [CONTACT_211412] -mask ed conditions . 
The study mask  should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where knowledge 
of the study drug received would affect the treatment of the emergency) or regulatory 
requirement (e.g., for SAEs or death). The subject’s safety takes priority over any other 
considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be un masked . 
Before breaking the mask  of an individual subject’s treatment, the Investigator should 
determine that the un masked  information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the subject’s 
immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency i s clearly not 
related to the study drug, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_820448]. The decision to un mask  treatment assignment 
should be discussed with the Sponsor  and Medical Monitor . The Investigator sh ould only 
call in for emergency un masking  AFTER the decision to discontinue the subject has 
been made.  
If the mask  is broken, the date, time , and reason must be recorded in the subject ’s 
eCRF system  and any associated AE report.  
Once approval for unmasking is obtained, the Investigator can unmask study drug 
assigned to a subject through the IRT system .  
If an Investigator , site personnel performing assessments, or subject  is un masked , the 
subject  must be listed as major protocol deviation.  
Serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), which are subject to 
expedited reporting, should be un masked before submission to the Regulatory 
Authorities . 
The overall randomization code will be broken only for reporting purposes. Thi s will 
occur once all final clinical data have been entered onto the database and all data 
queries have been resolved, and the assignment of subject  to the analysis sets has 
been completed.  
 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining accurate study drug accountability 
records throughout the study.  
Each dispensing of study drug will be documented in the eCRF . 
The Investigator  is responsible for returning all unused study drug to Ora at the 
completion of t he study . Ora will ensure no remaining supplies are in the Investigator’s 
possession  and agree with the Sponsor the fate of returned study drug . 
 Compliance  
Study dr ug shall be administered by [CONTACT_820449] ; the 
procedure must be recorded in the eCRF.

The concomitant use of the following medications will not be allowed in the study:  
 Anti–VEGF administered systemically ; 
 Any treatment in the study eye or given intravitreally in the study  eye for DME 
other than the study medication. Note, the fellow (non -study) eye may be treated 
for DME at the Investigator’s discretion ; 
 Steroid administered systemically , intravitreally in the study eye , or topi[INVESTIGATOR_820414]; 
 NSAIDs administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_820415] ; 
 Any Jetrea® (ocriplasmin) intravitreal injection in the study eye.  
 Any ophthalmic medication that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_820416] /or efficacy parameters in this study . 
Details of all medications  (other than those intended to treat the study subjects’ DME) , 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_786582] 3 month s prior to Screening Visit until 
the end of the study will be recorded in the eCRF. See section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details 
regarding requirements for data collection relative to DME history and previous 
treatments and medications.  With the exception of ocular medications intended to treat 
DME, p rior medications are defined as those medications taken within 3 month s prior to 
Screening Visit; concomitant medications are defined as those medications on going at 
or started after Day 1 . 
 
See section 5.8 regarding the collection of rescue treatment medications as concomitant 
medication.  
 Rescue Treatment  
Rescue intervention (e.g., anti -VEGF, focal/grid macular laser photocoagulation, IVT 
stero ids) may be administered due to worsening DME (i.e., attributable to worsening 
DME and not another cause) if either of the following occurs and, where possible, after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor:   
 During Treatment Phase  
o Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) deteriorates 3  lines (15 letters)  or 
more from baseline  
o Central Subfield Thickness  (CST)  worsening of >100  µm from baseline  
 During Follow up Phase  (i.e., after Week 16 ) 
o BCVA deteriorates 3  lines (15 letters)  or more from highest BCVA during 
treatment phase or baseline  
o CST worsening of >[ADDRESS_1137105] during treatment phase or 
baseline.  
 
Subjects who receive a rescue intervention in the study eye will be discontinued from 
further study participation. The Week 24/ED evaluations should be  collected prior to  
study discontinuation and prior to administration of the rescue  medication . Details 
regarding the medications used as rescue treatment must be entered as concomitant 
medications for the respective study subject.  
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137106] in this study  are: 
 BCVA  in letters  as measured by [CONTACT_63365] ; 
 CST in µm as measured by [CONTACT_820424];  
 Retinopathy severity as measured by [CONTACT_820450] . 
 Safety Variable s 
Safety variables of interest in this study are:  
 AEs; 
 Ophthalmic and physical findings ; 
 Laboratory test results (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) ; 
 Vital signs (SBP, DBP, PR, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1137107] (IP) in humans, whether or not considered IP -related. An AE can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or d isease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the 
investigational product (e.g. off -label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from  any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic proced ures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered an 
AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying patho logy should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end 
date, severity, relationship to investigational product, action(s) taken, seriousness, and 
outcome of any sign or symptom ob served by [CONTACT_820451].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_102]/sub ject.  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to investigational product or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
 Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  34 of 65 Version date 09APR2018   Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration  of therapy, 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:  
 Suspected : A reasonable p ossibility exists that the investigational product caused 
the AE. 
 Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational 
product caused the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the investigational product caused the AE.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the 
AE.  Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the 
investig ational product and the AE include:  a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with investigational product exposure 
(e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); one or more 
occurrences of an even t that is not commonly associated with investigational product 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the investigational 
product (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a 
clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under 
investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent 
of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the investigational 
product -treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety 
information about the investigational product using these explanations:  
 Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB )(IB 2017 ) or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Expected :  an AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
 Not applicable:  an AE unrelate d to the investigational product.  
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological/ mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the p articular product under investigation are to 
be considered unexpected.  
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is con sidered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  35 of 65 Version date 09APR2018   Death;  
 A life -threatening AE; 
o Note:  An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused deat h. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
o Note:  The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfe r within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same -
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nu rsing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
o Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_820417].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
o Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threa tening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to Ora, the study sponsor, and the IRB/IEC 
as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities and recorded on the appropria te CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora  within [ADDRESS_1137108] an evaluation of the reported event.  The 
results of the evaluati on will be reported to the IRB within 10 days of Ora and/or the 
Sponsor becoming aware of the event. Events must be reported to the study sponsor 
and the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorit ies.

KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  36 of 65 Version date 09APR2018  [IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the investigational 
product, must be immediately reported.  All information relevant to the SAE must be 
recorded on the appropriate case report forms.  The investigator is obligated to pursue 
and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_241531]/or the sponsor in addition to that 
information reported on the case report form.  All subjects experiencing a SAE must be 
followed up and the outcome reported.  
In the even t of a SAE, the investigator must notify Ora and the sponsor within 24 hours ; 
obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject;  provide Ora and the study sponsor with a complete case history, which includes 
a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use 
of the investigational product; and inform the IRB of the SAE within their guidelines for 
reporting SAEs . 
Contact [CONTACT_3031]  (SAEs ): 
 
 
 
  
  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
All AEs irrespective of the suspected causality will be monitored until the AE has 
resolved or until the end of the study (Week 24), unless the subject is lost to follow –up 
or withdraws consent or the subject died prior to the end of t he study. All SAEs, 
irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the SAE has resolved or 
until the subject is lost to follow -up or the subject has died.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of pregnancies where there 
has been maternal exposure to the study drug.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_820418] a c ontraceptive medication.  
Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs, unless they 
were therapeutic abortions  (see below) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14494] a healthy 
newborn should not be considered a SAE.  
All pregnancies mus t be reported by [CONTACT_820452]/Sponsor on the initial 
pregnancy report form within [ADDRESS_1137109] be reported by [CONTACT_820453] 30 days of becoming aware  of the normal delivery or elective

KalVista Pharma ceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137123] atistical considerations summarized in this section outline the plan for data 
analysis of this study.  
Before un masking , a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized, providing 
detailed methods for the analyses outlined below.  
Any deviatio ns from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final 
integrated study report.  
Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_820457] a 1:1 :1 ratio to 1 of the 3 treatment groups:  
KVD001 Injection  (6 µg/eye or 3 µg/eye ) or sham.  Allocation to the treatments will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_178814] (≤55 letters vs >55 letters) and CST at Screening (≤450 µm 
vs >450 µm) as determined by [CONTACT_5243].  
 Study Subjects  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1137124]-randomization will also be summarized.  
8.1.2  Protocol Deviations  
Deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion c riteria will be 
assessed as “minor” or “major” in cooperation with the Sponsor. Major deviations from 
the protocol that have the potential to impact the efficacy results will lead to the 
exclusion of a subject  from the Per Protocol  Set (PPS) . Deviations wi ll be defined prior to 
unmasking . 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1137125] been defined for this study:  
Full Analysis Set  (FAS) : All randomized subject s following the principle of 
intention -to-treat (ITT). Subject s will be included in the 
analysis according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized.  
Per-Per Protocol Set  (PPS) : All randomized subject s who are compliant with the 
study protocol, i.e., who do not experience any major 
protocol deviations.   Subjects will be included in the 
analysis a ccording to the treatment received . 
Safety Set (SAF):  All randomized subject s who received at least one 
dose of study treatment. Subject s will be included in 
the analysis according to the treatment received.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS and a secondary analysis will 
also be performed based upon the PPS, to assess the sensitivity of the analysis to the 
choice of analysis set. All safety analyses will be based upon the SAF. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be evaluated for the FA S and for the PP S. 
If one or more subject( s) received incorrect trial drug, these data will also be presented 
for the SAF.

 General Considerations  
All statistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed at the 5% level of significance, 
unless otherwise stated.  
Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] 
(number, arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). 
Categorical data will b e summarized by [CONTACT_310184] 
(frequencies and percent ages). 
All analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.4 or higher  or using other validated 
software.  
Analysis and data conventions:  
Definition of baseline  
The baseline assessment will be the latest, valid pre -dose assessment available.  
Visit windows  
Assessments taken outside of protocol allowable windows will be displayed according to 
the case report form (C RF) assessment recorded by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  
Unscheduled assessm ents 
Extra assessments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with non -protocol clinical 
visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be included in 
listings, but not summaries. If more than one laboratory value is available for a given 
visit, the first valid observation will be used in summaries and all observations will be 
presented in listings. It is noted that invalid laboratory data may not be used (from 
hemolyzed samples, mishandled samples, quantity not sufficient, or o ther conditions that 
would render values invalid).  
Unit of Analysis  
Ophthalmic safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes.  Non -ophthalmic safety 
endpoints will be analyzed with subject as the unit of analysis.  For efficacy endpoints, 
the unit of an alysis will be the study eye.   
Missing data conventions  
In general, data will not b e imputed for safety analysis. The primary and secondary 
efficacy data analys es will be performed on the FAS  
  An analysis using observed data 
only will also be performed in both the FAS and PPS.  Additionally,  
 
the FAS for the analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables . No exploratory 
efficacy endpoints or safety endpoints will be imputed. Additional details will be provided 
in the S AP. 
Multiplicity Considerations  
No multiplicity adjustments are planned in this exploratory Phase 2a study.  
Other considerations  
Since central randomization will be used, no testing for treatment by [CONTACT_820458]. No multiplicity adjustments are planned.  
Any outliers that are detected during the mask ed review of the data will be investigated. 
If necessary, queries will be issued to the Investigator , to either correct  or confirm the 
outlier.

 Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics , and Concomitant 
Medications  
Demographic data, medical history, concomitant disease s, and concomitant medication s 
will be summarized via descriptive statistics, as appropriate, (overall and stratified by 
[CONTACT_2948] ). 
Medical history, c oncomitant medications and AEs will be coded to MedDRA and WHO 
Drug dictionaries, as appropriate, for the purpose of summarization.  
 Treatment Compliance  
IVT injection compliance for the study eye will be assessed by [CONTACT_820459], tw o, three or four IVT injections . 
 Efficacy Analy ses 
All efficacy variables will be displayed in subject listings.  
8.5.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in BCVA letter count in the study 
eye at Week 16 . Change from baseline in BCVA letter count will be calculated as Week 
16 BCVA letter count minus Day 1 BCVA letter count such that a negative difference 
indicates a worsening in vision. In addition, treatment comparisons between each dose 
of the KVD001 Inj ection and the sham will be calculated as KVD001 Injection minus 
sham, such that a positive result indicates more letters gained in the KVD001 Injection 
treatment group.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis to be Tested  
The null hypothesis is that the effects change s from baseline in BCVA letter count  at 
Week 16 for each dose of the KVD001 Injection and the sham procedure on BCVA are 
identical:  
H0: µk - µs = µk-µs=0, 
where µk is the effect change from baseline in BCVA letter count at Week [ADDRESS_1137126] of  change from baseline in BCVA letter count at Week 
16 for the sham procedure on BCVA:  
Ha: µk - µs > 0. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Methods  
The study eye ETDRS letter scores including changes from baseline will be summarized 
using continuous descriptive statistics.  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will  
be used to compare the change from baseline in BCVA letter count at Week [ADDRESS_1137127] -
squares means (LSMeans) for each treatment group, the LSMeans difference between 
each dose of the  KVD001 Injection group and the sham grou p, the corresponding CIs 
and the p -value s will be presented.

Final  50 of 65  Version date 09APR2018  As a sensitivity analysis, treatment group differences for changes from baseline in BCVA 
letter count will be evaluated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
ANCOVA fitted with treatment g roup, visit and  the treatment by [CONTACT_820460] s with contrasts included for each visit.  LSMeans  and 95% confidence intervals 
for each treatment group, the LSM eans  difference between each dose of the KVD001 
Injection and sham , the corresponding confidence intervals, and the p -value s will be 
presented for each visit.  
8.5.2  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
 Change from baseline in CST as measured by [CONTACT_820424] (SD-OCT)  
 Proportion of eyes with a ≥ 2 step improvement from baseline in DRSS score   
 Change from baseline in BCVA letter count as measured by [CONTACT_63365]  
 Proportion of study eyes with ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 BCVA letter change from baseline 
(gain and loss) . 
Change from baseline in BCVA letter count in the study eye at Week [ADDRESS_1137128] will be in favor of KVD001 if the 
treatment difference is <0.  
The proportion of study eyes with improvement of 2 or more steps on the ETDRS DRSS 
score between the sham procedure group and each of the KVD001  injection  group s will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_820429], including 95% asymptotic 
normal CIs for each treatment group.  The difference in proportions between each of the 
KVD001 group s and the sham procedure group will be anal yzed at Week 16 and 
Week  24 using a Pearson’s chi -squared test.  95% asymptotic normal CIs for the 
difference s in proportions will also be calculated.  Fisher’s exact tests and exact CIs will 
be employed in cases of expected counts <5.

8.6.1  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs 
causing premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is 
treatment emergent  if it 1) occurs after the first dose of randomized study treatment or 2) 
if it is present prior to receipt of randomized study treatment but worsens in severity or 
increases in frequency after the first dose of randomized study treatment. Furthermore, 
frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_72065]; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity; by [CONTACT_820461], Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137130] relationship; by [CONTACT_72065] f or SAEs; and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and day of onset. Separate 
analyses will be performed for ocular specific and all AEs (including systemic).  AEs will 
be classified by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and preferred term in  the MedDRA coding 
dictionary. AEs will be tabulated both as the total events (regardless of relationship to 
treatmen t) and as drug -related events. The number of subjects with one or more events 
versus no events will be calculated for each treatment.  
Subject listings of all AEs will be provided as well as l istings of deaths , SAEs , and AEs 
leading to discontinuation.  
The following summaries will be provided:  
 Relationship between AE SOC and verbatim text ;

 Data Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor  or Sponsor’s designee  will conduct a site visit to verify the qualifications of 
each Investigator , inspect the site facilities, and inform the Investigator  of responsibilities 
and the procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation.  Site qualification 
visits may be waived, per the CRO’s SOPs, if the site has participated in a study with the  
CRO within the past 12months . 
The Investigator  is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for 
each subject . All information recorded on the eCRF  system  for this study must be 
consistent with the subject s’ source documentation ( i.e., medical records).  
9.1.1  Database Management and Quality Control  
All data generated by [CONTACT_820467] r using eCRF s. Data from  external sources (such as laboratory data) will be 
imported into the database. Once the eCRF  clinical data have been submitted to the 
central serve r at the independent data center , corrections to the data fields will be 
captured in an audit trail. The rea son for change, the name [CONTACT_820471], together with the time and date will be logged to provide an audit trail.  
If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data man ager will raise a 
query in the EDC application. The appropriate staff at the study site will answer queries 
sent to the Investigator. The name [CONTACT_820472]. On ce all source data 
verification is complete and all queries are closed, the monitor will freeze the eCRF  
page.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the EDC 
system/ eCRF  will be provided to study sites in a training ma nual. In addition, site 
personnel will receive training on the EDC system/ eCRF . 
 Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered in the  eCRF . All source documents 
from which eCRF  entries are derived should be  placed in the subject ’s medical records. 
Measurements for which source documents are usually available include laboratory 
assessments, and study specific exam inations .  
The original eCRF  entries  for each subject  may be checked against source documents 
at the study site by [CONTACT_820468].  
Instances  of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the Investigator  for 
resolution.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the eCRF  
will be provided to study sites in a training manual. In addition, site personnel will receive

designed for the collection of the clinical data in electronic format. Access and right to 
KalVista Pharma ceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Final  55 of 65  Version date 09APR2018  the EDC system will be carefully controlled and configured according to each individual’s 
role throughout t he study. In general, only the I nvestigator and authorized staff will be 
able to enter data and make corrections in the eCRF s. 
The eCRF  should be completed for each  subject  included in the study and should reflect 
the latest observations on the subject s participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRF s 
are to be completed as soon as possible during or immediately after the subject ’s visit or 
assessment. The Investigat or must verify that all data entries in the eCRF  are accurate 
and correct. If some assessments cannot be done, or if certain information is 
unavailable, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the 
eCRF .  
Computeri zed data –check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data 
discrepancies for resolution. Corresponding queries will be loaded into the system and 
the site will be informed about new issues to be resolved on -line. All discrepancies will 
be solved on –line directly by [CONTACT_820469]. Off –line edit checks 
will be done to examine relationships over time and across panels to facilitate quality 
data.  
After completion, the I nvestigator will be required to electronically sign off the clinical 
data. 
Data about all study product  dispensed to the subject  and any dosage changes will be 
tracked on the eCRF.  
 Access to Source Data  
During the study, a monitor will make site visits to revie w protocol compliance, compare 
eCRF  entries  and individual subject ’s source medical records, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent 
regulatory requirements. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to 
ensure that subject  confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking of the eCRF  entries  for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with 
source documents, will be required to monitor the progress of the study. Moreover, 
Regulatory Authorities  of certain countries, IRBs, IECs, and/ or the Sponsor’s Clinical 
Quality Assurance Group may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or on –site 
audit inspections. Direct access to source data will be required for these inspections and 
audits; they will be carried out giving due considerat ion to data protection and medical 
confidentiality. The Investigator  assures Ora and the Sponsor of the necessary support 
at all times.  
 Data Processing  
All data will be entered by [CONTACT_786632] /eCRF  (as detailed in 
Section 9.2.1 ). 
The data -review and data -handling document, to be developed during the initiation 
phase of the study, will include specifications for consistency and plausibility checks on 
data and will also include data -handling rules for obvious data errors. Query/corre ction 
sheets for unresolved queries will be sent to the study monitors for resolution with the 
Investigator . The database will be updated on the basis of signed corrections.  
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organiz ation (WHO) Drug Reference List (DRL), which employs the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Medical history/current medical

Final  56 of 65  Version date 09APR2018  conditions and AEs will be coded using  the m edical dictionary for regulatory activities 
(MedDRA) terminology.  
Previous and concomitant diseases as well as AEs will be coded with MedDRA . 
The versions of the coding dictionaries will be provided in the Clinical Study Report.  
 Archiving Study Records  
According to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, essential 
documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1137136]. However, these 
documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_275113].    
 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor 
and Investigator  abide by [CONTACT_685086] (GCP) guidelines of 
the ICH, and of the Declaration of Helsinki ( 1996 ). The study also will be carried out in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_95829].  
 Informed Consent  
Before each subject  is admitted to the study, informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject  (or his/her legally authorized representative) according to t he regulatory and 
legal requirements of the participating country. This consent form must be dated and 
retained by [CONTACT_820470]. The Investigator  will not 
undertake any investigation specifically required only for the clini cal study until valid 
consent has been obtained. The date the consent  was obtained must also be 
documented in the eCRF  system . 
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the 
changes to the protocol. If the consent form i s revised, it must be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_69869]/IRB, and signed by [CONTACT_386124] s subsequently enrolled 
in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study.  
 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study  protocol and/or other relevant documents will be 
approved by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB/Competent Authorities, in accordance with local legal 
requirements. The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have 
been met before the first subject  is enrolled  in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be 
written, receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive 
IRB/IEC/Competent Authority approval prior to implementation (if appropriate). Following 
approval, the protocol amendment(s) will be submitted to the Investigational New Drug 
Application ( IND) under which the study is being conducted.  
Administrative changes (not affecting the subject  benefit/risk ratio) may be made without 
the need for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with appropriate instructions.  
KalVista Pharma ceuticals, Ltd. Clinical Study Protocol  
KVD001 -[ADDRESS_1137137]  will be up 
to 28 weeks (including up to 4 weeks  for screening,  up to 12 weeks  of treatment  period, 
and up to 12 weeks  for follow –up).  
 Premature Termination of the Study  
If the Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor becomes aware of conditions or 
events that suggest a possible hazard to subject s if the study continues, the study may 
be terminated after appropriate consultation between the relevant parties. The study 
may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a 
finding.  
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
 The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subject s 
enrolled in the study;  
 Failure to enroll subject s at an acceptable rate;  
 A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development o f 
the drug.  
 Confidentiality  
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator  and 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior 
written approval from the Sponsor.  
The anonymity of partic ipating subject s must be maintained. Subject s will be identified 
on eCRF  system  and other documents submitted to Ora by [CONTACT_384302], initials 
and/or birth date, not by [CONTACT_2300]. Documents not to be submitted to Ora that identify the 
subject  (e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_3786] .  
 Other Ethical and Regulatory Issues (optional)  
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individual case report or review of 
aggregate data, then the Sponsor will issue prompt notification to all parties – Regulatory 
Authorities , Investigators , and IRB/IECs.  
A significant safety issue is one that has a significant impact on the course of the clinical 
study  or program (including the potential for suspension of the development program or 
amendments to protocols) or warrants immediate update of informed consent.  
 Publication Policy  
By [CONTACT_33351], the Investigator  agrees with the use of results o f the study 
for the purposes of national and international registration, publication , and information for 
medical and pharmaceutical professionals. If necessary, Regulatory Authorities  will be 
notified of the Investigator's name, address, qualifications , and extent of involvement.  
An Investigator  shall not publish any data (poster, abstract, paper, etc.) without having 
consulted with the Sponsor in advance.  Details are provided in a separate document.

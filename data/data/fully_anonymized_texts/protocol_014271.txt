1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to estimate  probability of  the 1 year disease free 
survival (DFS) after a HLA-haploidentical related hematopoietic cells transplant 
(Haplo -HCT)  using a reduced intensity 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine/melphalan/total body irradiation (TBI) 
conditioning with modifications based on factors including age and comorbidities in patients with a hematologic malignancy.   
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives are:  
• Incidence of day [ADDRESS_944088]-
disease (GVHD)  
• Probability of 6 month, 1 and 2  year treatment -related mortality (TRM)  
• Probability of 1 and 2  year relapse incidence  
• Incidence of serious fungal and v iral infections at day [ADDRESS_944089] 
1.3 Transplant Related Objectives 
• Incidence of neutrophil recovery by [CONTACT_4475] +30 
• Incidence of platelet recovery by [CONTACT_4475] +60  
• Donor cell engraftment (chimerism) at day +21, +100, +180 and + 365  
• Incidence of 1 and 2 year chronic GVHD  
• Probability of 1 and 2  year GVHD and relapse -free survival (GRFS)  
• Probability of 2  year DFS  
• Probability of 1  and 2  year overall survival (OS)  
2 Background and Rationale  
Allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is widely used as a curative therapy for number of hematological malignancies.  Reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC) opened opportunities for older patients and those with comorbid 
conditions to be eligible for potentially curable transplantation.
2-6  
However, donor availability still remains significant challenge for large number of 
patients as HLA -identical matched sibling (MSD) or adult unrelated donor (MUD) 
is available only for about 60% of the patients.7  In addition, the data from the 
National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) indicate that median time from donor 
search to adult MUD transplant is about 3- 4 months.  This time delay increases 
the risk of malignancy relapse in some patients with aggressive diseases.2, 3

(haplo- HCT) makes it an attractive alternative graft source. First -degree relati ve 
haploidentical donor is available for more than 95% of individuals with average such donor number of 2.7.

of the patients.14-16 However, when T -cells were depleted and reduced- intensity 
conditioning (RIC) regimen was used there was an excessive risk of graft failure. Engraftment was improved with mega- doses of CD34 + cells (over 10x10
6cells/kg) 
infusion and/or when full intensity conditioning regimen was used.10, 13, 17 On the 
other hand T -cell depleted myeloablative regimen was associated with significantly 
increased mortality from serious infections/unacceptable immune reconstitution as reported by [CONTACT_218088] (EBMT) 
among 266 acute leukemia patients with 2- year TRM ranging between 36- 61±10% 
depending on remission status at transplant.

18-22 T-cells 
engineered to express suicide genes,23-25 regulatory T -cells (Tregs),26, [ADDRESS_944094] -transplant cyclophosphamide (PT -Cy).11, 35-38 PT-Cy 
approach was pi[INVESTIGATOR_695938] (JHU) g roup using RIC 
regimen consisting of Flu 30 mg/m2/day IV daily from Days  - 6 to - 2, Cy 14.5 mg/kg 
IV on Day - 6 and - 5, and 200 cGy TBI in a single fraction on Day - 1 
(Flu150Cy29TBI200). 1, 39-41 PT-Cy has been shown to promote in vivo  depletion 
of alloreactive T-cells that helps reducing both graft rejection and GVHD rates after 
transplantation.42 In recent years PT -Cy approach either in a setting of RIC 
(Flu150Cy29TBI200 or other regimens) or myeloablative conditioning has become 
widely used in many transplant centers given its easy accessibility and lower

in that study that the yield of CD34+ dose (>2.5 x106/kg, in some cases 4- 8 
x106/kg) is higher in younger donors.[ADDRESS_944098] with T -cell replete BMT/PT -Cy versus T -cell

consisted of Cy 50 mg/kg IV on Days +3 and +4 followed by [CONTACT_496226] +5.  UCB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_695939]

46% after double UCB transplantation (n =50) and 62% and 48%, respectively, after haplo- HCT (n = 50). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 
56 was 94% after dUCB and 96% after Haplo- HCT. The cumulative incidence of 
grade II -IV acute GVHD at Day 100 was 40% after UCB and 32% after haplo- HCT.   
The 1 -year cumulative incidences of TRM and relapse after UCB transplant ation 
were 24% and 31%, respectively, and those for haplo- HCT were 7% and 45%, 
respectively.

the major challenge of haplo- HCT/PT -Cy particularly for AML diagnosis.1, 36, 40, [ADDRESS_944103]/PT -Cy in younger patients lowered the risk of post -transplant AML relapse to

higher comorbidities (HCT -CI ≥3) due to an acceptably high risk of TRM,  strategies 
identifying novel RIC regimen platforms that can reduce the risk of relapse and improve survival after haplo- HCT/PT-Cy are in great demand for those >[ADDRESS_944104] recently Flu/Mel and Flu/Busulfan RIC regimens 
were compared in matched adult donor alloHCT setting for AML/MDS, and significantly lower relapse rate and better survival was observed in those receiving Flu/Mel conditioning regimen.

regimen in another study with addition of 5- 10 mg/kg Thiotepa and increasing the 
those of TBI to total 400 cGy (200 cGy day - 2 and - 1) resulted into low 2- year 
relapse rate of 11% with TRM of 17% and encouraging 2- year DFS rate of 66% in 
patients receiving UCB allograft for hematological malignancies.52  The group from 
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) recently reported their experience with 
haplo- HCT/PT -Cy with use of Flu 40 mg/m2 Day -6 to - 3, Melphalan (Mel) 140 
mg/m2 Day -8 and either Thiotepa 5 mg/kg Day -7 or TBI 200 cGy (FM140)

19% with FM regimen in these studies, prolonged course of intensive immune 
suppression (MMF through Day +90 and Tac through Day +180) was required in 
order to minimize the risk of excessive acute GVHD.49, 50 Since high dose of Mel

increase the risk of oral mucositis and subsequent acute GVHD rate in alloHCT

in MDACC study.49  
We hypothesize that i ntensification of Flu150/Cy29/TBI [ADDRESS_944105]/PT -Cy RIC 
regimen with addition of low dose Mel of 100 mg/m2 Day -5 (70 mg/m2 for patients

3 Study Design  
This is a single institution phase II study of a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 
followed by a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (haplo- HCT) in persons 
with diagnosis of hematologic malignancy.   
 Conditioning will consists of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) preparative regimen with a melphalan dose reduction for patients ≥55 years old and those with HC T Comorbidity Index (CI) ≤  2 .  N o  
melphalan will be given to subjects age ≥ 65 - ≤ 75 or subjects of any age with a 
CI of ≥ 3. 
 
This study uses a two- stage phase II design with accrual goal of 94  patients, using 
28 patients separately for arms A  and C;  and 38 patients in Arm D (arm B has 
been closed) .  
4 Patient Selection  
Study entry is open to persons less than 75 years of age, regardless of gender, 
race or ethnic background.  While there will be every effort to seek out and include 
females and minority patients, the patient population is expected to be no different 
than that of a similar studies at the University of Minnesota.

5 Donor Selection 
Donor selection will be in compliance with 21 CFR 1271.   Donors will be evaluated, 
consented and enrolled via the University of Minnesota related donor protocol 
(MT2012 -14C); however information in this protocol (including match criteria, 
donor selection priority if more than 1 available donor, cell collection target) overrules that protocol.
 While bone marrow is preferred, p eripheral blood is an 
acceptable graft source for those haploidentical donors who are not suitable candidates for general anesthesia for bone marrow harvest, such as, but not 
limited to the elderly or morbidly obese, or per discussion with the treating 
physician. To tal volume required will be the same as above requirements for 
marrow.  
In addition to meeting the criteria in MT2012- 14C the following must be met:

5.3 For donors less than 18 years of age, the maximum recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593] (actual 
body weight) should not exceed 1.25 times the donor weight ( actual body 
weight) and bone marrow product volume should be limited to 20 ml/kg donor 
weight.  
5.[ADDRESS_944118]  within 7 days of marrow collection  
Donor Prioritization Schema  
In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the following order of priority is suggested:  
• Medically fit to donate  
• Absence of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496204] -specific anti -HLA antibodies (DSA). Positive 
DSA is defined as a positive crossmatch test of any titer (by [CONTACT_30937] -
dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometric testing) or the presence of DSA to 
the high expression loci HLA -A, - B, -C, or - DRB1 with mean fluorescence 
intensity >1000 by [CONTACT_496231].  
• Donor age 18- 40 is prioritized over donor age < 18, then >40, with donors 
<[ADDRESS_944119] 
donor is prioritized.  
• Lack of major ABO incompatibility  
• For cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], a CMV seronegative 
donor  
• Lack of minor ABO incompatibility  
• Male donor or non- parous female are preferable.

Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day will be administered over 30- 60 minutes intravenous 
infusion on Days – 6 through –2 for a total dose of 150 mg/m2.  Fludarabine will 
be dosed according to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s actual body weight.  For patients who 
have an estimated or measured creatinine clearance < 70 ml/min/1.73 m2, or 
either prior CNS disease, prior brain radiation, or prior intrathecal chemotherapy, the fludarabine dose should be reduced by 20%.  Fludarabine 
dosing is based on the last creatinine clearance prior to the start of conditioning.  
The fludarabine dose should be the same on Days - 6 to - 2, even if the patient’s 
creatinine changes.   
Fludarabine must be administered before cyclophosphamide on Day - 6.

be given according to recommended institutional standards, starting 12 hours 
prior to cyclophosphamide.  
Mesna dose will be 100% of the cyclophosphamide dose being given and 
divided into 5 doses.  20% of the total dose will be given  prior to the start of 
cyclophosphamide, and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after the start of 
cyclophosphamide.   
Cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg will be administered as a 2 hour intravenous infusion on Day – 6.  Cyclophosphamide dosing is calculated based on ABW 
(actual weight) unless ABW is >150% of the IBW (Ideal Body Weight).  Then 
the dose should be computed using adjusted body weight. Ideal body  weight is 
calculated using 50kg + [2.3kg x(height in inches –  60)] for men; 45.5kg + [2.3kg 
x(height in inches –  60)] for women.  Adjusted body weight = IBW + 0.5(ABW -

March 11, 2024  Page 35 of 50 CPRC #201 6LS092 12 Statistical  Considerations  
12.1 Statistical Endpoints  
12.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the probability of disease- free survival (DFS) by 
[ADDRESS_944138] -transplant.  An event will be defined as death or a relapse.  
12.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
• Probability of Grade II -IV and Grade III- IV aGVHD at 180 days  
• Probability of treatment -related mortality (TRM) at 6 months, 1 and 2 
years  
• Probability of relapse at 1 and 2 years  
• Probability of serious fungal and viral infections at day +[ADDRESS_944139] 
12.1.3  Transplant Related Endpoints  
The following endpoints are not stressed but will be abstracted from the 
BMT database:  
• Probability of neutrophil recovery by [CONTACT_4475] +30 
• Probability of platelet recovery by [CONTACT_4475] +60 
• Proportion of donor cell engraftment (chimer ism) at days +21, 
+100, +180 and +365  
• Probability of 1 and 2 year chronic GVHD  
• Probability of 1 and 2 year GVHD and relapse -free survival (GFRS)  
• Probability of 2- year DFS  
• Probability of 1 and 2 year overall survival (OS)  
 
12.2 Statistical Analysis  
Arm B  has been closed due to higher toxicity but we will analyze as intended 
to estimate endpoints under previous eligibility and conditioning. In order to 
reduce treatment -related mortality, future enrollment of patients previously 
eligible for arm B will be placed  into two separate arms (C and D) based on age 
and HCT -CI with reduced conditioning in arm D. Eligibility for Arm C  will 
primarily be changed to allow only patients aged 55- [ADDRESS_944140] -CI≤2. The 
conditioning will remain the same. In Arm D , eligible patient s will be age 65- [ADDRESS_944141] -CI ≥3 but Melphalan will be completely removed from the 
conditioning. Analysis will be performed separately for arms A , C and D  as we 
are not certain if the disease- free survival will differ between the two groups. It 
is possible that PBSC will be used as a donor source but this is unexpected. 
These patients will be evaluated separately in a descriptive format. Otherwise 
MT2016 -15:  RIC Haplo -HCT for Hematologic Malignancies   
 
   
March 11, 2024  Page 36 of 50 CPRC #201 6LS092 for the primary target study population, Kaplan- Meier curves will be used to 
estimate the probability of DFS, OS and GFRS along with respective 95% 
confidence intervals. Cumulative incidence will be used to estimate the 
probabilities of GVHD, relapse, infection, and neutrophil and platelet recovery 
treating non- event deaths as competing risks. The probabil ity of TRM will be 
estimated in a similar manner but treating relapse as the  competing risk. 
Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be estimated from respective 
standard errors. The proportion of donor chimerism (classified as ≥70% donor cells at va rious time -points will be estimated among patients who have survived 
to the evaluated time- point). Descriptive plots and measures will also be used 
to evaluate chimerism as a continuous measure. Medians, ranges and inter -
quartile ranges will be given for actual chimerism values. Analyses will be performed and plots generated using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and/or R 3.5.1.  
12.3 Design and Sample -Size Justification  
This study is designed  as a two -stage phase II trial to estimate disease- free 
survival (DFS)  by [CONTACT_235850] -transplant . We will potentially enroll 28 patients 
with one interim analysis (without pause in enrollment) at 15 subjects in each 
arm (A  and  C ) and 38 in Arm D. Since the goal is to estimate the DFS at a 
long-term time -point (1 year), we ran a simulated exponential model 10,[ADDRESS_944142] been enrolled, we will discontinue the trial if the projected kaplain- meier curve has an estimated 1 year DFS of <32%. 
Assuming the null hypothesis of 30% DFS is true, we have a 42% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695942]. Assuming the alternative hypothesis of 60% DFS by [ADDRESS_944143] overall power of approximately 79%. Due to the number of c omparison s, the 
Bonfer onni correction for multiple comparisons has been employed (type- I 
error = 0.0167 (0.05/3)) to maintain an experiment -wise type- I error of 0.05.   
 We expect to complete the study after 2- [ADDRESS_944144] enroll ed patients.   
 08/19/21: Arm D has been accruing  faster than expected (currently at 25 
patients with final enrollment  of 28 patients). Given that A rm D has been shown 
to be efficacious with 1 year  DFS of 52% (95% CL, 30 -70%) and safe (2  TRM 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695943] 2 Grade III -IV aGVHD stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_319526]), we

March 11, 2024  Page 37 of 50 CPRC #201 6LS092 propose to increase enrollment to 38 patients in Arm D. This will provide a more 
precise estimate of DFS for Arm D.  Thirty -eight patients would decrease the 
95% confidence limit w idth by [CONTACT_3450] 7%.  
 
12.4 Toxicity Monitoring and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695944] a 
continuous monitoring strategy based on an adaptation of Pocock stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]

patients, 3 out of 6, 4 out of 11, 5 out of 16 or 6 out of 21 or 7 out of 27 . 
The probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695949] 30% is 80%.

8 at any  time. The probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695951] 30% is 77 %. 
 
Due t o additional stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], it is understood that the overall power 
may be slightly reduced for this study.

All patients who have had previous radiation therapy or TBI will be seen by [CONTACT_695961] [ADDRESS_944157] feels that even a relatively small dose of total body 
irradiation (TBI) cannot safely be given.   
The total dose of TBI will be 400 cGy .  Each fraction will be 200 cGy given on Day -2 and Day -
1. 
The dose rate will be between 10- 19 cGy/minute prescribed to the midplane of the patient at the 
level of the umbilicus.  
The TBI will be delivered with right and left lateral fields with the patient semi -recumbent in a 
semi -fetal position with their arms at their sides.  
Based on measurement of transverse thickness, aluminum compensators will be used to ensure that the dose homogeneity across the fields is within 10% of the prescribed dose. Usually head/ 
neck, leg and lung compensators are used (although based on calculated mid- mediastinal 
doses, lung compensators are often not needed if the thickness of the arms, which partially 
shield the lung, are taken into the thickness consideration).  
TBI will be delivered with a linear accelerator using 6, 10, or 18 MV photons. The energy used 
will be based on the calculated dose to midline at points along the patient's torso. The lowest 
energy that gives 90-100% of the prescriptions point dose will be used.  
A beam "spoiler" will be used to ensure a full skin dose.  
Half value layer lung and kidney blocks will not be utilized for patients who have not previously 
received total body irradiation.

March 11, 2024  Page 47 of 50 CPRC #[ADDRESS_944158] Tr ansplant Procedures and Supportive Care  
Haploidentical Donor Marrow Collection and Infusion (Day 0)  
On Day 0, patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless there is an ABO 
incompatibility. In case of major ABO incompatibility red blood cells will be depl eted from 
the donor marrow using institutional practice.  In case of minor ABO incompatibilities 
donor marrow plasma depletion and IV hydration will be used per institutional standard practice.   
Donor bone marrow will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223], and a recommended minimum yield of 2.5 x 108 nucleated cells/kg of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223].  If ABO incompatible, then a target of 6 x 10 8/kg will be collected to allow 
for cell losses during RBC removal as needed.   We recommend taking no more than [ADDRESS_944159] as 
below.  
If bone marrow coll ection volume exceeding 20 ml/kg of donor actual body weight is 
required, donor hemoglobin/hematocrit (Hb/Hct) should be checked STAT during bone 
marrow harvest procedure to document that Hct remains ≥25. Fluids and colloid such as albumin will be infused to the donor as necessary. Unrelated donor RBC transfusions can 
be considered in some cases if clinically indicated.  
In addition to calculating the total nucleated cell dose/kg, a sample of the product to be infused will be sent for flow cytometry to dete rmine the content of CD34+cells.  The use 
of cryopreserved marrow is not permitted.   
Calculation:  
Total bone marrow volume required = (4 x 10 8 nucleated cells/kg x Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223] (kg)) / 
(Marrow nucleated cell count –  Peripheral blood WBC count)   
E.g. Req uired total bone marrow volume for 50 kg IBW recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: (4 x 108  cells/kg x 50 
kg)/( 25 x 106 /mL marrow count -  5 x 106 /mL PB WBC count) = 2 x 1010 /2 x 107 =[ADDRESS_944160], such as, but not 
limited to the elderly or morbidly obese . Peripheral blood is also acceptable at the 
discretion of treating physician and the BMT team for underlying diseases with higher r isk 
of engraftment failure including but not limited to those with m yeloproliferative 
neoplasms/myelofibrosis  and hypercellular marrow. Total volume required will be the 
same as above requirements for marrow.  Peripheral blood may supplement bone marrow 
graft if cell dose requirement is not met.

the days of post -transplant cyclophosphamide should be adjusted accordingly to be days 
+3 and +[ADDRESS_944162] -stem cell infusion. The start of tacrolimus and MMF should also be 
adjusted accordingly in this circumstance.   
 
GVHD Prophylaxis and Growth Factor Support (begin Day 5)  
All patients will receive prophylaxis for GVHD with two drugs both beginning at Day 5 as 
follows:  
Tacrolimus  
Tacrolimus will be given at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day IV as a continuous infusion.  
When tolerated, tacrolimus may be changed to PO dosing at 0.12 mg/kg/day PO divided into two doses.  Initial IV and/or PO dose may be adjusted as clinically 
necessary to achieve desired goal levels.  
Tacrolimus prophylaxis will begin on Day +[ADDRESS_944163] -transplant.  Serum levels of 
tacrolimus will be measured around  Day +7 and then should be checked twice 
weekly thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly to maintain a trough level of 
5-15 ng/mL for a minimum of 90 days, followed by [CONTACT_695962] +180 in the 
absence of GVHD. Tacrolimus may be continued if active GVHD is present.   
Sirolimus (trough level of 3- 12 ng/ml) may be substituted for tacrolimus if the 
patient is intolerant of tacrolimus.  
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)  
MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO TID (based upon actual body weight) 
with the maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams (1 g PO TID).  MMF prophylaxis will begin on Day +[ADDRESS_944164] dose on Day +35, or may be continued if active GVHD is present.  
Growth Factor Support

March 11, 2024  Page 49 of 50 CPRC #201 6LS092 G-CSF will be given beginning on Day  +5 at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day (rounding to 
the nearest vial dose is allowed), until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 
1,500/mm3 for three consecutive measurements on 3 different days.  G -CSF may 
be restarted to maintain ANC > 1,000/mm3.  G-CSF may be gi ven by [CONTACT_496233].  
 
 
Supportive Care  
Supportive care will be provided per University Of Minnesota institutional guidelines for 
transplant patients including any supportive care research protocols.  
All patients will receive standard supportive transfusion care according to transfusion 
committee guidelines or as modified based on clinical parameters.  
Acute and chronic GVHD will be staged and treated using current University of Minnesota 
BMT program GVHD protocols  
Antimicrobial prophylaxis directed towards bacteria, fungi and viruses will be per University Of Minnesota current institutional guidelines for transplant patients.  
Management of Slow Engraftment or Graft Failure  
Patients with ANC < [ADDRESS_944165] infusion will be started on G -CSF support 
at 5 mcg/kg (IV/SQ)(round to vial size) daily until ANC > 2500/μL for 2 consecutive days. 
Once a patient has met these criteria, the ANC will be monitored and G -CSF restarted if 
ANC falls to < 1000.  
If no evidence of donor engraftment on the Day +21/28 bone marrow biopsy, notify the unrelated donor (URD) search coordinator to pursue back -up graft and arrange a follow -
up bone marrow biopsy per current institutional slow engraftment guidelines.

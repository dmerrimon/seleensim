A. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
A.1. Primary  Objective.  Obtain  preliminary  estimates  of the effect  size of high flow 
oxygen and air on dyspnea. Our working hypothesis is that hig h flow oxygen/air will  be 
associated with lower levels of dyspnea than low flow oxygen/air in cancer  patients.  
A2. Secondary Aim #1. Determine the completion rate of a randomized controlled  trial 
of dyspnea  in cancer  patients.  Our working  hypothesis  is that at least  80% of patients 
will complete the 4 periods of this  study.  
A.3. Secondary Aim #2. Obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of high flow  oxygen 
and air on physiologic function (oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697],  transcutaneous  
CO2). Our w orking hypothesis is that high flow oxygen and air will improve  physiologic 
function.  
 
B. BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
B.1. Dyspnea is defined as “a  subjective 
experience of breathing discomfort  that 
consists of qualitatively distinct  sensations  
that vary in intensity” 1. It occurs  in 
approximately 10% -70% of cancer  patients 
and is one of the most feared symptoms  2, 
3. More than 80% of patients with  dyspnea  
have breakthrough epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  particularly 
with physical exertion 4. Dyspnea  is 
associated with decreased function,  quality 
of life, and survival 5. The 
pathophysiological features of dyspnea  are 
shown in Figure 1. The sensory  cortex  
receives afferent input from  various 
peripheral and central stimuli,  generating 
the sensation of breathlessness 1, 6. 
Parenchymal  metastasis,  lymphangitic 
carcinomatosis, airway obstruction,  pleural  
effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary  embolism, 
and    atelectasis    may    cause     difficulty  
breathing in the context of progressive  cancer.  
The current  management  of dyspnea  involves  treating  any reversible  causes  and 
providing supportive measures. Systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] a re effective for dyspnea relief 7. Low- 
flow supplemental oxygen (up to 5 L/min) has also been found to be effective, but  only 
in patients  with hypoxemia  8, 9. The current method  of supplemental  oxygen  delivery 
using nasal prongs and non -re-breather masks is limited because these modalities  can 
only deliver limited oxygen flow and are uncomfortable. These impracticalities,  coupled 
with their lack of effectiveness  at relieving  dyspnea  in non-hypoxemic  cancer  patients, 
indicate  a need  for more  effective  oxygen  delivery  methods  for dyspnea  10,  11. The 

2016 -0282  
Rev. 9/26/17 
Page 3 of 11  
proposed research is expected to provide new insights into the therapeutic role of  HFOx 
for dyspnea.  
B.2. High -flow oxygen is an innovative heat and humidification device that can  deliver  
oxygen at a rate of up to 60 L/min via nasal prongs. The device is postulated to  relieve 
dyspnea  by [CONTACT_117354]  a level of PaO2 superior  to that of LFOx,  which  may decrease 
and inhibit the activation of dyspnea chemoreceptors (Figure 1). The  high-flow 
mechanism, whether delivering oxygen or air, may also improve ventilation 12, augment  
end-distending pressure 13, reduce nasopharyngeal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32721] 14, and 
stimulate the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves (Figure 1). The inhalation  of 
heated and humidified gas may also decrease bronchoconstriction, improve  airway 
conductance 15, and reduce the metabolic cost of gas conditioning 14. Because of  these 
novel mechanisms, we hypothesize that HFOx and HFAir will  relieve dyspnea  in 
patients who are not included in the traditional target population (i.e., patients  with 
hypoxemia), including those with normal oxygen saturation. This  non-hypoxemic 
population  makes  up a large  proportion  of cancer  patients  with dyspnea  16. To our 
knowledge, to date, no published study has specifically evaluated HFOx for dyspnea  in 
non-hypoxemic cancer patients, nor has anyone studied the therapeutic role of HFAir  in 
any patient  population.  
B.3. High -flow suppl emental oxygen improved dyspnea in hypoxemic  cancer  
patients 17. We recently conducted the  first 
randomized controlled trial comparing  HFOx 
and bilevel positive airway pressure  (two 
hours each) in advanced cancer  patients 
with refractory dyspnea. Twenty -four of  30 
(80%)  patients  completed  the study  
interventions, suggesting that a study  of 
these two devices is feasible in this  patient  
population. HFOx (mean change, 1.9;  95% 
CI, 0.4 -3.4; P=0.02) was associated  with 
significa nt improvements in dyspnea  (Figure 
2). Remarkably, two patients who  completed  
HFOx  reported  low  dyspnea  scores  ( 2 of 
10) up to [ADDRESS_542055]  on dyspnea.  Overall,  10 of 13 
(77%) patients who completed HFOx reported dyspnea improvement, with  none  
experiencing  significant  adverse  effects.  Of note,  this study  was conducted  in patients 
who were  predominantly  hypoxemic  (93%)  and did not respond  to LFOx.  These  data 
support  the feasibility  of conducting  a clinical  trial with HFOx  in cancer  patients  and 
provide preliminary evidence of its efficacy. Importantly, HFOx and HFAir have not  been  
formally tested in non -hypoxemic patients, which is why the proposed trial is  particularly 
novel.  
B.4. Low-flow supplemental  oxygen  for non-hypoxemic  cancer  patients  18. In a 
double -blind, randomized trial, we found that LFOx at 5 L/min did not improve  dyspnea  
during  a 6-minute  walk compared  with LFAir  at 5 L/min.  The results  of this important  
2016 -0282  
Rev. 9/26/17 
Page 4 of 11  
study highlight the lack of efficacy of LFOx for dyspnea in non -hypoxemic patients  and 
the need to evaluate novel treatment options (i.e., HFOx and  HFAir).  
B.5. Study  rationale.  We expect  to advance  our understanding  of how HFOx  can be 
used to treat dyspnea in non -hypoxemic cancer patients. The effective management  of 
dyspnea may ultimately help alleviate this devastating symptom. By [CONTACT_428428] -flow mechanism from the oxygen content and capturing changes in  physiologic 
parameters,  we will gain a better  understanding  of the mechanisms  that help alleviate 
dyspnea and devise newer, more effective  treatments.  
 
C. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS  
C.1. Study design. This is a double -blind,  4- 
intervention, 4 -period crossover  randomized 
controlled trial of HFOx, HFAir, LFOx, and  LFAir 
in non -hypoxemic cancer patients ( Figure 3 ). We 
plan to enroll  36 patients  in total.  The eligibility 
criteria are listed in Table 1 . We will use  a 
computer -generated sequence for  randomization.  
Even with 2 different flow rates, patients  and 
research staff will be blinded to the gas  (i.e., 
oxygen v. air) while a separate  respi[INVESTIGATOR_428408];  thus, 
this will remain a double -blind study. On the  basis 
of our experience conducting symptom  control  
trials, we believe this study design will not be  an 
undue burden for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51379] 
(approximately 1 -2 hours, including  washout).19 
The rationale  for the current  study  design  is as 
follows:  
 Crossover design —This design allows intra -individual comparison,  thus 
maximizing  study  power  (144 tests  in 36 patients)  in addition  to providing  overall 
preference.20 We use the Latin square design to minimize the sequences  needed.  
 Intervention  duration —We will limit this intervention  to only [ADDRESS_542056] utilized similar durations  8. 
 Variable  washout  period —although  the washout  period  is expected  to be short 
(<10 min),  it has not been  defined.  Thus,  we will measure  dyspnea  on the Numeric 
Rating  Scale  starting  after 10 minutes  of each  intervention  every  5 minutes  until 
patient  returns  to within  1 point  of the baseline  level of dyspnea  (i.e. immediately 
prior to starting the first intervention) before we proceed to the next  intervention.  
 Inclusion  of HFOx,  HFAir  and LFAir  arms —HFOx  has not been  tested  in non- 
hypoxemic cancer patients. No published study has examined the therapeutic role  of 
HFAir  in any patient  population.  The efficacy  of LFAir  has not been  studied  in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203725]  21. 
 Use of LFAir as control —LFAir at 2 L/min is a well -accepted control intervention  in 
published  studies.

C.2. Eligibility  criteria.  The eligibility  criteria  are shown  in Table  1. The rationale  for 
including  patients  with obstructive  and restrictive  lung disease  in this study  is that the 
mechanisms of dyspnea relief (e.g., trigeminal nerve stimulation and  decreased  
breathing effort; see Figure 1) are applicable to both types of pulmonary  disorder.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.3. Recruitment. Patients seen by [CONTACT_428429], thoracic  oncology, 
pulmonary medicine, or emergency care will be screened for this study. The  supportive 
care inpatient consultation team sees 80 patients (10 -20 new consults) per day. A  two- 
step consent  process  will be used.  First,  verbal  consent  will be obtained  by [CONTACT_428430]. Before  signing  
any consent document, a respi[INVESTIGATOR_428409] a trial of  high-flow 
oxygen/air to ensure tolerance of high flow. Eligible patients will be formally enrolled  in 
the study  after they have  signed  the informed  consent  form indicating  their willingness 
to participate  in the trial. Once  enrolled,  the research  staff will work  with the patient  to 
identify  ideal  time to conduct  the study.  We will document  the number  of patients  who 
are screened,  approached,  eligible,  enrolled,  and randomized  for the study  and the 
number who complete it. When patients complete study procedures, they will  be 
compensated with a $[ADDRESS_542057] as a show of appreciation for their time  and 
participation. Patients’ reasons for declining to participate will also be  captured.  
C.4. Randomization. Randomization will be performed immediately before the  patient  
is ready to start study procedures by [CONTACT_428431][INVESTIGATOR_428410] (https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct),  which 
is maintained by [CONTACT_428432]. The trial  statistician  
will train the respi[INVESTIGATOR_428411]. 
We will use a computer -generated sequence in permuted blocks to randomize  patients, 
in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to the four treatment sequences from a Latin square. Each  sequence 
has a specific order of high flow oxygen, low flow oxygen, high flow air, an d low flow  air. 
C.5. Study interventions. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_428412] a high flow oxygen device  to 
deliver  HFOx.  This device  was approved  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  in 
2007 (K033710) to add “moisture to, and to warm, the breathing  gases  for 
administration  to a patient.  Gases  available  for medical  use do not contain  sufficient  Table  1. Study Eligibi lity Criteria

Rev. 9/26/[ADDRESS_542058]  been  by[CONTACT_92842].  This may be indicated  for 
patients requiring mechanical ventilation, positive pressure breathing assistance,  or 
general  medical  gases”.  HFOx  will be delivered  via nasal  prongs.  The flow of oxygen 
will be maximized (set between 20 and 60 L/min), if tolerated, to minimi ze dyspnea.  The 
FiO2 will be set at 100%. The level of heat will be adjusted to keep the  patient  
comfortable.  HFAir  will also be delivered  by [CONTACT_428434], 
except  that we will use pressurized  air instead  of oxygen.  LFOx  and LFAir  will be 
provided  at 2 L/min  using  a nasal  cannula.  This flow rate is based  on the results  of a 
previous large randomized controlled trial of oxygen use in non -hypoxemic patients 21. A 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_428414]. We  have 
previously collaborated with the same team of respi[INVESTIGATOR_428415] -flow oxygen  delivery.  
C.6. Blinding. The patients and research staff will be blinded to the assignment of  the 
gas (i.e., oxygen vs. air). The gas will be delivered via gas outlets inside the  patient’s 
room,  located  behind  the bed. Only the respi[INVESTIGATOR_428416]. To ensure proper blinding, the research staff will step out of  the 
room while the respi[INVESTIGATOR_428417]. The gas supply  will 
be covered  with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_428418].  The respi[INVESTIGATOR_428419]. We  will 
assess blinding by [CONTACT_428435]. The flow rate cannot be blinded in this  study.  
C.7. Study outcomes. See Table [ADDRESS_542059] data on patient demographics and study feasibility outcomes  (rates 
of enrollment and attrition). The study interventions will be provided to patients while  at 
rest, and dyspnea ratings will only be assessed when patients a re at rest. 
C.8. Co-interventions. We expect that co -interventions will be minimal because of  the 
short study period. We will document any regularly scheduled,  bronchodilators  or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_401372] 1 hour before or during the study period. However, if patients required  as 
need opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (for pain or any other reasons) or bronchodilators during the study  period, 
they will need to come off study and will need to be  replaced.  
C.9. Training  of research  staff.  An orientation  will be held with all research  staff 
involved in this study to introduce them to the study design and standardize  the 
provision of each intervention. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that  research 
staff provide patients with proper instructions so they understand the  study 
assessments. We wi ll also have several mock -ups for practicing the study  procedures.  
C.10.  Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The MD Anderson DSMB will  be 
providing monitoring for patient safety and data quality assurance  purposes.  
C.11.  Dropouts.  Patients  will come  off study  if (1) they decide  for any reason  to stop;  
(2) they did not achieve within 1 point of the baseline level of dyspnea after 1  hour 
during the washout period, (3) they require as need opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (for pain or any  other  
reasons) or bronchodilators during the study period. These individuals will need to  be 
replaced.  
C.12.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. This is a short study and we expect limited attrition. We will  stop 
the study at patient request or if patients required as need opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (for pain or any  other  
reasons) or bronchodilators d uring the study  period.

D. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
D.1. Analysis  plan.  
Design: We propose a 4 -period, 4 -intervention balanced Latin -square  cross -over 
(Williams)  design  with 4 sequences  and 36 patients  (i.e., 9 replicates  per sequence). 
The primary outcome is the Dyspnea Numeric Rating Scale (0 -10). Each intervention  is 
10-minutes  long with NRS  assessments  at 0, 5 and 10 minutes.  Washout  periods 
between  interventions  will continue  until NRS  assessment  returns  to within  one unit of 
baseline.  
Primary  analysis:  We will fit a mixed  effects  linear  model  to the Dyspnea  Numeric 
Rating Scale data to account for the repeated measurements (i.e. 0, 5 and 10  minutes) 
which yield period, sequence, and carryover effects and to model the various  inter- 
patient and intra -patient sources of variation. Appropriate data visualization and  residual  
analyses will also be performed. The primary objective of the study is to  obtain 
preliminary  estimates  of the effect  sizes  (In a mixed  model,  the slope  of change  will 
provide an estimate of effect size. We will also determine the mean change in NRS  over 
10 minutes for each study  intervention).  
Secondary  analysis  #1: We will estimate  the completion  rate as the proportion  of 
patients starting treatment that complete all four  interventions.  
Additional  secondary  analyses:  Using  mixed  effects  linear  models  we will obtain 
preliminary  estimates  of the study  effects  for physiologic  function  (oxygen  saturation, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], transcutaneou s CO 2). We will also assess washout period duration in  a 
similar fashion. Finally, we will tabulate patient intervention preferences obtained at  the 
end of the  study.  
D.2. Sample size justification. We will enroll [ADDRESS_542061]  estimates,  based  on our experience  with mixed  effects  models,  36 patients 
with 12 repeated measurements (3 times for each of 4 interventions) will  provide  
adequate precision. If the completion rate is 80% then with 36 patients, a  95% 
confidence interval on this estimate would extend from 64% to  92%.  
 
E. DATA CONFIDENTIALITY  PROCEDURES  
Study  data will be collected  and managed  using  REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data 
Capture)  tools  hosted  at MD Anderson  or hardcopy  surveys.  Participants  will have  the 
option to complete surveys electronically or hardcopy. Data entry of  any  hardcopy  
survey will be completed using REDCap software.  REDCap  (www.project -redcap.org ) 
is a secure,  web-based  application  with controlled  access  designed  to support  data 
capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data  entry;  
2) audi t trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated  export 
procedures for seamless downloads to common statistical packages; and 4)  procedures

We anticipate the study will be completed in five sessions, with four biomechanical data collection sessions. The first 
session will require approximately one hour and each of the subsequent sessions will take approximately [ADDRESS_219412] participants complete questionnaires concerning 
balance confidence and patient preference, and  use a motion capture system to investigate effects of assistive device on 
walking stability, balance, and gait biomechanics.  
 
Each participant will be given one overnight period to accommodate to the boot, SAC or HFC prior to collection. 
Participants will  then undergo testing in each study condition (BOOT, HFC + BOOT/HFC NO BOOT, SAC  
+BOOT/SAC NO BOOT, and NONE) to determine how the boot and/or the assistive device affects stability through 
whole body or segmental angular momentum and gait biomechanics. We will use well -established techniques to obtain a 
range of biomechanical gait dat a as individuals walk at self -selected and a controlled speed.  
 
Personal/demographic and anthropometric information (e.g. age, biological sex, height, weight, leg length, shoe type, 
shoe length and width) will be used to fully characterize the study partic ipants. We will collect multiple variables that 
have been previously associated with outcomes, including race, ethnicity, and education to characterize the cohort.  
 
Self-reported outcomes questionnaires will be used to evaluate participant balance confiden ce and device preference. 
These participant -centric assessments will provide insight that can be used to interpret other study findings. We have 
used the selected measures previously and expect that they will effectively capture device -related outcomes. Ba lance 
confidence will be assessed using the Activity -specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, a reliable, valid, and sensitive 
self-reported assessment of balance. Device preference and device comfort will be assessed using standardized 
questionnaires, in a manner consistent with multiple other protocols. Participants will also report maximum pain with 
movement with use of the assistive devices on an [ADDRESS_219413] (foot, shank, thigh, pelvis, trunk, arms and head). A pointer wand with 
a rubber tip will be used to identify bony landmarks for segment coordinate system definition. Visual 3D software (C - 
Motion Inc.) will be used to calculate segment a nd joint angles and velocities. Force plates imbedded in the floor will 
capture ground reaction forces. Data from successful walking trials will be analyzed using Visual -3D software package 
(C-motion Inc., Germantown, MD).  
 
Five total sessions, with four s essions including biomechanical data collection, are required for completion of this study. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_185776]. Three attempts will be 
made to contact [CONTACT_185777](s).  
 
Data and recordings will be stored on a password restricted drive that only authorized individuals have access to. They 
may be retained indefinitely for the purposes of evaluating data quality.  
 
Describe the analysis methods you will use, including, if applicable, the variables you will analyze  
AIM1  
There are four conditions in this study Aim,  1) BOOT, 2) HFC + BOOT, 3) SAC + BOOT and 4) NONE. Between 
condition statistical comparisons for each hypothesis will be conducted in a similar manner for each dependent measure 
(e.g. whole body angular momentum and segmental angular momentum in all three  planes: sagittal, frontal, and 
transverse). H1.1. Paired t -test will be used to compare the HFC + BOOT and SAC + BOOT conditions. H1.2. One -way 
repeated measure ANOVAs will be used to test for a condition effect across the 4 conditions: 1) BOOT, 2) HFC + 
BOOT, 3) SAC + BOOT and 4) NONE. Paired t -tests with Bonferroni -Holm correction will be used for post -hoc 
comparisons.

H2.[ADDRESS_219414] across the 4 conditions (1) BOOT,  
2) HFC + BOOT, 3) SAC + BOOT and 4) NONE) on self -reported balance confidence using the ABC scale. Paired t - 
tests with Bonferroni -Holm correction will be used for post -hoc comparisons. H2.2 Paired t -tests will be used to assess 
participant device preferen ce between 2) HFC + BOOT and 3) SAC + BOOT for: the device numerical scale (0 -10), the 
device comfort scale, and the numeric pain rating scale (0 -10). 
 
AIM [ADDRESS_219415] for main, and interaction effects acros s the 6 conditions 
for the primary dependent measures:  
1) BOOT, 2) HFC + BOOT, 3) SAC + BOOT  
4) NONE, 5) HFC NO BOOT, 6) SAC NO BOOT  
Paired t -tests with Bonferroni -Holm correction will be used for post -hoc comparisons.  
 
Provide the rationale or power analy sis to support the number of subjects proposed to complete this  study.  
The number of participants proposed for this study are consistent with those from prior investigations by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wilken 
using angular momentum, which range from [ADDRESS_219416]/missing data.

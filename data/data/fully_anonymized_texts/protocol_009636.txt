Study Description : We have developed a strategy -based cognitive intervention, based on 
the MultiContext (MC) approach, to enable people with PD to apply 
strategies in their everyday lives to cope with cognitive decline and 
improve or ma intain daily function. We hypothesize that this 
intervention will produce better functional outcomes compared to cognitive process training. This project will assess feasibility and 
treatment fidelity and generate data in preparation for a definitive clinical trial by [CONTACT_14664] a single -blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_599129] a standard -of-care treatment 
(Control). Participants with PD without dementia (N = 60) will complete pr e-treatment testing, randomization to treatment group, [ADDRESS_792598] -treatment testing.   
Objectives:  
 Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of t he MC approach for people with PD 
within an RCT.  
Aim 2: Demonstrate adequate treatment fidelity to the MC approach.  
Aim 3: Obtain preliminary estimates of the M C approach’s effect on 
patient -reported functional cognition.

The following target interval limits will be used, expressed as “target (window)”:  
• Pre assessment will occur ≤ [ADDRESS_792601] passed, 
participants will be re -screened before enrollment.  
• Treatment Session 1 will occur 7 (5 -14) days after the Pre assessment.  
• Each subsequent treatment session will occur 7 (5 -9) days after the prior treatment session.  
• Post assessment will occur 7 (5 -14) days after Tr eatment Session 10.  
• Follow -up assessment will occur 3 months ( -7 days/+14 days) after Treatment Session 10.  
Keep in mind that these are targets, and this study aims to determine whether these targets are feasible 
and/or how we can improve our processes to meet them in the future. Although we aim for participants 
to have a treatment session each calendar week, the stated goal of completing the intervention within 
12 weeks allows for up to 2 missed weeks due to practical circumstances (that would be present i n real-
world clinical practice) such as participant or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599132], travel, inclement weather, holidays, etc.

Research   6 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Parkinson disease (PD) affects over 1 million Americans and causes considerable personal and 
socioeconomic costs (>$34 billion/year in the US) that are expected to rise as the population ages1. 
Cognitive impairment produces disability and reduced quality of life among non -demented peo ple with 
PD2-4. Surgical and pharmacologic treatments for PD do not prevent or treat cognitive impairmen t and 
may even exacerbate the problem5-8. As such, cognitive rehabilitation treatments that mitigate its 
negative functional consequences are a top research priority8-13. Unfortunately, existing cognitive 
rehabilitative programs for PD, which focus on restoring deficient cognitive processes through process 
training (repetitive practice of tasks that challenge specific cognitive processes), have had limited effect 
on daily function10. To overcome this limitation, we take a strategy training  approach. We teach people 
targeted strategies to use in everyday life to circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish meaningful daily activities. Contemporary  cognitive rehabilitation evidence supports this approach for people with chronic 
neurocognitive dysfunction from stroke and brain injury
14-16; however, it has  not been studied in PD. By 
[CONTACT_599156], we hypothesize that our strategy training interventions will produce better 
functional outcome s for people with PD compared to process training.  
We adapted the MultiContext (MC) Approach  to enable people with PD to apply strategies in their 
everyday lives to cope with cognitive decline and improve or maintain daily function) . The MC Approach  
is an individualized, community -based intervention that focuses on the attainment of personally 
meaningful functional goals using training techniques known to enhance strategy learning and transfer.  
We hypothesize that the MC Approach  can enable people with PD to manage everyday cognitive 
challenges so they can perform and participate in desired activities and roles. Such an intervention could improve function and quality of life, reduce caregiver burden, and enhance clinical care for this 
population. This specific study is part of a rigorous developmental process designed to optimize the MC 
Approach  for clinical trials and eventual translation into clinical practice. It is significant  because it will 
provide us with feasibility data, fidelity enhancements, clinical trials infrastructure, experience training 
and monitoring therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and an estimate of treatment effect— all essential elements for efficiency, 
rigor, reproducibility, and payoff in future clinical trials as well as for implementation and sustainability in 
real- world clinical practice . 
2.[ADDRESS_792602] stages of PD demonstrate mild cognitive deficits —typi[INVESTIGATOR_599134] —
which are attributed to frontrostriatal circuitry dysfunction due to dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia 
and prefrontal cortex
5,17,18. These deficits produce disability, reduced quality of life, and restricted 
participation early in the course of PD, potentially to a larger extent than motor impairment2-4,19,20. Due 
MC4PD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] [ADDRESS_792603] taken a restorative process training approach , attempting to enhance 
underlying neural physiology and improve specific cognitive processes through practice10,21- 25. Although 
this approach has produced small, specific, and short -term improvements on cognitive tests , these 
benefits do not translate to daily function10. The goal of cognitive rehabilitation is to enable people with 
cognitive dysfunction to perform and participate in meaningful everyday activities and roles15,26. Clearly, 
cognitive process training falls short of this goal for people with PD, so we should pursue a different 
approach.  
Strategy training interventions may improve daily function in PD. A strategy training  approach to 
cognitive intervention provides ways to maintain task performa nce despi[INVESTIGATOR_599135]. It involves teaching people to use metacognitive, compensatory or adaptive techniques to by[CONTACT_599157] -related goals27. Strategy training is recommended for 
those with mild (vs. more severe) cognitive decline because it requires learning, capi[INVESTIGATOR_599136], and aims to prevent or delay functional decline27,28. Although strategy training does 
not specifically target neurodegeneration or aim to improve cognition per se (which may be unrealistic in the context of neurodegeneration
29), it can facilitate metacognitive control and continued activity 
engagement which may promote neuroplasticity, maintain cognition, or slow cognitive decline30-32. 
Strategy training is a Practice Standard for rehabilitation of mild memory and executive function deficits 
after stroke or brain injury14, and it has a larger impact on daily function than process training in older 
adults with MCI29,33. Because people with PD -MCI have similar cognitive problems and cognitive 
rehabilitation goals as these populations, strategy training may also be beneficial for them34,35; however, 
its application in PD is very limited to date10,13. Our prior work  in prospective memory supports the value 
of strategy training for non -demented people with PD for improv ing objective laboratory performance36 
and mai ntaining reported everyday performance37.  
We adapted the MultiContext (MC) Approach to teach non -demented people with PD strategies in a 
way that promotes generalization to daily function. In contrast to process training, which can produce 
skills that are tightly tied to the training context, strategy training can produ ce flexible skills that people 
can apply across situations if it uses training techniques that foster transfer of learned strategies to real-
world activities and goals38,39. The MC Approach  includes such techniques. First, it is client -directed  in that 
the person identifies his or her own treatment priorities (goals), selects the tr eatment session focus, 
develops strategies to test, and is considered the expert in his or her own situation. Second, it uses a 
metacognitive framework  to promote awareness of deficits and teach people to use structured and 
explicit methods to solve perfor mance problems by [CONTACT_599158], generating and testing 
strategies or solutions, monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness during performance, and making 
connections between activity experiences and contexts  (which facilitates generalization39-42). The 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599137] -directed metacognitive approach is to guide the process of self- awareness, 
strategy gen eration, and generalization. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599138] “tell” the person what to do, but instead 
MC4PD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] 5  
Protocol 201906062   2021.05.18  
 
NIH Protocol Template for  Behavioral and Social Sciences 
Research   8 uses mediation  (e.g. systematic questioning, prompts) to facilitate reflection and discovery. The above 
techniques are rooted in constructivism theories that suggest learning and transfer are enhanced when 
the learner actively engages in the process of discovering, testing, and evaluating solutions to challenging 
experiences43-46. Emerging evidence in older adults27,47,48 and neurological conditions16,49,50 increasingly 
supports the superiority of this type of approach over more directed training approaches. Finally, the MC 
Approach  uses homework with action plans , which are effective tools in promoting behavior change, self -
efficacy and daily function51,52, to support strategy application in everyday life38. Our preliminary study53 
found that the MC Approach  is acceptable, engaging, and may address the functional cognitive problems 
of people with PD.   
Treatment fidelity is critical to complex behavioral interventions. Treatment fidelity —methods used to 
ensure interventions are implemented as intended —is increasingly recognized as essential to behavioral 
intervention development54,55. High treatment fidelity increases the ability to attribute change (or lack 
thereof) in outcomes to the intervention per se (rather than, e.g., implementation failure), facilitates theory testing, improves retention, is associ ated with better treatment outcomes, and enhances 
reproducibility and translation of interventions from research to real- world settings
56. Therefore, in 
accordance with the NIH Behavioral Change Consortium Treatment Fidelity Workgroup guidelines54,57 we 
developed processes to enhance a nd monitor treatment fidelity , and we will assess and optimize their 
effectiv eness in this study (Aim 2) .

Setting Interview  Functional cognition —how cognitive abilities 
enable/disable function in daily activities —is the 
primary target of cognitive rehabilitation and is 
now recognized as an important outcome in PD 
cognitive research62,63. Patient -reported outcomes 
are increasingly used to measure this type of 
construct since it is not directly observable in 
research or clinical settings and because the 
patient’s experience is a key determinant of treatment value
64. In best practice cognitive 
rehabilitation, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599139]

those problems/goals determines treatment 
success. To be consistent with real -world practice

subjective cognitive decline (SCD)68 (as defined by a positive answer to either question: Do you feel like 
your thinking skills or memory are becoming w orse? Do you have problems with your thinking skills or 
memory? ), and can list ≥ 1 daily cognitive challenge they wish to address . Medications should be stable 
for 4 weeks prior with no changes planned during the study.  
Rationale for cognitive criteria for  entry:  We will include people with SCD regardless of whether they 
meet diagnostic criteria for PD -MCI. There is no gold standard assessment of SCD, so we are using a 
common method of ascertainment based on research criteria for SCD68,69. People with SCD are an 
important target for cognitive treatment because SCD may be a more sensitive measure of cognitive 
decline than cognitive tests in high functioning or at -risk individuals68 and, in the absence of objective 
deficits, SCD predicts future development of PD -MCI70,71. Because the MC approach  is client -centered, 
we hypothesize that it can meet the needs of peopl e with SCD with or without objective cognitive 
deficits. Our preliminary study53 supports  this notion, as both kinds of participa nts (using MoCA cutoff 
25/26)65 reported improved functional cognition from the MC approach . To begin to explore this issue 
more thoroughly in the current study, we will recruit people with SCD and then use neuropsychological 
testing to  characterize cognitive status (± PD -MCI) and assess it as a potential effect modifier. This study 
is not powered to detect significant effects of this factor, but our findings will guide sampling, inform 
hypotheses, and provide preliminary data for future trials.  
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Dementia according to MDS criteria72 or MoCA score < 2165, other neurological disorders  (e.g., stroke) , 
brain surgery  (e.g., STN DBS) , history of psychotic disorder or any significant current psychiatric disorder , 
or any condition that would interfere with participation (e.g. non -English speaking ).

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION  DESCRIPTION  
MultiContext Approach (MC):  
This treatment focuses on improving functional performance by [CONTACT_599161] —which can be internal (e.g., self- talk, planning) or external (e.g., checklist, alarm) —to 
circumvent cognitive processing limitations caused by [CONTACT_4002].  It uses a standardized approach across and 
within sessions for all clients while being tailored to each client’s cognitive problems and goals. The first 
two session are OT evaluation sessions designed to (1) provide the OT with a comprehensive 
understanding of the client’s functional cognition, occupational performance and participation, (2 ) begin 
building the client’s awareness of cognitive strengths and limitations and how they may relate to daily function , and (3 ) inform individualized goal s etting and treatment planning.  They involve  an explanation 
of MC’s purpose and process, OT functional cognitive “di agnostic” assessments (the WCPA, SRSI , 
structured treatment activity ), review of  pre-treatment assessment s, collaborative goal setting (BGSI) , and 
assign ment and review of the cognitive log homework (record and reflect on daily cognitive lapses). All 
subsequent treatment sessions consist of a review of prior sessions and learning, homework review, 
treatment activities, homework provision, and s ession recap. Each session’s treatment activities are 
selected collaboratively based on the client’s goals and preferences and the OT’s assessment of the client’s 
cognitive and functional status. They involve the performance of simulated functional activit ies with OT 
mediation and a metacognitive framework to help the client anticipate performance problems, generate 
and use strategies to support performance, evaluate and modify performance and strategy use, and transfer these principles to other activities.  The OT’s expertise in functional cognition, task and 
performance analysis, and task manipulation and grading guides this process. Treatment activities also 
involve in -depth discussion of these issues, including making explicit connections between the simu lated 
functional activities, strategies, and the client’s real- life experiences, to promote generalization of 
learning
40,41. Homework consists of action plans for using the strategies generated and practiced during 
the treatment session in specific everyday life situations. Clients record instances of strategy use (or

Research   13 missed opportunities) along with their evaluation of strate gy effectiveness and potential modifications on 
a structured worksheet, which is reviewed collaboratively in the next session. In this way, homework not 
only supports real -life strategy application and practice, but it also reinforces self- monitoring, self-
evaluation, problem solving, strategy self- generation, and strategy optimization. Treatment progresses 
through three general phases (1: Understand and define problems and goals, 2: Generate, execute, and 
evaluate strategies, 3: Generalize and reinforce st rategy use) and increases in difficulty, but progression 
is flexible depending on the client’s goals and abilities.  
Control:  
This treatment parallels the cognitive process training used in PD to -date but with simulated functional 
tasks (vs. computer or pap er & pencil tasks). It has the same basic protocol as MC, but it is therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -
directed, and the OT does not address strategies, metacognition, g eneralization, or use mediation or 
action plans . Therefore, this is a standard -of-care approach that includes all but the proposed critical 
elements of MC . The OT  reviews pre -treatment cognitive test scores with the client but without discussion 
to build awareness. The OT selects treatment activities based on the client’s cognitive profile and goals 
from a published set of activities designed for use in cognitive interventions73. Graded task practice with 
OT feedback on performance accuracy is used to produce neurocognitive improvement (or possibly 
independent strategy development). The OT assigns practice of specific cognitively challenging everyday 
life activities for homework (but without action plans).  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
Both interventions  consist of 10 1 -1.5 hour sessions over 12 weeks delivered in an individual, face -to-face 
format in participants’ homes and/or communities by [CONTACT_599160][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OTs).  Care 
partners are also invited to participate.  
A complete intervention is defined as completion of [ADDRESS_792610] TRAI NING  AND TRACKING  
 
Training: MC training will consist of a [ADDRESS_792611] requisite 
knowledge in metacognitive strategy training and task -oriented training and clinical experience with PD.  
Supervision: We will audiotape all treatment sessions, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I will review the tapes and meet 
with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599141], correct problems, and discuss issues. Initially, 50% of the tapes 
MC4PD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_457344] [ADDRESS_792612] weekly meetings; this will reduce to 20% review and fewer 
meetings when appropriate56. 
Assessment:  Interventionist fidelity is a primary outcome of this study  (Aim 2a) and thus will be formally 
assessed . See section 8.1.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Participants will be randomized to treatment arm (MC, Control) * stratified by [CONTACT_599162] 
[25/26]65. The study statistician created a randomization process that is implemented through REDCap by 
[CONTACT_81595] (Meghan Campbell, PhD). Immediately after a participant completes Pre assessment, the tester inform s [CONTACT_295324], via email, o f their study ID, sex, and MoCA  score 
(stratification variables). Within [ADDRESS_792613] and Follow -up data, which includes the study coordinator, will remain blind 
to treatment arm throughout the entirety of the study.  They will not know which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599142]. Inadvertent unblinding of t esters will be documented  (yes/no, notes) . 
Most of the outcomes, including the primary efficacy outcome (BGSI, Aim 3), are collected via computer, 
so inadvertent unblinding should not bias the data.  
Personnel responsible for rating the audio files for fidelity (A im 2) will be blind to study purpose. Due to 
the nature of their work, they will likely come to understand that there are two general intervention 
approaches being delivered and which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599143]; however, having no 
knowledge of the study aims and hypotheses and clear criteria for rating should reduce any associated 
biases in their ratings.  
Participants  will be aware that they have been randomly assigned to one of two interventions, but they 
will be given no informat ion on what the other intervention entails, nor will they be informed which is the 
hypothesized “active” (MC) or Control intervention. In the Follow -up assessment, participants will be 
asked if they think they received the active or control intervention (y es/no/I don’t know with an option 
to provide an open -ended response describing why).  
*Randomization ratios over the course of the study due to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599144]:  
• November 2019 -December 2020 = 2:1, MC:Control  
• January 2021 - ~2021 = 1:2, MC:Control  
• ~July 2021 - = 1:1, MC:Control  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPU LATION  ADHERENCE  
Participant engagement in and adherence to the intervention are primary outcomes of this study (Aim 2b) 
and thus will be formally assessed .

6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
There are no medication exclusions for this protocol . Medication  information will be obtained from 
electronic medical records and confirmed  with the participant at the Pre- treatment assessment. Medical 
records will be reviewed after participation to deter mine whether there were any changes over the course 
of the study. If so, they will be documented and potentially accounted for in analyses (exploratory).  
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPUL ATION  DISCONTINUATION  AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTI ON/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPU LATION  
Participants may discontinue the study intervention before receiving 10 treatment sessions for a variety 
of reasons (e.g., adverse events, no longer interested, other obligations taking precedence). Temporary 
discontinuation of the study intervention can a lso be considered; however, this should not last longer 
than 3 weeks unless absolutely necessary (i.e., the COVID -19 situation) . When a participant  permanently 
discontinues from  the study intervention  but not  from the study, remaining study procedures will be 
completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]  (i.e, Post -treatment assessment within [ADDRESS_792614] 
treatment session, and Follow- up assessment 3 months after that) . The reason(s) for discontinuing the 
participant from the intervention  will be docum ented on the Participant Tracking sheet.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study or the study intervention at any time, but 
investigators will seek to minimize participant discontinuation/ withdrawal from the study except for 
safety reasons.  An investigator may discontinue  a participant from  the study for the following reasons : 
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of study data 
would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional treatment that 
would confound the interpretation of the study . 
• The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation . 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be documented on the 
Master File.  Because an aim of this study is to track retention and determine attrition rates to power a 
future full- scale trial, participants who discontinue/withdraw from the  study will not be replaced.

Research   16 • The OT or study coordinator  will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visit,  
counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain 
if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] . These contact [CONTACT_599163].  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. 
[ADDRESS_792616] testing while participants are on their 
regular medication (to prevent motor interference63 and best represent their function in daily life). Testing 
will occur at the same time of day to control for potential effects of dosage timing or wearing off. Follow -
up assessment will occur via web -based or mailed survey.  
Primary outcomes:  
Aim 2  
• Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72191]:  Trained raters who are blind to study purpose and treatment group will use the 
MC Fidelity Tool to perform the following ratings.  Adherence:  Proportion of protocol steps that 
occurred within the session will be rated as present or absent. Proficiency:  Quality of delivery of 
each of MC’s critical treatment components will be rated on a 4 -point scale (0=Did not occur, 
1=Little Evidence/Inadequate, 2=Emerging/Adequate, 3=Proficient; averaged for a competence 
score) with detailed guidelines for each component and anchor.  The raters will rate a random 
sample (30%, n = 180) of MC and Control session audiofiles (evenly distributed across condition, 
OT, treatment session number, and study month).  
• Acceptance:  We will administer the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire  (CSQ -8)76,[ADDRESS_792617] 4 -point response scales (3 -4: positive, 2: 
neutral, 1: negative) and are s ummed for a total score; higher scores indicate higher acceptance.  
• Receipt:  The raters will rate participants’ engagement in treatment sessions with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_599145]  (PRPS)78 from the audiofiles (3 sessions per participant). The 
PRPS is a 6 -point scale (1=None, 6=Excellent) with full descriptions of each anchor. Session scores 
are averaged for a single score, which is reliable and predictive of rehabilitation outcomes78,79.  
• Enactment (i.e, Ad herence):  The raters will code homework completion for each session (0=Did 
not do , 0.5=Partial, 1=Complete). We will sum these scores and divide by [CONTACT_599164] (10) to yield a homework completion rate for each participant.

Research   17 • Functional cognition:  The Bangor Goal -Setting Interview (BGSI)80,[ADDRESS_792618] a semi -structured 
interview to gain an understanding the participant’s functional cognitive performance and 
potential problem areas and goals.  Part of the  participant ’s first homework assignment will be to 
think further about problem areas and functional cognitive goals, and they will be provided with 
a handout and Activity Checklist to guide and d ocument the process . At the second session, the 
OT and participant will review what was discussed in the first session and anything the part icipant 
wishes to add or modify. Then they will identify and set goals for 3 -5 real- life functional cognitive 
problems. They and their informants will rate each of their goals for Attainment, Importance, and 
Readiness to Change on 10 -point scales (e.g., At tainment: 1=Cannot do or am not doing 
successfully, 10=Can do and am doing very successfully) in the second session (Pre) and then again 
at Post and Follow -up. Goal attainment ratings are averaged to yield mean attainment scores81.   
Additional  Measures :  
In addition to the primary measures above, we will collect other data to characterize participants, as 
covariates, or as exploratory/secondary outcome measures of treatment effect ( see Table below). Some 
objective and informant -report measures of functional cognition will be administered as exploratory 
outcomes in this trial to assess their  potential to be co -primary outcomes for the future RCT, thus 
mitigating potential limitations associated with self- report. The rater will retrieve clinical characteristics 
from electronic medical  records and confirm with the participant in the Pre assessm ent.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of the MC approach within an RCT.  
• H1: Study recruitment will be 4 participants/month, retention in both treatment groups will be ≥ 
85%, and ≥ 85% of participants in both groups will complete the intervention in 12 weeks.  
Aim 2: Demonstrate adequate treatment fidelity to  the MC approach.  
• H2a: Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599146] (≥ 80%) and proficiency  (scores ≥ 2/3, 
indicating Adequat e). 
• H2b: MC participants will have good acceptance (CSQ -8 ≥ 24/32, indicating all positive responses), 
receipt (PRPS ≥ 4/6, indicating at least “Good”) and enactment (homework completion ≥ 80%).  
Aim 3: Obtain preliminary estimates of the MC approach’s  effect on patie nt-reported functional 
cognition.   
• H3 (exploratory):  MC participants will report greater improvement in functional cognition than 
Control participants immediately and 3 months after treatment.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
We will enroll 30 participants per group (N = 60). Although not required for an R21 proposal, we provide 
power analyses for our feasibility and fidelity hypotheses (Aims 1 & 2) assuming 15% attrition (see Table). 
We also estimate power for our (exploratory) pre- post comparisons of treatment  effect (Aim 3). Based on 
our preliminary data ( Goal Attainment  Δ M = 2.4, SD = 0.97), with n = [ADDRESS_792619] mean differences in change of 0.85 in Attainment  (2-tailed, α = 0.05, 90% power).  However, we 
want to reiterate that our reason for measuring treatment effect in this study is not to demonstrate 
efficacy but to obtain effect size estimates to power an efficacy trial. Our proposed sample size will provide 
enough information to achieve our aims and is feasible to accomplish in  the timeframe of an R21.  
Confidence bounds around target thresholds assuming 15% attrition 
(for Aim 2) and 95% confidence level.

Population (i.e., all randomized participant s). We will also conduct Per -Protocol analyses on the subset 
considered to have completed the intervention (at least 4 treatment sessions).  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of the MC approach within an RCT.  
• H1: Study recruitment will be 4 participants/month, retention in both treatment groups will be ≥ 
85%, and ≥ 85% of participants in both groups will complete the intervention in 12 weeks.  
We will track and report recruitment, retention, intervention duration, and reasons for non -enrollment 
or attrition throughout the study period. Based on our preliminary study, we anticipate no problems in 
meeting our hypothesized thresholds. We enrolled 3 pa rticipants/month (with only [ADDRESS_792621] 
and without an existing cohort from which to recruit), had 87.5% retention, and 85.7% of participants 
completed the intervention in the allotted timeframe53. With N=60, if we meet our retention and 
completion goals (85%), we can be 95% certain of true rates of at least 73% (see Table  in Section 9.2 ). 
Aim 2: Demonstrate adequate treatment fidelity to the MC approach.  
• H2a:  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599147] (≥ 80%) and proficiency  (scores ≥ 2/3). 
Blinded raters will rate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599148] a random sample (30%, n=180) of MC and 
Control treatment sessions. We will calculate adherence and proficiency  (to MC) for each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; 
adherence ≥ 80% and proficiency  ≥ 2 (out of [ADDRESS_792622] “ Adequate ”) will be benchmarks for  
good treatment integrity.  
• H2b:  MC participants will have good acceptance  (CSQ -8 ≥ 24/32, indicating all positive responses), 
receipt (PRPS ≥ 4/6, indicating at least “Good”) and enactment (homework completion ≥ 80%).  
MC participants will complete the Clie nt Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8) at post -treatment, and 
blinded raters will rate participants’ session participation (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_399466]; PRPS) and homework completion. CSQ -8 scores ≥ 24, PRPS scores ≥ 4, and homework completion rates ≥ 
80% will be benchmarks for good acceptance, receipt, and enactment, respectively.  
For the Aim 2 outcomes, w e will calculate mean scores ± 95% confidence bounds (CBs) and compare them 
to our stated thresholds. To assess treatment differentiation, we will compare Proficiency  scores  for the 
MC and Control sessions using t -tests. We can also categorize participants using cutoffs (e.g., homework: 
<50%=Poor, 50- 79%=Fair, ≥80%= Good) for descriptive purposes and compare the MC and Control groups’ 
scores on outcomes using appropriate non -parametric tests.

Research   20 Aim 3: Obtain preliminary estimates of the MC approach’s effect on patient -reported functional 
cognition.   
• H3 (exploratory):  MC participants will report greater improvement in functional cognition than 
Control participants immediately and  3 months after treatment.  
We will compare treatment effects (Goal Attainment) using mixed model repeated measures ANOVA (2: 
group X 3: time point). We chose this model because we want to use statistical contrasts to compare pre -
post and pre -follow up changes across group. We will evaluate the pattern of correlations within subjects 
and test various correlation structures as appropriate using Akaike’s information criteria and the Schwarz 
Bayesian criteria. However, our purpose is not to demonstrate effi cacy, but rather to obtain effect size 
data to inform sample size calculations for a definitive RCT. To this  end, we will generate mean change 
between the time points with 95% CBs. We will compare these data to the suggested minimally clinically 
important difference (≥ 2 points improvement)[ADDRESS_792623] size values due to uncertainty

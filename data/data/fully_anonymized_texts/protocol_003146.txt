1.  Background and Significance  
 
Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by [CONTACT_812348][INVESTIGATOR_1841], effecting an estimated 45 million worldwide1. The lifetime prevalence rate is estimated 
at 1% for BD in general, with specific prevalence rates of 0.6% for BD type -I, 0.4% for BD type -
II, and 1.4% for subthreshold BD2. BD is among the most impairing psychiatric disorders, typi[INVESTIGATOR_812334]. Furthermore, BD is associated with premature 
mortality due to a suicide rate [ADDRESS_1124790] significant drawbacks due to poor tolerability, including the risk of metabolic 
syndrome, cognitive dulling, sexual dysfunction, and anhedonia.  Consequently, nonadherence to 
medications is common in BD, with a reported rate of approximately 50%6. This nonadherence 
carries a high risk of relapse, recurrence of depression, mania and psychosis, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 
suicide attempt, especially after abrupt discontinuation of medications. Overall, nonadherence 
decreases the likelihood of achieving rem ission and recovery. While medications have been shown 
to reduce impulsivity, with combination antipsychotics and mood stabilizers having a greater effect 
than mood stabilizers alone, on the whole these impulsivity scores continue to be higher than 
healthy  controls7.   
 
There is promise in the use of device -based interventions to control manic symptoms. Prior to the 
advent of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was 
the only −and very effective− intervention for mania, mixed stat es, and delirious mania8. 
Nowadays, the use of ECT for the treatment of manic symptoms is limited by [CONTACT_812349], 
stigma, access, lack of specialists, cost, healthcare inequity, and national laws. Modern 
noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBs) could potentially achieve the same efficacy of ECT in 
controlling manic symptoms, however with better tolerability, lower stigma, and easier access.  
 
Impulsivity, associated with poor decision -making, is a prominent manic symptom, often 
associated with severe functional impairment. Furthermore, as impulsivity remains high in BD 
subjects outside of a manic state, it may represent a core feature or trait of BD. Recent imaging 
studies have shown hyperactivation of ventral striatum and ventromedial PFC when anticipating 
rewarding outcomes in euthymic patients9 as well as striatal activity during anticipation being more 
strongly modulated by [CONTACT_812350]10. 
Accordingly, most treatment studies show reduced impulsivity by [CONTACT_812351] (PFC). Specifically, high -frequency rTMS (excitation) on right dorsolateral PFC 
(dlPFC) decreases hasty, impulsive choices driven by [CONTACT_812352]11-14. Therefore,  it is 
evident  that the  dlPFC plays an essential role in some of the cognitive processes of impulsivity. 
Use of NIBs on dlPFC could reduce impulsivity in patients with bipolar disorder, depression, high 
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 3 of 29 suicidality, and addictions.  Similarly, bilateral, right anodal (excitation) and left cathodal tDCS on 
dlPFC reduces impulsivity14. Therefore, excitation of right dlPFC (R -dlPFC) by [CONTACT_812353] a potential 
mechanism for treatment of manic symptoms such as impulsivity, while preserving physical 
health, individual functioning, and quality of life.   
 
Mainstream NIBs devices, such as rTMS and tDCS, are limited by [CONTACT_812354], which necessitates frequent in -office sessions with specialized staff. Mainstream 
NIBs are therefore not scalable to the large needs of our society. Instead, at -home, self -
administered NIBs could lead to broad access to non -stigmatizing, well -tolerated interventions 
for manic symptoms.  Transcranial photobiomodulation (t -PBM) with near -infrared light (NIR) 
over the forehead is a novel NIBs, which is inexpensive, user -friendly and can be safely 
administered at home without supervision15.   
 
A substantial body of literature proves that t -PBM with NIR penetrates deeply into the cerebral 
cortex, modulates cortical excitability16,17, and improves cerebral perfusion18-20 and oxygenation21. 
Its safety was demonstrated in 1,410 acute stroke patients22,23. t-PBM improves inhibition, 
attention, memory, working memory and learning24-32, with evidence for cognitive benefits in both 
healthy individuals and in neuropsychiatric patients.  t-PBM is ideally suited to excite R -dlPFC  
and to improve inhibition −  similarly to rTMS and tDCS  − with the substantial advantage that 
t-PBM is also suitable for in -home, self-administration.   In the proposed study,  we will test t -
PBM on R -dlPFC  to control impulsivity (improve decision making) in patients with a diagnosis 
of bipolar disorder and currently in the spectrum from euthymic to hypomanic. We will also use 
cerebral blood flow as the most reliable biomarker of target engagement of R -dlPFC.    
 
Mechanistically, t -PBM with NIR (wavelength 800 –1100 nm) is absorbed by [CONTACT_35233] C 
oxidase (CCO) in neuronal mitochondria, leading to an increased synthesis of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), along with photodissociation of nitric oxide (NO) and cerebra l vasodilation 
and subsequent increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF)33. t-PBM increases cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) based on SPECT18,34, Doppler Ultrasound20,21, and fNIRS  reports.  This proposal will use 
the fMRI BOLD signal as the biomarker of CBF change  induced by t -PBM. The BOLD signal 
was previously validated as a marker of target engagement and as a predictor of treatment outcome 
in other NIBs35,36. t-PBM to the R -dlPFC  led to both increase of BOLD signal and to cognitive 
improvement in adults with cognitive deficits37. By [CONTACT_812355] (BOLD), we will test the 
propensity of t -PBM to modulate R -dlPFC in patients with impulsivity due to bipolar disorder.  
 
At MGH,  we are conducting a single -blind, sham -controlled (paired sample) study to test the effect 
of bilateral t -PBM on fMRI BOLD signal (dlPFC) in adults (n=1 5) with major depressive disorder. 
We have demonstrated feasibility for multiple t -PBM sessions per week and for the delivery of t -
PBM within MRI scanner, while recording BOLD signal ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  A collaboration 
between MGH and colleagues in Italy pi[INVESTIGATOR_812335] t -PBM in adults (n=4) with BD38. t-PBM 
was helpful in alleviating BD residuals, including impulsivity and irritability.

Hypothesis : repeated t -PBM sessions on the R -dlPFC  will significantly decrease the total Mood  
Spectrum -Self Report ( MOOD S-SR) score  at day [ADDRESS_1124794] of tPBM on CBF, the study is additionally 
sham -controlled. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, not currently in a 
depressive , manic , or mixed state  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], will undergo one sham and one NIR - t-PBM session 
on day 1 (within MRI scanner), and one daily NIR - t-PBM session from day 2 to 5. On day 5, the 
NIR t -PBM session will also occur in the MR I scanner. The fMRI scan will measure BOLD 
changes during sham t -PBM (day 1) and during NIR t -PBM (day 1 & 5), on R -dlPFC. 
Impulsivity will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] B IS at pre-screen  (for inclusion criteria), baseline, treatment 
day 5 , and the follow -up visit ; and by [CONTACT_812356] s at baseline , after the first NIR t -PBM 
(day 1), after the fifth  NIR t -PBM (day 5), and at the follow -up visit . Other aspects of

Inclusion criteria for this study include:  1) adult s between the ages of 18 and 65, 2) diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder assessed with M.I.N.I. diagnostic interview, 3) currently  experiencing symptoms 
of impulsivity as per BIS total cut-off score equal or greater than 70, 4) if of child -bearing potential 
must agree to use adequate contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, double 
barrier methods, or total abstinence from intercourse) , and 5) vision corrected to normal with 
contacts/ vision does not require glasses or other visual aids . 
 
Exclusion criteria for this study include: 1) currently in depressive , manic, or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ; 2) 
currently psychotic ; 3) judged to be at serious and imminent suicidal risk (C -SSRS≥4 ); 4) currently 
in alcohol or substance use disorder (meeting criteria in the past 3 months  as assessed with M.I.N.I. 
diagnostic interview ); 5) unstable medical conditions ; 6) inability to consent or to complete study 
procedures ; 7) failure to meet standard MRI safety requirements (e.g. claustrophobia, non -
removable pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], implanted medical devices, other non -removable metals) as determined by 
[CONTACT_812357] ; 8) changes in medications or  use of augmentative devices and other 
interventions in the 2 weeks prior to the study ; 9) participation in other clinical research trials that 
may influence  primary outcomes or adherence to the proposed study, as assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_812336]-Is; and 10) current pregnancy.  
 
Source of subjects will include outpatient clinics at MGH and McLean, the Translational and 
Clinical Research Center, and Registries/Patient Databases such as the RPDR and Patient 
Gateway  Announcements and or Invitations . We will recruit primarily through referrals from 
physicians, flyers, online advertisements, and platforms such as Partners Rally and 
ResearchMatch . We will respond to all individuals who express interest in the study, whether it 
is from an online recruitment source or through a referral from outpatient clinics at MGH. 
Clinical research coordinators will primarily handle recruitment and outreach, tho ugh some tasks 
may fall to other members of study staff, like interns. Physicians may send referrals directly to 
[CONTACT_242602], who will forward the information to a CRC to make contact.  
 
We will not discriminate against any group of persons. Based upon the composition of the 
patient population at MGH and [LOCATION_011], we anticipate that at least 50% of the participants will be 
women. The percentage of minority participants is expected to be at least 20%, consistent with 
previous studies in our lab a nd at MGH. We expect a roughly equal distribution across sex and 
ethnicity, as has been previously demonstrated with BD, with the potential for slightly more 
diagnoses of B D type-I among men and BD type-II among women.  Fetuses, children, prisoners, 
and institutionalized individuals will not be recruited, because they are beyond the scope of the 
objectives. We will review recruitment regularly at team meetings to track progress and adjust 
recruitment strategies as needed.  
 
 
We are only enrolling English -speaking participants in this study since the measures used are 
developed and validated in the English language and because non -English speaking subjects may 
not be able to understand study procedures, which could undermine th e validity of the results.

patients might be offe red the participation in this study, the PI, [CONTACT_242602], or other licensed co -
Is will review the consent and co -sign the consent for any study subjects referred to the study by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ellard. This measure will be implemented to prevent any type of coercion.  
 
All subjects participating in the study will receive the same standard of care as those who are not. 
There are additional study procedures that subjects will undergo, though this should have little to 
no impact on clinical care. Further, study participatio n will not impact access to standard of care, 
meaning that participating in the study will not prohibit subjects from receiving standard 
treatments for bipolar disorder . 
 
t-PBM is not considered standard of care and is therefore an alternative treatment for bipolar 
disorder . Standard of care for bipolar disorder  includes, but is not limited to,  psychotherapy, 
medications (such as mood stabilizers, anti -depressants, or anti -psychotics), or device -based 
treatments (such as ECT) . Information on standard of care for bipolar disorder will be provided 
to all subjects. Subjects may continue with their current treatment regimen throughout the study . 
 
The MGH Brain Photobiomodulation Clinic (Director: Paolo Cassano, MD PhD) has historically 
served as a resource for subjects enrolled in t -PBM clinical trials who then wish to continue with 
specialized supervision. Study staff will offer access to the clin ic to all subjects upon study 
completion.  
 
Participants will be compensated $125 for each of the following visits: Baseline, Treatment 1, 
Treatment 5, and Follow Up. For each of these visits, the participant receives $25 for attending 
the appointment, $[ADDRESS_1124797] gambling task, and $50 for the completion of the 
second gambling task. Participants who complete all portions of the study will receive a total of 
$500.  Subjects who end study procedures prematurely will be compensated for all completed 
study procedures. Subjects will be  mailed a check at the conclusion of their study participation.

Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 7 of 29 While participants will always receive the full $50 for completing each gambling task, they will 
be told that their real -world earnings are based on their performance on the gambling task. They 
will be told that the maximum amount of real-world money that the y can earn  in each task is 
$50. Participants will be told that the  better they do on the task, the closer they will get to earning 
the full $50, and that their total earnings will be revealed at the final study visit . The purpose of 
these gambling tasks is to investigate various aspects of behavior, such as impulsivity and 
decision -making. In order for these tasks to effectively gather accurate data on these behaviors, it 
is crucial that the participants believe that the amount of money they earn is based on th eir 
decisions within the tas k. Upon completion of all study procedures, participants will be informed 
that they will receive the full $[ADDRESS_1124798] made with potential research subjects will include only the minimum PHI (name

unencrypted emails or will send detailed study and PHI information using the “Send Secure” 
function.  Emails not sent using “Send Secure” to participants will contain and automatic email 
signature [CONTACT_812368]. If participants are uncomfortable 
receiving information unencrypted,  they should alert study staff who will then proceed to 
communicate securely with the participant.  If an individual contacts the study staff by [CONTACT_812358], 
it is implied that email communications are acceptable. Study staff will ver ify that individuals 
are comfortable  with unencrypted emails and obtain written or verbal consent to proceed with

Pre-Screen   
  
Prior to enrolling in the study, interested individuals will be  contact[CONTACT_812359] a 
pre-screening , which can be completed over the phone or via a REDCap link . The trained study 
staff will review study details and procedures and will ask  a series of questions and administer 
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 8 of 29 two questionnaires (the ASRM and the PHQ -9) to assess eligibility for the study.  Additionally, 
study staff will either administer the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)  over the phone or send 
interested individuals the REDCap survey link to assess if their impulsivity levels meet our 
inclusion criteria.  Prior to collecting any information, individuals will be asked to provide verbal 
authorization to write down their responses and will be given the option to not answer questions 
if they do not wish to do so.  Individuals will also be given the opportunity to provide verbal 
consent regarding unencrypted emails.  If the individual is eligible for the study, they will be 
invited to a screening visit. If the individual is not eligible or decides not to enroll, any 
information collected during the phone call will be destroyed to protect privacy. If an individual 
is eligible for the study and enrolls, the information collected during the pre-screening phase  will 
be added to their research file.  Individuals will be sent  a copy of the consent form for their 
review via email and the screening visit will be scheduled.  Individuals will be reminded not to 
discuss medical information  through unencrypted emails.  Individuals will be instructed not to 
sign the consent form until  after they’ve discussed it with the clinician during the screening visit.  
  
Screening   
  
Subjects will review  the consent form  with the study clinician  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -I; MDs)  and be given 
the opportunity to ask questions.  Consent will be obtained by a licensed physician investigator . If 
the screening visit is conducted remotely  using Zoom, the consent form will be collected 
electronically using  REDCap  following the  MGH  eConsent  Template. Subjects will then receive 
an electronic copy of the consent form through their provided email which they can download  
and keep for their records . This is an automatic function of REDCap. If the sc reening visit is 
conducted in -person, the consent form may be collected on REDCap or on paper.  If the consent 
form is signed on paper, subjects will receive a paper copy of the consent.  Subjects will be 
considered enrolled in the study once they sign the consent form.  
  
Subjects will be asked a series of question naires  to assess eligibility for the study , including the 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI),  and the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale  (C-SSRS ). Demographic information , concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , prior 
treatment history, and medical history  will be collected. Subjects will complete an MRI 
Screening Form  and the MOODS -SR Lifetime . Screening will also include a dipstick toxicology 
urinalysis and, if applicable, a dipstick pregnancy test. If the subject is eligible, they will be 
invited to continue to the baseline visit. If not eligible, the subject will not be invited 
to continue  with the study.   
  
Baseline Visit  
 
Adverse events,  as well as  concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], will be collected. Participants 
will complete the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the BIS, the BRIEF -A, the I -7, the 
CAST -IRR, and the SAFTEE. A licensed clinician will administer the C -SSRS and the CGI -S. 
Skin color will be recorded using the NIS -SCS.  Participants will complete two computerized 
gambling tasks: The I owa gambling task  and the Delgado gambling task . The order of 
administration of the gambling tasks will be randomized.  This appointment will last 
approximately [ADDRESS_1124799]

treatment administration. If necessary, this window can be extended so that these three treatment 
visits occur within ten days of the Baseline/Treatment 1 visit  (in this case, the timing of follow 
up visits will be adjusted accordingly) . Adverse events and concomitant medications and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812337]. Participants will complete the TSRQ  and 
CAST -IRR after treatment administration. Study staff will complete an intervention tracking 
form  for each study visit.  
  
Treatment 5  
  
Treatment 5 should ideally occur the day after Treatment 4. If necessary, this window can be 
extended so that this visit occurs within ten days of the Treatment 1 visit  (in this case, the timing 
of follow up visits will be adjusted accordingly) . Adverse events, concomitant medications and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and vitals will be assessed and recorded.  The MRI Safety Checklist will be completed 
and signed before the MRI. Participants will complete the MOODS -SR, the BIS, the BRIEF -A, 
and the I -7.  
 
Participants will undergo an MRI Scan. A structural scan and a pre -stimulation resting state 
functional scan will be collected first.  Active t -PBM will be administered immediately after the 
resting -state scan, followed by a post -stimulation resting state functional scan.  Participants will 
then complete the Delgado  gambling task. A functional sequence will be collected during the 
gambling task administration. The MRI will last approximately [ADDRESS_1124801] -IRR,  the TSRQ, and the Iowa gambling task  
after the MRI/t -PBM session. Study staff will complete an intervention tracking form.

after the final treatment session . Adverse events and concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812338] . The clinician will administer the C -SSRS and the CGI -S/I. The 
clinician may use the PHQ -9 and/or ASRM to guide their call with the study participant, though 
these scales do not need to be completed in full. The purpose of this call is to check in on the 
general safety and well -being of the participant.  
 
Follow Up Visit   
  
The follow up visit  takes place  approximately  one week after the final treatment session.  This 
visit will be completed in person. Adverse events and concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812339]. Participants will complete the MOODS -SR, the BIS, the BRIEF -

administration of the gambling tasks will be randomized. A licensed clinician will administer the 
C-SSRS and the CGI -S/I.  
 
Communication with participants throughout the study:  
Participants who consent to text messaging , in addition to standard email and phone 
communication,  will receive a text message reminder before every scheduled visit. Text 
messages will be sent via Updox Secure Text Messaging  and SMS . Updox is an online 
messaging service that specializes in secure healthcare communication.  
 
Participants who consent to text messaging will receive a text message the day before each 
scheduled study visit. This message will be sent as a SMS text message letting the participant 
know they have received a secure message from the MGH Photobiomodulation Lab with a link 
to access the message. The first message received will instruct them to enter in their f ull name 
[CONTACT_812369] a PIN to access the message. Each time a message is received they must enter their 
unique PIN number to access the message. Study  staff do not have access to anyone’s personal 
PIN numbers. Individuals are able to respond back to the message they receive with questions  or 
for more information if necessary .   
 
  
tPBM  Administration   
  
The t -PBM -NIR device used in the study is the  Litecure’s LightForce® EXPi  [INVESTIGATOR_812340], Transcranial PhotoBioModulation -1000 (tPBM -2.0). The tPBM -2.0 is an 
investigational device based on LiteCure’s LightForce® EXPi [INVESTIGATOR_812341]. For the investigational study, the EXPi [CONTACT_286420]’s beam delivery - Empower TM, is 
modified to non -invasively deliver Near -Infrared Radiation (NIR) to subjects diagnosed with 
Bipolar Disorder. The modified system is also configured to provide sham (placebo) treatment.

The tPBM -2.0 is considered a Class II medical device per 21 CFR 890.5500 and 878.4810 and is 
manufactured per 21 CFR 820. It utilizes a laser diode source with a maximum continuous (CW) 
output of ≤30 Watts at a wavelength of 808 nanometers (nm) and nominal  beam diameter of 
40mm at the outside aperture.  
 
The tPBM -2.0 consists of a therapeutic laser console (that produces laser energy as NIR), and an 
optical delivery system consisting of a flexible, double -sheathed optical fiber connected to a 
custom helmet (cap). The cap is configured to deliver NIR light to EEG site F4 (or in close 
proximity if covered by [CONTACT_370197]), covering a total surface treatment area of approximately 24 cm2 
[12 cm2 x 2]. It also includes laser safety eye ware with an optical density rating >5.0 at 808 nm.  
 
The therapeutic laser console is the only component of the device that is not MRI compatible. It 
will be stored in an equipment room located in Zone 2 (area with no detectable magnetic field 
but to which access is restricted due to scanner proximity). An M RI-compatible optical fiber will 
connect the laser console to the MRI -compatible cap. The safety eye wear is also MRI 
compatible.   
 
Aside from the cap, the tPBM -2.0 is the same device as LiteCure’s EXPi [CONTACT_286420] – Model LTS -
2500, which is marketed under FDA’s 510(K) # K107637.

Version 2021.[ADDRESS_1124803]'s head. The cap is provided by [CONTACT_812360] (LiteCure) and is very similar to those used in our previous t -PBM studies. The 
laser probe (attached to the cap) will be connected to the laser console with a multimode MR -
compatible optical fiber. The distal end of the optical fiber is fitted with ceramic ferrules, which 
will be affixed to the cap. The cap (headgear ) contains clamps which secure the ferrules. The cap 
will be used in place of the wand. The cap is the only modification of the device delivery system, 
and it was required in order to do the t -PBM inside the MRI scanner. The cap is a component of 
the tPBM -2.0 device; it is not a separate device. The cap is used to apply NIR to EEG site F4.  
  
The t -PBM -2.0 is a nonsignificant risk device because it:  
 
1. Is NOT intended as an implant and DOES NOT present a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety, or welfare of a subject;   
2. Is NOT purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and 
DOES NOT present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;   
3. Is NOT for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and DOES NOT present a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or   
4. DOES NOT otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject.   
 
Further,  
 
• The t -PBM -2.0 maximum dose administered in this study does not exceed the Maximum 
Permissible Exposure (MPE) for skin – Center for Devices and Radiological Health 
(CDRH), 21CFR1040.10 and 21CFR1040.11;   
• The t -PBM -2.0 is substantially equivalent to the OmniLux New U which the FDA has 
already categorized as a non -significant risk device;     
• Currently FDA -cleared lasers are typi[INVESTIGATOR_125984] -the-counter and are considered 
safe to use without professional supervision.   
• The MGB IRB determined a similar PBM device as NSR for the ELATED -3 study (IRB 
Protocol Number 2016P001490). The ELATED -3 device operated at significantly higher 
irradiances than the current PBM device. The FDA determined that an IDE was not 
required for t he ELATED -3 device.  
• The current PBM device was deemed to be NSR by [CONTACT_812361] . 
 
The tPBM -2.0 device is currently being used in two other approved studies at MGH: 
Transcranial Photobiomodulation for Alzheimer’s Disease (Protocol #2020p003051) and 
Transcranial Near Infrared Radiation and Cerebral Blood Flow in Depression (Protocol

Assessments   
 
Adverse Events Form  
 
The Adverse Events Form captures any adverse event (serious or otherwise) that the subject 
experiences while participating in the study. Events may occur during or outside of study 
procedures.  
 
Altman Self -Rating Mania Scale ( ASRM ) 
 
The ASRM is a 5 -item self -rated mania scale designed to assess the presence and/or severity of 
manic symptoms over the past 7 days.  This scale will be administered as part of the pre -
screening phase.  
 
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS )39 
 
The BIS is a 30 -item measure of cognitive and motor impulsivity rated on a 4 -point Likert scale 
(1 = rarely/never to 4 = almost always/always). It captures three factors: Motor Impulsiveness, 
Non-Planning Impulsiveness, and Attentional Impulsiveness. The BIS has demonstrated high 
internal consistency and validity across populations.  
 
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function  – Adult Version  (BRIEF -A)40 
 
The BRIEF -A is a 75 -item self -report scale to assess executive function. It consists of two 
indices: The Behavioral Regulation Index and the Metacognitive Index. T he Behavioral 
Regulation Index measures inhibition, set shifting, control , and attention monitoring. The 
Metacognitive Index measures ability to initiate tasks, working memory, planning/organization 
ability, task monitoring, and organization. The BRIEF -A has demonstrated good internal 
consistency and validity across several clinical populations and non -clinical controls.  
 
Concise Associated Symptom Tracking Irritability Scale (CAST -IRR)  
 
This instrument is a f ive item self -report that assesses irritability  over the last 24 hours . 
 
Clinical Global Impressions – Severity and Improvement (CGI -S, CGI -I)  
 
These two instruments are scored [ADDRESS_1124808]'s 
overall clinical status. They measure, based on history and scores on other instruments: 
(a) severity of impairment  (CGI -S) and (b) clinical improvement (CGI -I).  
 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS ) 41 
 
An instrument endorsed by [CONTACT_242576]. This instrument systematically tracks 
suicidal ideation and behavior (e.g., suicide attempts, wish to die, thoughts of suicide, plan , and 
intent).

Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812343], as well as other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and will be completed at 
every study visit, including the screening visit, as a safety -monitoring tool.  
 
Iowa Gambling Task  
 
In this computerized task,  participants play a game of chance in which they can win or lose fake 
money. Participants are presented with four cards and are asked to choose one. Their choice 
results in a gain or loss. Participants are given feedback on each choice. This task is designed to 
measure impulsivity.  
 
Delgado Gambling Task (IGT)  
 
In this computerized task , participants play a game of chance in which they can win or lose fake 
money.  Participants are given a target number. They are then presented with a sequence of cards. 
Before each card is presented, participants are asked to guess whether the number on the next 
card will be higher or lower than the target number. They are then given feedback on their 
choice. This task is designed to measure reward -processing.  
 
I-7: Impulsiveness and Venturesomeness Questionnaire  
 
The I -7 is a self-report scale of  54 items and three subscales. Of the 54 items, 19 measure 
Impulsiveness, 16 measure Venturesomeness, and 19 measure Empathy. Answers are marked as 
“Yes” or “No.”  
 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Intervie w (M.I.N.I)42 
 
The M.I.N.I. is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by [CONTACT_812362], for DSM and ICD psychiatric disorders. With an 
administration time of approximately 15 minutes, it is designed to me et the need for a short but 
accurate structured psychiatric interview for clinical trials. According to researchers at the 
National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Division of Clinical and Treatment Research, the 
M.I.N.I. is a fully validated and more time-efficient alternative to the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID).  For the purposes of this study, we will only use modules 
related to mood, psychosis, and substance abuse.  
 
MOODS -SR – Last Week  & Lifetime  
 
This 161 -item self -report scale assesses manic -depressive symptoms. Participants are asked to 
answer “Yes” or “No” to each question. Subdomains measure Moods, Energy, Cognition, and 
Rhythmicity. Time frame is either lifetime or the last week, depending on scale us ed.

Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) 
 
This nine -item self -report measure assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms 
over the past 14 days. This scale will be administered as part of the pre -screening phase.  
   
Perceived Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ)  
 
The PBQ is a self -report questionnaire to determine the degree to which the participant believes 
they are receiving active treatment or sham.  
 
Prior Treatment Log  
 
This form captures information regarding prior treatments for bipolar disorder or other mental 
health concerns.  
 
Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE )44 
 
The SAFTEE is a commonly used instrument originally developed by [CONTACT_242577] a 
self-report instrument. The version of the scale that we plan to use is the same used by [CONTACT_15747] -
center, NIMH -sponsored CO -MED trial, and it examines in a systematic  fashion all possible 
treatment -emergent side effects and probes specific adverse symptoms, including suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors, and self -injurious behavior.  
 
t-PBM Self -Report Questionnaire (TSRQ)  
 
An open -ended questionnaire focusing on potential inconveniences and discomforts from the t -
PBM treatment.

Version 2021.[ADDRESS_1124811] of a single t -PBM session on cerebral blood flow (CBF), 
while irradiating R -dlPFC (SA1), in subjects with impulsivity due to BD and to test the effect of 
repeated t -PBM sessions on CBF (SA2).  
 
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
 
Screening and Evaluation: The risks  and discomforts of the screening evaluations  include 
discomfort or distress responding to potentially sensitive questions regarding mental illness and 
drug use.  Research interviews are interrupted if individuals become distressed or object to 
answering questions.  
 
Delay in Initiation of New, or Changes in Ongoing, Bipolar Treatment:  While this study is not 
testing t -PBM as a treatment for bipolar disorder, it is possible that participants will experience 
improvements to their symptoms while undergoing t -PBM. Any delay in receiving t -PBM (while 
screening procedures are completed) migh t be considered as a delay in treatment from a patient 
perspective. We will emphasize that the study is not geared to test a treatment but instead the 
impact of t-PBM on cerebral blood flow.  
 
Further, study participation requires stable  BD treatment  during and two -weeks prior to 
enrollment.  Subjects  should not change medications, treatm ents, or therapeutic interventions two 
weeks prior to study enrollment or during study participation as to avoid interference with t -PBM 
treatment. However, without adjustment of medication it is possible that participants’ symptoms 
may worsen while participating in the study.  This may include  increased disturbances in mood, 
anxiety, sleep, appetite, energy , or cognition.  This could result in work loss, loss of social 
function, and possibly increased risk of suicide.  Therefore, there is some risk to halting 
medication changes while in the study.  However, the risk will be minimized as there are several 
safety precautions in place and participants will have frequent contact [CONTACT_370178]. The 
clinical monitoring in this study exceeds that of standard care for BD. The potential benefits of 
improving impulsivity and cognition offset the risk of worsening BD symptoms.  
 
Risks of Clinical Decompensation:  If a patient has worsened to such a degree that further 
participation would put them  at risk, then they will be discontinued from the study. In such cases, 
the patient is immediately transferred to standard clinical treatment and exited from the research. 
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_1124812] Operating Plan (SOP): If a subject spontaneously expresses suicidal 
ideatio n and the thoughts are passive, vague, or infrequent, the study team will respond with 
close monitoring of the subject. This may include phone calls, video calls, or in -person check -ins 
between  the study clinician and the subject. If the suicidal ideation includes more specific 
thoughts, intent, and/or plans, if the subject responds “Yes” to questions [ADDRESS_1124813] answers 1, 2, or 3  to Question 9 of the PHQ -9, then they will be proactively 
discontinued from the study and referred to adequate care.  
 
Risks associated with study tasks:  Performing tasks  can result in frustration related to difficulty 
with performance, or boredom during longer sittings. Participants may refuse to answer 
questions that make them uncomfortable.  
 
Risks of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRIs use powerful magnets to make images.  There are 
no known radiation risks associated with MRI.  However, individuals with metal implants, such 
as surgical clips or pacemakers, should not have an MRI. All credit cards and other items with 
magnetic strips should also be kept out of the MRI room.  People who feel uncomfortable in 
confined spaces (claustrophobia) may feel uncomfortable in the narrow tube.  The MRI makes 
loud banging noises as it takes images.  Earplugs can be  used to reduce the noises.  The MRI can 
be stopped at any time at subject’s request. If the study subject is or suspects they are pregnant, 
they should not participate in this study. Study staff will assess chance of pregnancy . If there is 
any uncertainty, a study physician can recommend a pregnancy test. The MRI has the potential, 
during normal routine use, to cause localized warming of participant’s skin and of the underlying 
tissues. The participant will be instructed to immed iately inform study staff if  they experience 
discomfort due to warming and the procedure will be stopped.    
  
Some people experience dizziness or rarely nausea when going into an MRI scanner and these 
sensations may be more common in scans with higher magnetic fields. In most cases, these 
symptoms only last a short time. However, some people may experience them throughout the 
scan and/or continue to experience them for a short period of time after (generally, less than half 
an hour). No case of permanent problems is known.  
 
Risks of tPBM: The study laser device emits light with a longer wavelength than the human eye 
can see. The staff will be provided training on basic safety procedures relative to the use of the 
device. The staff administering the t -PBM will be careful not to operate the l aser unless it is in 
direct contact [CONTACT_1155]’s skin. Protective eyewear is required since the device is a laser. 
Failure of laser device, resulting in the cessation of investigative therapy can cause no adverse 
event to our knowledge . Delivery of the infrared laser energy to an inappropriate site, such as 
directly over the open eye, would pose risk to the subject, such as blindness. Based on previous 
observations with similar laser devices, application of the laser may result in mild thermal 
sensation of warmth during use. The temperature of the skin is however kept well below the 
level for thermal damage. Based on human clinical trial experience to date and on sale of t -PBM 
devices for their intended use (e.g.  Omnilux  New -U), each adv erse event listed below has been 
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board

Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 22 of 29 reported by [CONTACT_21316] 0.1% of all subjects and users: erythema, pain, discomfort, warmth, 
headache , or other reactions at the application site. In our research experience, t -PBM devices 
could produce insomnia, irritability , and fleeting illusions.  The modality of administration for t -
PBM with the study laser device is analogous to the protocols used in our feasibility studies. The 
dose of light delivered by [CONTACT_812363] t -PBM.  No serio us adverse events occurred during our feasibility trials.       
 
8. Benefits  
 
The effects of the current proposal on impulsivity in individuals with bipolar disorder  are yet 
unknown. It is possible that subjects may experience improvements in impulsivity , cognition,  or 
other symptoms of bipolar disorder . Participant s in this study will improve our understanding of 
the pathology underlying bipolar disorder  and their participation may lead to the development of 
novel therapeutics.  
 
 
9. Statistical Analysis  
 
Preprocessing of MRI and fMRI data will be performed  with the FreeSurfer software package, 
scripted in Bash. Slice -time correction, motion -correction, and co -registration of functional 
BOLD scans,  Time of Repetition  (TR), and participant will then be performed. BOLD signals 
will then be smoothed to a full -width half maximum (FWHM) of 3mm and z -scored at every 
voxel.  
 
t-PBM related increase of BOLD percent signal change (PSC) averaged across all ROI voxels 
will be assessed during the first scanning session where the participant receives both sham and 
NIR over the R -dlPFC. PSC of t -PBM related increase in BOLD both during and after 
stimulation will be the dependent variable with the independent variable being the condition of t -
PBM during the first session (sham vs. NIR).  
 
BOLD signal will again be assessed during the 5th NIR session as a PSC across all ROI voxels in 
comparison with the BOLD PSC from the first NIR session  to observe any BOLD changes after 
5 NIR treatment sessions. The dependent variable will the BOLD signal and the independent 
variable will be the timepoint: day 1 vs. after 5 sessions (day 5).  
 
For both gambling tasks, the  gambling task net gain score  will be analyzed for changes from 
baseline to after treatment on day 1, baseline vs day 5, and baseline vs follow up.  The BI S, 
BRIEF -A, and I -7 will be analyzed for changes from baseline to  day 5  and follow up . Here, the 
dependent variable will be the gambling task s’ net gain s cores, BIS, BRIEF -A, and I -7 total 
score. The independent variable is the timepoint baseline vs. day 5  (for the gambling task s) and 
follow up. The MOOD -SR will also be analyzed for a decrease in impulsivity  at each timepoint 
of baseline vs. day [ADDRESS_1124814]

of BD. These additional analyses will also be helpful in assessing the  initial  safety profile of t -
PBM in this psychiatric population.  
 
Power and Detectable Effects:  The study is powered (G*Power 80%) to answer Aim #[ADDRESS_1124816] size (Cohen’s d≥0.5), based on a Wilcoxon signed -rank test (matched pairs; one -
tailed; alpha=0.05). Dmochowski et al. demonstrated a BOLD increase as high as 31% (dlPFC) 
within a single t -PBM session and in healthy subjects (pre - and post -t-PBM; Cohen’s d=0.374). 
In our current design, we will compare NIR versus sham (also within a t -PBM session) in [ADDRESS_1124817] ’s name [CONTACT_812370]. Documents will be stored separately from 
other materials in a locked filing cabinet that is only accessible by [CONTACT_464]. Subjects may 
request that their data be withdrawn by [CONTACT_55175]. Cassano (contact [CONTACT_812364]). Experienced, doctoral -level clinicians will be available to participants by 
[CONTACT_648], or in -person if necessary, to discuss any concerns throughout the study. This will be 
clearly communicated orally and in writing to subjects.  
 
The data gathered from the project will include imaging and treatment data. Information relating 
to the data derived from this study will be made available to Partners IRB. The information 
collected in the study will be used only for research purposes. The re are no plans to share any of 
the collected data with anyone outside of the immediate study staff.

including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the 
definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E -6 
Guidelines for Good Clinical  Practice).   
 
A serious adverse event means any event temporally associated with the subject’s participation 
in research that meets any of the following criteria:  
• results in death.   
• is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred ). 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].   
• results in a persistent or significant disability/ incapacity.   
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse).

orally and in writing to subjects.  
 
All monitoring and quality assurance procedures will be in accordance with the MGH sub -
committee on human studies. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9411], maintenance, and analysis of the 
data. Research affairs will be contact[CONTACT_812366] . If an unexpected adverse event or serious adverse event does 
occur, the investigator will consider whether corrective actions should be made to study 
procedures in order to protect the safety and welfare of study subjects. If any changes are made 
the Protocol and Informed Consent Form will be updated and these edits will be submitted as an 
Amendment to the IRB .  
 
If a subject’s clinical condition deteriorates substantially by [CONTACT_6270] -report  and clinician assessment , 
the subject will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects may also be withdrawn if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812345] a substantial risk to the participant or if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812346] a higher level of care 
is needed.  
 
Procedures used in this study are consistent with safe and ethical research practices and do not 
unnecessarily expose subjects to risk. Adverse events are expected  to be infrequent  given the 
excellent safety profile of t -PBM, but should they arise, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812347]. Moreover, study staff and subjects may report concerns directly to the IRB.  
 
Every effort will be made to enhance the comfort of subjects while throughout the study 
procedures. Subjects will be informed that they can stop any study procedure at any time if 
needed.

Extended Access:  For subjects continu inginto the Extended Access period of the trial, [COMPANY_013] w ill 
provide venetoclax until [ADDRESS_1169339]: Venetoclax
Dose s: Single daily doses QD starting with 20 mg; dose increment s will 
proceed w eekly →50 mg → 100 mg →200 mg →400 mg as tolerated .  
Expansion Cohort subjects with bulky disease who are non -responders 
at the Week 12 Disease Assessment may be permitted to escalate 
venetoclax to 600mg dose.
Mode of Adm inistration: Oral
Duration of Treatm ent:  Subjects may continue receiving study drug for up to [ADDRESS_1169340] discontinuation.  The anticipated median 
treatment duration is ≥ 24 months.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], based on laboratory results, physical examinations, 
CT/MRI scans and bone marrow  examinations, using the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for 
Tumor Response.  An Independent Review Committee (IRC) w ill eval uate disease progression and 
response based on overall response rate, duration of response, time to progression and progression free 
survival. Subject treatment management will be based on review by [CONTACT_94561]/or site 
staff.
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory testing, 
and PET/CT scan (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated).
During the study, subjects will be assessed at each visit by a physical examination and laboratory testing.  
Clinical Disease Assessments will take place at Screening (baseline), on Week 5 Day 1 (or Day 1 of 
initiation of 400 mg of venetoclax) Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, Week 36 and then every 
12weeks thereafter until disease progression, death, discontin uation from the study or study completion.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Radiographic scans will be performed in addition as described below :
For subjects enrolled under Arm A and Arm B, a CT/MRI scan must be performed at Screening, 
Week 8, Week [ADDRESS_1169341] 's Final Visit –CT scan is not needed for subjects continuing in the Extended Access period of the 
trial.  For subjects enrolled under the Ex pansion Cohort, a CT/MRI scan must be performed at 
Screening, Week 12, Week [ADDRESS_1169342] 's Final Visit – CT scan is not needed for subjects 
continuing in the Extended Access period of the trial.  If a subject has study drug interrupted for more 
than 3 days (i.e., adverse event), the site must contact [CONTACT_841725]' s visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case by [CONTACT_413]. Subjects 
should have the same method of imaging performed thro ughout the study for consistency.  For 
determination of CR, both the CT/MRI and bone marrow  are required to be free of disease.  If a subject 
exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, 
spleen o r lymph nodes on physical exam and or changes in the peripheral blood count), a CT/MRI scan 
and/or bone marrow must be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Confirmation of CR by [CONTACT_841726]: 
Once CR is determined by [CONTACT_298826], a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_841671].  If the marrow  is hypocellular, a repeat examination should be performed 
after [ADDRESS_1169343] will be performed as described below :
A peripheral blood specimen will be collected at Screening from all subjects to determine individual 
disease characteristics, and follow  up samples will be collected at Week 24 and after a confirmed 
CR/CRi/PR for analysis of MRD levels.  MRD will be assessed using recommended methodologies 
(flow  cytometry, PCR and/or sequencing).  MRD negativity w ill be defined as the presence of less than 
one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4) in either peripheral blood and/or bone marrow .
Pharm acokinetic:
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax at designated time points throughout the study.  
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the apparent clearance (CL/F) a nd the apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F), may be determined using a population PK approach.  Additional 
parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Exploratory Biom arkers:
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and respo nse may be evaluated in this study with the goal of 
defining the relationship between various disease markers and disease status that may predict the 
subject 's response to therapy.  Assays to determine Bcl -2 gene amplifications and translocations, 
modifica tions of TP53 and NOTCH 1 and genomic profile for mutations before and after treatment may 
be performed.  In addition, mutational analysis of genes that may be associated w ith resistance and 
response to ibrutinib and B -cell receptor targeted agents includi ng but not limited to mutations of BTK 
(C481S), PLC gamma and other genes linked to B -cell receptor activation may also be evaluated.  If 
necessary, aliquots from PK samples will be utilized for pharmacodynamics analyses.  Exploratory 
research analyses may not be included in the clinical study report.
Pharm acogenetic:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject 's response to venetoclax.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Safety:
Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, and laboratory assessments 
will be evaluated.  Guidelines for the management for TLS are provided.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The follow ing efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  Overall Response Rate (ORR), Duration of 
Response (DOR), Time to Progression (TTP), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) 
and Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity rate.
Overall Response Rate
The proportion of subjects w ith overall response (per the investigator a ssessment) will be calculated for 
all subjects based on IWCLL NCI -CWG criteria.  In addition, a ninety -five percent (95%) confidence 
interval based on binomial distribution will be constructed for the calculated ORR.
Duration of Response
Duration of respon se will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response per 
investigator assessment to the earliest recurrence or PD per investigator assessment.  If a subject is still 
responding then the subject 's data w ill be censored at the date of the subject 's last available clinical 
disease assessment.  For subjects who never experienced response, the subject' s data will be censored on 
the date of enrollment.  Duration of response will be analyzed by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier methodology using data 
for all enroll ed subjects.  Median duration of response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.
Time to Progression
Time to progression will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose (date of enrollment 
if not dosed) to the date of earliest disease progression (per the investigator assessment).  All disease 
progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as taking study 
drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression, 
then the data will be censored at the date of the last available disease assessment.  TTP will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier methodology using data for all enrolled subjects.  Median time TTP will be calc ulated 
and 95% confidence interval for median time TTP w ill be presented.
Progression -Free Survival
Progression -Free Survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of 
earliest disease progression (per the investigato r assessment) or death.  All disease progression will be 
included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject w as taking study drug or had 
previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression or death, the n 
the data will be censored at the date of the last disease assessment.  PFS will be analyzed by [CONTACT_841727].  Median PFS time will be calculated and 95% 
confidence interval for median PFS time will be present ed.
Overall Survival
Overall survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death for 
all dosed subjects.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study visit 
or the last known date to be alive, whichever is later.  OS will be analyzed by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier 
methodology using data from all dosed subjects.  Median time survival will be calculated and 95% 
confidence interval for the median time survival will be presented.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Additional Exploratory Efficacy Analyses
Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Status
MRD negativity will be defined as less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes (or below  10–4) on 
peripheral blo od and/or bone marrow  based flow  cytometry and/or nucleic acid based methods.  Rate of 
MRD status will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have MRD negativity status.  
Ninety -five percent (95%) confidence intervals based on the binomial distributi on will be provided.
Time to Next Anti -CLL Treatment
Time to next anti -CLL treatment will be defined as the number of days from the date of the first dose of 
venetoclax to the date of first dose of new non -protocol anti -leukemia therapy (NPT) or death from any 
cause.  For subjects who did not take NPT, the data w ill be censored at the last known date to be free of 
NPT.  TTNT w ill be analyzed by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier methodology using data for all dosed subjects.  Median 
TTNT time will be calculated.
Pharm acokinetic/Pharmacodynamic:
An analysis may be performed using a nonlinear mixed -effect population modeling approach with 
NONMEM software to describe the disposition of venetoclax, to identify significant covariates and 
explore relationship betw een ph armacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by [CONTACT_841728].  Additional analyses may be performed if useful in the 
interpretation of the data.
Health Econom ic and Patient Reported Outcom e (PRO) Measures
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ 
CLL16, the EQ -5D-5L utility score, and the EQ- 5D-VAS score, including mean change from baseline to 
the visits identified in Table 5 (Week 1 Day 1, Week 24 Day 1, ever y 12 w eeks starting with Week 24 
and Final Visit).  Only the EORTC QLQ C30 w ill be utilized in the Expansion Cohort.
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study who took at least one dose 
of study drug.  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory 
test results and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized.

Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1169357] identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) 
chromosomal translocation results in significant over -expression of the protein in B -cells.  
The Bcl- 2 famil y of genes encodes a family of closely related proteins that possess either 
pro-apoptotic or anti -apoptotic activity  and share u p to four Bcl -2 Homology  (BH) 
domains.1-4  Many  hematologic malignancies are highl y dependent upon the anti -apoptotic 
protein Bcl -2 for survival.  Over -expression of Bcl -2 is associated with tumor initiat ion, 
disease progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a compelling target for anti -tumor 
therap y.  Bcl -2 is overexpressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic ly mphocy tic 
leukemia (CLL) is a genetic disease where the microRNAs miR15a and miR16- 1 that 
negativel y regulate the transcription of Bcl -2 are deleted or down regulated, resulting in 
uncontrolled expression of Bcl -2.5,6
Venetoclax in vitro/in vivo Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Pro file
Venetoclax is a potent, selective and orall y bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Bcl -2 
that binds with > 1,000 -fold higher affinit y for Bcl -2 (K i< 0.010 nM) than for Bcl -XL
(Ki–48 nm) or Mcl -1 (K i> 444 nM).[ADDRESS_1169358] a panel of ly mphoma 
and leukem ia cells including B -cell follicular ly mphomas (FLs), mantle cell ly mphomas 
(MCL s), diffuse large B -cell ly mphomas (DLBCLs), and acute my eloid leukemias 
(AML s).  Venetoclax was especiall y potent against cell lines expressing high levels of 
Bcl-2.  Leukemia and l ymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation were 
significantl y more sensitive to venetoclax than non -mutated cell lines.
Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell lines 
derived from acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Non- Hodgkin 's Lymphoma 
(NHL).  The drug was also active in a model of disseminated ALL. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1169359] on the oral bioavailability  in 
dog.
Venetoclax has high protein binding to human, rat , dog, and monkey  plasma proteins 
(>99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, 
lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, 
and bone.  Metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary  excretion of the 
parent drug play ing the secondary  role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic 
stability  in in vitro hepatic sy stems across species tested, except for low to moderate 
stability  in dog hepatocy tes.
Vene toclax is a CYP3A4 substrate and both venetoclax and its major human metabolite, 
M27, are predominatel y metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 in vitro.  Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers are expected to cause changes in venetoclax and M27 exposures.  At the 
400mg QD dose, venetoclax and M27 are not predicted to be perpetrators of the major 
CYP or UGT enzy mes, and venetoclax is predicted to weakl y inhibit UGT1A1.  
Venetoclax and M27 are predicted to cause clinical interaction via inhibition with drugs 
that are subst rates of P -gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran) and BCRP (e.g., rosuvastatin).  
Venetoclax is predicted to inhibit OATP1B1 and cause weak interaction with drugs that 
are substrates of this transporter (e.g., statins).
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient- derived CLL cells treated ex vivo, 
killing these cells with an average concentration required for 50% effect (EC 50) of 
0.006 µM (n = 35; note that not all subject samples are from venetoclax trials).  
Venetoclax was equally  potent against the subs et of CLL samples bearing the high- risk 
17p deletion, with an average EC 50of 0.008 µM (n = 5), indicating that venetoclax may 
have a significant utility  in treating subjects with this high -risk disease.

Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
The nonclinical to xicology  of venetoclax has been evaluated in repeated -dose studies in 
mice and dogs with up to 4 weeks of once dail y oral dosing (and with 4- week recovery  
periods) and in dogs with 2 weeks of dosing (18 -week recovery  period); safety  
pharmacology  studies (c ardiovascular, neurofunctional, and pulmonary ); and in genetic 
toxicity  tests (Ames and in vitro chromosome aberrations assay s).  The primary toxicities 
associated with venetoclax administration included effects on the hematologic system 
(lymphocy tes and r ed blood cell parameters) in mice and dogs and on the male dog 
reproductive s ystem.  There was no evidence of genotoxicity  of venetoclax.  A severely  
toxic dose (STD10) was not identified in mice up to and including the top dose of 
600mg/kg/day  (overall m ean AUC 0-24= 91.5 µg•hr/mL  and C max= 7.2 µg/mL).  In dogs, 
the highest non- severel y toxic dose (HNSTD) was 150 mg/kg/day , but due to overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_197717], the HNSTD was defined as the mid dose of 
50mg/kg/day  (overall mean AUC 0-24= 472 µg•hr/mL  and C max= 27.4 µg/mL ).
Venetoclax causes decreases in circulating l ymphocy tes and l ymphocy tes in ly mphoid 
tissue.  After 4 weeks of dosing, the l ymphocy te effects were reversible or partially  
reversible in the mouse but generall y were less reversible in the dog at the end of a 
4-week recovery  period.  However, in a 2 -week dog study  focused on l ymphocy te 
recovery  over an extended (18 -week) period, reversibility  of lymphocy te effects were 
demonstrated.  Immunophenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_841672] a ssess changes in peripheral blood 
lymphocy te subsets (i.e., mature T cells, helper T cells, cy totoxic T cells, and mature 
Bcells).  At the end of the 18
-week recovery period, both total and ly mphocy te subset 
counts returned to within range of baseline and control values, and all effects on ly mphoid 
tissue reversed.  The venetoclax -related decreases in ly mphocy tes in blood and ly mphoid 
tissues are considered pharmacologically  mediated and non -adverse.8
Additional hematological effects of venetoclax treatment included reversible decreases in 
red blood cell parameters (primarily , hematocrit and hemoglobin co ncentration) in mice 
and dogs.

The decreases in red cell parameters were adverse only at the high dose levels in the 
4-week studies (i.e., at 600 mg/kg/day  in mice and at 150 mg/kg/day  in dogs, but all red 
cell parameters were reversible at the end of a 4- week recovery  period.
Effects on both l ymphocy tes and red cell mass are readil y monitored in subjects.
Male dog reproductive effects consisted of markedly  reduced numbers of spermatogonia 
in the testes at all venetoclax dose levels after [ADDRESS_1169360] the 
treatment of subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies.
Dogs at the high dose of 150 mg/kg/day  in the 4 -week study had clinical signs of itching 
and swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  
Most of the animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected.  The clinical signs were mi ld to 
moderate in severity , transient and sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the 
recovery  period.  The swelling reactions were observed after the first dose in 3 dogs, and 
therefore not consistent with drug -induced immediate (IgE -mediated, Ty peI) 
hypersensitivity ; however, other immune -mediated mechanisms could be involved.  
Although the basis for the swelling reactions was not established, there were no signs of 
anaph ylaxis.  Any  occurrences of swelling reactions in patients can be monitored a nd 
treated.
In an ongoing 9 -month chronic toxicity  study  of dogs with venetoclax, hy popi[INVESTIGATOR_49194] 
(white) facial hair was observed after approximately 3 months of dosing (ongoing stud y 
[COMPANY_013] R&D/12/384).  The finding was limited to the mid and high doses (6 and 
20mg/kg/day ), and was observed in both males and females.  Evidence from Bcl -2 
knockout mouse (bcl -2-/-) studies indicates that hair hy popi[INVESTIGATOR_841673] (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1169361] of Bcl -2 functional loss, and occurs due to loss of ha ir follicle 
melanocy tes dependent on Bcl -2 for survival.12  A dedicated ph ysical examination of the 
skin and extensive ophthalmic examinations determined that pi[INVESTIGATOR_841674] e (particularl y in the iris and fundus) appears unaffected.  The potential for 
development of white (hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_49194]) hair in humans is unknown.
In an anesthetize d dog cardiovascular model given intravenous doses of venetoclax, mild 
reductions in my ocardial contractility  (maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure 
[dP/dt max]:  –6% to – 13%) and cardiac output ( –11% to –19%) were observed at plasma 
concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL and ≥ 32 µg/mL , respectively .  However, no effects on 
blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were observed relative 
to baseline or controls in either the anesthetized dog stud y or in the conscious dog 
cardiovasc ular stud y using telemeterized animals at maximum drug concentrations of 
46µg/mL  and 16 µg/mL, respectivel y.
Venetoclax was tested in a battery  of safet y pharmacology  assay s and produced no effects 
in central nervous sy stem/neurobehavioral, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_841675] 600 mg/kg.  In dogs, mild reductions in cardiac contractility  and cardiac output were 
observed at plasma concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL.  However, no effects on blood 
pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) param eters were observed in dogs at a 
maximum drug concentration of 46 µg/mL.
On the basis of nonclinical safet y pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of 
venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical and human studies of related antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 family  prote in inhibitors, potential mechanism -based toxicities may  include 
lymphopenia and neutropenia,13signs of tumor ly sis, reduction in red cell mass, decreased 
spermatogenesis, skin swelling, and hair h ypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  Thrombocy topenia has not 
been observed in toxicology  studies in mice and dogs.  These findings are consistent with 
venetoclax as a Bcl -2 speci fic (Bcl -
XLsparing) inhibitor.  Consequently , 
thrombocy topenia is not expected to be a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) clinically .

Venetoclax is a CYP3A4 substrate and both venetoclax and its major human metabolite, 
M27, are predominatel y metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3 A4 in vitro.  Therefore, CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers are expected to cause changes in venetoclax and M27 exposures.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology , metabolism, and pharmacology  can be 
found in the current version of the Investigator 's Brochure.14
Venetoclax Clinical Data
As of 28 November 2015, based on the available data in the AbbV ie and 
Genentech/[COMPANY_002] clinical databases, a total of [ADDRESS_1169362] 
1 dose of venetoclax in the oncology  and immunology  development programs.  A total of 
1498 oncology  subjects had data available in [COMPANY_013] and Genentech/[COMPANY_002] studies as of 
28 November 2015.  Of these 1498, 935 subjects had CLL/small l ymphocy tic leukemia 
(SLL), [ADDRESS_1169363] ranged from 20 mg to 1200 mg.  Multiple 
ongoing Phase 1/2 [COMPANY_013] and Phase 1/2/3 Genentech/[COMPANY_002] clinical studies are 
evaluating safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and efficacy  of venetoclax as 
monotherap y or in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (rituximab [R], obinutuzumab 
(GA101) [G], rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP [cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, and prednisone; R -CHOP or G -CHOP, respectivel y], BR, bendamustine plus 
obinutuzumab [BG], bortezomib plus dexamethasone, azacitidine or decitabine, and 
cytarabine) in subjects with hematologic malignancies.  Additionally , two Phase 3 studies 
are ongoing:  one stud y in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL exploring the combination of 
venetoclax and rituximab against BR and one Phase [ADDRESS_1169364] -line CLL exploring  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1169365] common adverse drug reactions 
across all indications are nausea, diarrhea, hematological effects, and serious and/or 
opportunistic infections.  The important risks identified with venetoclax administration 
based on nonc linical and clinical data are tumor l ysis sy ndrome (T LS) and neutropenia, 
particularl y in the CLL indication.  Infection is a potential risk.  Other adverse events 
commonly  observed with venetoclax include nausea, diarrhea, and other hematological 
effects (including, anemia, thrombocy topenia, and ly mphopenia).  In addition, as 
venetoclax is being evaluated in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease who had 
previously been treated with various cy totoxic agents, second primary  malignancies are 
closely being monitored.
Tumor ly sis sy ndrome (TLS) is an important risk, particularl y in subjects with R/R CLL.  
As a result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early  
in the program when the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL received starting doses of 
100mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which was reported as an adverse event for 
each.  Subsequently , 2 fatal events in the setting of TL S and another event of clinical TL S 
in subjects with CLL /SLL occurred in December 2012.  Aft er comprehensive review of 
all safet y data available from studies with venetoclax, a revised dosing regimen with a 
ramp -up period of 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophy laxis and monitoring measures were 
implemented in all CLL studies.  A subsequent analy sis of data from subjects with 
CLL/SLL following the implementation of proph ylaxis measures, who completed 
monotherap y indicated a marked reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when 
compared to the previous anal ysis.  None of the subjects experienced an y ser ious 
(including fatal) or nonserious event of clinical TLS (CTL S) or laboratory  TLS (LTLS) or 
had study  treatment discontinued because of TLS.  Overall, the clinical data strongl y 
support that the risk of TLS with venetoclax in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when

initiating venetoclax dosing, especially with a higher initial dose of venetoclax, as well as 
being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia is a ly mphoproliferative disorder, characterized b y 
progressive accumulation of monoclonal, small, mature -appearing CD5+B cells in 
peripheral blood, bone marrow, and secondary l ymphoid organs.  It is the most common 
form of leukemia in adults in the Western World, accounting for approximately 30% of all 
leukemias.15  Chronic ly mphocy tic leukemia primarily  affects elderl y individuals; 
however, approximat ely one third of patients are less than [ADDRESS_1169366] 4,500 individuals will die of the disease.17  In 
Europe, CLL accounts for approximately  30% of all leukemias in adults with a reported 
age standardized incidence rate of 3.79 per 100,000 individuals (for CLL/SLL) in the 
years 2000 –2002.15,18  The approximate 5- year survival rate for patients with CLL is 
73%.[ADDRESS_1169367] not

CLL is currentl y an incurable disease, despi[INVESTIGATOR_841676] .  Nonetheless, globally  access to allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or 
clinical trials is limited, and treatment options for relapsed disease tend to h ave increased 
toxicity  and reduced antitumor activity .
Study Rationale
During recent years, evidence accumulated suggesting that signaling via the BCR could 
have an important role in the development of CLL and that it could determine the clinical 
heterogeneity  of the disease.  The advent of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841677].  Clinical trials with drugs that inhibit SYK 
kinase (Fostamatimib), reversible pan -Src kinase (Dasatinib), the BTK inhibitor A VL [ADDRESS_1169369] .  Ibrutinib (IMBURVI CA) and 
idelalisib (Zy delig) are currentl y approved for relapsed CLL patients.  These drugs cause 
rapid response with reduction in lymph node size and splenic mass accompani ed by 
[CONTACT_841729] l ymphocy tosis likely  reflecting that microenvironment modulation could 
prevent these cells from receiving the survival signals delivered b y the 
microenvironment.21  However, in earl y trials of Ibrutinib, approximately  10% of the 
patients developed progressive disease.  Few of these patients developed resistance after 
achieving partial r esponse lasting ≥ [ADDRESS_1169370].23  Briefly, 
venetoclax inhibits Bcl -2 allowing the release of BIM, which includes oligomerization of 
pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAK and BAX which triggers rapid apoptosis.  The 
clinical data to date with venetoclax monotherap y shows strong activity  in refractory  CLL 
indicating tha t it might be beneficial in a population that is refractory  to these newer 
therapeutic agents.

M14 -[ADDRESS_1169371] progressed or 
developed recurrence after treatment with BCR signali ng kinase inhibitors.  Safety  data 
and preliminary  efficacy  responses in the CLL population from the Phase 1 trial support 
this Phase 2 trial.  All subjects will be evaluated for histologic transformation (HT) to 
high grade l ymphoma at screening with a pos itron emission tomography using 
18F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) and subsequent biopsy  of PET avid areas to exclude 
subjects with histological and immunophenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_841678].
3.2 Benefits and Risks
The preliminary  clinical data of venetoclax monotherap yin subjects with CLL/SLL, MCL  
and NHL have shown a favorable benefit to risk ratio drug during Stud y M12-175.  In 
Arm A (CLL and SLL) 47 of 52 (90%) evaluable subjects achieved a best response of CR.  
CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery  (CRi), or part ial response (PR):  12 (21%) 
subjects experienced CR/CRi and 35 (63%) subjects experienced PR of which 30 were 
confirmed.
Additional safet y and efficacy data can be found in the current Investigator Brochure.
The encouraging preliminary  data from the ongoi ng venetoclax studies in R/R CLL 
indicate that venetoclax may be beneficial in subjects with relapsed CLL after multiple 
treatment regimens.

4.0 Study  Objectives
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of venetoclax
monotherap y in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) relapsed after or 
refractory  to treatment with B -cell Receptor Signaling Pathway  Inhibitors (specificall y 
Ibrutinib or Idelalisib).  Efficacy  will be measured by  [CONTACT_34426] (ORR).

The secondary  objectives are to evaluate the duration of response, time to progression 
(TTP ), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Additional exploratory  objectives will be evaluated.  Time to next anti -CLL treatment 
(TNT) and minimal residual disease (MRD) will be assessed in the peripheral blood and 
bone marrow (BM) b y flow cy tometry  and PCR.  Health Economic and Patient -Reported 
Outcome Measures will include the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ CLL16 
(ameasure of health- related quality  of life specific to CLL) and the EQ 5D 5L  (measure 
of general health status) including EQ -5D- VAS.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is an open -label, non -randomized, two arm, multicenter study  to determine the 
efficacy  and safet y of venetoclax (GDC -0199) monotherap y in subjects with Chronic 
Lym phocy tic Leukemi a (CLL) relapsed/refractory to treatment with B -cell Receptor 
Signaling Pathway  Inhibitors (specifically  Ibrutinib and Idelalisib) sponsored by  [CONTACT_841730]/[COMPANY_002].
This study  is designed to enroll approximately  120 subjects who ha ve CLL that is 
refractory  to treatment with ibrutinib and/or idelalisib, has relapsed on treatment or 
experienced progression after discontinuation of either one of these agents.
Two arms and an expansion cohort will be implemented to enroll as follows:  
●Arm A with approximately [ADDRESS_1169372] ibrutinib -resistant with 
relapsed or refractory  CLL.
●Arm B with approximately  [ADDRESS_1169373] idelalisib -resistant with

treatment.
Subjects in this study  will be enrolled at approximately  15 research sites.
The study  was designed to enroll approximately  120 subjects to meet scientific and 
regulatory  objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with 
ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there 
is a possibility  that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
Dosing Schedule Overview (All Subjects)
Venetoclax will be administered orall y once dail y (QD), continuousl y.  Each dose of 
venetoclax should be taken with approximately  [ADDRESS_1169376] 's first meal of the day .  To mitigate the risk for 
TLS, a lead -in period of 5 weeks will be employ ed with step wise dose increments.  For 
tumor ly sis sy ndrome prophy laxis, all subjects will be classified into 3 risk categories 
based on the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_841679].
Subjects in low risk category  and medium risk category  with CrCl ≥80 ml/min and low 
tumor burden will begin the lead -in period in the outpatient setting with an initial dose of 
20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 Day  1.  If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or 
lab TL S occur within 24 hours, the same dose will be con tinued until Day  7 in the 
outpatient setting.  Subjects with no laboratory abnormalities suggestive of L TLS will 
escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax on Week 2 Day  1 in the outpatient setting.
Medium risk subjects with CrCl < 80 mL /min and/or higher tumor burden (i.e., AL C 
>100 × 109/L or multiple bulky  nodes) may  be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841680]- in period with an initial dose of 20 mg venetoclax on Week 1 
Day 1.  If no significant findings suggestive of clinical or lab TLS occur within 24 hours, 
the same dose will be continued until Day 7 in the outpatient setting.  Subjects with no 
laboratory  abnormalities suggestive of LTL S will escalate to a dose of 50 mg venetoclax
on Week 2 Day  1 in the outpatient setting.   
Subjects may  be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841681] (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

Dosing Schedule Details
Lead -In Period (All Subjects)
Every  subject will receive an initial dose of 20 mg on Week 1, Day  1 of the lead -in 
period.
If one or more electrol yte changes (from the 0 hour pre -dose value) suggestive of TL S 
occurs within 24 hours of the 20 mg dose, no additional venetoclax doses will be 
administere d until resolution.  See Appendix D, Recommendations for Initial 
Management of Electrol yte Abnormalities and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
(TLS), for procedures to follow.  If aggressive correction of electrol ytes was performed, 
the subsequent dose of venetoclax can onl y be given when electrol ytes have been stable 
without any  further treatment for at least [ADDRESS_1169380] will remain on the 20 mg dose through Week 1 (e.g., Week 1 
Day 2 –Week 1 Day  7).
Subjects who had drug interruptions may  escalate to [ADDRESS_1169381] been on a 
20mg dose for 7 day s.
After a week at 50 mg, weekl y dose incr ements will be implemented as follows:  
100mg→200 mg →400 mg (or additional lead -in steps to designated 400 mg dose) as 
tolerated.

made as clinically indicated for subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
h. If a subject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination without an 
increase in lymphocytes meeting PD criteria), a CT/MRI scan may be performed within 2 weeks to confirm or rule out PD as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
i. All measurable disease must be documented at screening by [CONTACT_225687], physical examination,  CT scans (or MRI if CT is medically contraindicated), and bone 
marrow examinations. For all subsequent disease assessments, only PE and laboratory testing is required unless confirmation of CR is required. If confirmation of CR is 
required a CT/MRI and Bone Marrow will also be completed.
j. Screening sample will assess individual disease characteristics and the Week [ADDRESS_1169426] will be assessed in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow for subjects achieving CR/CRi at the [ADDRESS_1169427] for these subjects (radiographic PR/CR/CRi) will continue to be assessed in the peripheral blood at [ADDRESS_1169428]/MRI scan will be performed after a response of CR/CRi is determined by [CONTACT_316316] (PE/labs) for confirmation.  Fo r confirmation of CR, both the CT and/or MRI 
scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.  It is recommended that the CT scan is performed first, and if this does not confirm a CR, then a BM biopsy should not b e 
obtained.
m. For subjects who meet all criteria for CR/CRi (with the exception of a node(s) that is enlarged around 1.5 –2 cm) m ay also have a bone marrow performed.  If bone marrow 
was performed to confirm a CR or for any clinical indication close to Week 24, then it should be performed within a week of t he Week [ADDRESS_1169429]/MRI scans.  Subjects 
who have MRD negativity confirmed in peripheral blood on [ADDRESS_1169430] a confirmation by [CONTACT_167666].
n. Survival information (i.e., the date/cause of death, post treatment cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], etc.) will be collected every [ADDRESS_1169431] has

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
All study  procedures outlined in Table 4and Table 6are discussed in detail in this section, 
with the exception of adverse event info rmation (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data 
will be recorded on eCRFs with the exception of the pregnancy  reporting forms, which 
will be re corded on paper CRFs.
Procedures performed at Screening will serve as baseline, unless repeated on Week 1 
Day 1 prior to dosing; in which case the latter will serve as baseline.  The schedule of 
study  visit procedures is based on subject stud y drug adminis tration.  Scheduled study  
visits and/or procedures will need to be altered if there is an interruption in study drug 
administration.  I f stud y drug administration is interrupted for more than 3 days 
(i.e., adverse event), the site will contact [CONTACT_176401] s tudy team or [COMPANY_013] Medical 
Monitor to adjust the subject 's visit schedule, procedures and/or dosing on a case b y case 
basis.
Subjects who signed informed consent, have had at least one study procedure conducted, 
and are determined to be a screen failure, will not proceed in stud y.  All of the data from 
the screening procedures will be collected into the EDC regardless of subjects 'enrollment 
into the study .
Refer to Appendix Gfor COVID- 19-related processes for this section.
Informed Consent
Signed informed consent will be obtained from the subject or the subject 's legally  
acceptable representative before an y stud y-specific procedures are undertaken or before 
any prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this 
study .  Informed consent is also required for pharmacogenetic (PG) sampling and a 
portion of the pharmacodynamic (PD) samp le collections.  Details about how informed 
consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.

eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , gastrointestinal, and neurological sy stems.
Clinically  significant changes fro m baseline that are unrelated to disease will be 
documented in the source documentation and eCRFs as Adverse Events.
A symptom directed physical examination may be performed at all other visits (other 
than Screening and 30 Day  Follow -Up visit) and should be limited to sy stems of primary  
relevance- that is, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_432829]/or those associated with symptoms.
Physical Examination (Disease Assessment)
All Phy sical Examinations (complete or s ymptom -directed) should also include the 
evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes in two dimension 
(cervical, supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal and femoral nodes), hepatomegaly , and 
splenomegal y.  These should be noted on all examinations irrespective of being present or 
absent.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional information pertaini ng to methods of 
measurement.
If during ph ysical examination, signs or sym ptoms suggestive of Richter 's Syndrome are 
observed, further assessments (i.e., nodes, biopsy, PET scan) should be considered to 
exclude or confirm the transformation.
All phy sical e xaminations may  be performed within 72 hours before or after the scheduled 
visit starting with Week 8 Day  1.

b. Creatinine clearance should be assessed using Cockcroft- Gault equation or a 24 -hour urine collection.
c. For samples analyzed locally, at room temperature, rasburicase causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in 
blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The 
following special sample handling proce dure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.  Uric acid 
must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into pre -chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.  
Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice w ater bath .  Plasma samples must 
be prepared by [CONTACT_26795] a pre -cooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice 
water bath and analyzed for uric acid within four hours of collection.
d. Prior to rasburicase administration per protocol, test to be performed per label.
e. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples are to be collected and sent to the central laboratory for archiving 
and will only be analyzed if needed due to manifestations of possible infections during the treatment period.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
For all subjects, a 12- lead resting ECG will be obtained at the following:

●Final Visit
●As clinically  indicated
The ECG results will be used by  [CONTACT_841732], includin g 
adverse event determination and management and termination of subjects from the study .  
ECG results will be summarized as follows:
●normal ECG
●abnormal ECG –not clinically  significant
●abnormal ECG –clinically  significant
●unable to evaluate
Any ECG report that is both abnormal and clinically  significant will be faxed to the 
Oncology  Safet y Management Team via the contact [CONTACT_222644] 6.1.5
within 5 business day s of obtaining the results.  The QT interval measurement will be 
documented in the eCRF only  if a "prolonged QT "is observed.  Correction by  [CONTACT_416970] (QTcF) is preferred; however, correction b y othe r methods may  be 
acceptable based on discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.  The original ECG 
tracing will be retained in the subject 's records at the study  site.
Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)
Assessment of ejection fraction will be made at screening b y either two -dimensional 
echocardiogram or a Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Subsequent evaluation of LVEF will be made as clinically indicated for 
subjects who develop signs of cardiac compromise.
Disease Assessments
For all subjects, clinical response will be assessed by [CONTACT_841733] (hematology  laboratory  values) and ph ysical examination.  I n

Response criteria definitions are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Note :  Disease assessments may  be performed [ADDRESS_1169463] scans (with contrast) including neck, chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis will be performed to assess response to treat ment.  MRI  of the 
abdomen and pelvis with a non -contrast CT scan of the neck and chest may be used 
instead in subjects for whom CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., subjects with 
contrast allergy  and impaired renal clearance).  Subjects should h ave the same imaging 
modality  performed throughout the stud y for consistency and direct comparison.   
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

When CR/CRi is determined by [CONTACT_841734] y, a CT/MRI  
scan must be performed for confirmation (refer to Table 10).  If the CT/MRI scan 
confirms a CR, then a BM biopsy is also required.  For confirmation of CR, both the 
CT/MRI  scan and bone marrow are required to be negative.   
When PR is determined by  [CONTACT_316316] b y changes in disease assessment they  must be 
confirmed b y a repeat clinical assessment at least [ADDRESS_1169465] exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocytes meeting PD criteria, a CT/MRI  scan must be performed within 
2weeks to confirm or rule out PD, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] according to Modified 
IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response.
Clinical data and radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified 
IWCLL NCI -WG Criteria for Tumor Response (refer to Table 10).  In addition to being 
reviewed b y the investigator and/or site staff, an independent review will be performed to 
assess tumor response and disease progression.  The independent review facility  will

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Variables
For disease assessments, response will be assessed by  [CONTACT_841741] (hematology  laboratory values), complete ph ysical 
examination, CT scan of involved anatomic regions (or MRI  if CT is medically  
contraindicated), bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752].  Subjects will be evaluated against the 
[ADDRESS_1169490] 
imaging (or MRI).
At Screening, all measurable disease must be documented by  [CONTACT_841742] 
(hematologic status), physical examination, PET/CT and bone marrow.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed no more than [ADDRESS_1169491] a disease assessment 
at Screening, Week 5 Day 1 (or Day  1 of initiation of 400 mg dose) and bey ond by  a 
physical examination and laboratory  testing.  When a CR/CRi response is determined b y 
clinical criteria at an y time during the stud y, a CT scan or MRI must be performed within 
[ADDRESS_1169492]/MRI  scan and bone 
marrow are required to be negative.  If the scans confirm a CR, then a BM biopsy is 
required for confirmation of the CR.
If a sub ject exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or 
denovo enlargement of liver, spleen or l ymph nodes on phy sical examination) without an 
increase in ly mphocy tes meeting PD criteria, then additional assessments including 
contrast enhanced CT scan (or MRI) and/or bone marrow must be performed within 
2weeks to confirm or rule out PD.
Methods of Measurement
Disease response and progression will be assessed by  [CONTACT_147560], clinical 
examination, radiographic scans and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_111779] y. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Details on the anal ysis of peripheral blood required to assess r esponse are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study  Procedures.
A full phy sical examination should be performed to assess the extent of disease 
involvem ent.  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers.  Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they  are 
superficial (e.g., palpable ly mph nodes).  The diameter, in two planes, of the largest 
palpable nodes in each of the following sites should be measured:  cervical, 
supraclavicular, axillary , inguinal, and femoral.  The presence of hepatomegal y and 
splenomegaly  should be performed.
The [ADDRESS_1169493] bi -dimensional lesions should be recorded in the eCRF.  
●Target Lesions:  A maximum of 12 target lesions may be selected (up to 
6nodal and 6 extranodal).  Target nodal lesions must be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in 
LDi at baseline), clearl y measurable and suitable for consistent, reproducible 
measurement in at le ast two perpendicular dimensions.  Target extranodal 
lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters at baseline.
● Non- Target Lesions:  A maximum of [ADDRESS_1169494] be abnormal (> 1.5 cm in L Di at baseline).  
Non- target extranodal lesions must be > 1 cm in two perpendicular diameters.  
Nodal and extranodal lesions that were not selected as target lesions at baseline 
can be followed as non- target lesions.
Computed tomograph y (CT) is the preferred method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment.  CT scans (with contrast) should include neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis scans.  CT scans for response assessment may  be limited to areas of prior 
involv ement only , if required by  [CONTACT_841743].  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) may  be used if CT is medically  contraindicated (e.g., severe contrast 
allergy ).  If MRI s are used instead of CT scans, MRI s should be used consistently

chest , abdomen and pelvis at baseline and follow ups.  The [ADDRESS_1169496] bi- dimensional 
lesions should be recorded in the eCRF (6 nodal and 6 extra nodal).
For accurate overall response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure 
tumor lesions.

In addition to being reviewed b y the investigator and/or s ite staff, an independent review 
will be performed to assess tumor response and disease progression.  Clinical data and 
radiographic scans will be interpreted according to 2008 Modified I WCLL NCI -WG 
Criteria for Tumor Response (refer to Table 10).  The independent review facility  will 
provide instructions regarding the preparation and shipment of the imaging data.  
Interpretations from the independent re view for individual subjects will not be sent to the

Tumor Response Criteria
Complete Remission (CR)
CR requires all of the following criteria:
●Peripheral blood l ymphocy tes (evaluated by  [CONTACT_26850]) 
below 4 × 109/L (4000/µL)
●Absence of ly mphadenopathy  (nodes > [ADDRESS_1169497] diameter or an y extra 
nodal disease) b y physical examination and CT scan
●No hepatomegal y or splenomegaly by [CONTACT_5292] (as determined by  
[CONTACT_416985])

●Absence of disease or constitutional sy mptoms (B sy mptoms:  unexplained 
fevers > 38° C or 100.4 °F, drenching night sweats, > 10% bod y mass weight 
loss in the preceding 6 months)
●Blood counts above the following laboratory  values:
○Neutrophils > 1.5 × 109/L [1500/µL ] (without the need for exogenous 
growth factors)
○Platelets > 100 × 109/L [100,000/µL ] (without the need for platelet 
transfusion or exogenous growth factors)
○ H emoglobin > 110 g/L [11 g/dL ] (without the need for blood transfusions 
or exogenous ery thropoietin )
●Bone marrow at least normocellular for age, < 30% of nucleated cells being 
lymphocy tes.  Ly mphoid nodules should be absent.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_841706]/CRi has been achieved.  If the bone 
marrow is h ypocellular, a repeat determination should be made in [ADDRESS_1169498] recovered.  A marrow biops y should be 
compared to a pre -treatment marrow if avai lable.  Subjects who are otherwise 
in a complete remission, but bone marrow nodules can be identified 
histologically  should be considered to be nodular PR (nPR).  
Immunohistochemistry  should be performed to define whether these nodules 
are composed of prim arily T cells or ly mphocy tes other than CLL cells, or 
CLL cells.
Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)
Subjects who fulfill the criteria for CR (including bone marrow) but who have persistent 
cytopenia (anemia or thrombocy topenia or neu tropenia) apparentl y unrelated to CLL but 
related to drug toxicity  will be considered CRi.  The marrow evaluation described above 
should be performed with scrutiny and not show any clonal infiltrate.
Partial Remission (PR)

DNA meth ylation regulates gene expression (inactivates certain genes and their normal 
role); aberrant meth ylation of specific genes is associated with cancer development and 
poor clinical outcome.  Genes with variable meth ylation status that are known to have 
prognostic implications may  be assessed in the trial.  These anal yses may  examine 
putative stratification markers for correlation for efficacy .
Genetic amplification, chromosomal loss and/or mutational/methy lation status of various 
genes represent genetic lesions potentially  associated with subject outcome.  Nucleic 
acids, protein expression, and/or mutational/methylation analysis may be conducted on 
CLL cells isolated from blood, tissue from tumor samples and/or DNA/RNA extracted 
from serum from subjects participating in this study to assess modifications in genes 
(e.g., which may  include but will not be limited to the Bcl -2 family , p53, notch and other 
genes associated with resistance to B -cell receptor targeted agents such as BTK and 
PLCγ), which may  prove to be informative.  Additionally , comprehensive sequencing of

from subjects participating in this study  to assess amplifications and translocations in the 
Bcl-2 gene and other alteration in genes associated with CLL, which may  prove to be 
informative.  The potential relationship between amplif ication/loss/mutation/methy lation 
of these genes and the clinical outcome in these subjects may be examined as a subject

will be performed.
Each of these domains will be calculated as per the EORTC scoring manual, and 
summarized (mean, std. dev., median) at each assessment; in addition mean change in 
each of these values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify  any 
statistically  significant differences versus baseline.
The five EORTC QLQ CLL16 domains (Fatigue, Treatment Side Effects and Disease 
Symptoms, Infection, Social Activities, Future Health Worries) will be summarized 
(mean, std. dev., median ) at each assessment; in addition mean change in each of these 
values (final assessment versus baseline) will be calculated to identify an y statistically  
significant differences versus baseline.29

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of 400 mg was selected on the basis of the data in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
subjects from the ongoing venetoclax first-in-human Study  M12 -175.  A time -to-response 
model and a logistic -regression model were developed using data from Study  M12 -175 to 
understand the relationship between the response outcome and the final target venetoclax
dose.  Both models fou nd that a faster response was achieved with a higher final target 
dose.  Further analy sis focused on comparing 400 mg and 600 mg as the final target dose 
showed a minimum difference on the overall response rate (i.e., percentage of subjects 
with partial re sponse or better).  With doses below 400 mg QD, however, a longer (and 
clinically  unfavorable) duration will be needed to achieve the same response rate.  Since 
there is no strong difference between [ADDRESS_1169526] dose of 50 mg on Week 2 Day  1.  Low risk subjects 
and medium risk subjects with Cr Cl ≥ 80 mL /min will begin lead -in-period as

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated i n the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (meets protocol specific crite ria [see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity  
management]) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment -emergent adverse eve nt is defined as any  adverse event reported by  a subject 
with onset or worsening from the time that the first dose of venetoclax is administered 
until [ADDRESS_1169529] elapsed following discontinuation of study  drug administration.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_1169530] 's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study  subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -[ADDRESS_1169531] and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent an y 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elec tive 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  For deaths related to disease progre ssion 
(coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of death will be recorded 
on the appropriate case report form, however, the event will be considered expected for 
the purpose of determining expedited reporting requirements to regulatory authorities.  If 
the cause of death is unknown at the time of reporting, "unexplained death "should be 
recorded on the eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available "unexplained death "
should be replaced b y the established cause of death.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841709] a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV h ydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophy laxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), 
unless there is an additional reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841710] r 
seriousness other than hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., abnormal post -dose TL S laboratories that 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, etc.).
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population (CLL) at some 
frequency  independent of drug exposure.  These are discussed here as Adverse Events 
commonly  associated with CLL or progression of CLL.  Such events include known 
consequ ences of the underly ing disease or condition under investigation (e.g., s ymptoms,  
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)
M14 -032 Protocol Amendment 6
117
disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underl ying disease under 
investigation but common in the study population independent of drug therapy  
(e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderl y population).
These events are listed in Appendix E.
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combination s and are considered 
expected for reporting purposes.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to Health Authorities and IRBs as 
individual cases, if an event commonly associated with CLL or progression of CLL meets 
seriousness criteria (as defined in Se ction [IP_ADDRESS] ) it must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 
24hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.  For deaths related to 
disease progression (coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of 
death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the event will not be 
expedited as an individual case safet y report (ICSR) to regulatory authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse E vent Severity
The investigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0).[ADDRESS_1169532]
the change in severit y.  The dates on the AE 's cannot overlap.  For all reported serious 
adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated 
to reflect an y changes due to the increase in severity.  For adverse events n ot captured b y 
the Common Terminology  Criteria, the following should be used:
Grade [ADDRESS_1169533] (mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_1169534] 's 
usual act ivities (moderate).
Grade [ADDRESS_1169535] 's usual 
activities and may  be incapacitating (moderate to severe). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199-GDC -0199)

118
Grade 4 The adverse event is life -threatening requiring urgent intervention (severe).
Grad e [ADDRESS_1169536] (severe).
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the adverse even t.
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated. "  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated. "  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_237421], an "Other cause "of event must be provided by  [CONTACT_112789].

(TLS)
There is a potential for tumor ly sis sy ndrome in subjects, affected by  [CONTACT_841747], elevated pretreatment lactate 
dehy drogenase (LDH) levels, elevated leukocy te count, renal d ysfunction, and 
dehy dration.
In response to the events of TL S reported in the Phase [ADDRESS_1169540] that siz e of baseline lymph 
nodes is a risk factor for TL S, with larger l ymph nodes resulting in increased risk.  I n 
addition, creatinine clearance of ≤ 80 mL/min at Screening was identified as a risk factor 
for TL S.  Data anal yses have resulted in development of three risk categories, listed 
below.  Risk category  for an individual patient is determined upon study  entry .
A detailed description of risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_841711] l ysis following treatment with 
venetoclax is available in the current Investigator 's Brochure.
A "TLS Prophy laxis and Monitoring Checklist "will be completed throughout the lead -in 
period to ensure proper TLS proph ylaxis measures.
Refer to table in Appendix Ffor laboratory  and clinical TL S.
For TLS proph ylaxis, all subjects enrolling into the study will be classified into 3 risk 
categories based on the tumor burden prior to venetoclax administration.  The tumor 
burden assessed b y the nodal disease and absolute ly mphocy te count at Screening will be 
used to define each category  as described below:

The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be overall response rate (ORR) –the proportion of
subjects with an overall response (per the investigator assessment) will be calculated for 
all subjects based on IWCLL NCI -WG criteria.
In addition, the ninety -five percent (95%) confidence interval based on binomial 
distribution will be constructed for t he calculated ORR.
The assessment of ORR will be performed independently  for Arm A, Arm B and the 
Expansion Cohort.  I n the Expansion Cohort assessment of ORR will be performed 
independentl y for ibrutinib failure and idelalisib failure subjects.  Subjects who have not 
had a confirmed response prior to the data "cutoff "date defined in Section 8.1.3 will be 
considered to be non- responders.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints
Key secondary  efficacy  endpoints will include duration of response, time to progression, 
progression -free survival, and overall survival.
Duration of response will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response 
(CR or PR) to the earliest recurrence or PD.  If a subject is still responding, then the 
subject' s data will be censored at the date of the subject 's last available disease 
assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject 's data will be 
censored on the date of enrollment.  Duration of response will be anal yzed by  
[CONTACT_5263] -Meier methodology  using data for all enrolled subjects.  Median duration of 
response will be calculated and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be 
presented.
Time to progression (TTP) will be defined as the number of days from the date of 
firstdose or enrollment if not dosed to the date of earliest disease progression.  All disease 
progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was

Median time TTP will be calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time TTP 
will be presented.
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be defined as the number of day s from the date of 
first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death.  All disease progression will 
be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was taking the stud y 
drug or had previously discontinued the study  drug.  If the subject does not experience 
disease progression or death, then the data will be censored at the date of last disease 
assessment.  Data for patients who receive non -protocol, CLL therap y prior to disease 
progression will be censored at t he last disease assessment prior to receiving non- protocol 
therap y.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after the baseline 
visit will be censored at the time of enrollment plus 1 day.  PFS will be analyzed b y 
Kaplan -Meier methodolo gy using data for all subjects enrolled.  Median time PFS will be 
calculated and 95% confidence interval for median time PFS will be presented.
Overall survival (OS) will be defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the 
date of death for all dosed subjects.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be 
censored at the date of last study  visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever is 
later.  OS will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_5263] -Meier methodology  using data from all enrolled

8.2 Determination of Sample Size
There is no planned h ypotheses testing on the primary endpoint overall response rate 
(ORR).  ORR will be presented by  a point estimate and it s corresponding 95% confidence 
interval.  A sample size of 20 subjects would ensure that the distance of true rate will be 
within 23% of the observed rate with 95% confidence and a sample size of 60 subjects 
would ensure that the distance of true rate will be within 14% of the observed rate with 
95% confidence.

The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject 
and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior t o any  study -related screening 
procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the informed 
consent, and an y other signatories according to local req uirements.  A copy  of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject' s medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject 's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
Pharmacogenetic anal ysis will only  be performed if the subject has voluntarily  signed and 
dated a separate pharmacogenetic informed consent, approved b y an IRB/IEC, after the 
nature of the testing ha s been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask 
questions.  The separate pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the 
pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the 
pharmacogenetic testing, it will not impact the subject 's participation in the study .

●Nephrology  (or other acute dialy sis service) must be consulted/ contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (per 
institutional standards to ensure emergency  dialysis is available) upon 
admission for an y subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841719].
●IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at least 
1mL/kg/hr rounded to the nearest 10 mL  (target 150 to 200 mL /hr; not 
<50mL/hr).  Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for 
individuals with specific medica l needs.
●Rasburicase must be administered/considered per regional standards or 
institutional guidelines for subjects with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y rising uric acid level.
●Monitor for sy mptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion and seizures).  If an y clinical 
features are observed, re check potassium, phosphorus, ur ic acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour STAT.
●Vital signs should be taken at time of all blood draws or an y intervention.
●The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial 
responses required.  If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ong oing intensive

3.2 Benefits and 
RisksConsidering the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk 
to subjects participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects 
receiving venetoclax may be at an increased risk for COVID -19 infection 
or experience serious illness if infected.  Management of these adverse 
events will be made on a case- by-case basis with consideration of 
benefit/risk.  How ever, based on the population and disease being 
studied and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not 
expected to differ substantially betw een study subjects and the broader 
population of subjects receiving treatment for CLL, no change to the 
benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study is expected.

Concomitant 
TherapyA vaccine for COVID -19, though not yet available at the time of 
protocol amendment vers ion 6.0, may be allowed when available after 
documented communication with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study 
ProceduresDuring the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ 
mitigation strategies to enable the investigator to ensure patient safety 
and continuity of care.  Acceptable mi tigation strategies are identified 
below  and throughout the protocol.
Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  This may 
include changes such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative 
locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study 
procedures, among others.  Additional details are provided in the 
subsequent section.  Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of 
subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.  If 
visits cannot be conduc ted onsite due to travel restrictions or other 
pandemic -related reasons, follow  the updates below  on how to proceed.
COVID -19 Pandemic- Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, if it is not possible for all study 
procedures to be performed as specified due to travel restrictions or other 
reasons, the following modifications are allowed:
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by 
[CONTACT_648]/virtually.
Some study visits and/or activities may be performed by a local 
clinic /hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/laboratory.  All procedures performed at local 
facilities must be performed by [CONTACT_82163].
Study visits and/or activities should be performed as scheduled 
whenever possible.  If it is not possible to do so due to the 
pandem ic, the following modifications are allowed:
oIf an activity is missed during a virtual visit, perform the 
activity at the earliest feasible opportunity.

history, or close contact [CONTACT_4490] a case), the investigator should 
evaluate the benefit/risk of venetoclax being interrupted until 
the infection has resolved or has been ruled out.  There are no 
time limits for venetoclax interruption as long as no permanent 
study discontinuation criteria have been met.  The investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_841749] -19.  See also Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_1169626] in accordance w ith local regulations.
Clinical Laboratory Testing
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of 
the COVID -[ADDRESS_1169627] laboratory w ork done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or 
other facility.  Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  
Local lab results should be review ed by  [CONTACT_841750].
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration 
may be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all prior 
laboratory results and confirms and discusses with the subject that 
there is no safety conc ern for the subject to continue use of the study 
drug in the absence of current labs.  The subject should be 
scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/2021Page  2 of 20SECTION  I: RESEARCH  PLAN
1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  
To evaluate  the efficacy  microneedling through a professional tattoo machine in hair regrowth  in patients 
with androgenic alopecia over  up to 6 treatments (6 months).
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
Subject participation will be 8 months, the protocol will be kept open  for 24 months for patient enrollment,  
the entire study length including data analysis and publication  will be 32 months
3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Androgenic alopecia is the miniaturization of scalp  terminal hairs into vellus hairs in an androgenic-dependent  
pattern. Often with a genetic component, it results in in aesthetic hair thinning and scalp hair loss. Patients  
with androgenic alopecia often have  significant changes in quality of life and self-esteem.1
Current treatments include topi[INVESTIGATOR_463025]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_463026]. Less than 5% of drug reaches hair follicles with topi[INVESTIGATOR_29899].[ADDRESS_592879] cosmetically satisfactory results for a limited 
number of patients.3 Oral Minoxidil has 20 times  higher concentration in the blood stream compared  to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_463027] 90% of the drug is inactivated in the liver.[ADDRESS_592880] to a tattoo machine. Recent work  has demonstrated use of micro needling to stimulate 
regrowth in androgenic alopecia.6,7,8, 9,10  We propose using microneedling via the SOL Nova Device to 
stimulate hair regrowth. This device has previously been used by [CONTACT_463045] a colleague who has previously  had success  performing this 
procedure with the SOL Nova device
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
We propose an open label trial of tattoo machine microneedling in ten patients with androgenic alopecia. Ten 
healthy patients older than 18 years will undergo 6 microneedling sessions. Over the course of six months, 
subjects will undergo up to six treatment sessions (one session every 30 day). Photographs will be taken at 
each session. Patients  will be evaluated  at [ADDRESS_592881] about an hour. Approximately 30 minutes will be spent on consenting and time  for patient

Procedure: 
The procedure will occur in an outpatient dermatology office either at YCCI or Yale Dermatology in Middlebury 
(YDM). The patient will be positioned in a conformable seated position.  The entire scalp  will be cleansed  using an 
alcohol swab.  A nerve  block will be offered, using up to 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. The IRB 
understands that a block will be used to numb the entire scalp at each visit, prior to microneedling. The 
surgeon will use a professional tattoo machine, SOL Nova (Cheyenne, MT.DERM, [LOCATION_010]), attached  to 
Cheyenne needle cartridge 27 magnum-bugpin-Soft  Edges (MT.DERM, [LOCATION_010]) to perform 
microneedling to the scalp, setting the needle exposure to approximately 1mm and the repetition rate in the 
tattoo machine power source to 120-[ADDRESS_592883] procedure aftercare:
Patients will be provided with  verbal and written  aftercare recommendations. Patients  will be advised to wear a 
hat, avoid sun protection  and continue their normal  hair care routine. Additionally, expected side effects (skin 
flaking a few days post procedure  (will be discussed. Concerning side effects will be listed with a number to call if 
patient is concerned. 
Biopsy
One biopsy  will be taken on visits two and eight (two  biopsies total). The biopsy on visit eight will be taken prior  to 
the tattooing procedure.  The area for biopsy will be cleaned with an alcohol  swab.  The area will be anesthetized 
using up to 0.5 ml of lidocaine HCL 1% and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000  injection.  A 4 mm punch biopsy will be 
obtained. The biopsy site will be closed using a 4-0 monocryl absorbable suture.  Biopsy  specimens will be fixed  in 
formalin for routine  histology  (H&E)  and immunohistochemistry. Both biopsies will be optional.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures:
The primary  outcome will be change in SALT score over  [ADDRESS_592884].  Secondary outcomes  will include Hamilton-Norwood classification.   We will also measure

white dots, presence of perifollicular halo, total hair count,  hair density,  percentage of anagen hairs,  catagen  
hairs, ratio of vellus hairs and terminal  hairs over an area  of 1 cm2.
Photographs will be taken prior to each  session.  Subjects will be consented at the time  of screening and informed 
of the risks  and benefits  of the participation. Subjects  will be informed that participation is voluntary, and 
withdrawal can occur  at any time. 
Early Termination:  
The IRB understands  that early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241491] (e.g.,  3 months with no response) may not be applicable as 
subjects may be delayed in showing  a response of hair growth, which can take up to 6 months.

1. Personnel responsible for the  safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_463033], assuring protocol  compliance,  and 
conducting the  safety reviews  at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of 
every 6  months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the 
principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged,  require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the authority  to stop or suspend 
the study or  require modifications.
2. The  risks associated  with  the current  study  are deemed greater than minimal for the following 
reasons: 
We do not view the risks associated with the use of scalp microneedling using a tattoo device as  minimal 
risks. Although we  have assessed the proposed  study  as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/2021Page  7 of 20exists for anticipated  and/or unanticipated adverse  events, serious or otherwise, to  occur since  it is not  
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in  advance  of first-hand  
experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore,  we provide a plan for monitoring the data and  
safety of  the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse  Events:
Adverse events will be monitored  for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_62674],  Brett King, according to the following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related  to investigational procedure/agent.
b.) Probable: Adverse event is  likely  related to investigational procedures/agent.
c.) Possible:  Adverse event may be  related to investigational procedures/agent.
d.) Unlikely:  Adverse event is likely not to be  related to the investigational procedures/agent.
e.) Unrelated:  Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures/agent.
4. Plan  for Grading Adverse  Events:
The following scale will be used in grading  the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1.Mild  adverse event
2.Moderate adverse  event
3.Severe 
5. Plan  for Determining Seriousness of  Adverse  Events:
Serious Adverse  Events:
In addition  to grading  the adverse event,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_463034] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results  in any  of 
the following  outcomes:
1.Death;
2.A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_463035]; 
3.A persistent  or significant disability or incapacity; 
4.A congenital  anomaly or birth defect;  OR
5.Any other adverse  event that, based  upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require  medical  or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed  in this  definition.  
An adverse event may be  graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse  event may be  graded  as moderate but  still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_463036] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the  IRB is necessary.

Any incident, experience or outcome  that meets  ALL 3 of the  following criteria:
1.Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity,  severity, or  frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described  in the  protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved  protocol  
and informed consent  document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; AND 
2.Is related  or possibly related  to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that  the incident,  experience, or outcome may have been caused  by [CONTACT_463046]); AND
3.Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, legal,  or social  harm) than was  previously known  or 
recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks  to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and  include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related  adverse 
events and unanticipated adverse device  effects.  Please note  that adverse events are  reportable to  the 
IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria  listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported  to the IRB in accordance with  IRB Policy 710, using the 
appropriate forms found  on the website.  All related  events involving  risk but  not meeting the prompt 
reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_592886] to oversight by a DSMB (or  other monitoring entity that  is monitoring the study on behalf of an 
industry sponsor).
7. Plan  for reporting  adverse events to co-investigators  on the study, as  appropriate the protocol’s 
research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors,  funding and 
regulatory agencies, and regulatory and  decision-making bodies.

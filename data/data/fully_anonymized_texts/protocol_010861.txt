Trans -incisiona l Rectus Sheath Block versus Laparoscopic Guided Rectus Sheath Block for 
Pediatric Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Prospective, Randomized Study  
Background : Regional anesthesia has been increasingly utilized for providing post -operative 
analgesia for a number of surgical procedures in children. Rectus sheath block and local anesthetic 
infiltration of the surgical site are two common modes for providing post -operative analgesia. Studies 
comparing the two modes have shown ultrasound -guided rec tus sheath block to improve immediate 
pain scores and reduce use of post -operative analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing umbilical 
hernia repair. However, these studies have compared pre -incisional ultrasound -guided rectus sheath 
block to post -operati ve local anesthetic infiltration as a subcutaneous and/or intradermal injection.  
Also, to our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the use or efficacy of laparoscopic guided 
rectus sheath block for pediatric single -incision laparoscopic surgery. Sin gle-incision surgery 
involves performing abdominal operations though a single, small incision, usually located at the 
umbilicus.  
Hypothesis : The purpose of our study is to compare the efficacy of trans -incisional rectus sheath 
block to intra -operative inf iltration of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic visualization via an 
intra-abdominal approach for providing post -operative analgesia following single -incision 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in children.  
Methods : We propose a prospective stud y where pediatric patients who are undergoing single -
incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be randomized pre -operatively to receive either a trans -
incisional rectus sheath block after facial closure but prior to skin closure or intra -operative 
infiltr ation of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic visualization after cholecystectomy. The 
primary outcome is the post -operative pain rating based on the Wong -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale 
(WBFPRS) following SILC. Additional outcomes measured will inclu de: operative times, the use of 
intravenous/oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527]/or non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_205220] -operative period, duration of 
analgesia following surgery based on time to first rescue analgesic, intra -operative hemodynamic 
changes, post -operative hemodyna mic changes, incidence of side -effects, and complications.

-Primary outcome : Degree of analgesia in the post -operative period following single -incision 
cholecystectomy  
-This will be measured by [CONTACT_100953] -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, use of intravenous/oral

cholecystectomy  
-Secondary outcome : Operative times (this will include into operating room, surgical start, 
surgical stop, and out of operating room times which wi ll include time required for 
administration of rectal sheath block or local infiltration), duration of analgesia following 
surgery based on time to first rescue analgesic, intra -operative vital signs, incidence of side -
effects  
3. Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, drug 
or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
Regional anesthetic techniques are commonly used to improve post -operative analgesia in 
pediatric patients. The re continues to be an increase in the use of regional anesthetic techniques 
in an effort to reduce post -operative pain while limiting the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. Studies 
have reported improved analgesia when comparing regional anesthetic techniques with  
intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Some of the regional blocks that have been described in children include: 
transverse abdominis, ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve, rectus sheath, lumbar plexus, 
paravertebral and intercostal nerve block. These have been described for  use in a number of 
different surgical procedures in children (1,2).  
A few studies have been published comparing bilateral rectus sheath block (RSB) to 
infiltration of local anesthetic for children undergoing umbilical hernia repair (3 -5). One recent 
prospective, randomized controlled study demonstrated that ultrasound guided rectus sheath block 
provided superior analgesia in the peri -operative period compared with infiltration of the surgical 
site after umbilical hernia repair. In this study, the RSB was placed prior to incision, while the 
local anesthetic infiltration was placed into the subcutaneous tissues after the procedure and prior 
to closer of the skin incision (3). A second prospective, randomized study also reported decreased 
use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_205222] n-opi[INVESTIGATOR_205223] -operatively for patients who underwent ultrasound 
guided RSB. In this study, the RSB was placed at the conclusion of the surgery rather than prior 
to the incision (4). A third randomized, blinded study comparing wound infiltration  with 
ultrasound guided RSB placed prior to incision for umbilical hernia repair demonstrated more 
effective analgesia in the RSB group (5). The available literature therefore demonstrates the

repair.   
Single -incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) involves performing abdominal operations 
though a single, small umbilical incision (6). Local anesthetic infiltration of the surgical site is the 
most common mode  for providing post -operative analgesia following SILC. This can be 
performed prior to the incision or after the operation and prior to closure of the skin incision. To 
our knowledge, there are no studies to date evaluating the use or efficacy of intra -operative, 
laparoscopic guided rectus sheath block for post -operative pain control in pediatric patients 
undergoing SILC. One recently published study evaluating transverse abdominis plane (TAP) 
blocks placed under laparoscopic guidance at the end of colorect al operations found that using 
TAP blocks facilitated shorter length of stay with low re -admission and reoperation rates (7). 
Given that the rectus sheath block provides analgesia along the midline of the anterior abdominal 
wall, and has been shown to be e ffective and safe in patient undergoing umbilical hernia repair, 
we propose a randomized controlled study to compare trans -incisional rectus sheath block to 
intra-operative infiltration of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic visualization/guidance 
via an intra -abdominal approach for providing post -operative analgesia following single -incision 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in children.  
The majority of regional anesthesia in pediatric patients is performed under deep sedation or 
general anesthe sia. Safety studies support the rationale that performing regional anesthesia under 
general anesthesia is safe (1). The Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network (PRAN) was formed 
to obtain highly audited data on practice patterns and complications in regional  anesthetic 
techniques in pediatric patients. It is a centralized database, at a number of participating centers, 
and includes a total of 14,917 regional blocks performed on 13,725 patients over a 3 year period. 
They concluded that regional anesthesia in c hildren as commonly performed in the [LOCATION_002] 
has a very low rate of complications. There were no adverse events reported for the 294 rectus 
sheath blocks performed (1).  
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a long -acting local anesthetic that has been shown to cause less c ardiovascular 
changes than other local anesthetics (8,9). The overall incidence of adverse events associated with 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205224]/or vomiting occurring most frequently (9). It has 
been shown to be effective for peripheral nerv e, caudal, and lumbar/thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_205225] (8,9).  
With regards to measurement of pain intensity post -operatively, self -reported measures of pain 
are preferred over other typ es of pain measures for use with children capable of verbal 
communications (10). Pain is a subjective experience, and self -report measures ask the patient to 
articulate their pain experience. This approach also has a high clinical utility as it is convenie nt 
and easy to use in every day practice. The Wong -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) is the 
current standard for measuring pain at our institution. The intended age group range is 3 -18 years,

 which includes our proposed study population. Advantages of  the WBFPRS include: ease of use, 
minimal instruction required for use, preferred by [CONTACT_205251], and is available 
free of charge. Studies have reported that the scale has adequate psychometric properties (10). 
Psychometric properties o f outcome measures include level of measurement, reliability, validity, 
and responsiveness. One study evaluating validity, discriminant validity, and test -retest reliability 
of the Wong -Baker Faces Scale demonstrated that it is a valid and reliable tool wh en used to 
assess procedural pain among verbal children aged 4 -18 years and among 3 year olds who can 
count and understand the instrument (11). A systematic review of the psychometric properties, 
interpretability and feasibility of self -report pain intensi ty measure in children and adolescents 
showed the WBFPRS to be psychometrically strong. They reported advantages of the scale to 
include: ease of administration, cost effectiveness, and child preference (12).  
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures   
 This is a prospective, double -blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of 
trans -incisional rectus sheath block to intra -operative infiltration of the rectus sheath un der direct 
laparoscopic visualization via an intra -abdominal approach after removal of the gallbladder for 
providing post -operative analgesia following single -incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 
children.  
 Patients aged 10 -21 years old undergoing SIL C for cholelithiasis,  choledocholithiasis, 
gallstone pancreatitis, cholecystitis or biliary dyskinesia will be screen for study inclusion. 
Eligible patients and their parents/guardians will be approached and, if agreeable, consented for 
the study pre -opera tively. Patients will be randomized to receive either trans -incisional rectus 
sheath block or intra -operative anesthetic infiltration of the rectus sheath under direct 
laparoscopic visualization by [CONTACT_205252]. Patient, patient gu ardians, 
select research team members, and Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) staff will be blinded to the 
method of analgesic administration.  
Standard anesthetic technique : All patients will undergo the standard of care per Johns Hopkins 
All Children’s Hosp ital (JHACH)  Anesthesia Department with regards to the administration of 
anesthesia for single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Standard vital signs will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_205253]. 
Acetamino phen 15 mg/kg solution or 325mg – 650 mg oral tab may be given in the pre -
anesthesia unit prior to SILC and , when given,  will be administered based on patient age and 
weight. General anesthesia is induced via a mask with Sevoflurane , oxygen, nitrous, and/or 
propofol or rocuronium IV if the patient has an IV in place. The type of induction anesthesia 
given will be at the discretion of the attending pediatric anesthesiologist.  The airway is then 
secured with endotracheal intubation. A  peripheral IV is placed if the patient does not already 
have one in place. A volatile inhalational anesthetic is used for maintenance of anesthesia. The 
patient is monitored for hemodynamic changes throughout the surgical procedure and treated

 accordingly . Any changes in hemodynamics or requirements of additional anesthetic or analgesic 
will be documented and assessed. Hemodynamic changes (>20% increase in non -invasive 
systolic blood pressure and heart rate after incision) is treated with deepening of the anesthetic 
with volatile agents. Patients with persistent tachycardia or hypertension are treated with 1mcg/kg 
of fentanyl. Patients may receive 0.1 mg/kg of ondansetron intravenous or dexamethasone or 
glycopyrrolate if appropriate and at the discretion of  the attending anesthesiologist.  If approved 
by [CONTACT_205254], they may also receive 0.5 mg/kg of ketorolac intravenous at the 
end of the procedure.  
Study anesthetic technique : Patients will be randomized into two groups: trans -incisional rectus 
sheath block or intra -operative infiltration of the rectus sheath under direct laparoscopic 
visualization via an intra -abdominal approach.  
 
-Trans -incisional rectus sheath block group : After removal of the gallbladder, a 
predetermined volume of 0.2%  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (1cc/kg, max dose 10cc, divided into equal doses 
bilaterally) will be administered under direct visualization into the rectus sheath bilaterally by 
[CONTACT_17925]. This will be done after closure of the fascial incision but prior to 
closure of the skin incision.  
-Intra -operative rectus sheath block group : After removal of the gallbladder, a 
predetermined volume of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (1cc/kg, max dose 10cc, divided into equal doses 
bilaterally) will be administered intra -abdominally under direct laparoscopic visualization into 
the rectus sheath bilaterally by [CONTACT_17925].   
Surgical procedure : Patients will undergo single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy per the 
standard surgical protocol followed by [CONTACT_205255] . The surgical technique 
for single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including incision closure is standardized, and 
has been previously published by [CONTACT_205256]. Surgical dressings will be 
standardized for both groups.  
Post-operative period : All patients will receive standard post -operative PACU monitoring, 
including pulse oximeter, non -invasive blood pressure, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_205226]. The PACU team and selec t members of 
the research team will be blinded to the method of administration of analgesic. Initial post -
operative pain will be assessed by a blinded member of the research team or PACU nurse using 
the Wong -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (see figure below) . This is a horizontal scale of 6 hand -
drawn faces scored from 0 -10. WBFPRS values will be assessed and documented approximately 
every 10 minutes  for 60 minutes and approximately every 30 minutes thereafter for three hours or 
until discharged home  or trans ferred to the floor . The timing of the recorded pain scale will be at 
the discretion of the PACU nurse and/or research team member.  A time lapse until the next pain

 score is recorded will not be considered a protocol violation as the clinical situation ma y deem a 
pain score unnecessary (e.g. the patient is asleep/resting quietly). In the PACU, p atients with a 
pain score of ≥ 4 will be given Fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg every 10 minutes for a maximum of two 
doses and 0.05 mg/kg of intravenous Morphine every 10 minut es for pain score ≥ 4 thereafter, for 
a maximum of two doses. Once patients are able to tolerate oral intake, they will be given one or 
two tabs of oxycodone 5 mg tablet or oxycodone elixir 0.1 mg/kg for one dose for pain score ≥ [ADDRESS_244819]. The protocol allows that not every pain score ≥ 4 will necessarily be follo wed by 
[CONTACT_205257], as the particular clinical scenario may dictate otherwise. 
Therefore instances in which a pain score ≥ [ADDRESS_244820] -
operatively patients will be admitted for further management.  
Patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205227] 0.05mg/kg of IV morphine until 
tolerating PO. Once tolerating PO, oral analgesics will be administered as described below . Pain 
scores will be recorded  approximately  every four hours until disc harge home.  Pain scores will be 
directly obtained and recorded by [CONTACT_205258]. If a study team member is not available to remain with the patient for the duration of the 
recovery period in the PACU, or  if the patient is admitted to the floor, the electronic medical 
record will be the source of data pertaining to pain scores and analgesic administration for the 
remainder of the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
After discharge  from PACU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] : A WBFPRS shee t will be given to each patient/parent 
or guardian prior to discharge. They will receive specific instructions for interpretation of the 
WBFPRS and when to administer oral analgesics. Patients will receive a prescription for 
acetaminophen -hydrocodone 325/5  mg tablet or acetaminophen -hydrocodone 325/5 mg/15mL 
elixir, 0.1 -0.2 mg/kg for analgesia prior to discharge based on age and weight. Instructions will 
include checking the WBFPRS value every 4 hours while awake and for a value of ≥ 4 administer 
the approp riate pain medication as prescribed. Patients will also be instructed to alternate narcotic 
pain medication with ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6 hours while awake for 2 days. They will be 
instructed to transition to non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595] (acetaminophen) once the ir pain is reported as a

careful to document WBFPRS values every 4 hours while awake and any administration of 
analgesics/pain medication for a total of [ADDRESS_244821] -operative complications/symptoms or concerns. We will 
provide a self -addressed, stamped envelope so this sheet may be returned to our surgical group 
via mail. Patien ts will receive a telephone call from one of the study team members [ADDRESS_244822] laparoscopic visualization by [CONTACT_11065] (2 4 participants per group). Participants will be 
randomly assigned to the two treatment groups with a 1:[ADDRESS_244823] 30 days. Th e research study 
visit will coincide with the routine outpatient visit approximately 2 weeks following SILC as well 
as a foll ow up telephone call from a study team member at day 1, 5, and 30 after surgery.  We 
encourage patients to schedule an in -person follow -up visit 2 weeks following operation.  
However, due to scheduling conflicts and other family responsibilities, these visi ts are sometimes 
outside the 2 week timeframe.  We will perform the study visit in -person at the time of the 
scheduled postoperative visit appointment.  Failure of the family to return for a postoperative 
clinic visit will be recorded but not considered a protocol violation by [CONTACT_3476].

 Surgeons will not be blinded for the study as they will be administering the anesthetic. 
Anesthesiologists will not be blinded a s they will be providing anesthetic care during the surgery 
and present in the room during the surgeons’ administration of the anesthetic. The patient, patient 
family, the P ACU team, and select members of the research team will be blinded to the method of 
administration of anesthetic. Blinding of this group will help to prevent bias when evaluating 
WBFPRS values and administering analgesic medication. Blinding of this group would not have 
impact on the standard post -surgical care.

stopped.  
Participants will receive routine care for SILC and be managed according to best practices 
regardless of which group they are assigned. No current therapy will be stopped.  
e. Justifi cation for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
There is no placebo or non -treatment group as the standard of care for SILC includes the 
administration of local analgesia prior to incision closure and administration of intravenous or 
oral analges ics as needed in the post -operative stages.

Ropiv acaine is a long -acting amide l ocal anesthetic that has been shown to cause less 
cardiovascular changes than other local anesthetics. It has been shown to be effective for 
peripheral nerve, caudal, and lumbar/thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_205228]. It is less lipophilic than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_205229]: May 16, 201 8

 to penetrate large myelinated motor fibers, resulting in a relatively reduced motor blockade. The 
reduced lipophilicity is also associated with decreased potential for central  nervous system 
toxicity and cardiotoxicity. It is metabolized extensively in the liver and excreted in urine and 
displays linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics. Ropiv acaine has been shown to be 
generally well tolerated in children aged 1 month to 15 years regardless of the route of 
administration. The incidence of adverse events associated with its use is low, with nausea and/or 
vomiting occurring most frequently (8,9).  
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administere d for non -
FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations 
are changed.  
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205230] a local anesthetic both for surgical anesthesia and for 
acute pain management.  Per FDA Drug Approval Package (1), indications and usage include: 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_205231], major nerve block, local infiltrat ion, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_205232], local infiltration. It has been approved for use 
in adults, is less toxic to the central nervous system and heart and interferes less with motor 
function than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. While the safely and effica cy of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205233], there exist a number of studies in the 
literature that have shown its efficacy and safety in this patient population.  Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205234].  
One report studying the pharmacokinetics after caudal block of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (2mg/kg) in

A second report investigated  the pharmacokinetics of caudal 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (2mg/kg) 
in 30 infants aged less than 12 months. They concluded that the total and free plasma ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205235] c audal ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205236]. No adverse events were reported (3).

with a lower pain score and decreased use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_205223] -operatively 
when compared to the local infiltration group (5).  
We intend to use a route of administration and dose of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205240]. We there fore do not 
anticipate any increased risk with the use of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205241]. This

7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  
The primary outcome is the mean post-operative pain rating based on the Wong -Baker Faces 
Pain Rating Scale at three hours postop or at discharge (whichever comes first).  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables.  
 Operative times, the use of intravenous/oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527]/or non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_205220] -
operative period, duration of analgesia following surgery based on time to first rescue analgesic, 
intra-operative hemodynamic changes, post -operative hemodynamic changes, incidence of side -
effects, and complications.  
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.  
This is a prospective, double -blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of 
trans -incisional rectus sheath block to intra -operative, intra -abdominal rectus sheath block under 
direct laparoscopic visualization after gallbladder removal for providing post -operative analgesia 
following SILC in children. The primary outcome variable is the mean WB pain rating at 3 hours 
postop or at discharge (whichever comes first) based on the Wong -Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale 
in the post -operative period fo llowing SILC.  
The sample size for this study was estimated based on the historical pain scores of patients 
undergoing SILC at JHACH. Historically, the mean pain score for patients undergoing SILC 
repair using the FLACC pain scale is 4. [ADDRESS_244826] deviation of 1.78. We estimate a 
decrease in mean pain score to 2. 9 (decrease pain score <3 is considered a clinically important 
goal) ) for patients undergoing laparoscopic guided RSB. A sample size of 2 4 patients per group 
(total of 48) will achieve a power of 0.[ADDRESS_244827] a 1.5 
decrease in pain scores between the groups. We anticipate a loss to follow up of 1%, which will

Whitney test, Chi -square or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. We will first analyze the subgroups  
before and after the change in inclusion criteria separately and if necessary combine the p -values 
using a combination test. We will also perform a pooled analysis of the combined sample. All

8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures,  their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
Some of the overall risks of laparoscopic cholecystectomy include bile duct injury, bile 
leaks, bleeding and bowel injury (21). In a study combining data from seven large studies with a 
total of 8856 lap aroscopic cholecystectomies, serious complications occurred in 2.6% (22). A 
combined review of eight large studies reported the following types and frequencies of 
complications: bleeding (0.11 -1.97%), abscess (0.14 -0.3%), bile leak (0.3 -0.9%), biliary inju ry 
(0.26 -0.6 %), and bowel injury (0.14 -0.35%) (23). The rate of wound infections and surgical site 
infections is lower with a laparoscopic approach than with an open approach (24). Significant 
bleeding from the liver bed is fairly common and found in up t o 10-15% of patients (25).  
Potential complications of the rectus sheath block include infection, intravascular injection, 
and bowel puncture. The literature has reported a very low complication rate for RSB.  The 
Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network (PRA N) was formed to obtain highly audited data on 
practice patterns and complications in regional anesthetic techniques in pediatric patients. It is a 
centralized database, at a number of participating centers, and includes a total of 14,917 regional 
blocks p erformed on 13,725 patients over a 3 year period. They concluded that regional 
anesthesia in children as commonly performed in the [LOCATION_002] has a very low rate of 
complications. There were no adverse events reported for the 294 rectus sheath blocks pe rformed 
(1).  
Ropiv acaine is a long acting amide local anesthetic and has been shown to cause less 
cardiovascular changes than other local anesthetics (8). It is less lipophilic than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_205243], r esulting in a relatively reduced motor

 blockade. The reduced lipophilicity is also associated with decreased potential for central nervous 
system toxicity and cardiotoxicity (8,9). Ropiv acaine has been shown to be generally well 
tolerated in children aged 1 month to 15 years regardless of the route of administration. Incidence 
of adverse events associated with its use is low, with nausea and/or vomiting occurring most 
frequently (9). One of the general risks of local anesthetics is local anesthetic systemic  toxicity 
(LAST). Symptoms of LAST include altered mental status (agitation, confusion, seizures, 
drowsiness, coma, apnea, metallic taste, cicumoral numbness, diplopia, tinnitus, dizziness) and/or 
cardiovascular signs (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia s, hypotension, conduction block, 
bradycardia, asystole, Torsades de Pointes). According to pooled data of 3000 patients in 60 
studies, the incidence of probable accidental intravenous injection of ropiv acaine was 0.2%. Only 
one patient experienced convuls ions and no patient showed symptoms of cardiotoxicity (9).   
The overall risks of participating in the study are low. Participants will continue to receive 
care according to established guidelines for management of SILC.  
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
Steps taken to minimize risk include best practices associated with the current standard of  
care for surgical management of SILC as well as standard of care for the administration of 
regional and local anesthetics.   
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated prob lems or study deviations.  
Unanticipated problems or study deviations will be reported/communicated promptly to the 
principle  investigator as well as the appropriate body as dictated by [CONTACT_205259]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205244] d Policy 103.6b. This includes submitting Form 
R.F.3 “Event report summary sheet” when appropriate.  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_205260]. 
The Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205245] (attending 
physician, physician assistants, surgical fellows, surgical residents, nurse practitioners) all 
participate in a patient’s care. This includes close observation and monitoring of p atients. The 
primary investigator of the study will perform the monitoring data, safety, and complications.  
 
Frequency of monitoring will be in accordance to the current standard and practice/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205246]. All patients receive routine pre -operative, intra -operative, 
and post -operative care. Post -operative care includes the standard [ADDRESS_244829] the family or failure of the family to schedule a postoperative visit will be 
recorded but not considered a protocol violation by [CONTACT_3476].  
  
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
The risk associated with the release of information of this study is minimal as the  information 
to be collected is not considered sensitive. In addition, the information to be collected is no

In accordance with HIPAA guidelines, the identity of subjects will be strictly protected. All 
information will be kep t in a locked file cabinet and any electronic version will be kept in a 
password protected worksheet. All results will be reported in aggregate with patient identifiers 
removed.  
   
 
e. Financial risks to the participants.  
There is no financial risk to the par ticipants in this study.  
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society.  
Participants of the study may benefit from experiencing superior or improved post -operative 
analgesia. This could decrease or possibly eliminate the need for post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_205247]. If one method/mode of anesthetic administration is found to be superior to the 
other, this may change the standard practice for administration of analgesia for patients 
undergoing SILC repair in t he future. Providing improved post -operative analgesia, with the 
possible elimination for need for post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_205248] a benefit for future 
patients undergoing SILC.  
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participants includ ing possible total compensation, proposed 
bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
There will be no compensation for participants in this study. There will be no financial  
penalties for not completing this protocol, for choosing not to participate in the study, or for 
withdrawing from the study.  
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants and identify 
who will pay for them.  
The cost of the procedure and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205249]/guardian

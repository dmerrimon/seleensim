SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.0  
Page 10 of 36 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
1.1 Scope of the Problem   
There were  around  25,0000  people  killed  inside  vehicles  on U.S. roadways  during  2016  (NHTSA,  
2016)  and over 2 million  injured  in motor  vehicle  crashes  (MVC)  (CDC,  2016 ). A few key behaviors  
contribute  to increased  risk of either  MVCs  or MVC -related  injuries:  lack of seat belt use, impaired  
driving  (due to drugs  and/or  alcohol),  and distracted  driving  (due to either  other  passengers  or 
electronic  devices).   Among  the deaths  from MVCs  in 2016,  42% were  unrestrained  passengers  
(NHTSA,  2016) .  These  behaviors  are especially  prevalent  in young  adults.  Over  35% of lifetime  
medical  costs  for crash  injuries  (US$6.5  billion  of US$18  billion)  are attributed  to young  drivers  aged  
15 to 29 (CDC,  2014).   
 
1.[ADDRESS_792491] been through  
multimedia campaigns (Whittam KP et al., 2006),  driver training programmes  (Lenne LG et al., 
2011 ; Unni P et al., 2017 ), or public policies such as surveillance with fines for speeding and seat 
beltuse (Wilson C et al., 2011). Secondary prevention approaches include mandated interventions 
for offenders such as a lcohol Ignition Interlocks  (McGinty EE et al., 2017) .  Recently, improved 
knowledge of the behavioral drivers of vehicle safety allow for updated interventions incorporating 
psychological theories and behavior change techniques (Fernandez et al., 2010).  
 
1.3 Behavioral Drivers of Vehicle Safety  
Two psychological theories useful in  understand ing vehicle safety behaviors are the Theory of 
Planned B ehaviour (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). In the TPB, intentions are influenced 
by a person’s attitude, perceived norms and self -efficacy. The TPB has been shown to explain up to 
53% of variance in intention to speed and 40% of variance in speeding  behavior (Stead M et al., 
2005). In the HBM,the perceived risks/threats of personal injury and the perceived benefits of 
performing a safety behavior in fluence the likelihood of performing them . These HBM factors have 
been shown to be important in sealt  belt use  (Chaudhary, Solomon, & Cosgrove, 2004; H elweg -
Larsen & Sheppard, 2001).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_792492] shown that these cognitive and motivational factors  of vehicle safety behaviors can be 
potentially modified. One study showed that an intervention targeting TPB factors resulted in small 
immediate improvements in vehicle safety (Poulter DR et al., 2010) but effects were not durable 
over time. Another study by [CONTACT_27213] (2018) reported on the development of a  digital 
intervention targeting TPB fac tors, finding feasible and initial evidence of effects.  
 
 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.0  
Page 11 of 36 1.5 Rationale  for SMS Behavioral Intervention s 
In the US, mobile phones are near ubiquitous, and by [CONTACT_2892] 2020, 70% of the world's population 
will use a smartphone (Ericsson,  2015 ). Text messaging (SMS) is a commonly used digital 
communication modality that has particular usefulness in reaching individuals to support behavior 
change (Suffoletto et al.,2017). SMS interventions are ideally suited to deliver microinterventions – 
interventions that can be completed in a few moments, typi[INVESTIGATOR_178106] a repeated administration, 
tailored to some immediate assessed need or trigger.   These microinterventions are  more closely in 
line with the expectations of consumers of digital information, who may routinely interact with fast -
paced, user -driven, interactive content.  Systematic reviews  have found SMS interventions  to be 
effective in short -term behavioral outcomes (Fjedsoe et al., 2009) and supporting preventive health 
for adolescents specifically (Badway & Kuns, 2017). Our group has shown that SMS interventions 
incorporating behavior change strategies of self-monitoring with p erformance feedback and goal 
support  produces reductions in alcohol use in at -risk young adults (Suffoletto et al., 2017).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_792493] three  unique SMS interventions each t argeting a 
different vehicle risk behaviors ( seat belt use, distracted driving, and impaired driving). They will all 
use psychological theory and state of the art human -interaction design to optimize engagement and 
effects. Specifically, the SMS interventions will incorporate  periodic (weekly) check -ins to promote 
self-monitoring of recent risks,  goal commitment prompts tailored to past performance to maximize 
willingness and support gradual behavioral shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and performance feedback. Feedback and 
features will focus on modifying cognitive and motivational factors found in the TPB amnd HBM.   
 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.[ADDRESS_792494]  3 related  randomize d, controlled, parallel group, assessor -blind , superiority  
trials of 6-week text message intervention s vs. SMS vehicle safety self -monitoring  in young adult 
participant s with risky vehicle behaviors . A total of 5 00 adult participant s will be enrolled: 300 into 
Cohort 1 (seat  belt); 100 into Cohort 2 ( distracted driving ); 100 into Cohort 3 ( drink driving ). Each 
SMS intervention will be desgined to target a single risk behavior. The study is powered to show a 
difference of 15% in the percentage of subjects reporting seat belt use at week  8. Other cohort trials 
(i.e. distracted driving, drink driving) and outcomes will be exploratory.  
 
2.2 Setting  
The trial will be conducted at 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599070] . Additional sites 
might be recruited if needed.  
 
2.3 Inclusion criteria  
Inclusion  criteria:  
1) Adult participant  (age ≥ 18 years  & ≤25 years ) 
a. Cohort 1 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports not using a seat 
belt 
b. Cohort 2 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports phone was used 
to type while driving and car was moving   
c. Cohort 3 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports driving a vehicle 
within 3 hours afte r consuming 3 or more drinks   
Exclusion criteria :  
1) Member of a protected population (prisoner)  
2) Unable to provide informed consent  
3) No plan to drive and/or ride in a vehicle in the next month  
4) Non-English speaking  
5) No personal mobile phone or planning on changing phone in next 3 months  
 
Justification of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:  The inclusion criteria were chosen to isolate three  
different vehicle risk behaviors in a  population with high risk of injuries due to these risks . We chose 
to be more inclusive than restrictive in these criteria to ensure me meet enrollment goals in the 
allotted time of funding. The exclusion criteria were chosen to minimize the risk of potential harm to 
vulnerable populations.  
 
2.4  Participant Identification  
In the ED a research associate (RA) will conduct confidential screening of ED patients during 
breaks in patient medical care. The RA will review ED admissions data form the EMR to identify 
potential subjects, identifying adult patients 18 -25 years of age who receive medical care in the ED. 
The RA will then ask a clinician (physicians, nurses, or physician extenders) caring for a potential 
participant to ask the patient if they ar e interested in speaking with a researcher about a research 
study. ED clinician s are instructed to refer only patients who are able to provide informed consent 
(i.e., oriented, able to concentrate, not intoxicated and can understand/remember requirements of 
the study). We ask clinicians to document in their medical record about the p atient’s assent to talk 
with the RA.  
The RA will then discuss the screening and study details with these patients  who agree to be 
approached . Those who wish to see if they are eligible will be asked to complete limited 
demographics (age, sex, ra ce, and current education), a [ADDRESS_792495] Trial Protocol v.1.0  
Page 13 of 36 used  to determine how those who screen and/or enroll in our study differ from the genera l ED 
population of young adults . See Appendix for Screen Questions .  
All participants who are  screen  positive will be provided an in formation sheet on vehicle risk 
reduction . See Appendix for draft of Discharge Instructions .  We will request a waiver of informed 
consent to view the electronic medical record to identify potential participants by [CONTACT_117310] a waiver 
of written consent to ask limited screening questions . Detailed screening logs, with reason(s) for 
exclusion will be stored in a password -protected database.  
 
2.5. Consent pro cedures  
After it is determined that they meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, the participant   
will be approached for written informed consent by a RA. The RA will provide the 
participant /representative  information regarding the background and significance of the study, 
eligibility criteria, and a description of the protocol. The consent process may need to be modified 
based on site -specific IRB recommendations. The name [CONTACT_599093], and this person will sign the informed consent document and provide 
the date  and time  of their signature. Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_599071]/surrogate, and the original co nsent document will be stored in the secure study file. In 
obtaining and documenting informed consent, each investigator will comply with the applicable 
regulatory requirements and adhere to the ethical and Good Clinical Practice principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_792496] information (name, phone number, email). 
We will also ask them to provide a social security number, as it is required for participant payment.  
 
2.7 Allocation  to Cohorts  
We will use the risks reported in the screening survey to allocate the participant to their cohort. The 
overall goal is to meet recruitment goals for all three cohorts simultaneously, but to preferentially 
allocate individuals to the seat belt group (Cohor t 1). Individuals who report only one risk behavior 
will be allocated to that study cohort. Individuals who report more than one risk factor will be 
allocated probabilistically. Individuals who screen positive for seat belt risk + one other risk will have 
a 75% chance of being allocated to Cohort 1.  Individuals who screen positive for seat belt risk + 
two other risks will be allocate as 60% Cohort 1, 20% Cohort 2, 20% Cohort 3. Individuals who 
screen positive for both other (non -seat belt) risks will be al located in a 1:1 ratio.  
 
2.8 Baseline Assessment  
We will ask participants to complete a questionnaire collecting detailed demographics, vehicle -
related risks, and impulsivity traits. This  surve y takes about 5  minutes to complete  See Appendix for 
Survey Questions . We will also ask participants to complete the 5-Trial Adjusting Delay Discounting 
Task  (Kaffaurnus & Bickel, 2014)  to assess monetary impulsivity trait. All cohorts will complete 
identical baseline assessments.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_792497] 
50% of the SMS queries in week 1 & [ADDRESS_792498] -enrollment/ pre -intervention vehicle risk behaviors that may occur as 
a result of assessment reactivity. We expect that simply the act of enrolling in a study about vehicle 
risk and completing weekly SMS assessments of risk may result in reduced risk behaviors.  
 
2.11 Allocat ion to Treatment  
Participants in each cohort who meet run -in criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
SMS intervention  or SMS self -monitoring  in blocks of 4. The randomization will be stratified 
according to site  (i.e. ED). An independent statistician will create the randomi zation list using a 
random number generator. The randomization  list will be stored in an electronic database to be 
unblinded once trial enrollment and follow -up periods have been completed .  
 
2.12 SMS Intervention s 
All three SMS interven tions  work iteratively primarily through once -weekly dialogue sessions or 
micro -interventions and  use behavior change techniques (BCTs) including self-monitoring with 
perfor mance feedback and goal support. Each SMS intervention will differ in the content of queries 
and feedback, which is tailored to the target risk behavior. SMS queries and subject responses are 
stored and time -stamped in a database. Branching logic is used t o tailor SMS feedback and 
queries.  At the completion of 6 -weeks, all SMS intervention participants will be asked to complete 
another 6 weeks of SMS assessments without receiving any feedback or goal support. This is to 
serve as a washout period so that durability can be assessed at week 14. All queries, feedback 
libraries and branching logic will be written prior to trial enrollment. See Appendix for SMS 
Intervention Material . 
 
2.13 SMS vehicle safety self -monitoring  (i.e. assessment control)  
Participants allocated to the control arm will simply continue to receive weekly SMS assessments  
related to their target risk behavior  without receiving any feedback or goal support  for 12 more 
weeks.  
 
2.14 Outcome Assessments &  Blinding  
The primary outcome s will be the percentage of participants in each treatment arm wh o report 
vehicle risks at week 8  (immediate effects) and week 14 (durable effects) . Questions are the same 
as those used in screening. Participants will receive a text prompting them to log in to the secure 
web site to complete the 21-question survey which  should take them no more than [ADDRESS_792499] any scenarios where emergency unblinding will be necessary.  
 
2.15 Compensation  
Participants will be compensated $15  for completing enrollment procedures. We will add $15  if they 
meet run -in criteria at the end of  week 2  and complete the 8 -week follow -up assessment. We will 
add a final $[ADDRESS_792500] the 
trial to be minimial risk to participants, given that the only p ossible risk will be from potential breach 
of confidentiality. We will minimize these risks through various strategies.  
The trial will be registerted on ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
2.17 Contingencies  and Participant  Withdrawal  
• In the unlikely event that a participant  is discharged from the ED  prior to completing  enrollment  
procedures , we will make every attempt to assist the participant in completing them in the 
following 48 hours . Those participants who still do not complete in this time period wi ll be 
withdrawn from the study.  
• If a participant  withdraws from the study, further communication  will be stopped. Data collected 
prior to withdrawal  will be maintained but additional data will not be collected.

3. OUTCOMES  
3.1 Definitions  
3.1.1 Primary Outcome  
 -Percentage of participants  who report a vehicle risk at week 8 .  
d. Cohort 1 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports not using a seat belt  
e. Cohort 2 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports phone was used to type while 
driving and car was moving   
f. Cohort 3 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks  where individual reports driving a vehicle within 3 
hours after consuming 3 or more drinks   
 
3.1.2 Secondary Outcomes : Feasibility  
-Percentage of ED patients who screen positive and agree to enroll  
-Percentage of ED patients who enroll who meet run -in criteria.  
 
3.1.3  Secondary Outcomes : Acceptability  
-Percentage of ED patients enrolled in the Intervention arm who complete at least 50% of the SMS 
assessments during the intervention period.  
-Percentage of  ED patients enrolled in the Intervention arm who found the program helpful.  
 
3.1.4  Secondary Outcomes : Effectiveness  
-Percentage with Vehicle Risks at Week 14  – We are interested to see if there is any signal of 
effectiveness once the intervention is “turned -off”. This measure of durability is especially critical to 
understand potential public health benefits.  

 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.0  
Page 16 of 36 -Slopes of change over time  – We will also examine the average slopes of change over time, 
specifically examining the slopes of change in the pre -enrollment, run -in (2-weeks), active 
intervention (6 -weeks), and post -intervention (6 -weeks) periods.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_792501] of outcome assessment questions, see Appendix . 
 
3.2.2  Cohort 1: Any vehicle trip in past [ADDRESS_792502] between front and rear -seat passenger  trips or driver versus 
passenger trips.  
 
3.2.3  Cohort 2: Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks where individual reports phone was used to type 
while driving and car was moving .  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_599072] (TWD) has been shown to increase collision 
or near -collision event risk by [CONTACT_1192] -fold (Fitch et al., 2013), and studies among younger drivers have 
found that TWD is associated with 35% slower reaction times (Reed and Robbins, 2008) and a four -
fold increase in time spent looking away from the road compared to those driving undistracted 
(Hosking et al., 2006 ). We chose to asses not just typi[INVESTIGATOR_599073], but any typi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a phone, 
as there are a number of platforms for communication outside of texting that are commonly used 
(e.g. Google searches, social media messaging, location -based services).  
 
3.2.4 Cohort 3 : Any vehicle trip in past 2 weeks where individual reports driving a vehicle within 3 
hours of  consuming 3 or more drinks .  The risk of a motor vehicle crash increases exponentially with 
elevated blood alcohol content (NHTSA). We chose as an outcome driving a vehicle within [ADDRESS_792503] 0.05 
mg/dl, which would inidicate some psychomotor impairment and elevated risk taking (Van Dyke & 
Filmore, 2017).    
 
3.[ADDRESS_792504] data on the following:  
 
 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.[ADDRESS_792505] 80% power for the primary outcome  for Cohort 1 ( seat 
belt use). Based on Sommers et al., 2013, we can likely expect the intervention to increase the 
percentage of subjects  reporting  seat belt  use by15% on top of self -monioting alone. Using a [ADDRESS_792506] of proportions, estimating 25% of the intervention participants and 10% of the control 
(SMS self -monitoring) report always seat belt use, we  would need around 10 0 subjects per group to 
show a significant differenc e between arms.   Expecting 10% drop -out in the SMS 2 -week run -in and 
80% completing 8 -week assessments, 300 enrolled in the ED should provide an analyzed sample of 
216 (108 per arm).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_792507] s will be two -
sided, a p -value < 0.[ADDRESS_792508] 95% 
coverage. All analyses will be conduct ed on a modified intention -to-treat basis only including 
participant s responding to at least one week of SMS assessments during the intervention period . 
The two groups will be compared in relation to baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics. 
The persons conducting the statistical analysis will be blinded to the randomized allocation. Groups 
will b e designated as “A” and “B”  until all pre -specified analyse s are perfor med and shared with all 
authors.  
 
4.2.2 Primary Analysi s 
At baseline, all participants (based on screening criteria) all had the risk factor . At subsequent time 
points, participants are analyzed as having/not having the same risk factor by  [CONTACT_196880].  
For our primary analysis, we will examine the proportion of participants in each group (SMS 
intervention; assessment control) who report the risk behavior  using a chi -squared test of 
proportions . We will then perform a logistical regression, entering any baseline attribute that has 
univariate association with the outcome in the final model. We will report the difference in 
percentage with pr imary outcomes as well as odds ratios (from logistical regressions) with 95% 
confidence intervals The α level is set at .[ADDRESS_792509] 50% of the SMS assessments during the intervention 
perio d, and the percentage of  ED patients enrolled in the Intervention arm who found the program 
helpful will be calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals. We will explore whether 
individual factors (e.g. sex, race, education) are associated with enrolling, meeting run -in criteria, 
completing SMS as sessments or finding the program helpful using multi -level modeling. We will 
examine whether perceived norms, perceived control, or perceived risk  differed between treatment 
arms.  We will explore the slope of change over time in SMS risk reports using generized estimating 
equations (GEE) with log link function, examining time, treatment and time*treatment effects. Any 
individual factors signifianctly associated with SMS assessment completion will be included as 
 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.[ADDRESS_792510] estimates and account for 
clustering of outcome data within individuals. Results will be presented as odds ratios with 95% 
confidence intervals.   
 
Handling Missing Outcome Data : If a participant  is missing outcome assessment  time point s (week 8 
or week 14), vehicle risk behavior  will be  imputed based on a pre -defined plan as follows. If a 
participant has reported that risk via SMS weekly reports, we will use those values for missing weeks. 
If either of the prior [ADDRESS_792511] conservative estimate of 
the missing value.  Sensitivity analyses w ill be  performed using various other imputation techniques , 
including multiple chained imputations using baseleine and prior SMS reports . 
 
4.2.4  Subgroup analyses  
The analysis will include three  pre-defined subgroup analyses  for the primary and key secondary 
outcomes  according to 1) participant s with high baseline  impulsivity (based on delay discount task 
or self -report (S -UPPS); 2) participants with low perceived danger (defined as those who report No 
danger associated with target vehicle risk); and 3)  participants with low perceived control (i.e. 
disagree with being able to control behavior)  . These cut-off were  chosen to represent a population 
with the highest  predicted likelihood of injury due to vehicle risks.  The trial is not powered  to detect 
subgroup differences and these will be considered exploratory and  hypothesis generating.    
 
4.2.5 Statistical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_599074]. There will be no predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_599075].  
 
5. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
5.1 Data collection process  
Data collection will be the responsibility of the individual site investigators with oversite from the trial 
coordinating center. All baseline and outcome variables  (i.e. demographics, vehicle risk behaviors ) 
will be obtained prospectively from electronic surveys . Data will be entered directly into the  online  
database software (see below ).  
 
5.2 Variables  
Measure library is included in the Appendix.  
 
5.3 Data quality and validity  
Data quality and validity will  be optimized by [CONTACT_2329] a detailed data dictionary  which will be 
distributed to all sites . Data quality will be monitored both centrally by [CONTACT_599085].  
 
5.4 Data storage and security  
All data will be stored and secured by [CONTACT_599086], the Director of the Office of Academic 
Computing (OAC) at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC). Baseline data will be entered 
into Web Data Xpress ,  a web -based data entry system that enables users to add and edit records 
in a database.   By [CONTACT_599087] (SSL) and user authentication, users can be 
assured that data transmitted over the internet is safe and secure.   The system to send, receive and 
process text messages, was developed on the OAC SQL Server [ADDRESS_792512] 7-years at each site (or longer depending on local IRB guidelines) . 
 
6.[ADDRESS_792513] adverse consequences for subjects or damage their 
financial standing, employability, insurability, or reputation. Additionally, we  are enrolling underage 
individuals , which risk disclosure of illegal activity  associated with alcohol and/or drug use . Participant s 
face some risk of loss of confidentiality due to the nature of data acquisition  through the internet and cell 
phone SMS . First, participants may have information on their mobile  phone that is seen by [CONTACT_24663]. 
As well, there may be the rare risk that someone not associated with this research sees their medical 
record or data as a result of their participation in this research. Overall, t he likelihood of any of these risks 
causing a subject any serious discomfort or inconvenience is very low.  Confidentiality of information will 
be maximized in accordance with HIPPA regulations.   
 
6.[ADDRESS_792514] RISK  
6.2.1 Recruitment and Informed Consent : Eligibl e patients will be identified by a Research Associate 
with clinical appointments at enrolling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  The RA will conduct confidential screening of ED patients 
during breaks in patient medical care. All responses to screening questions will be recorded on a secure 
web site. The Primary Investigator will audit screenings and will be available to the RA during scr eening.  
The RA will approach all permission -granting, potentially eligible patients to obtain inf ormed consent for 
study screening . To ensure privacy, family or other individuals accompanying the patient will be asked to 
leave the area prior to the screening procedures and patients will be reminded that other people may be 
able to overhear the conversation . The RA will provide tablet computer for participants to complete 
screening questionnaire immediately after informed consent.  Screening will include review of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and basic demographic information to determine how those who screen 
positive differ from those who screen negative.   Interested and eligible individuals will be asked to 
complete written informed consent. The computer shows the RA whether the participant is eligible or not, 
and whether the risks were present or not. The RA will then read a standard script based on eligibility and 
offer eligible patients study participation, obtaining written informed consen t. The RA will present an oral 
and written description of the study as part of informed  consent, including a description of the project 
procedures, potential  risks and benefits, and confidentiality. The RA will review any questions the patient 
may have during the consent process. Patients will be informed that they will be compensated for their 
time during the research assessments.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_792515] Risk: In order to  protect study participants form potential risks related to the 
loss of confidentiality and due to any discomfort that they may experience in answering any questions, the 
following steps will be taken: 1) Patients will be told that they can withdraw from th e study at any time by 
[CONTACT_442642]. 2) All information provided by [CONTACT_599088] a subject ID# and will be 
kept in locked file cabinets. The patient’s ID# can be connected to the subject’s name [CONTACT_358772] y through a 
single master file, accessible only by [CONTACT_85661]. All data and files will be entered on 
computers protected by [CONTACT_442644] a locked office. 3) All research staff will be trained in the 
importance of maintaining confid entiality and will undergo annual mandatory training of human subjects 
research. 4) All patient data will be presented in aggregate and no individuals will be identified 
individually.  Additionally, we will make every effort to ensure that subject informat ion is protected so only 
 
SaVE Trial Protocol v.1.[ADDRESS_792516] protection on their cell phones and to erase messages after responding to minimize the 
chance of loss of private information. We state explicitly in the consent that we will not be able to respond 
in real -time to any concern a patient has that is outside the expected responses that is sent t o our phone 
number, nor any text message outside the scope of the question we ask. Immediate or emergency text -
messages that are received and outside the scope of the questions we sent will all receive a standardized 
text message, stating "We appreciate yo ur participation. If you have an emergency, please call 911." As 
well, all messages are archived in our database and will be reviewed at least every 2 days by [CONTACT_4520].  At the end of this study, the data key will be destroyed.  
 
6.2.3 Certificte of Confidentiality : Because we are collecting data that is sensitive, we will seek a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.  
 
6.2.4  Potential Benefits to Individual Participants: All participants (and those who screen positive) 
will be offered an informational sheet on vehicle risks. Particiapnts in both treatment arms will also be 
prompted to self -monitor their vehicle risks over a period of [ADDRESS_792517], 
individual participants enrolled in our study and randomized to the treatment arm will also benefit in 
learning improved vehicle safety behaviors.  
 
6.2.4 Potential Benefits to Society: Risky vehicle behaivors are associated with increased 
probability of serious injury due to motor vehicle crashes. No current existing behavioral support tool 
exists to reduce these risky behviors. Our study, assuming our hypothesis is confirmed, will provi de 
strong support for the widespread adoption of an SMS program for young adults with these risks. This, 
in turn, could significantly reduce the global burden of injury -related morbidity and mortality.  
  
 
7. MONITORING  
7.[ADDRESS_792518] (IRB)  
The study will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_599089].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_792519] monthly by [CONTACT_599090] R esearch Meeting (DCRM) of the Department 
of Emergency Medicine. This DCRM includes senior researchers in the Department of Emergency 
Medicine and is responsible for continual review of all non -exempt studies involving patients. At 
least one investigator of  this study will attend these meetings. All members  of the DCRM have 
considerable research and clinical experience to evaluate the study’s recruitment and retention 
procedures, to monitor any potential significant benefits or risks that may occur so as to warrant the 
early termination of the study and to m onitor study progress. Additionally, bi -weekly meetings will be 
held with primary investigators and research assistants to review research process. Any significant 
issues or variations from protocol relate d to this study will be reported to Department of Emergency 
Medicine DCRM and to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_599076] a timely fashion. 
Upon study renewal, a monitoring report will be provided to the  IRB.

8.2 Screening & Enrollment  
Enrollment at each site will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_599091].  Each site will maintain a screening log including all participant s who meet all eligibility  
criteria at that site. A standardized screening log will be kept using WebDataXpress, thus allowing 
for continuous updating of the screening log  and will allow capture of all screening failures .    
 
Enrollment will be competitive (i.e. without specific enrollment caps). Number of enrollments at each 
site will be shared with all sites on a monthly basis.  Sites will be expected to complete all elements 
of the online screening and enrollment forms for each subject.  In the case that a site continuously 
underperforms despi[INVESTIGATOR_599077], the Investigators  will evaluate whether 
enrollment will continue at that site.

10. PUBLICATION S 
We plan to write 3 separate main manuscripts describing findings related to Cogorts 1,2, &3. The 
manuscript s will adhere to the CONSORT guidelines. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599078]. At a minimum, all members of the Investigator Team  will be 
included in the primary author list. The main results will be presented at an international conference. 
The trial results wil l be shared with participating sites and via press releases but not directly with the 
participant s. 
 
11. DATA SHARING  
Six months after the publication of the last results, all de -identified individual participant  data will be 
made available for data sharing. Procedures, including re -coding of key variables, will be put in 
place to allow for complete de -identification of the data. All relevant trial -related documents, 
including the protocol, data dictionary, and th e main statistical code, will be shared along with the 
data. There will be no predetermined end date for the data sharing. Data will be available for any 
research purpose to all interested parties who have approval from an independent ethics review 
committ ee and who have a methodological sound proposal as determined by [CONTACT_599092]. Interested parties will be able to request the data by [CONTACT_70855]. Authorship of publications emerging from the shared data will follow standard 
authorship guidelines from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and might or 
might not include authors from the steering committee depending on the nature of their involvement.

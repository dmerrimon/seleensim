Ventricular Arrhythmia s 
 
Objective:  This study will examine the safety and efficacy  of intramural needle  
ablation (INA) in the treatment of intramural ventricular arrhythmias  
in patients for whom standard RF ablation  has been unsuccessful . We 
hypothesize that the increased current density and improved rates of 
transmural lesi on creation seen with intramural needle  ablation w ill 
lead to successful arrhythmia termination with minimal or no 
increased risk of complication.

undergoing ablation. Patients are considered eligible  to undergo 
intramural needle  ablation if they meet the following criteria  1) a) 
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT ); b) frequent ventricular 
arrhythmia  (including unifocal PVCs, couplets, or nonsustained VT) 
with a PVC burden ≥ 13%, or is causing a decline in left ventricular 
(LV) ejection fraction to <40%; or c) previous failed ablation for one 
or more of the criteria above , 2) Age 16 or older; 3) Left v entricular 
(LV) ejection  fraction > 10% as estimated by [CONTACT_51541], 
contrast ventriculography or radionuclide imaging within the past 90 
days; 4)  Clinical indication for catheter ablation of VT; 5) Ventricular 
arrhythmias not terminable with standard ablation once enrolled in the 
Intramural Needle Ablation study  or previous failed  ablation within 6 
months prior to enrollment;   6) Able and willing to comply with all 
pre-, post-, and follow -up testing and requirements ; 7) Signed 
informed consen t (for patients < 18 years old, parental consent will be 
obtained with patient assent) ; 8) Projected lifespan greater than 1 year .  
 
Patients will be excluded from the trial if:1) history of MI or CAB G 
within 6 weeks; 2) Class IV HF; 3 ) Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias  
defined as VT  or PVCs that occur without evidence of structural heart 
disease and that are not causing significant depression of LV function ; 
4) pregnant; 5) Definite protruding left ventricular thrombus on pre -
ablation echocardiography or other imaging modalities; 6)

2 STUDY  OBJECTIVE  
 
This prospective, single center observational study will exami ne the role of intramural needle  
radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of intramural ventricular arrhythmias  in patients wh o have 
failed standard RF ablation. We hypoth esize that the increased current density and improved rates of 
transmural l esion creation seen with intramural needle  RF ablation will lead to successful arrhythmia 
termination with minimal or no increased risk of complication.  
 
 
3 INTRODUCTION , RATIONALE  
 
Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is the most commonly employed method for the catheter treatment of 
cardiac arrhythmias. Myocardial scar serves as the most frequent substrate for the genesis of both atrial 
and ventricular arrhythmias . Such scar frequently con tains surviving myocyte bundles interspersed with 
fibrotic tissue, which leads to slow conduction. Areas of denser fibrosis cause conduction block. When 
appropriately arranged, conduction through or around these scars leads to the creation of a “reentry” 
circuit through which an arrhythmia is generated and maintained.1 Each reentry circuit contains within it 
an area called the isthmus, a portion of the circuit located in a position intimately related to the scar 
border zone. Electrical activation travels slowly through the isthmus before breaking out into normal 
myocardium. Ablation at the site of an isthmus will terminate a reentrant tachycardia.2  
 
RF ablation is also  commonly used for the treatment of i solated premature ventricular contractions 
(PVCs), couplets, and non -sustained VT that occur in patient s without structural heart disease.  However, 
when frequent, ventricular ectopy can result in left ventricular d ysfunction and increased risk of 
congestive heart failure.  PVC-induced cardiomyopathy appears to be a distinct entity from tachycardia -
induced cardiomyopathy.  Patients who develop cardiomyopathy have overall heart rates similar to those 
with PVCs who do not develop LV dysfunction.3  But higher PVC burdens clearly portend greater risk for  
cardiomyopathy.  One study reported a 24% PVC burden to have the best combination of sensitivity and 
specificity in identifying patients likely to develop cardiomyopathy, though LV function improvements 
occur following catheter ablation with PVC burdens as low as 10% .4  In a four-center study, a 13% PVC 
burden predicted, with 100 percent sensitivity and 85 percent specificity, an absolute increase of 5% in 
the LV ejection fraction after catheter ablation.21 
 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   7 
 A variety of techniques, including electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_623594], entrainment , and substrate 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], are employed during electrophysiologic (EP) study to identify areas of myocardial scar and 
potential isthmus sites. Points or lines of ablation using RF energy are then created in an attempt to 
interrupt the reent ry circuit. Similarly, activation or pace -mappi[INVESTIGATOR_623595].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], RF energy is applied via a catheter tip electrode to the endocardial or epi[INVESTIGATOR_623596]’s skin. RF energy in this 
setting is dispersed through the entirety of the tissue between catheter tip and grounding pad. The 
standard [ADDRESS_830334] with the catheter tip ; myocardial cell death occurs several millimeters more deeply 
through passive, conductive heating, which spreads outward from the contact [CONTACT_2929].[ADDRESS_830335] RF energy to a larger area of myocardium. A 
larger interface between catheter tip and blood improves cooling and allows for the delivery of mor e 
power without a rise in impeda nce.6 The clinical use of these larger catheters can, however, be limited b y 
rapid temperature rises at the catheter -tissue interface, resulting in thrombus formation, char, and “steam 
pop” rupture of the endocardial surface.[ADDRESS_830336] ablation techniques.

4.1 HARDWARE / SOFTWARE / CATHETERS  
 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   8 
 The needle -tipped ablation catheter is a deflectable catheter with a distal bipole (dome and ring 
electrodes) with an extendable/retractable 27 -gauge nitinol needle. The needle has a central lumen 
through which saline can be infused. It has an embedded thermocouple and a position sensor within the 
tip which is compatible with an electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816] (Carto; Biosense Webster). The needle 
can be extended or retracted to adjust the depth . It can be locked in position  at the desired depth. In its 
fully retracted position, it is entirely within the catheter tip, whereas, when fully deployed, it extends 12 
mm beyond the tip.  The depth of extension can be preset and the needle can be locked in position with an 
adjustable plunge activator.  During catheter manipulation, the needle is kept retracted and irrigat ed with 
0.9% saline (with 2 U/mL  heparin) at 1 mL/min.  
 
Recording and  pacing are possible from both the external electrodes and from the needle . Bipolar 
recordings  are generated  between the needle and ring electrode (filtered 30 –500 Hz), and between the 
needle and an inferior vena cava electrode, as well (filtered 30 –500 Hz, and separately, filtered 0.5 –500 
Hz). 
 
At target sites of VT circuits , the catheter tip is placed roughly perpendicular to the endocardial surface. 
Infusion is discontinued and the needle is extended 7 to 9 mm into the myocardium.  One ml of infusate 
(50% NaCl solution [with 2U/mL h eparin], 50% iopamidol [76%]) is injected into the myo cardium, after 
which heparinized saline ( 2 U/mL, 0.9% NaCl) i s infused at 1 mL/min for [ADDRESS_830337] is confirmed with fluoroscopy to ensure intramy ocardial positioning and to rule out perforation . 
Temperature -controlled power i s delivered for 60 to 90 s with temperature limited to 60°C and power

and subxiphoid puncture approach, respectively. Prolonged, split, or isolated late potential s will be 
tagged. For unipolar  RF, power will be set to 30 –50 W at 30 -cm3 irrigation, targeting an impedance drop 
of >10 . In the epic ardium, power will be set to 15 –30 W with 5 -ml/min irrigation. The use of the 
percutaneous left ventricular assist device in patients with  ventricular tachycardia  (VT) allows for 
prolonged mappi[INVESTIGATOR_623600]. Termination during VT will  therefore the preferr ed initial strategy for 
these patients, followed by [CONTACT_623611]. The procedural end point will be  non-inducibility  of 
VT.  
 
Intramural Needle  Ablation  of Ventricular Arrhythmias;  
INA will be performed with Intramural Needle Ablation catheter, a retractable needle -tipped catheter 
(Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, [LOCATION_003]). The catheter will be positioned at locations 
determine d on the basis of activation or entrainment mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Saline solution (0.9% NaCl, 19◦C) will be 
infused through the ne edle into the myocardium at 1 mL/min for 60 seconds using an automatic injector 
(Mark V, Medrad, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA, [LOCATION_003]). Ablation will be initiated with RF energy (500 kHz, Stockert -70 
RF Generator, Stockert GMBH, Freiburg, [LOCATION_013]) which will be delivered b etween the needle and a 
skin patch electrode. Power will be manually titrated between 30 -50 W (limiting catheter tip temperatures 
to < 60oC) over 60 -90 seconds for an impedance drop of up to 30 -40 . Ablation will be terminated or the 
power down -titrated if a sudden rise in temperature or a rapid fall or rise in impedance is seen.

the consent form home to contemplate whether he/she would like to be enrolled in the study (see 
Appendix 1 for informed consent form.)  Only patients who voluntarily provide consen t will be included 
in this study.  Consent will be obtained prior to undergoing the ablation procedure. Patients will be able to 
withdraw from the study at any point without compromising their medical care. All data will be de -
identified and protected in a ccordance with institutional and HIPAA guidelines, including 1) de -
identification of all geographic subdivisions smaller than a state; 2) all elements of dates related to the

with subjects who have no VT ablation during the procedure.  Patients succes sfully treated with standard 
ablation once enrolled will be enrolled and will be followed in a registry for 6 months (adhering to the 
same post -procedure schedule as the patients tha t underwent INA ). 
 
 
VERSION 1.[ADDRESS_830345] of care in all patients undergoing VT abla tion, 
and INA ablation as an experimental procedure employed only if patient had an unsuccessful 
ablation within six  months prior to enrollment  or if the index ablation procedure  proves 
unsuccessful. Unsuccessful ablation is defined as the inability to terminate ventricular 
arrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias that are  still inducible following ablation. 
The following  tests and procedures will occur before the ablation  as a routine part of pre -
procedural medical assessment  (all done within 30 days prior to procedure unless noted below) : 
 
 Recording of patient medical history (including details of VT both clinical/ICD)  
 Recording medication history (including all anti-arrhythmic drugs  used and duration of use)  
 Obtain β-HCG in females of child bearing age the mornin g of the procedure as per usual 
clinical practice  
 Baseline assessment of arrhythmia burden and type:  
 Office/inpatient records, ICD interrogation report  

VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   13 
  For patients being considered for PVC ablation only: 24 -Hour Holter monitoring (within 
three months)  
 Review pre-procedural imaging  (within three months) : MRI/CT  (optional) , TTE. 
 Baseline laboratory, includ ing complete blood count, standard electrolyte panel, renal 
function, and brain natriuretic peptide levels.  
 Consent must be obtained before the VT ablation procedure.  
 
10.2    PRE-PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT  
 
Management of pre -procedural anti -platelet a nd anti-thrombotic medications will be at the 
discretion of the primary operator. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], however, these medications will be continued 
through the procedure. Every effort will be made to maximize beta -blocker, ACE -i/ARB, and 
aldosterone antagonist thera py per current guidelines.  
 
10.3    VT ABLATION PROCEDURAL DETAILS  
 
 Patients will be brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state . 
 General anesthesia or conscious sedation will be used for sedation.  
 Patients will undergo electrophysiology study and VT ablation as per standard practice . 
 If a patient’s arrhythmia cannot be eliminated wit h standard  ablation or if the patient has 
failed ablation by [CONTACT_314481] , the patient will undergo INA. The INA 
hardware/software will be employed  as described above . 
 Therapeutic anticoagulation will be administered with intravenous heparin with a target 
ACT of 300 seconds or greater.  
 Esophageal temperature monitoring is required when ablation is performed in the 
coronary sinus or e pi[INVESTIGATOR_623602].   Ablation should be stopped when esophageal temperature 
is 38.5oC. 
 Procedural endpoint will be non -inducibility of clinical VT.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_830346]-PROCEDURE FOLLOW UP 
 
 All patients will be monitored to verify vascular hemostasis prior to discharge from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 The majority of patients will receive either warfarin or a novel oral anti -coagulant 
(dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822])  for 4-[ADDRESS_830347] -procedure . Those patients 
with less extensive ablations may receive oral aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 -325 mg daily) or 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (75 mg daily). These decisions will be made at the discretion of the 
primary operator per current guidelines.  
 A proton pum p inhibitor is recommended for any significant esophageal temperature 
rises noted during the procedure as determined by [CONTACT_1963].  However, if 
the esophageal temperature is noted to have been 41.0oC, a proton pump inhibitor is 
required for a  minimum of 4 weeks following the ablation procedure.   
 Medication and adverse event review will be performed prior to discharge.  
 Complications including vascular, stroke, heart failure , pericardial effusion, 
tamponade, bleeding, and death will be documented.  
 The total numb er of epi[INVESTIGATOR_51496], ATP, and s hocks will be documented at all 
visits.

 Therapeutic anticoagulation beyond t he requisite 4-[ADDRESS_830349] -procedure time  point 
will be at the discretion of the patient’s physician.  
 
10.4.3    REPEAT VT ABLATION PROCEDURES  
   
 One repeat intramural needle  ablation procedure may be performed within the six-
month follow -up period  post procedure at the discretion  of the ph ysician and the 
participant will be deemed a treatment failure .  Additionally, should a participant 
finish the six -month follow -up period and require a repeat intramural needle ablation 
for ventricular arrhythmias  at a later date, the patient may be re -enrolled and re-
consented in the trial using  the same identification number . Primary and secondary 
endpoints in these re -enrolled patients will be re -assessed at six months post -second 
procedure .  The maximum allowab le number of intramural needle ablation 
procedures for any participant is two, irrespective of the timing  of the second

An adverse event is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a study patient, whether or not it is related to 
the study intervention.  Any condition that was recorded as pre -existing is not an adverse event  unless 
there is a change in the nature, severity or  degree of the condition.   
 
Serious Adverse Event  
 
Serious adverse events are defined by [CONTACT_384840] a fatality or is life 
threatening; results in significant or persistent disability; requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; results in 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   15 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to 
research subjects or others, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372]. Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623604] a serious adverse event 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medical events include br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  
 
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Event  
 
An unanticipated (unexpected) serious adverse event is any se rious adverse event that is not protocol -
defined or documented in the patient consent form.  Expedited reporting is required for serious adverse 
events that are unexpected.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
An unanticipated adverse device effects (UA DE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigationa l plan, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects. 
 
Event Recording  
 
The following adverse events will be captured throughout the period of trial participation:  
 
 Protocol-defined (as described below)  
 Serious unanticipated events (serious “Other” adverse events)  
 
Causality  
 
The investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the i ntervention. Causality will be 
defined as follows:  
 
Probable 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, are considered with a high degree of 
certainty to be related to the ablation procedure.  The following characteristics will apply:  
o A reasonable temporal relationship exists between the event and the int ervention, and  
o The event is a known reaction to the intervention, and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_623614]/individual.  
Possible 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a probable 
relationship to the intervention, but for which a connection cannot be ruled out with certainty. 
The following characteristics will apply:  
 
o The event occurs after intervention, and  
o The event is not a known reaction to intervention, but canno t be explained by a 
commonly occurring alternative etiology  
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   16 
 Unlikely  
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a possible or 
probable relationship to intervention and for which a connection is unlikely. The follow ing 
characteristics will apply:  
o The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
intervention, or  
o May have been produced by [CONTACT_80238], and there is no apparent pattern of 
response to the intervention.  
Reportin g of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
All investigators must report both expected (protocol -defined) and unexpected SAEs. All protocol defined 
SAEs must be reported directly to the clinical center’s IRB and the DCC within [ADDRESS_830351] be reported to the Data Coordinating Center ( DCC) and the clinical center’s IRB within [ADDRESS_830352] be reported to the DCC and the clinical 
center’s IRB within [ADDRESS_830353] be reported to the 
DCC within 5 calendar days of knowledge of the event, or as dictated by [CONTACT_623615], 
whichever is sooner.  
 
DCC Reporting to FDA  
 
The DCC will report unexpected SAEs that are possibly or probably related to the investigational device 
or UADEs to FDA as appropriate. The DCC will send an initial IDE safety report communication to the 
FDA within 2 business days of notification from the site. The DCC will submit a follow -up safety 
communication to the FDA, based on source documentation or PI [INVESTIGATOR_623605], within 10 business 
days from notification of a UADE for this IDE trial.  
 
Data Monitoring Committee  
 
To meet the study's ethical  responsibility to its subjects, an independent Data Monitoring Committee  
(DMC) will monitor results during the study.  The committee will consist of a cardiologist who has no 
formal involvement or conflict of interest with the subjects, the investigators,  the sponsor or the 
DCC.  The DMC will act in a senior advisory capacity to the DCC regarding data and safety matters 
throughout the duration of the study. In addition, the DMC will review interim summary results of the 
accumulating data every 6 months  or on an as needed basis depending on enrollment figures.   These 
data include adverse events (e.g., infection, bleeding, right heart failure) and mortality.  They will 
communicate their findings directly with the DCC. The FDA will be provided a copy of any wr itten 
VERSION 1.[ADDRESS_830354] with the members of DMC regarding this  trial and no voting 
member of the committee may participate in the study as an investigator.  Non -DMC members will not be 
allowed during DMC closed meetings.   
 
Interim Analyses  
 
An interim analys is will be performed after the enrollment of 20 subjects. This analysis will be presented 
to the DMC, who has the authority to terminate the study prematurely if an increase in adverse events is 
encountered. If the DMC determines the trial should be stopped  early because of safety concerns, or 
otherwise modified, the DMC will prepare formal written recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_623606]. Moreover, any pressing safety concerns that the DMC identifies will be verbally communicated to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_87953], prior to written documentation. The trial will be terminated early if severe 
procedure -related adverse events occur in more than 15% of patients. 
 
 
12   RISKS 
 
Patient confidentiality risks associated with any research study are  minimal and i nclude: breach of 
confidentiality and loss of personal data.  
 
The risks associated with an intramural needle ablation catheter are expected to be similar to 
those for ablation of ventricular arrhythmias with standard ablation catheters.  
 
As the protocol includes a standard of care  VT ablation procedure , the risks of the procedur e are generic 
to a standard VT procedure, and include the following :  
 
Potential Risks Associated with VT Ablation  
 
 Death: End of Life (1%).  
 Cardiogenic shock: when the heart has been damaged so much that it is unable to supply enough 
blood to the organs of the body (<1%).  
 Complete Heart Block: complete absence of conduction from the atria to the ventricles during a 
stable supraventricular rhy thm (2%).  
 New incessant VT/VF: new arrhythmias may occur as a result of damage to the heart’s electrical 
system. It may be necessary to shock your heart to stop the rhythm (<1%).  
 Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): blocked blood supply to the heart that may cause damage to 
the heart muscle and affect how you feel and how well your heart can pump blood. This is often 
treated with drugs or may require surgical repair (1.5%).  
 Stroke (also called Cardiovascular Accident or CVA): may cause an interruption in the blood 
supply to a part of the brain (~2 -4%).  
 Pericarditis: inflammation may occur in the outer lining of the heart (<1%).  
 Cardiac perforation causing pleural effusion or tampona de: fluid build -up around the heart. A 
hole in your heart wall ( perforation ) could result in bleeding into the sac, called the pericardium, 
which surrounds your heart ( cardiac tamponade ). This may be treated by [CONTACT_180541] a needle, 
through your chest wal l, into the sac and removal of the blood. This type of hole sometimes 
requires surgical repair (1.5%).  
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   18 
  Adverse effects on implantable pacemakers, cardioverters, and defibrillators. An example is 
dislodgement of ICD leads: (<1%).  
 Coronary artery occlusion : a partial or complete block of blood flow in a coronary (heart) artery 
(<1%).  
 Heart Valve injury (also called Valvular Damage/Insufficiency): an injury to a valve structure 
resulting in a loss and/or worsening of function (e.g., worsening of regurgitati on score or 
prolapse) (<1%).  
 Acute Pulmonary edema: fluid accumulation (build -up) in the lungs (<1%).  
 Pulmonary embolism: blockage of a pulmonary artery; a blood clot from a vein may get stuck in 
the lungs. This is usually treated with drugs (<1%).  
 Vascular access complications: an obstruction or perforation or damage to the vascular (blood 
vessel) system (2%).  
 Arterial/venous thrombus: clot formation in the artery or vein (1.5%).  
 AV fistula: an abnormal passageway (such as a hole) between an artery an d a vein; this may 
allow blood to go between the arteries and veins and not through the entire body. This may cause 
some part of the body to not receive the usual amount of blood. This may heal on its own, but 
may require surgical repair (1.5%).  
 Catheter insertion site hematoma: bleeding or bruising from the site of catheter placement. This 
may go away without treatment, but may require manual compression or surgical repair. If 
excessive bleeding at the site of the catheter placement continues, this could result in anemia 
requiring medical intervention (2%).  
 Esophageal injury:  the esophagus is located in close proximity to the left atrium and ventricles.  
Esophageal injury may occur from radiofrequency ablation  and most often heals on its own.  In 
rare situations, a communication may develop a cardiac chamber and the esophagus.  This may 
present as fever, hematemesis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or stroke.  This complication requires 
emergency surgical repair and is associated with a high mortality .  The incidence of a fistula 
forming between a cardiac chamber and the esophagus following ventricular tachycardia ablation 
is very rare (< 0.1%).  
 Hemo-pneumothorax: bleeding in the chest (also called hemothorax); blood may leak into the 
chest cavity putting pre ssure on internal organs like your lungs (also called hemo -pneumothorax). 
This may be treated by [CONTACT_2329] a needle or suction to remove the excess blood or it may require 
surgical repair. Pneumothorax may also occur when gas or air is present in the pleural ( chest) 
cavity (<1%).  
 Hypoxia: reduced oxygen supply to tissue (<1%).  
 Infection, Localized or systemic: an infection may occur anywhere an incision or cut is made 
during the procedure (<1%).  
 Peripheral venous thrombosis: blood clots in the vein (<1%).  
 Phrenic nerve damage: damage to the nerve that controls the diaphragm and may affect your 
breathing. Symptoms may be temporary but in some cases can be permanent (respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374]) 
(<1%). 
 Pneumonia: infection of lungs or gathering of fluid in the lungs (<1%).  
 Pseudoaneurysm: development of a false pouch in the vessel wall. This can be caused by 
[CONTACT_623616]. This may heal on its own, but sometimes need 
surgical repair (<1%).  
 Radiation injury resulting in dermatitis (skin burns): (<1%). 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]: damage to breathing that can be permanent (respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374]) (<1%).  
 Radiation exposure during the fluoroscopic imaging of the catheters during ablation: this may 
slightly increase the lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fatal malign ancy or a genetic defect in offspring 
(<1%). 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   19 
  Fluid overload: excessive fluid built up could result in pulmonary (lung) edema; congestive heart 
failure (CHF) may occur or may be exacerbated (worsened) due to delivery of sterile salt water 
(saline) during th e procedure (these risks are specific to open irrigated ablation catheters) (1.5%).  
 Post-procedural hypotension defined as: systolic blood pressure of < 80 mmHg or hypotension 
that requires administration of vasopressors ( ~20%). 
 
There are risks associated  with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_623607]  
 
 RV puncture with no clinical consequence: a rupture or hole (perforation) in the right ventricular 
heart of no clinical significance (15%).  
 Pericardial bleeding: blood in the pericardial sac (~7%).  
 Hemoperitoneum: blood in the peritoneal cavity due to damage to abdominal vessel / organ 
(<1%). 
 Coronary Artery Damage: see definition for Coronary Artery Occlusion above (~0.6%).  
 Phrenic Nerve Damage: see definition for Phrenic Nerve Damage above (~0.6%).  
 Pleural damage: see definition for Hemo -pneumothorax above (~1.5%).  
 MI: see definition for acute myocardial infarction above (~0.6%).  
 Tamponade: see definition for Cardiac Perforation above (~4%).  
 Abdominal bleeding: uncontrolled bleeding in the abdomen (~ 0.5%) . 
 Pericarditis: see definition of Pericarditis above (~21%).  
 Esophageal injury:  the esophagus is located in close proximity to the left atrium and ventricles.  
Esophageal injury may occur from radiofrequency ablation , particularly in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623608] e 
coronary sinus.  This most often heals on its own.  In rare situations, a  fistula may develop a 
cardiac chamber and the esophagus.  This may present as fever, hematemesis, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, or stroke.  This complication requires emergency surgic al repair and is associated with a 
high mortality .  The incidence of a fistula forming between a cardiac chamber and the esophagus 
following ventricular tachycardia ablation is very rare (<0.1%).  
 
 
13   STUDY MANAGEMENT  
 
13.1 Study Data Collection and Processing  
 
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF must 
be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must be kept 
current to reflect patient status during the cou rse of the study.  Patients will be identified by a [ADDRESS_830355] numbers (or other personal identifiers) for their own reference. All study -related documen ts 
(CRFs, source medical records, regulatory binder) must be kept in a secure, locked environment with 
access limited to study personnel only.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_623609]: 1) adherence to the protocol; 2) verifying adherence 
to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research; and 3) ensuring completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  
 
Final CRFs in human readable format must be reviewed and verified for accuracy by [CONTACT_623617] r and signed -off.  A copy of the final CRF will remain at the investigator’s site at 
the completion of the study.  
 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   20 
 The CRF numbering convention is as follows:  
 
_01_-_2_ _3__4_ A -B -A 
_01_: Site # must be 2 digits (use leading zero) --- (sites 01-10) 
 
_2_ _3__4_: patient screening/enrollment # (001 – 500)—must be 3 digits  
 
A-B-A: Patient initials (if no middle initial, use dash)  
Total [ADDRESS_830356] parties (for  example 
in case of an audit performed by [CONTACT_12721]) provided the data are treated  confidential and 
that the patient’s privacy is protected.   
 
13.3   Deviations from Protocol  
 
The investigator will not deviate from the protocol except in medica l emergencies or in unforeseen, 
isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase t he patient’s risk or affect the 
validity of the trial.  In  medical emergencies, prior approval for pr otocol deviations will not be 
required, but the IRB/EC must be notified within five days of the incident.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_830357] responsibilities and will delegate other responsibilities to his research staff and the 
Coordinati ng Center,  the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai . The coordinating center will: 1) 
ensure adherence to the national  and institutio nal regulations; 2) develop and distribute protocols and 
case report forms; 3) coordinate  data organ ization; 4) perform statistical analyses; 5.) provide on-site 
and remote monitoring.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_830358] of the procedure will 
be included within the Disease Related Group (DRG) charge, neither patient nor insurance provider 
will incur additional cost.  
 
 
14   ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
VERSION 1.4 - September 2018   21 
 14.1 Maintaining  Records (21 CFR 812. 140 (B))  
 
All clinical sites will maintain study records for two years after research termination.  The 
Coordinating center will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_106152], data, shipment of devices, adverse 
device effects and other records related to the clinical trial.   
 
14.[ADDRESS_830359] (IRB) / Ethics Committee (EC) Information  
 
This protocol and t he informed consent must be reviewed and app roved by [CONTACT_19821]/EC 
where the trial is to be conducted before enrollment of patients.  Changes to the protocol that may 
increase the risk or present new risks to the patient, or may adversely affect t he validity of the trial, 
must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_1201]/EC before the change is made.  
 
The study site Principal Investigator(s) is responsible for submitting and obtaining initial and 
continuing review (at intervals not greater than once a year) o f the trial by [CONTACT_11577]/EC.  
 
 
15   CLINICAL CENTERS    
 
The study will be conducted at 1 site in the [LOCATION_002].  Each clinical center will be required to obtain 
IRB/EC approval for the protocol and consent (and their revisions) in a timely fashion, to recruit patients, 
to collect data and enter it accurately in the electronic data capture  (EDC) system, to faithfully follow the 
protocol and adhere to the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  In addition, centers will be 
required to provide the DCC with the information necessary for interim, annual, and final reports, to 
provide source  documents, data and regulatory documents for study monitors, provide prompt responses 
to DCC inquiries, and to participate in analyses and reporting of study results.  
 
Investigator Profile  
 
All cardiologists, coordinators and other investigators in the st udy must complete the Investigator Profile 
form, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15669], address, telephone, fax,  beeper and email information.  The 
cardiologist and coordinator must email or fax their CV, Conflict of Interest Statement and Financial 
Disclosure Cer tification, and Institutional Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Certificates to the DCC.  
 
Qualifications and Training  
 
Clinical investigators will be electrophysiologists with expertise in VT ablation.  The certified operator 
will either perform the ablation on their own patient, or participate in the ablation of an enrolled patient.  
The clinical site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_623610] s ite over the course of the study.   
 
All clinical site investigators and coordinators will be trained by [CONTACT_623618] a site initiation visit in advance of patient enrollment.  In addition, the investigators and coordinators 
will undergo a separate training session to gain familiarity with the electronic data capture system.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_830360] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those 
regulations require a signed patient authorization in forming the patient of the following:  
 
1. What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients.  
2. Who will have access to that information and why.  
3. Who will use or disclose that information.  
4. The rights of a research patient to r evoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
  
In order to ensure patient confidentiality, all case report forms and patient information (CT / MRI, if 
reviewed), fluoroscopic and endoscopic images, ECGs) will be de -identified and replaced with a uniqu e 
patient identifier.  Information will be stored in the office of the local study coordinator, which will be 
kept in a secure , locked location. The research study coordinators, principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigators will be the only personnel  with access to this data. All data will be stored without any 
patient information apart from the unique three-digit patient identifier . Electronic data  will be encrypted 
and password -protected.  
 
 
17    DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Baseline clinical characteristics (e.g. age, gender, renal function) and procedural characteristics (e.g. 
surface intracardiac electrogram, and imaging findings) of the patients will be collected and analyzed. All 
continuous variables will be performed as the mean  standard deviation , and all catego rical variables as a 
percentage of the total study population .  
 
The co-primary endpoints of safety and efficacy will display events as a percentage of the total study 
population. Bar charts may be employed to demonstrate such data.  
 
Secondary data analysis will display continuous variables as the mean  standard deviation, and all 
categorical variables as a percentage of the total study population.

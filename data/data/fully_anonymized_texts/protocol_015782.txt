 1 Background  
1.1 Feasibility Studies  
Two feasibility studies were initially conducted to assess the fit and function of the Eclipse  System 
in female subjects. These studies were approved by [CONTACT_25733]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) as 
non-significant risk  (NSR) device investigations. In to tal, 86 subjects were fit with the Insert who 
wore it for up to 3 months.  Initial safety and effectiveness outcomes were deemed acceptable for 
ongoing study.   
1.2 LIFE Pi[INVESTIGATOR_713586] (Protocol CA003)  was a multi -center,  prospective, open label cl inical trial  
conducted at 6 centers in the [LOCATION_002]. As with the prior studies, all IRBs approved the trial as 
an NSR investigation. The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_716242] (FI) in adult women.    
Sixty -one (61) subjects met all study eligibility criteria and entered the 1 -month Treatment Period to 
make up the Intent to Treat Cohort.  The primary effectiveness endpoint was met: At 1 month, 
78.7% of the ITT Cohort (95% CI, 66-88%, p<0.0001) met the success criterion, defined as a 50% 
or more reduction in the number of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . Additionally, t here were no serious device -related 
adverse events  reported in the trial.  
1.3 LIBERATE  
The LIBERATE study was a mu lti-center, prospective, open label clinical trial conducted at 11 
centers in the [LOCATION_002].  As with the prior  studies, all IRBs approved the trial as an NSR 
investigation.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness among 
treatment responders  between 3 and 12 months.  
Seventy -three (73) subjects met all study eligibility criteria and entered the 12 -month Treatment 
Period to make up the Intent to Treat Cohort.  The primary effectiveness endpoint was met:  At 3 
months, 73% (95% CI 61 -82%, p<.0001)  of subjects met the success criterion, deined as a 50% or 
more reduction in the number of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  At 12 months, 70% (95% CI 58 -80%, p < 0.0001) met 
the success criterion.  Addit ionally, throughout the study there  were no serious device -related 
adverse events reported.

LIBERATE study . Patients who completed LIBERATE were offered new Eclipse devices to be used 
in the subsequent year, and were offered enrollment in LIBERATE PRO  in which they would 
complete online surveys at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. . As the registry databa se was hosted and 
maintained by [CONTACT_713621] (sponser) and no clinic visits were required of the patients, Pelvalon was 
the only site to seek and obtain IRB approval.

 1.5 Description of the Eclipse System  
1.5.1  Overview  
The Eclipse System is a vaginal bowel control (VBC) therapy intended to provide bowel control fo r 
women with fecal incontinence . Manufactured by [CONTACT_713621]  (Sunnyvale, CA), i t is comprised  of a 
non-surgical device  placed in the vagina (referred to as the “Eclipse Insert ”) and a p ressure -
regulated pump which is used to inflate and deflate the Insert.  
1.5.2  The Sizing Kit  
The Sizing Kit is a set of reusable fitting inserts (Sizers) which consist of the same stainless steel 
base and medical grade silicone coating as the Eclipse Insert, but  without the balloon that is part of 
the Eclipse system.  These reusable Sizers are available in the same base sizes as the Eclipse 
Insert, and can be reused after reprocessing in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU).  
1.5.[ADDRESS_976013].  The Trial Insert is composed of a 
base made of medical grade silicone, polycarbonate, and stain less steel, and a balloon made from 
medical grade silicone and polyurethane.  
The Trial Insert consists of base -balloon configurations sized exactly as the Eclipse Inserts are 
sized and is intended for short -term use (1 -2 weeks). This disposable Trial Inser t allows the subject 
to try one or more Insert sizes (while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fecal incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_637855]) during the Fitting 
Period before qualifying for and committing to the year -long use of the Eclipse Insert.   
A silicone inflation tube connects to the ba lloon on one end, and to  a self -closing luer valve  (Valve) 
and cap on the other end which extends outside of the subject’s vagina . An optional extension tube 
can be added between  the existing tube and the V alve to increase the length . The Valve allow s the 
user to inflate or deflate the balloon with the  Pump.  
1.5.4  The Eclipse Insert  
The Eclipse Insert is provided as a non-sterile unit for use by a single patient and i s currently 
available in a range of base sizes with two (2)  different balloon sizes . It is composed of a base 
made of medical grade silicone and stainless steel, and a balloon made of medical grade silicone 
and polyurethane.  The Eclipse Insert is graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1 . 
A silicone inflation tube connects to the balloon on one end, and to a self -closing valve  (Valve) and 
cap on the other end which extends outside of the subject’s vagina . The Valve allow s the user to 
inflate or deflate the balloon with the  Pump.  An optional extension tube can be added between  the 
existing tube and the V alve to increase the length .

Figure 1. Eclipse Insert (inflated state)  
1.5.5  The Pump  
A pressure -regulated Pump ( Figure 2) is provided to inflate and deflate the Insert . The Pump  
connects  to the Insert via the Valve.  The Pump has two ports  that connect to the Valve: one end for 
adding air  (labeled with a “+”)  and t he other end for removing air ( labeled with a “ -“). Air is moved 
through the Pump by [CONTACT_713622].  During inflation, the Pump is squeezed seven to  
ten times.  Seven pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_713584]. The balloon will not 
over-inflate because  any excess air is vented out by [CONTACT_713623]. When the balloon is fully inflated, 
the internal pressure is set to the venting pressure of the regulator.   
 
Regulators are removable so that different balloon pressures can be achieved.  Regulators and 
pumps are also designed for single -patient use only.  Three different Regulators are available that 
regulate the balloon pressures to w ithin the values listed in Table [ADDRESS_976014] PARTY WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSEN T OF  PELVALON, INC.

Inflation (mmHg)  
Low 45-[ADDRESS_976015] .  
The Insert is designed to restore bowel continence in women with FI by [CONTACT_713624], which is complex and multi -factorial. 
The Insert utilizes the naturally overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_713585] (or 
allow) stool passage in a user -controlled manner. Though separated by [CONTACT_716250], much of the vagina and rectum effectively share the same space.  When the 
rectum fills with stool, it expands, taking  up more of this shared space.  This is often palpable on a 
vaginal exam as the vagina conforms to the shape of the expanded rectum.  Similarly, when an 
object is placed in the vagina, it is often palpable in the rectum.  The redundant nature of the vaginal 
tissue makes it naturally conformable without discomfort or strain.   
The Insert  is designed such that when it is placed in the vagina and is in the  deflated state, the 
rectal space is not occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530], allowing stool to pass through normally (see Figure 3 , left). When the 
Insert is inflated, the vagina conforms around it, causing a reduction in rectal space, which h elps 
the patient prevent unwanted stool passage (see Figure 3 , right).   
In Figure 4 the Insert is shown in its deflated state. The base  of the Insert is flexible to allow for 
ease of insertion and removal, as shown in Figure 5.

1.7 Regulatory Status  of the Eclipse System  
The Eclipse System received marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration 
(FDA) on November [ADDRESS_976016] Fitting metrics (e.g. sizes 
used)  and Patient Reported Outcomes in subjects using the Eclipse System in a commercial 
setting .  
2.[ADDRESS_976017] be a new user of Eclipse or a patient returning to the clinic for her annual 
f/u visit.  All participants will be required to provide informed consent and HIPAA authorization.  
As the PURSUIT study does not have a pre -determined hypothesis o r success end -point, the 
patient target population does not have a specific minimum and the 400 patient upper bound is 
based only on budgeting and  resource availability.  
2.3 Recruitment and Enrollment  
All patients who are deemed new suitable clinical candidate s for the Eclipse System at a 
participating site will be invited to participate , as well as patients who are already using Eclipse, and 
are due for their annual device replacement  during the enrollment period  (“renewal patients”) .  
Potential subjects will be presented with information about how to sign up for the registry. Each 
subject will be directed to a study -specific URL (searchable web page) where they can read an 
electronic Informed Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization Form. I f they click on the “I agree to 
participate”, “I consent”, or similarly worded button they are taken to a registration form and are 
asked to provide their full name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address.

participate in the online surveys  and to receive future emails with the links to the online surveys to 
be completed, as well as to be contact[CONTACT_716251], email or in writing to  remind 
them  to complete the surveys, and/or to provide clarifications about the information they have been 
provided in the completed surveys . 
If a subject does not have  access to, or is unwilling to provide,  an email address, they can review a 
paper versi on of the Informed Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization form, and will be given an 
option to receive paper versions of all study surveys which can be filled out by [CONTACT_716252]. Similarly, if a site can not easily access the URL, they  can use the paper 
versions of all forms  / surveys as well . 
Enrollment in the post market registry, including the online data capture, will last for up to one year, 
and recruitment will end on 12/31/ [ADDRESS_976019] been enrolled .  
Sites wil l receive compensation for completing site surveys at each patient visit.  Subjects will 
receive compensation for their time to complete each online  (or returned hard copy)  survey, which 
will be outlined in the Informed Consent form.  
 
Enrollment will be com pleted once the annual visit is complete (approximately 1 year after 
enrollment begins).  
 
In the case of r enewal patients , if the patient is no longer local to the participating site  and is due for 
a renewal device,  the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_716243].  If the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_716244], she or her research staff may obtain the patient’s consent by 
[CONTACT_716253] a bout the 
study.  If the patient agrees to the informed consent and registers for the study as described above, 
she will be enrolled, walked through the appropriate case report forms, and the site may ship the 
renewal device  to the patient .  At the followin g annual renewal visit (approximately 1 year after 
enrollment), if the patient is unable to travel to the site, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_716245] f orms are completed online.  
 
2.4 Schedule of Events  
At the Enrollment/Fitting visit, and subsequent in -office visits (as outlined below, in Table 2 ), 
patients and clinicians will access online surveys to complete the required data collection  (or if 
necessary, u se hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) . Additionally, s ubjects will be sent an email with a link to the optional 3, 
6, and 9 month  surveys or mailed printed surveys , depending on chosen survey delivery method,  to 
be completed at each of 3, 6, and 9 month time point s as per the s chedule in  Table 2.  
 
Note that renewal patients will not require “Subsequent fitting visits” or the “Eclipse Visit ”, as they 
have been successfully fit prior to this registry study and are merely obtaining a replacement 
device.  As  such , these visits can be omitted  for these patients . 
 
For renewal patients who are no longer near their participating site and are unable to travel to the 
site, but who wish to renew their device and take part in the registry, they may be enrolled and their 
evaluations may be conducted by [CONTACT_716254] [INVESTIGATOR_439975], or by [CONTACT_98991], as described in 
section 2.3.

2.5 Surveys  
The following questionnaires or surveys will be collected  (as outlined in Table 2, above) : 
2.5.1  Bowel Health History  
The Bowel Health History survey collects information regarding the patient’s history with FI 
(symptoms and treatments), as well as other bowel health items, such as IBS and Rectal Prolapse.  
Also included are marketing questions about Eclipse and health insurance.  
2.5.2  Fitting Metrics  
Clinicians will be asked at fitting visits , Eclipse visits, and annual renewals  to provide information o n 
the fitting process.  For example, how many Inserts were used, and what sizes . 
2.5.3  Eclipse Experience Assessment  
Subjects will be asked , at in -office visits (fitting follow -ups and 12 -month visits),  to provide feedback 
on several Eclipse Experience questions related to perceptions of device comfort, satisfaction with 
usage and features, and impact on daily activities . This assessment includes t he Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement (PGI -I), a validated global index that may be used to rate the response 
of a condition to a therapy on a scale from 1 ( Very much better ) to 7 ( Very much worse ). The PGI -I 
will be used to assess improvement of accidental bowel leakage in comparison to how it was prior 
to joining the registry or starting with Eclipse.  
2.5.[ADDRESS_976020]. Marks (V aizey) Incontinence Severity Score  
The St. Mark’s (Vaizey) Incontinence Severity Score is a measure of severity of FI symptoms, 
which has been shown to correlate with improvement in frequency of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_713601]’ 
perceptions of relief.4,5,6 This score reflects the severity of FI and ranges from 0 (complete 
continence) to 24 (complete incontinence).

envelope.  
Subjects will have a 4 week window dur ing which they can complete the surveys (every 3 months 
+/- 2 weeks) from their Eclipse Fitting date  (or renewal  date) . If the surveys for the associated time 
period are not completed within this [ADDRESS_976022] one, and no more than  5, reminders ( by [CONTACT_54769]/or mail) to complete 
the surveys throughout the [ADDRESS_976023] approval  or to establish 
safety or effectiveness of the Eclipse System . There is therefore not a pre -determined hypothesis  or 
success end -point , and a statistical  analysis  plan is not required . Any data from the study used to 
support Eclipse System marketi ng claims will be analyzed per Pelvalon’s quality system statistical 
procedures.  
3.2 Analysis Population  
The Analysis Data Set (ADS) will include all subjects who consent to participate in the PURSUIT  
registry and have at least an initial fitting , or, in the c ase of a patient already using Eclipse, be 
administered an annual renewal  Eclipse . 
For any analyses that require a comparison to baseline data, or data collected at the initial fitting 
visit, patients who enroll at their Eclipse renewal will be omitted  from the ADS , as they will not have 
baseline or fitting metrics.  
3.3 Outcomes Measurements  
Outcomes Measurements will be assessed at 12 months.  Additional assessments may be made for 
interim (3, 6, 9 -month) time points. Where applicable, changes from baseline will be evaluated.  
Baseline data will be defined as data provided at the initial Fitting Visit . If the patient was previously 
using the Eclipse System (e.g. joins the registry at a yearly follow -up/renewal ), her baseline values 
will be omitted, and she will be excluded from analyses that require a baseline value.  
 
The PGI -I, assessed as part of the Eclipse Experience Assessment,  assesses c hanges from 
baseline in the control of bowel leakage,  but does not have a baseline measurement.  Instead, it  is 
rated on a 7 -point scale, where 1 is “Very much better ” and 7 is “Very much worse ”. For a given 
time point, t he average PGI -I score  will be  compu ted as the mean score across all completed 
assessments.  Other Eclipse Experience Assessment questions will be summarized descriptively.

5.2 Risks  
The main risk to being in this research study is a risk of sharing protected (personal) health information 
(PHI), and the potential breach of confident iality.  
5.3 Other Risks of the Device  
The Eclipse System Patient Guid e directs patients to report any of  the following to their doctor if they 
occur:  
• Foul odor or excessive vaginal discharge  
• Difficulty urinating or defecating  
• Significant bleeding not associated with menstruation  
• New onset or worsening pelvic pain or discomfort  
 
Good hygiene is important for the safe use of any vaginal insert.  Proper care and cleaning of the Insert is 
important to avoid common side effects related to poor hygiene such as infection, bad odor, vaginal 
discharge and itching. Proper cleaning  should reduce the likelihood of these events.

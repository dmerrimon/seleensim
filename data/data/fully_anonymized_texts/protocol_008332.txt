  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/[ADDRESS_426481].  Although 
mortality from the procedure is reported to be less than 5% in high volume centers, 
morbidity rates are much higher with reports indicating rates around 40 % [1, 2].  Two 
of the  most common complications  contributing to this high morbidity rate  include 
infections and pancreatic fistulae.   Studies have demonstrated that such complications  
have been associated with increased mortality rates  in patients undergoing pancreatic 
surgery  [3]. 
 
Many  patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy  already have a biliary  stent in place 
draining their biliary system  to prevent obstructive jaundice .  While these stents allow 
for decompression of an obstructed  or soon -to-be biliary tree, they are also quick to 
colonize with enteric flora of the gastrointestinal tract.  Patients with preoperative stents 
have been shown to have higher wound infection and bacteremia rates [4].  Because 
pancreatoduodenectomy  involves resection of the bile duct and construction of a biliary -
enteric anastomosis, it is quite lik ely that contaminated bil e is present in the surgical 
field.  These bacteria  sitting within the peritoneum are not appropriately treated  by 
[CONTACT_343712] , wound infections , and pancreatic fistulae .

been used with varying degrees of success.  Recent literature in the field of colorectal 
surgery has d emonstrated that the intraoperative  use of  antibiotic irrigation decreases 
wound complication rates  to less than 5% compared to a rate of 14% among those 
receiving  normal saline irrigation  [5].   
 
Hypothesis: The routine use of intraoperative antibiotic irrigation during 
pancreatoduodenectomy  will decrease superficial and organ space infections.  
 
Primary Specific Aim:  
• Test the efficacy of routine antibiotic irrigation in  reducing superficial and organ  
space infections  among patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy . 
  
Secondary Specific Aim:  
• Test the efficacy of antibiotic irrigation i n reducing pancreatic fistula rates .

4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
All patients will be registered with the Surgery Research  Office. Regulatory files will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_343713].  
 
Screening and Informed Consent: Study personnel will identify the patients 
undergoing pre- operative evaluation at the surgical outpatient clinic (SOPA clinic).  All 
eligible patients (fulfilling the inclusion criteria with no exclusion criteria) will be 
approached for informed consent.  
 
Randomization: Once consented, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_426483] to assign the randomized m edication.  
 
 5.0 Treatment Plan  
 
Study Medication: Randomized patients will receive the study drug or placebo 
intraoperative ly during the reconstructive phase of the surgery .  The study drug will 
consist of  Polymyxin B (500,000 U) in  1 liter of 0.9% normal saline and the placebo will be 
0.9% normal saline. In addition, all patients will receive one dose of parent eral 
antibiotics within [ADDRESS_426484] 
allergic contradictions to this regimen, intravenous moxiflox acin (400mg) and 
clindamycin  (600 mg) will be given .

Page 5  of 16 
 Administration of Study Medication:  
 
• The peritoneal irrigation solution will be manually lavaged over all intended peritoneal 
surface for a minimum of 60 sec onds, but not to exceed 5 minute s. During the irrigation, 
the operating surgeon will “massage” the solution in the peritoneal surface for another 
minimum of 60 sec onds, less than 5 minutes . The irrigation start and stop time will be 
recorded. Once this is completed, the residual solution will be cleaned up.  
 
At the end of the reconstructive phase of surgery:  
 
• One ( 1) Liter of either placebo or study medication will be gently irrigated 
directly at the pancreatojejunostomy  anastomosis  or at the 
pancreatogastrostomy anastomosis , if performed , upon its completion and then 
removed from the surgical field by [CONTACT_343714] .   
• One ( 1) liter of either placebo or study medication will be gently irrigated at the 
site of the ch oledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy  anastomosis at its 
completion  and then removed from the surgical field by [CONTACT_343714] .   
 
Administration of Parenter al Antibiotics:  
 
Within 2 hours (before or after) of  initial incision: 
• One dose of parent eral antibiotics will be given  
 
 
Dosing Schedule : 
 One ( 1) liter of  study  drug or placebo will be administered  twice via peritoneal irrigation 
intra- operatively , once at the completion of the pancreatojejunal anastomosis or at the 
pancreatogastrostomy anastomosis  and once at the completion of choledochojejunal or 
hepaticojejunal anastomosis.   
 
Blinding:  
 The patient , treating surgeon, and research nurse coordinator  will be blinded to the 
assigned treatment during the course of the study.  Upon randomization, the 
investigational pharmacy will prepare two one liter bags of normal saline solution, either 
with the antibiotic or just normal saline.  During the procedure, the solution will be 
provided and documentation of the treatment administered will be made as part of the 
investigational pharmacy documentation.

 7.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others  
 
Definitions of Adverse Events  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event  is defined as untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug or procedure in humans, whether or not considered drug or procedure  related. An 
adverse event can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign,  symptom, or disease 
temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product  or procedure , 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product or procedure 
(attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).  Examples of 
Adverse Events that will be recorded in this study are:  
 
• Concomitant illness  
• Physical injury  
• Events possibly related to medication  
• Significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease 
under study or other pre -existing conditions  
  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/2014 
Page 7  of 16 
 • Drug interactions  
• A laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality occurring shortly after the start of the 
study that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or is considered by [CONTACT_343715], Version 4.0.  Delayed gastric emptying will be graded using the International Study Group of 
Pancreatic Surgery ( ISGPS) system.  
 
 
Serio us Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of 
the following: 
 
• Results in death or ANY death occurring within [ADDRESS_426485] dose of study drug (even if it is not felt to be drug related)  
• Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256357]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85265]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85266]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition unrelated to the study medication  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313],  based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but 
are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An adver se event not mentioned in the package insert or the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the package insert.  
 
 
Determining Attribution to the Investigational Agent(s)  
 
Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical 
intervention. CTCAE does not define an AE as necessarily “caused by a therapeutic 
intervention” . After naming and grading the event, the clinical investigator must assign 
an attribution to th e AE using the following attribution categories:  
  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/2014 
Page 8  of 16 
  
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational 
agent/intervention  Unrelated  The AE is clearly NO T related  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  
Related to investigational 
agent/intervention  Possible  The AE may be related  
Probable  The AE is likely related  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  
 
Adverse Event (AE) Reporting 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_343704]  30 days 
after surgery , regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to 
trial procedures or medications .  All AEs considered related to trial medication 
will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this occurs post -trial. 
 
Reporting to the IRB:  
1. Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others  will be reported 
promptly to the IRB if they:  
• caused harm;  
• were unexpected;  
• were related or possibly related to the research intervention; AND  
• require d revision to the informed consent document. 
 
If the serious adverse event does not meet all four (4) criteria listed above, the 
event does not have to be promptly reported to the Indiana University IRB.  However, it will be reported at the time of continuing review . 
 2. Prompt reporting of unanticipa ted problems  to the IRB is defined as within 5 
days from becoming aware of the event . 
 
Reporting to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DS MC) : 
Regardless of study sponsorship, the DSMC chair and/or coordinator  will review  
all expedited SAE reports through OnCore
®. Expedited reports are completed per  
IRB guidelines and may include the IRB Prompt Reporting form,  non- compliance 
form. When follow -up information is received, a follow up report will also be 
created in OnCore .  The DS MC chair and/o r coordinator  will review expedited 
SAE reports monthly, and report findings to the DSMC .   
 
 
8.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/2014 
Page 9  of 16 
 Subjects may be withdrawn from study participation at the discretion of the investigator 
or if the patient/surrogate or attending phys ician requests that the subject be 
withdrawn. The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded. The Informed 
Consent Document will notify participants that their participation is voluntary, and they can tell the study staff at any time if they decide to stop participating. In addition, if 
they choose to withdraw their authorization for study staff to access protected health 
information (PHI) in the medical record, they may do so by [CONTACT_343716]. If a participant chooses to no longer participate but does not notify study staff 
that they withdraw authorization for access to PHI, their medical record may be 
accessed to obtain outcomes and safety data. Follow -up will be performed for all 
discont inuations due to an AE or other safety concern until resolution, until deemed 
chronic and stable, or as long as clinically appropriate.  
 
 
Definitions:  
 
Pancreatic fistulae will be defined by [CONTACT_094] -existing definitions in the literature.  
  In general, a panc reatic fistula is considered to be leak from the pancreatic 
ductal system.  More specifically, it is formally defined as an abnormal 
connection between pancreatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_343705].  In the context of pa ncreatic surgery where a 
pancreatojejunal anastomosis is created and a surgical drain is utilized, a fistula likely indicates a failure of proper healing of the anastomosis and may not be 
connected to another epi[INVESTIGATOR_343706] a drain [7].   
 
We will define a pancreatic fistula as output of at least 10mL/day of amylase -rich 
fluid (amylase content greater than 3 times the upper normal serum value ) for 
greater than [ADDRESS_426486] five days following surgery.  
 
 Additionally, pancreatic fistulae are grading based on severity and will be classified as either grade A, grade B, or grade C as defined by [CONTACT_343717].  
• Grade A pancreatic fistulae are the most common are have limit ed to no 
clinical impact.  The patient appears clinical well, there no signs of infection 
or sepsis, there is typi[INVESTIGATOR_343707] a fluid collection, drainage resolves 
and no specific treatment is indicated.   
• In contrast grade B fistulae require a ch ange in clinical management; 
patients are made NPO (nothing by [CONTACT_1966]) and supported with enteral or 
parenteral nutrition.  They require leaving pancreatic drains in place and will 
often necessitate a delay in discharge.   
• In patients with a grade C fistula , major deviations in management are 
required.  These patients may not be clinically stable and require aggressive 
interventions including care in the intensive care, nothing by [CONTACT_1966], 
supplemental nutrition, intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous draina ge 
with a possible return trip to the operating room for repair, creation of a new 
  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/[ADDRESS_426487], or 
completion pancreatectomy [7].  
 
Superficial and organ space infections are defined as follows from pre -exisiting 
definitions in the literature [6]: 
 
Superficial infections will be defined as an infection which occurs within 30 days 
after surgery and involves either skin/subcutaneous tissue (superficial) or the 
fascial/muscle layer (deep) of the incision.  Furthermore, the patient will need to 
meet at l east one of the following criteria:  
1.  Purulent drainage from the incision but not from the organ/space component 
of the surgical site;  
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision;  
3. At lea st one of the signs or symptoms of infection, including pain or 
tenderness, localized swelling, redness and heat and a superficial incision deliberately opened by a surgeon and either found to be culture -positive or not 
cultured (a culture -negative finding  did not meet this criterion);  
4. A deep incision spontaneously dehisced or deliberately opened by a surgeon and either found to be culture -positive or not cultured (a culture -negative finding 
did not meet this criterion) and at least one of the signs or s ymptoms of fever 
(>38 °C), localized pain or tenderness;  
5. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_317673].  
 
Organ space infections will be defined as infections that occur within [ADDRESS_426488] one of the 
following criteria:  
1. Purulent drainage from a drain that was placed through a stab wound into the 
organ or space;  
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the 
organ or space;  
3. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ or space found 
on dire ct examination, during reoperation, or by [CONTACT_317673].  
4.  Any intraperitoneal collection requiring percutaneous drainage  
 
 9.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
The patients’ characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_343718]-sample t -tests for continuous and Chi- square test for categorical variables as 
appropriate. Nonparametric tests will be used if there is a normal distribution 
assumption violation.  All analysis will be performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, N C) 
 
  IUCRO -0463

Page 11  of 16  
 Efficacy in reducing superficial and organ space infections :  In the primary analysis, 
proportion of patients with infection will be tabled and calculated for each arms and 
compared using a Chi -square test. In the secondary analysis, we will also us e a logistic 
regression model with infection as the outcome variable, treatment arm  as the main 
predictor , and will  adjust for disease process in order to further evaluate the efficacy.  
 
Efficacy in reducing pancreatic fistula rates  will be analyzed in a similar way to the 
primary outcome variable.  
 Toxicity data related to the treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  
 
Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]:  
An inte rim analysis will occur after [ADDRESS_426489] been treated.  Overall complication rate and 
rate of major complication (e.g. Grade 3 through 5) will be analyzed for each treatment group at 
the interim analysis.  If the placebo group infection rate is three (3) times the infection rate of 
the treatment group, the study will be stopped.  
 
 
Sample Size and Statistical power: Historical data in hepatopancreatobiliary 
surgery show that the treated group will reduce  primary outcome  rate from 24% to 
8%. The anticipated reduction in infectious complications was estimated based on 
historical outcome data for abdominal operations involving one or more 
gastrointestinal anastomoses. Using a two-sided Chi -square test, we will need [ADDRESS_426490] such a difference with 80% power and 5% Type I 
error rate.  With no attrition rate , we will need to recruit  164 patients totally.   The 
power analysis was performed for the primary endpoint  only.

 11.0  DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
  IUCRO -0463 
  Version Date:  10/31/2014 
Page 12  of 16  
  
DSMP for Moderate Risk Trials (Level 2)  
 
Moderate Risk Trials  
Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety. Monthly 
review meetings for Phase I/II and Phase II trials are required and will include the 
principal investigator, clinical research specialist and/or research nurse (other members 
per principal investigator’s discretion). Monthly meeting summaries will include review 
of data, the number of patients, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, and 
responses observed. Summaries will be submitted monthly and reviewed quarterly  by 
[CONTACT_6802].  
 Study Auditing and Monitoring  
All trials conducted at the IUSCC are subject to auditing and/or monitoring. Reports will 
be reviewed quarterly by [CONTACT_343719] (Reference Risk Table in full DSMC Charter).  
 
Early Study Closure  
At any time during the conduct of the trial, if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343710] (or benefits) to the patient warrant early closure of the study, this 
recommendation will be made in writing to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. 
Alternatively, t he DSMC may initiate suspension or early closure of the study based on 
its quarterly review of the investigator reports.  
 
Reporting Guidelines  
The DSMC has streamlined the reporting process by [CONTACT_164953]. This 
has allowed direct view of reports within the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS); 
thus discontinuing paper reports. SAE reports are entered into OnCore monthly and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator monthly. Findings will be reported to the 
full DSMC quarterly.  
 
Reporting Death:  
Death will be reported per  local IRB reporting guidelines . The DSMC will review all 
reported deaths monthly.  
 
Study Accrual Oversight  
Accrual data will be entered into the IU Simon Cancer Center OnCore system on a 
monthly basis. The Pro tocol Accrual Committee (PAC) reviews study accrual twice per 
year while the PAC coordinator reviews accrual quarterly.  
 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are entered into OnCore monthly and reviewed by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator monthly. Fin dings will be reported to the full DSMC quarterly.

Study Phase:  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_764196]:  
City of Hope  
Rationale for this Study:  
 
Recently, in a Phase III randomized trial on patients with HER2 positive gastric cancer, 
trastuzumab was shown to significantly improve survival for patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic disease (1).  Notably, the percent of HER2 positive disease in the literature ranges from 
~7% to 34% depending on the clinical study and methodology used to assess HER2 status.   
Surgical blocks have established that , on a microscopic scale, gastric cancer is heterogeneous, 
making it more difficult to establish HER2 positivity when compared  to breast cancer.   This has 
resulted in recommendations ranging from the use of multiple blocks (2), to the use of bright -field 
methodologies (3) and larger tissue samples (4).  Each of these approaches has limitations.    
 
Our research team has developed radiolabeled trastuzumab to study HER-2/neu positive breast 
cancers in animal models and in humans using P ET, in part because trastuzumab has a high rate 
of internalization, which results in trappi[INVESTIGATOR_764197]. We have used 
radiolabeled trastuzumab for PET imaging in women with advanced HER2 positive invasive 
breast cancer and shown that t umor uptake of the radiotracer correlates with pathologic HER2 
positivity/negativity. We hypothesize that 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET can be used to improve 
assessment of HER2 status in gastric cancer by [CONTACT_148000] -invasive, macroscopic 
measurements of av erage receptor expression (on a scale of approximately 4 cc).    Our long term 
goal is to use functional imaging with 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET to better predict which 
gastric patients will benefit from HER2 -targeted therapy.    This pi[INVESTIGATOR_764198] t he first 
imaging of gastric cancer with 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET.    It will allow us  (1) To compare 
tumor uptake of  64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in gastric cancer patients with pathologic evaluation of 
tumor HER2/neu expression; and (2)  To compare 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab -PET scan with 
standard radiographic imaging for staging patients with gastric cancer.  
  
Objectives:  
1. To compare tumor uptake of  64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in gastric cancer patients with 
pathologic evaluation of tumor HER2/neu expression  
2. To compare 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab -PET-CT scan with standard radiographic imaging 
for staging patients with gastric cancer

Version: [ADDRESS_1047106] of the objectives can obtain sufficient information for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_764199], 
we powered this study to insure sufficient number of HER2 positive patients by [CONTACT_764212] a 
positive control.  
 
Specifically, with 22 patients, there is an 80% chance we’d enroll at least one HER2 positive 
patient by [CONTACT_764213]2 positivity is the lowest end of the reported rate of 
7%. If the incidence is 16% (5), we would expect to observe 2 or more HER2+ patients with 89% 
probability.  
 
Additional analysis :  
1. In breast cancer, 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab -PET-CT) (Cu-PET-CT) was able to identify 
the tumors with low HER2 expression.  Gastric cancer has different adjacent tissue to 
provide a background noise comparison. As a result, with [ADDRESS_1047107] with a 95% CI 
half-width of 21%.  
2. A subset of patients will have tumors of sufficient size to have Cu-PET-CT SUV 
variation over the tumor.  For patients with metastatic disease who have Cu -PET-CT 
positivity but negative initial testing for HER2 expression, additional image -directed 
biopsy of the Cu -PET-CT positive area will be performed for analysis pri or to their 
destination systemic treatments (Track A on schema).  In those cases  when subjects 
undergo surgical resection (Track B on schema), the , positive and negative areas of the 
tumor will be sent to pathology for confirmation.  Th ese will be explorat ory. 
3.  A subset of patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemotherapy and 
radiation as part of their standard of care treatment as determined by [CONTACT_11065]. Once 
their neoadjuvant treatment is complete, they will undergo resection and pathologi c 
correlation with the Cu-PET-CT. (Track C on Schema).  
4.  Correlation of Cu -PET-CT SUV (measured as peak SUV) and pathology will be 
explored. As correlation requires a continuous measure from pathology, and some 
pathology will use FISH and/or IHC, this will be exploratory.  Comparing Cu -PET-CT in 
positive cases versus negative by [CONTACT_764214]. This is an exploratory aim.  
5. Patients who are deemed negative by [CONTACT_56618], but appear positive by [CONTACT_764215] -PET-CT is 
exploratory, as further evaluation will be needed to determine positivity by [CONTACT_764215] -PET-CT.

evaluation of the biopsied tissue then utility of scan is verified (E on Schema). If the 64Cu-DOTA-
trastuzumab -PET-CT scan is positive and correlates with positive HER2 staining of biopsied 
tissues then, again the utility of scan is verified (C2 and B2 on Schema). If the scan is positive but 
the staining of HER2 is negative, the hypothesis is that this discrepancy is due to the 
heterogeneity of the tumor (A, B1, C1 on Schema). Therefore these patien ts will undergo scan 
directed biopsy or scan directed evaluation of the surgical specimen after resection.

1. Goals and Objectives (Scientific Aims) 
1. To compare tumor uptake of  64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in gastric cancer patients with 
pathologic evaluation of tumor HER2/neu expression  
2. To compare 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab- PET-CT scan with standard radiographic imaging 
for staging patients with gastric cancer  
2. Background 
2.1  Introduction/Rationale for Development 
Gastric cancer remains the 2nd most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide(6). Although the 
incidence of gastric cancer is relatively low in the [LOCATION_002], it is a major cause of cancer-related 
deaths in [LOCATION_004] because of the state’s high numbers of Asian and East European immigrants(7). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_764201], the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancers has 
remained quite poor with median rates of overall survival approximately [ADDRESS_1047112] been identified and tested in many cancers; and recently, the evaluation of HER2/neu in gastric 
cancer has resulted in treatment advances. As a member of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_764202], 
HER-2/neu (c -erb-B2, ERBB2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a key role in 
growth factor signal transduction regulating cell growth, survival, and differentiation.(8) It has been 
shown to be overexpressed in 15-40% of tumors evaluated.(9)  
 
Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG-1 antibody that binds to the ectodomain of HER2. When combined with 
chemotherapy, trastuzumab significantly improves the survival of patients with biopsy-proven HER2 
overexpression. In the recent trastuzumab in gastric cancer (TOGA) Phase III randomized trial, the 
addition of trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy was shown to significantly improve survival. HER2 
overexpression and candidacy for trastuzumab is defined as 3+ staining by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) 
or gene amplification by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH).(1) The greatest benefit appeared to 
occur in patients with 3+ overexpression on IHC, leading to median overall survival rates close to [ADDRESS_1047113] cancers which are largely 
homogeneous, the task of identifying HER2 expression in gastric cancers is more difficult because of 
tumor heterogeneity. Although HER2 overexpression in the TOGA trial was reported to be 22% 
(consistent with breast cancer), our City of Hope institutional data shows a rate closer to 10-15%. 
Therefore, the diagnostic workup for HER2 overexpression must be improved, so that we can determine 
whether patients are eligible to receive trastuzumab which improves survival in patients with advanced 
gastric cancer.  
 
Interestingly, trastuzumab has been shown to be of benefit even in patients whose cancers are HER2 
negative by [CONTACT_764216]2 when associated with chromosome [ADDRESS_1047114] cancer 
ma
y benefit from trastuzumab therapy.(10) Finally, it is noted that when multiple measures of HER2 are 
performed at different institutions, the discordance rate (positive versus negative) may be as high as 20%. 
Taken together, the current measures of HER2 in clinical practice for patients with gastric cancer (and 
breast cancer) remain inaccurate which may preclude the administration of an effective targeted agent.   
 
2.2 Overview of Proposed Study 
Positron emission tomography (PET) provides a non-invasive way of studying tumor metabolic functions 
and response to therapy. In gastric cancer, PET- CT imaging is used in staging patients to evaluate 
metastatic disease and to assess response to chemotherapy before tumor regression can be documented on 
Page 13 of 36 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:   04/26/2017  
Version: 11 clinical or radiological exam.(11-13) Our research team has developed radiolabeled trastuzumab to study 
HER-2/neu positive breast cancers in animal models and in humans, in part because trastuzumab has a 
high rate of internalization, which results in trappi[INVESTIGATOR_764197].(14, 15) We have used 
radiolabled trastuzumab to image women with advanced HER2 positive invasive breast cancer. 64Cu-
DOTA-trastuzumab, first developed at City of Hope, accurately identified HER2 positive breast cancer in 
nude mice bearing an MCF7 HER2 overexpressing xenograft.(16, 17) We hypothesize that functional 
imaging with 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET-CT will improve the accuracy of HER2 assessment in 
patients with gastric cancer.  
 
An accurate assessment of HER2 status is essential to select patients who would benefit the most from the 
targeted therapy with trastuzumab. However, tumor heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification has been 
reported between 5-53%.(4)  Although other published studies report overexpression of HER-2/neu in 15-
40% of gastric cancers, our institution has had a much lower HER-2/neu   overexpression rate at 
approximately 10% in biopsy-proven gastric cancer.  We hypothesize that imaging with 64Cu-DOTA-
trastuzumab- PET-CT can provide a non-invasive approach to more accurately evaluate HER2 status in 
gastric cancer.  Our proposed study is also highly innovative in three ways: (1) We will compare HER2 
expression in gastric cancers in vivo with 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab- PET-CT; (2) the 64Cu-DOTA-
trastuzumab- PET-CT and the IHC and/or FISH expressions of HER2 will be correlated; (3) the 
possibility of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab -PET-CT directed identification of HER2 positive areas will be 
explored in both the biopsy of metastatic and resection of primar y lesions; and (4) the effect of 
neoadjuvant treatment of gastric cancer on HER2 expression will be tested.    
 
2.3 Human Studies 
Trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 protein, 
was conjugated to the active ester of DOTA (Macrocyclics).  64Cu, provided by [CONTACT_764217], Washington University School of Medicine, was incubated with DOTA-conjugated 
antibody and purified on a size exclusion preparative column.  Radiolabeled trastuzumab has been used 
safely and effectively to study HER2 positive breast cancers in animal models and in humans.  
Researchers at City of Hope have utilized 111In-DOTA-trastuzmab to image women with advanced HER2 
positive invasive breast cancer.  In the City of Hope experience, 111In-DOTA-trastuzmab identified areas 
of known metastasis in 4 of 7 patients; however, this agent has variable accuracy in identifying HER2 
positive disease on planar and SPECT scans. The positron emitting isotope 64Cu has a number of potential 
advantages over 111In including: improved image resolution with PET- CT and lower doses of radiation to 
the patient. 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab, first developed at City of Hope, accurately identified HER2 positive 
breast cancer in nude mice bearing an MCF7 HER2 overexpressing xenograft.  Because normal tissues 
that express HER2 will bind the radioabeled (hot) antibody, administration of a “cold dose” of 
trastuzumab improved the tumor specificity of the radiographic image.  [CONTACT_764229] (PI) recently 
completed a clinical trial with 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast 
cancer. The optimal dose of cold antibody required for 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET-CT to produce a 
high image quality was determined to be 50 mg.

administration of 64Cu -DOTA-trastuzumab, their medical condition will continue to be followed until 
resolution of the adverse effects.  Participants requiring additional study related treatment such as the 
image directed transcutanteous biopsy of the area of PET and IHC/FISH discordance will continued to be 
monitored as part of the study until first postprocedure follow-up or until any complications from the 
study related procedures are resolved.  Those who undergo surgical resection will be followed until the 
first postoperative clinic appointment or until any complications from the study related procedures are 
resolved.   
5.[ADDRESS_1047130] Follow- Up 
There is no formal follow-up after 15 days.  Progress notes on the patient’s condition with standard 
therapy may be collected for data up to 6 months after the completion of the trial. 
5.5 Su
pportive Care, Other Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Medications 
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over-the-counter products) 
during the course of the study without prior consultation with the investigator. At each visit, the 
investigator will ask the patient about any new medications he/she is or has taken after the start of the 
study drug. 
All concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to start and after start 
of study drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be recorded. 
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study (Days 1-15 ): 
No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  The patient may proceed with 
therapeutic treatment after day 15.   
No anticancer agents should be given to patients. If such agents are required for a patient then the 
patient must first be withdrawn from the study.

the anniversary date of activation.  Protocol specific data collection will include the following items: any 
UPs or AEs that occur on this study along with any treatment related deaths.  
7.3 Definitions 
 
Adverse event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change 
of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is 
considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
 
Unexpected  Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a)]  – An adverse event is unexpected if 
it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an expected natural progression of any 
underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research 
participant experiencing the adverse event. 
 
Expected  Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
event OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, 
condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the 
adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32] - defined as any expected or unexpected adverse 
event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 Is life-threatening experiences (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred) 
 Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91589] 24 hours)) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Secondary malignancy 
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Unanticipated problem (UP)  - Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all 
three of the following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB 
Page 22 of 36 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:   04/26/2017  
Version: 11 approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_36923], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously 
known or recognized. 
 
 
Adverse Event Attribution 
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the 
study agent or study procedure. 
 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent or study procedure and 
unrelated to any other cause. 
 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the investigational agent or study procedure and 
unlikely related to other cause(s). 
 
Possible -The AE may be related to the investigational agent or study procedure and may be 
related to another cause(s). 
 
Unlikely -The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent or study procedure and 
likely related to another cause(s). 
 
Unrelated -The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent or study procedure and 
is attributable to another cause(s).

8. Agent Information and Risks 
8.1 Preparation of 64Cu -DOTA-trastuzumab  
8.1.1 Description 
Trastuzumab will be purchased from the City of Hope pharmacy and conjugated with active ester of 
DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-1,4,7,10-tetracetic acid) in the COH biologics production facility 
(CBG) under cGMP compliant conditions. Each lot of trastuzumab-DOTA will undergo testing for 
sterility, potency, purity and lack of pyrogenicity. Vialing of the conjugated materials will be done 
in COH biologics production facility Fill and Finish area.  An IND application will be filed with the 
FDA. Radiolabeling with 64Cu will be carried out in the City of Hope Radiopharmacy under the 
direction of David Colcher, PhD. The 64Cu will be purchased from the Mallinckrodt Institute of 
Radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine, which is preparing the radiolabel for 
clinical use under a separate NCI grant. Labeling will be accomplished by [CONTACT_764221] 64Cu for 45 minutes at 43o C, followed by a chase with DTPA and subsequent 
purification on a size exclusion preparative grade Superdex-200 column. Appropriate fractions will 
be pooled and filtered to make up the patient dose, which will be formulated with human serum 
albumin. Protein dose to the patient will be approximately 50 mg. The total trastuzumab content per 
64Cu -DOTA-trastuzumab injected dose is less than 50 mg. All procedures will be done as specified 
in an I
ND that will be filed with the FDA to cover the studies proposed in the protocol. Based on our 
previous work with 111In-DOTA-trastuzumab and anticipating that the normal tissue biodistribution 
of 64Cu -DOTA-trastuzumab will be the same as that of 111In-DOTA-trastuzumab, we calculate that 
the radiation doses to normal tissues will be:

Version: 11 8.2 Herceptin 
8.2.1 Description  Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to 
the extracellular domain of the HER2. Trastuzumab is a sterile, white to pale yellow, 
preservative-free lyophilized powder for intravenous (IV) administration. The nominal 
content of each trastuzumab vial is 440 mg trastuzumab, 440 mg ,-trehalose 
dehydrate, 9,9 mg L-histidine HCl, 6.4 mg L-histidine, and 1.8 mg polysorbate 20, USP.  
Reconstitution with 20 mL of the supplied Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI), 
USP, containing 1.2% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, yields a mu lti-dose solution 
containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at a pH of approximately 6. 
8.2.2 Pharmacology – Handling, Storage, Dispensing and Disposal 
Storage/stability: Vials of trastuzumab are stable at 2o-8o C (36o-46o F) prior to 
reconstitution. They will not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_30473]. A 
vial of trastuzumab reconstituted with BWFI, as supplied, is stable for 28 days after 
reconstitution when stored refrigerated at 2o-8o C (36o-46o F), and the solution is 
preserved for multiple use. We will discard any remaining multi-dose reconstituted 
solution after 28 days. If unpreserved Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) (not supplied) is 
used, the reconstituted trastuzumab solution should be used immediately and any unused 
portion must be discarded. We will not freeze trastuzumab that has been reconstituted. 
The solution of trastuzumab for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene 
bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be stored at 2o-8o C (36o-46o 
F) for up to [ADDRESS_1047138] not been shown to contain effective 
preservatives for trastuzumab. Each vial of trastuzumab should be reconstituted with 20 
mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol preserved as supplied, to yield a multi-dose 
solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. Immediately upon reconstitution with BWFI, 
the vial of trastuzumab must be labeled in the area marked “Do not use after:” with the 
future date that is 28 days from the date of reconstitution. 
Note: When administering trastuzumab to a patient with a known hypersensitivity 
to benzyl alcohol, trastuzumab must be reconstituted with SWFI, and only one dose 
per trastuzumab vial should be used. Trastuzumab which has been reconstituted 
with SWFI must be used immediately and any unused portion must be discarded. 
Use of other reconstitution diluents should be avoided.  
Page 29 of 36 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:   04/26/2017  
Version: 11 Shaking the reconstituted trastuzumab or causing excessive foaming during the addition 
of diluent may result in problems with dissolution and the amount of trastuzumab that can 
be withdrawn from the vial.  Use appropriate aseptic technique when performing the 
following reconstitution steps: 
 Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the 20 mL of diluent into the vial containing 
the lyophilized cake of trastuzumab. The stream of diluent should be directed into 
the lyophilized cake. 
 Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. Trastuzumab may be sensitive to shear-
induced stress, e.g., agitation or rapid expulsion from a syringe.  Do not shake. 
 Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual.  Allow the vial to 
stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes.  The solution should be essentially 
free of visible particulates, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. 
 
Administration 
 The cold trastuzumab will injected prior to the injection of 64Cu -DOTA-
trastuzumab.   
 
9. Correlative/Special Studies 
 Specimen Collection / Documentation 
Antibody assessment will be performed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_764230].  Left over serum from 
the antibody assessment will be stored in the Translational Research Core of the Cancer Center 
for future research.  After the diagnosis and HER [ADDRESS_1047139] been determined, additional tumor 
wi
ll be stored in pathology for future assessment of PI3K, PTEN, IGF1-R, EGFR, and phospho-
S6 by [CONTACT_4729]. The DNA Sequencing Core will assess mutations in PI3K 
and PTEN. Both IHC and FISH assessment of HER2 status will be performed by [CONTACT_764222]. Left over tumor will be stored in pathology for future analysis.

11.[ADDRESS_1047141] examinations will be analyzed and interpreted by [CONTACT_764224] (IRAT). Tumors will be selected for analysis on the basis of the pretreatment 
CT examination and pathological analysis of the surgical specimen.  The Cu64 SUVs will be 
evaluated in tumors, adjacent non-tumor tissue and selected non-tumor organs and tissues (heart, 
extracardiac mediastinum, liver, skeletal muscle). Tumor sizes (product of maximum mutually 
perpendicular transaxial diameters as well as maximum axial diameter) will be estimated from 
coregistered CT. Tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab will be parameterized in terms of 
single-voxel maximum values SUVmax and whole-tumor volumes of interest (SUVwhtum) as 
defined from the coregistered CT images. Ratios of tumor to non-tumor activity concentration 
will also be calculated for adjacent tissue, extracardiac mediastinum, liver, and skeletal muscle.  
Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis will be performed to estimate optimal cutoff values of  
SUVmax, SUVwhtum, tumor:background and tumor:organ ratios for classifying tumors as 
“HER2 positive” or “HER2 negative.” The optimal cold antibody dose required for 64Cu -DOTA-
trastuzumab to produce high quality images was determined to be 45 mg.  
 
12. Data Reporting/Protocol Deviations 
12.1 Data Reporting 
12.1.1 Confidentiality and Storage of Records 
The original data collection forms will be submitted into electronic data capture (EDC) system Medidata 
Rave. Data will be stored in a encrypted, password protected, secure computers that meet all the HIPAA 
requirements.  When results of this study are reported in medical journals or at meetings, identification of 
those
 taking part will not be disclosed.  Medical records of subjects will be securely maintained in the 
strictest confidence, according to current legal requirements.  They will be made available for review, as 
required by [CONTACT_1622], HHS, or other authorized users such as the NCI, under the guidelines established by 
[CONTACT_764225]. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1047142]’s Bill of Rights (for the medical record) and 
three copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (for the subject, the research record, and the Coordinating Center) must be available.  All 
Institutional, NCI, Federal, and State of [LOCATION_004] requirements will be fulfilled. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1047143]. The CRFs will be submitted within 
1 week from baseline, completion of each treatment and each subsequent follow-up visit.  Data will be 
sent to the location identified in Section 12.1.1 and stored in a secure location. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eligibility Checklist 
The Eligibility Checklist must be completed by a protocol nurse or clinical research associate and signed 
by [CONTACT_177447].  See Section 4.3 for the registration 
procedure.

12.[ADDRESS_1047144](s) for the 
protection, safety, and well-being of the study subjects without prior IRB approval.  For any such 
deviation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_519391] 5 calendar days of its occurrence via iRIS in 
accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy  [policy effective date:  11/07/11].    
 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation Policy” 
located at ht tp://www.coh.org/dsmc/Documents/Institutional%20Deviation%20Policy.pdf . 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity require 
prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.  In addition, if contractually obligated, the 
sponsor must also approve the deviation.  IRB pre-approved SSE protocol modifications are considered 
an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The submission of a deviation report is not required. 
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can also extend 
to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_511308].  Examples include, but are not limited to:  a) dose 
adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) alteration in treatment schedule due to non-availability 
of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol 
requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety.  These instances are considered to be 
deviations from the protocol.  A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB within five days. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_1047145] be submitted by [CONTACT_764226] ([EMAIL_593]) for distribution. The clinical research 
associate at City of Hope will also submit copi[INVESTIGATOR_764205].  All deviations will be reported to the COH DSMC within five days.  
The DSMC will forward to report to the IRB following review. 
 
12.2.3  Resolving Disputes 
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a protocol 
deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key point, the IDS 
should rely on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177380]. 
In situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the persons 
involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_511309] (or designee) to arrive at resolution.

Version: [ADDRESS_1047146] of the objectives can obtain sufficient information for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_764199], we 
powered this study to insure sufficient number of HER2 positive patients by [CONTACT_764212] a positive 
control. 
 
Specifically, with 22 patients, there is an 80% chance we’d enroll at least one HER2 positive patient by 
[CONTACT_764213]2 positivity is the lowest end of the reported rate of 7%. If the incidence 
is 16% (Marx, et al, 2009), we would expect to observe 2 or more HER2+ patients with 89% probability.  
 
For the other objectives:  
1. In breast cancer, Cu- PET-CT (64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab- PET-CT) was able to identify the tumors 
with low HER2 expression.  Gastric cancer has different adjacent tissue to provide a background 
noise comparison. As a result, with [ADDRESS_1047147] with a 95% CI half-width of 21%.  
2. A subset of patients will have tumors of sufficient size to have Cu- PET-CT SUV variation over 
the tumor. For patients with metastatic disease who have Cu- PET-CT positivity but negative 
initial testing for HER2 expression, additional image-directed biopsy of the Cu-PET-CT positive 
area will be performed for analysis prior to their destination systemic treatments (Track A on 
schema).  In those cases when subjects undergo surgical resection (Track B and C on schema), 
the positive and negative areas of the tumor will be sent to pathology for confirmation.  These 
will be exploratory. 
3. Correlation of Cu- PET-CT SUV (measured as peak SUV) and pathology will be explored. As 
correlation requires a continuous measure from pathology, and some pathology will use FISH 
and/or IHC, this will be exploratory.  Comparing Cu- PET-CT in positive cases versus negative by 
[CONTACT_764227]. This is an exploratory aim. 
4. Patients who are deemed negative by [CONTACT_56618], but appear positive by [CONTACT_764215]- PET-CT is 
exploratory, as further evaluation will be needed to determine positivity by [CONTACT_764215]-PET-CT.

federal regulations at [ADDRESS_1047149] who is a co-investigator of this study will screen patients for this study.   From analysis of the 
gastric cancer patient volume at City of Hope in the previous three years, 65-67 gastric cancer patients 
underwent surgery for gastric cancer and another similar volume non-surgical patients seen by [CONTACT_764228] 35 of 36 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:   04/26/2017  
Version: 11 oncologists.  The inclusion criteria should allow for majority of these patients to be eligible to this study 
and both the surgical and medical oncologists treating gastric cancer patients at COH will be recruiting to 
this study.   
14.3  Advertisements  
Advertisements to include print, media (radio, television, billboards), telephone scripts, lay summary to 
be posted on City of Hope’s public Clinical Trials On-LineSM website, etc., will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_177449]. 
14.4  Study location and Performance Sites 
This study will be performed at COH.  
14.5  Confidentiality  
This research will be conducted in compliance with federal and state of [LOCATION_004] requirements relating 
to protected health information (PHI).  The principal investigator, co-investigators, and laboratory 
technicians will have access to this information, but all information will be treated confidentially.  No 
identifiers will be used in any subsequent publication of these results. 
14.[ADDRESS_1047150] of care procedures provided will be the responsibility of the research participant and/or the 
insurance carrier.  The research participant will be responsible for all copayments, deductibles, and other 
costs of treatment and diagnostic procedures as set forth by [CONTACT_91642].  The research participant 
and/or the insurance carrier will be billed for the costs of treatment and diagnostic procedures in the same 
way as if the research participant were not in a research study.  However, neither the research participant 
nor the insurance carrier will be responsible for the research procedures related to this study. 
In the event of physical injury to a research participant, resulting from research procedures, appropriate 
medical treatment will be available at the City of Hope to the injured research participant, however, 
financial compensation will not be available. 
The research participant will not be paid for taking part in this study. 
14.[ADDRESS_1047151]’s bill of rights and the 
HIPAA research authorization form.  Research subjects will be informed that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason without prejudice, including as applicable, their current or future 
care or employment at City of Hope or any relationship they have with City of Hope.  Research subjects 
will be afforded sufficient time to consider whether or not to participate in the research. 
Should sufficient doubt be raised regarding the adequacy of comprehension, further clarifications will be 
made and the questionnaire repeated until a satisfactory result is obtained.  Prospective research subject s 
who cannot adequately comprehend the fundamental aspects of the research study with a reasonable 
amount of discussion, education and proctoring will be ineligible for enrollment.  For those subjects who 
do comprehend the fundamental aspects of the study, consent will be obtained and documented, followed 
by [CONTACT_177451].  The research team will review the results of eligibility testing and determine if the 
subject is a candidate for study enrollment.

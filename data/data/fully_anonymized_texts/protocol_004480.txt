documented rates of type 2 diabetes of any population group in the world.1-3, 4, 5-7 Our review of 
local, national, and international data sources found estimates of diabetes in the Marsha llese 
population (in the US and the Republic of the Marsha ll Islands) ranging from 20% to 50%, 
compared to 8% for the US population and 4% worldwide (Table 1 ).1-3, 5 
 
While national prevalence data are limited, 23.7% 
of Pacific Islanders surveyed by [CONTACT_263632] (CDC) in 2010 
reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes – more than all 
other racial/ethn ic groups .[ADDRESS_336981] Arkansas ( n = 401), 
documented extremely high incidence of diabetes 
(38.2%) and pre -diabetes (32.4%). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_275996], one of the 
strongest risk factors for diabetes; 90% of Marshallese 
participants were classified as overw eight or obese.9, 10 Further compounding these significant 
disparities, Pacific Islanders living in the US are less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to 
receive preventive or diagnostic treatment or diabetes education.11, 12, 13, 14, [ADDRESS_336982],  the Arkansas Marshallese suffer 
from a significant and disproportionate b urden of type 2 diabetes and lack access to effective 
prevention and treatment due to a dearth of research with Pacific Islanders.16-19, 20, 21,22,13 Second,

modifiable risk factor for type [ADDRESS_336986] reduction in weight (5 -10%) can 
be clinically meaningful.75-[ADDRESS_336987] a weight -loss intervention referred to throughout the 
proposal as  Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls (HBHS) in a single arm study.  The intervention 
includes the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention  (DPP-LI) with the addition al 
enhancement  of working with Marshallese churches to implement organizational/institutional 
level changes to support the individual behavioral intervention of the DPP -LI. Because the DPP -
LI intervention and data collection are the same as the approved UAMS IRB #207034, the study 
team may compare the outcomes of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_275997] -LI. 
 
Study design  
Up to f our Marsha llese churches  will be recruited . 
 
The primary  outcome is percentage of body weight loss . Secondary  variables include: 1) HbA1c, 
2) blood pressure, 3) changes in food and physical activity related behaviors, and 4) changes in 
self-efficacy and perceived social a nd environmental support for healthy lifestyle changes.  
 
Recruitment and Consent  
Participants will be recruited through churches from Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and /or 
Oklahoma. The recruitment goal for the church level intervention is up to [ADDRESS_336988] in participation 
in the DPP -LI will complete a  screen ing instrument to determine eligibility  – see 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. The eligibility screen er will include systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and height and weight measurements to calculate BMI.  
 
Church -based  recruitment is specified by [CONTACT_276010]’s preferred recruitment meth od. 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Participant inclusion criteria : 
1) Self-reported Marshallese  
2) 18 years of age or older  
3) To participate in the DPP -LI, h ave a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2

Date: 201809 21 IRB# : 217566  Exclusion Criteria  
Participant exclusion criteria  for the DPP -LI: 
1) A clinically significant medical condition likely to impact weight (cancer, HIV/AIDS, 
etc.) 
2) Currently pregnant or breastfeeding  an infant who is 6 months old or younger.  
3) Have any condition that makes it unlikely that the participant will be able to follow t he 
protocol, such as terminal illness, plans to move out of the area within [ADDRESS_336989] clinically significant medical conditions that will exclude them from the DPP-LI 
component of the study.  
 
All study information and consent materials will be provided in Engl ish and/or Marshallese 
based upon the participants’ preferences. Eligible participants will be provided a copy of the 
consent to review, and participants will have the opportunity to ask questions, consent, and enroll 
in the study. The consent process will  include providing information to the potential participant s 
and the opportunity to have bilingual Marshallese staff answer questions regarding study 
participat ion. The consent document will be given to the participant , and the informed consent 
process wil l be documented in the participant’s research record. The consent document will be 
reviewed with the group and questions will be answered by [CONTACT_3647]. Experience working 
with the Marshallese population and input from both advisory groups and Marshall ese staff 
support providing consent information to potential participants in a group setting. This is 
consistent with Marshallese cultural practices and does not preclude the provision of the  
opportunity for all potential participants for individual, priva te discussion of the study and the 
consent document before they sign the consent. All members of the research team will be trained 
and certified in participant consent procedures, the study protocol, human subjects protection, 
and HIPAA regulations. After the consent process, a participant contact [CONTACT_276011].  
 
Data Collection Instruments and Procedures  
Biometric and survey data will be collected during pre -intervention , post-intervention , and 
twelve  months post -initiation  on both persons who only participate in the health screening and 
those who participate in the DPP -LI. The data collection window is up to six  weeks on each side 
of the data collection date to accommodate participant availability. In the event missing data  is 
identified, participants will be contact[CONTACT_276012].  
 
Participants may be invited to participate in a qualitative interview to understand participants’ 
perceptions of the intervention and implementation process. Participants may refuse any data 
collection or any questions within a data collection event.

Biometric measures include: HbA1c, w eight, height, BMI (calculated by [CONTACT_276013]), 
waist measurement, and blood pressure. Participants’ weight will be measured in clothing to the 
nearest 0.5 lb. (0.2 kg) using a calibrated scale. Height (without shoes) will be measured to the 
nearest 0.25 inches  using a stadiometer. Weight and height will be used to compute a continuous 
measure of BMI using the Quetelet Index (kg/m2).[ADDRESS_336990] kit and Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer.  The biometric data collection 
will be completed  by [CONTACT_3784], trained research staff. Bilingual study staff will be present f or

Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES )84. 
 
The survey data collection includes 57 items adapted from valid and reliable scales, which will 
take participants approximately 20 minutes to complete. Family support for exercise and healthy 
diet is measured by [CONTACT_276014] (2008).85 Weight locus of control is measured using the 
Weight Locus of Control scale.86 Exercise self -efficacy is me asured using the self -efficacy for 
exercise and outcome expectations scale Resnick (2004).87 Eating habits are measured by [CONTACT_6270] -
efficacy scales for health related diet and exercise behaviors  from Clark et al (1991).  Fruit and 
vegetable consumption is measu red by [CONTACT_276015]., (1997).89 Food insecurity is measured 
using questions from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).84 
Questions about sugar sweetened beverage  consumption and sleep quality and quantity are taken 
from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).69 There is one item about church 
attendance from the Koenig & Büssing (2010), and items regarding how often participants 
receive health messa ges at church adapted from Ayers et al.88

Date: 201809 21 IRB# : 217566  The documents will be translated into Marshallese and field tested by [CONTACT_1758]’s Marshallese 
Community Advisory Board. These surveys/forms  will be administered at the pre-
intervention data collection and post-intervention data collection events. All surveys will be 
administered by a qualified study staff who have completed all required trainings (see 
protections against risk) . A bilingual M arshallese staff will be present  for all sessions and 
data collection events. 
 
Remuneration:  Participants who only participate in the church health screening will be offered 
a $[ADDRESS_336991] for each data collection event and an additional $[ADDRESS_336992] if they 
participate in the qualitative interview. Participants who participate in all three data coll ection 
events and a qualitative interview will receive a total of $80 in gift cards. Participants will only 
receive gift cards for the health screenings  they complete.  
 
Participants that are in the DPP-LI classes will be offered a $[ADDRESS_336993] as 
remuneration for their time for their pre-intervention data collection event , a $[ADDRESS_336994] -intervention data collection event , and a $[ADDRESS_336995] 
three gift cards , for a total of $ 90 for those who  participate in all three  data collection events.  
 
Participants  that are in the  DPP-LI classes and  who participate  in the qualitative interview  will be 
provided a $[ADDRESS_336996] for their participation. A DPP-LI class participant who 
completes all three  data collection events and the interview will receive a total of $ 110 in gift 
cards.  
 
Intervention Description . Participant  group s will receive the DPP-LI. The intervention modules 
will be delivered at a church group setting and participation in discussion will be encouraged.  
The interventions’ core curricula emphasize increasing physical activity, eating healthy, and 
sustaining motivation. Participants will be invited to join a private Facebook group to facilitate 
providing reminders and sharing information between educational  sessions. The private 
Facebook group will be created and managed by [CONTACT_464]. Participation will not be a required 
component of the study. The intervention includes [ADDRESS_336997] 8 modules are intended to be 
delivered every other week. Participants will be encouraged to maintain a daily weight, nutrition, 
physical activi ty, and prayer log. Persons who do not want to participate in the study or choose to 
stop participating in the study can still attend the classes.  
 
Each group will be led by [CONTACT_276016]  (Marshallese and English) DPP -LI lay educators who will 
each receive  no less than  [ADDRESS_336998] two years’ experience delivering 
health education interventions. The intervention will offer materials and survey instruments in 
English and Marshallese. Makeup sessions fo r missed modules  will be offered .

In addition to the DPP -LI provided to the church members, organizational/institutional change 
level support will be provided to the church. The organizational/ institutional intervention will 
include me eting with church leadership and church health committee members approximately 
monthly to identify what organizational changes they want to make.  The facilitated meetings to 
identify changes that the church wants to make will last approximately 2 -3 hours.  The 
organizational /institutional  systems, policies, and environmental changes will be developed 
collaboratively with church leaders/ members. Organizational /instructional  changes to support 
healthier behaviors include improvements in food purchasing and preparation for events, 
physical activity programs, and increased congregational engagement in health promotion 
activitie s.91, 92 Example changes could include: starting a walking club, implementing a policy to 
not included sugary beverages at church meals, implementing a healthy potluck policy. The 
number of church leaders and health members who will attend per church will be determined by 
[CONTACT_139990]. Process notes will do cument changes made by [CONTACT_139990]. Church leaders and 
health committee member will not be consented unless they take part in the DPP -LI and/or they 
take part in the focus groups.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
Potential risks to study participants are minimal and no  greater than usual care or standard health 
screenings. The physical activity may result in fatigue or soreness. There  is a potential  risk for 
loss of confidentiality. Measures to protect the confidentiality of study participants will be 
implemented as described in the Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171981]. The alternative to 
participating in the interventions is to not participate in the interventions. Further, any pa rticipant 
can choose to leave the study at any time.  
 
Protections against risk.  All data collectors  involved in the interventions will have received 
training on: participant consent procedures, the study protocol, human subjects protection, 
HIPAA regulations, survey administration, biomedical data collection (including finger stick 
blood collection), maintaining confidentiality of study participants, mandatory reporting, and 
appropriate treatment of participant data. Collection, transport, and storage of data, and 
subsequent access will be limited to only those personnel who need it to complete relevant job 
duties. All data, regardless of whether it is identifiable or not, will be stored in a locked file 
cabinet in a locked room, or on a secure UAMS server  that requires two -factor authentication.

Data analysis.  The proposed study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], so the focus is not on testing hypotheses;[ADDRESS_337001] 
sizes needed to better plan a larger study.94 Using pi[INVESTIGATOR_123704], the results will be compared to the 
results of protocol #207034 testing DPP -LI in the Marshallese community without the 
organizational/institutional level intervention.  Focus will be on point estimates and confidence 
intervals instead of p-values fr om hypothesis tests. Judgment of the preliminary effectiveness of 
the intervention will be based on the estimated mean difference between the groups and the 
range of plausible values for that parameter from confidence interval. Attention  will be on 
looking  to see if the effect is in the right direction (consistent with the intervention being 
effective) and whether the estimate would be clinically meaningful. To assess feasibility of the 
analysis plan for the larger study and the preliminary effectiveness of  the intervention, pi[INVESTIGATOR_275998]: Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls in the Marshallese Population

effectiveness of  the intervention, we will have an adequate sample size to estimate means, 
standard deviations, effect sizes, and confidence intervals that will provide preliminary 
information and prove invaluable in planning the full scale evaluation of the intervention .

The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, will be obtained 
before that subject is involved in  any study procedure. All subjects for this study will be provided 
a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information in language suitable for 
subjects to make  an informed decision about their particip ation in this study. A 
translator/interpreter will be available for the consent process. The person obtaining consent will 
thoroughly explain each eleme nt of the document and outline the risks  and benefits, alternate 
treatment(s), and requirements of the study. Subjects may take as much time as needed to make  a 
decision about their participation. Questions regarding  participation will be answered. No 
coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process. This consent form must be 
signed by [CONTACT_276018]. A copy of the consent will be 
given to the participant, and the informed consent process will be documented in each subject’s 
research re cord. 
 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan . This is no more than a minimum risk study  however, a Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plan has been submitted as  a separate document.

 HEALTH OUTCOMES OBJECTIVE:  
 Total healthcare costs from admission to discharge. 
EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:  To evaluate:  
 Change in serum cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1ß, and ferritin levels, as well as other 
exploratory biomarkers. 
 Change in baseline antiviral immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) at EOS. 
 Pharmacokinetics of LSALT peptide over the study period. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:   This study is a parallel group, randomized, third-
party blinded, multicenter study to assess safety and efficacy of LSALT peptide versus placebo 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462027]-19.   
Patients will be followed for safety and efficacy up to Day 28, with Day 1 being the day of randomization 
to assess safety. 
After assessing the risk of ARDS and satisfying all inclusion and e xclusion criteria, the patient 
will be randomized to 5 mg LSALT peptide or blinded placebo to be given intravenously once  
daily for a maximum of 14 days. Physical and respi[INVESTIGATOR_462028], vital signs, and a dverse 
events will be recorded throughout the study, including Day 28 (EOS). Blood chemistries , 
hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, ECG, SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_591621] x-ray (CXR) will 
be assessed at Day 1 (Screening/Baseline) prior to initiation of study drug, and on Day 3 , EOT, 
and at EOS, as well as when clinically indicated. The ECG at EOS will only be obtained if 
clinically indicated. An additional CXR will be obtained at time of clinical improvement.  
Cytokines/biomarkers and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed at Day 1 (Screening/Baseline) 
prior to initiation of study drug, at 1 (mid-dose) and 2 hours (end of infusion) of drug therapy on 
Days 1, 3, EOT, and a single blood sample at EOS for cytokines/biomarkers only. Where 
applicable, a urinary pregnancy test will be obtained at Screening in women of childbearing 
potential. Questionnaires (APACHE II, SOFA) will be obtained at Baseline, Day 3, EOT, and 
EOS; venous blood gas (VBG) or HCO 3 (bicarbonate) levels may be substituted for arterial blood 
gas (ABG) if it is considered standard-of-care (SOC) or in the patient’s best interest , and results 
in comparable APACHE II and SOFA scores. Other questionnaires (Berlin Definition and 
modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale) will be assessed at Baseline, Day 3, EOT,  
and EOS. IgG, IgA, and IgM antiviral antibodies will be collected at Baseline and EOS. Patients 
will be maintained on the SOC per institutional guidelines, including prophylaxis or treatment of 
VTE, throughout the study.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate patients on a continuing basis for 
primarily safety assessments. Per the DSMB Charter, the DSMB will meet at least monthly if not 
more frequently based upon enrollment throughout the study period. 
NUMBER OF PATIENTS (PLANNED):   Thirty (30) patients will be randomized to active 
drug (LSALT peptide) and [ADDRESS_591622] at the site unblinded for the purpose of preparing 
drug/placebo for injection.

EFFICACY ENDPOINTS: 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
7 
 Primary efficacy endpoint: 
 To evaluate the proportion of subjects alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] ( e.g., need for 
non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow oxygen [≥ 6 L/minute], or 
ECMO) and free of the need for continued renal replacement therapy (RRT) on Day 28. 
The need for continued RRT at Day [ADDRESS_591628] 3 days 
(Day 26, 27, or 28) or an eGFR on Day 28 <10 mL/min/1.73 m2.     
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
 All-cause mortality 
 The presence and severity of ARDS as an ordinal outcome of the proportion of patients 
who have none, mild, moderate, or severe ARDS  
 Time to each of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS 
 The number of ventilation-free days and ECMO-free days 
 Time on nasal canula or oxygen mask 
 Length of stay in ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (admission to discharge)  
 Virologic clearance rate  
 Worst PaO 2/FiO2 ratio following enrollment  
 Change in PaO 2/FiO2 ratio 
 Vasopressor-free days 
 Change from maximal radiographic damage to EOT 
 Change in baseline mMRC score 
 Change in APACHE II score 
 Proportion of patients with extrapulmonary organ dysfunction using the daily SOFA score

 SAFETY ENDPOINTS: 
 Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
 Clinical laboratory tests 
 Physical examinations 
 Vital signs 
 12-lead electrocardiogram 
 Radiologic findings  
PHARMACOKINETICS (PK):  Blood samples will be obtained at Baseline prior to the start 
of drug infusion on Day 1, then midpoint (1 hour after start of infusion), and immediately 
following the daily 2-hour infusions on Days 1, 3, and at EOT regardless of active or placebo 
therapy. These blood samples will be analyzed for parent LSALT peptide and associated 
fragments (metabolites). Cytokines will be measured at the same times to assess relationship 
between drug concentrations and cytokine levels. 
STATISTICAL METHODS:   
Sample Size:  Sixty subjects are planned for enrollment (randomized and treated) in this study. 
Efficacy Analyses:  Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (the 
number of non‑missing values [n], mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and 
maximum). All categorical variables will be summarized with frequency counts and percentages, 
as applicable. Time to event variables will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
and compared between treatment groups using either Log-rank tests or Cox’s Proportional 
Hazard model adjusting for baseline covariates, as necessary.  For continuous variables assessed 
at multiple time points, a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach will be used or 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) if assessed at a single time point post-baseline. For 
categorical endpoints Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) methods will be used, or a logistic 
regression approach, in the case of continuous covariates. The primary efficacy analysis 
population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which will include all subjects randomized who 
receive any part of at least one infusion of randomized treatment, assigned to treatment group as 
randomized.   
Additional details regarding precise endpoint definitions (including transformations, as 
applicable), analysis model specifications and α-level control for primary and important 
secondary endpoints associated with multiplicity will be provided in a separate statistical analysis 
plan (SAP), to be finalized prior to unblinding the study.     
Although significant missing data with respect to the primary endpoint is not anticipated for a 
study of this duration (due to the nature of the endpoint), methods for handling missing data and 
intercurrent events, including for secondary endpoints will be specified in the SAP. These 
methods will be consistent with missing data due to death as having a worst possible outcome.

 Safety Analysis: 
All patients randomized and who received any part of at least one infusion of randomized 
treatment will be evaluated for safety according to the treatment actually received. The safety 
analyses will include evaluation of the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment tabulated by [INVESTIGATOR_322306], System Organ Class, and 
Preferred Term using the MedDRA coding system. Additional tables with AEs by [CONTACT_462106] [INVESTIGATOR_462034]. Laboratory data, vital signs, radiologic 
evidence, drug and cytokine concentrations, and ECGs assessments will be evaluated over time 
on study using descriptive statistics, including changes from baseline. Shift analyses of relevant 
clinical laboratory parameters will be produced showing shifts across low, normal, and high 
categories.

 3 INTRODUCTION 
 COVID-19 Background 
Recently, a global outbreak of a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_462041] 
2 (SARS-CoV-2; also listed as 2019-nCoV in the literature) and the disease it produces named 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected 2,355,676 total cases with 162,032 deaths 
globally (19-April-2020; Johns Hopkins, 2020). Similar to influenza, COVID-19 presents with 
fever > 100 °F, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and fatigue, and, in severe cases, bilateral 
pneumonia (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Jin et al, 2020). Diagnosis of COVID-19, or any 
coronavirus, is based on the symptoms and confirmed through laboratory testing. Human-to-
human transmission of COVID-19 has rapi[INVESTIGATOR_462042], urging individuals to exercise social and 
physical distancing ( e.g., 6 feet apart). Those who may be infected yet asymptomatic highlight the 
need to implement social distancing for all people (Ahmed et al, 2018; Lau et al, 2020). Recently, 
there are two FDA-approved treatments, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin, to 
treat SARS-CoV-2 under emergency use authorization (CDC, 2020a).  However, there is neither 
FDA-approved antiviral therapy nor a vaccine authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19, 
yet more than [ADDRESS_591639] been initiated looking at dozens of promising therapeutic 
interventions (Mullard, 2020). Patients with severe symptoms should go directly to an emergency 
department or contact [CONTACT_462109][INVESTIGATOR_057], in particular if 
community-acquired viral pneumonia is diagnosed (Grasselli et al, 2020). Criteria for progressive 
COVID-19 disease vs. disease improvement/stabilization include (Liu et al, 2020):  
 Age (66 vs. 37 years, U=4.932, P=0.001) 
 History of smoking (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ2=9.291, P=0.018) 
 Maximum body temperature at admission (38.2 °F vs. 37.5 °F, U=2.057, P=0.027) 
 Proportion with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ2=5.611, P=0.028) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] (34 vs. 24 breaths/minute, U=4.030, P=0.004) 
 Receive high-level respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] ( χ2=16.01, P=0.018) 
 C-reactive protein (38.9 vs. 10.6 mg/L, U=1.315, P=0.024) 
 Albumin (36.62 vs. 41.27 g/L, U=2.843, P=0.006). 
Others, including one report of 99 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan China and another of 201 patients 
in the same area, found similar signs and symptoms to diagnose community-acquired viral 
pneumonia (Chen et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020). 
Due to rapid escalation of this pandemic, clinicians and scientists have initiated experimental 
treatments for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Raoult and colleagues recently described 
their findings on the effects of 600 mg hydroxychloroquine daily in attenuating the symptoms of 
COVID-19 and reducing viral load (Gautret et al, 2020). Depending upon the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_462043], at the clinician’s discretion, azithromycin (Z-Pak 1500 mg over 5 days) was added to 
the regimen in this single arm, open-label, four site study at the Méditerranée Infection University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462044]. A total of 20 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226760]-19 infection were 
treated with hydroxychloroquine for up to 10 days and compared with 16 control patients. At Day 
6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were eradicated compared with 12.5% in the

 control group ( P=0.001). Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral with activity against SARS-
CoV-2 (Wang et al, 2020), manufactured by [CONTACT_462110], is being 
studied in a large ongoing clinical trial; cohorts studying the effects of individual and combination 
drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, and interferon-ß-1A, are also being studied 
in this prospective, multinational trial involving 3100 patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Remdesivir was 
very recently authorized by [CONTACT_194387] 1, 2020 for the emergency use in the treatment of 
COVID-19 (FDA, 2020). 
There is also an ongoing post-exposure prophylaxis study with hydroxychloroquine and 
azithromycin ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In many cases ( e.g., vitamin C infusions for the treatment of severe 
2019-nCoV pneumonia; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), success of the treatments will not be known for several 
months to years.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_462045], none of the potential 
antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_462046]-controlled studies are 
completed. Furthermore, it is becoming apparent that once cytokine release syndrome and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_462047]-[ADDRESS_591640] immune/inflammatory 
responses (Moore and June, 2020; Henderson et al, 2020). A large proportion of patients with 
critical illness related to viral pneumonia still die despi[INVESTIGATOR_462048] (Ayres, 
2020). Furthermore, uncontrolled host immune responses, also known as cytokine storms, drive 
the need for critical care, ventilatory support, and ensuing mortality from COVID-19.  
 
There is mounting evidence that organs other than, or in addition to lungs are damaged by [CONTACT_4113]-
19 (Zhai et al, 2020; Klok et al, 2020; Shi et al, 2020). A recent report from 13 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462049] 5,449 patients over a 5-week period highlights this issue (Hirsch et al, 2020). 
The vast majority of patients were diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) within 1 month of 
mechanical ventilation in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The odds ratio for need for ventilation 
and AKI was 10.7. At the time of the publication, 780 (39%) were still admitted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 
519 (26%) had been discharged, and 694 (35%) had died. Other organs such as the liver, 
gastrointestinal tract, and the heart have been similarly compromised in COVID-[ADDRESS_591641] 
immune/inflammatory response.  
 Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_462050] (ARDS) is a life-threatening inflammatory response to 
triggers such as infections and sepsis, resulting in acute lung injury (ALI) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] 
(Jenne and Kubes, 2015; Thompson et al, 2017). The prevalence of ARDS in 459 ICUs from 50 
countries was 10.4% (3022 ARDS patients of 29,144 ICU patients; Bellani et al, 2016), with more 
than 75% being diagnosed with ARDS in the first 48 hours of admission to the ICU. This 
prevalence was divided into mild (30.9%), moderate ARDS (46.6%), and severe ARDS (23.4%). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400075] 34.9%, 40.3%, and 46.1% for those with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, 
respectively. Others have reported a similar mortality rate (Cochi et al, 2016). The incidence of 
ARDS was highest in the [LOCATION_002] (80.1 cases per 100,000 person-years) and lowest in Iceland

20 
 (3.65 cases per 100,000 person-years), likely due to patient characteristics including gender, race, 
and age, and early recognition of the signs and symptoms of ARDS (Pham and Rubenfield, 2017; 
Eworuke et al, 2018).  
Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401536]-19, and secondary infections developed in 10% (Huang et al, 2020; Chen et al, 2020). In 
one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days (Wang et al, 2020). Among 
201 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 41.8% developed ARDS, and among these patients, 
52.4% died (Wu et al, 2020). Comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as those 
presenting with dyspnea, were found in patients who developed ARDS compared with those who 
did not. Risk factors for ARDS in this special population who died from ARDS-related disease 
were older age, neutrophilia, and underlying or evolving organ and coagulation dysfunction.  
The cascade of pattern recognition receptor activation, upregulation of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, and ultimately recruitment of leukocytes to the affected tissue, in this case alveoli, 
results in the release of cytotoxins, ensuing cytotoxicity and cellular death. A number of 
interventions have been implemented over the last decade including (1) positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_22325] (PEEP) to keep alveoli open for oxygenation of the deoxygenated blood, (2) induction of 
paralysis in the patient maintained on a lung-protective mechanical ventilator, and (3) prone 
positioning (patient lying face-down) for 16–18 hours per day to prevent primary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (Festic 
et al, 2015; Albert, 2012). All interventions have reduced the mortality from 41% to 16%, however, 
these measures are supportive, at best, but at least reduce mortality in patients with ARDS. There 
remains no therapeutic modality to prevent the development of ARDS nor target its specific 
pathophysiology once diagnosed (Rawal et al, 2018). Trials with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_462051]/formoterol, amongst others, have been studied but despi[INVESTIGATOR_462052], mortality 
and morbidity remain high (Panka et al, 2017; Pais et al, 2018). Since 2010, ARDS mortality rates 
of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], ICU, 28/30-day, and 60-day mortality were 45, 38, 30, and 32%, respectively (Máca 
et al, 2017); thus, at least a third of patients with ARDS do not survive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Others 
(Bellani et al, 2016) have shown mortality rates as high as 46% for those with severe ARDS, 
defined by a PaO 2/FIO2 <100 mmHg based on the Berlin Definition (Ranieri et al, 2012).  
A keystone to preventing and managing ARDS is understanding the interaction between 
leukocytes, primarily neutrophils, and endothelial cells which line the vascular lumen of the lung 
allowing the exchange of oxygen between alveoli and blood (Mammoto and Mammoto, 2019). As 
part of the endothelial glycocalyx, which on its own may be a target in the cascade of events related 
to ARDS (Porras et al, 2018; Ozolina et al, 2016), these small capi[INVESTIGATOR_462053] a critical 
pathway for delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and cellular components to local tissues while also 
eliminating waste products carbon dioxide and blood. The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of 
injury in the lung actually results in “friendly fire” since cytokines expressed and released by 
[CONTACT_462111] ( e.g., infection) also result in 
“by[CONTACT_112815]” cytotoxicity of previously normal tissue and end-organ damage (Narasaraju et al, 
2011; Collins et al, 2013). Further, interactions between neutrophils and inflammatory mediators 
at the site of damage result in increased stiffness of the neutrophil and inability to deform due to 
rearrangement of the cytoskeleton within the capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996], leading to vascular congestion and 
ischemia (Doerschuk, 2000; Williams and Chambers, 2014).

 Discovered by [CONTACT_462112], dipeptidase-1 (DPEP-1) is a vascular adhesion receptor 
for recruitment of neutrophils and other immune responders to organs of pathogenic inflammation, 
including the lung, liver, and kidneys (Choudhury et al, 2019). Thus, DPEP-1 is a viable target for 
therapeutic intervention to halt attraction of neutrophils as well abrogate binding of the neutrophil 
to endothelial cells (Figure 1). The therapeutic intervention of the LSALT peptide is discussed 
later, but it specifically binds to DPEP-1 and not DPEP-2 nor DPEP-3 (Figure 2). More 
information is found in Section 3.3.

There is no cure for ARDS, only patient supportive strategies (American Lung Association, 2020). 
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_462054]-protective ventilation with lower tidal volumes, thereby [CONTACT_462113]-6, IL-8, and TNF α (Parsons 
et al, 2005; Ranieri et al, 1999). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is often used for 
severe ARDS to allow lung healing/repair and reverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (Peek et al, 2009). High-
frequency oscillatory ventilation, with its rapid delivery of low tidal volumes and a respi[INVESTIGATOR_462055] 60 to 900 breaths/minute, has also been utilized in ARDS patients to avoid 
complications found with traditional ventilators (Meyers et al, 2019; Chan et al, 2007).  Other 
measures are outlined in Rawal et al, 2018. All interventions do not prevent ARDS, rather stabilize 
any ongoing lung injury, and in some cases, reduce overall mortality (Saguil and Fargo, 2012).  
It is important to understand that multi-organ dysfunction associated with ARDS, such as acute 
kidney injury (AKI; Cheng et al, 2020; Martinez-Rojas et al, 2020), cardiomyopathies (Shi et al, 
2020; Akhmerov and Marban, 2020), VTE (Llitjos et al, 2020; Zhai et al, 2020), acute liver failure 
(Xu et al, 2020; Lee et al, 2020), amongst others also occur alone in COVID-19. Some reports 
accurately suggest that ARDS also arises from non-pulmonary conditions including acute

22 
 pancreatitis, sepsis, trauma, pneumonia, burns, elective surgery, and amniotic fluid embolisms 
(Fan et al, 2018; Cutts et al, 2016). A recent review of [ADDRESS_591642] 
acute or chronic renal impairment prior to ARDS (an exclusion criteria for their primary analysis) 
revealed the following facts:  
 68.3% developed AKI of which half (48.4%) were stage III severe AKI  
 Median time of onset was 4 days 
 Higher BMI (> 30 kg/m2), history of DM, high SOFA score (3 – 4), and acidosis were risk 
factors for Stage III AKI (Panitchote et al, 2019).  
Others have shown similar results associating ARDS with the development of nephropathies (Liu 
et al, 2012; Tignanelli et al, 2018; Darmon et al, 2014). ARDS is also associated with acute liver 
failure which increases in severity as the severity of ARDS increases (Kallet et al, 2019). In this 
single-center retrospective study, 1747 patients with ARDS were evaluated for prevalence, 
severity, and mortality by [CONTACT_34565]. Up to four nonpulmonary organ dysfunctions were 
common at the onset of ARDS: trauma-associated ARDS had the lowest mortality rate and 
decreased in prevalence with increasing ARDS severity. In contrast, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]-associated ARDS 
had the highest mortality rate, second only to sepsis, which increased in prevalence with increasing 
severity. COVID-19 has been linked to pulmonary damage through the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al, 2020). Since ACE2 
is extensively expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of the heart, kidney, liver, intestine, and 
testis, amongst others, it is hypothesized that coronavirus will bind to ACE2 in these organs as 
well, resulting in multiple organ failure secondary to activated neutrophils expressing cytokines 
(Varga et al, 2020; Fu et al, 2020; Henderson et al, 2020). 
Since late 2019, intensivists treating COVID-[ADDRESS_591643] identified acute lung injury which 
approximates ARDS, largely a result of activated neutrophils at the infected alveolar endothelial 
level. The Berlin definition of mild ARDS is 200 mmHg < PaO 2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg with PEEP or 
CPAP ≥ 5 cm H 2O (Table 1; Donahoe, 2011). However, when supplemental oxygen is 
administered to a patient, there are ways to determine whether a VQ mismatch is the source of 
poor oxygenation or if there is a right to left shunt that is causative. The rule of thumb for 
oxygenation improvement is that for every 10% change in FiO 2, there should be an accompanying 
increase in the arterial PaO 2 of 7 mmHg. For example, a patient is receiving 50% FiO 2 by [CONTACT_462114] a drop in pulse oximetry, the patient is then placed on 100% by [CONTACT_105]-rebreather (mask). 
The expected increase in PaO 2 related to the 50% increase in FIO 2 (50→100) should be 35 mmHg 
(7x5=35). If the increase in PaO [ADDRESS_591644] or greater than 35 mmHg, then there is a right to 
left shunt (Figure 3), suggesting an increased risk of cellular anaerobic metabolism at end organ, 
which could lead to the need for intubation. 
The NIAID Ordinal Scale could capture this information: 1) Death; 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive 
mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on 
non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental 
oxygen; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical care 
(COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer 
requires ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home 
oxygen; 8) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities.  Any change from scale #4 to scale #[ADDRESS_591645] worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_462056]. This would be the

23 
 ideal time for intervention to prevent ARDS, although this scale does not obviate clinical 
judgement and the decision may occur prior to scale #4.  
In COVID-[ADDRESS_591646] there is a signal of uncoupling of the lungs ability to augment oxygenation. 
This inability is multifactorial related to poor diffusion, VQ mismatch caused by [CONTACT_462115], 
and microvascular thrombosis resulting in right to left shunt physiology (Gattinoni et al, 2020; 
Figure 3). Augmented PEEP in this setting can be deleterious, due to inappropriate redistribution 
of cardiac output to areas of thrombosis or poor diffusion caused by [CONTACT_462116][INVESTIGATOR_462057]-19 (Greenland et al, 2020; Gattinoni et al, 2020), although others continue 
with moderate to high levels of PEEP in these patients (Matthay et al, 2020; Poston et al, 2020; 
Alhazzani et al, 2020). 
Scientists are also exploring the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in pulmonary disease, 
including ventilator-associated nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, virus-
related acute lung injury, and pneumonia-related ARDS (Mikacenic et al, 2018; Ebrahimi et al, 
2018; Lefrançais et al, 2018; Bendib et al, 2019; Twaddell et al, 2019). Indeed, Bendib and 
colleagues speculate on the potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in ARDS (Bendib et al, 2019). 
The formation of NETs has been linked to disease severity and mortality, including recruitment of 
macrophages to the active site which secrete IL-1ß which in turn induces IL-6. All-together, the 
ensuing cytokine storm leads to respi[INVESTIGATOR_462058] (Zhu et al, 
2020; Barnes et al, 2020; Kaplan and Radic, 2012; Henderson et al, 2020).  
By [CONTACT_462117]-associated cascade of events, LSALT peptide may be an option 
to more fully understand the therapeutic benefits of NETs clinically as well as harm to normal 
tissue and organs. Further research with patient-centric outcomes will be a focus of subsequent 
research with LSALT peptide.

 As discussed above, reports are emerging during this viral crisis that damage to the lungs are in 
part due to an evolving cytokine storm (Mehta et al, 2020; Ruan et al, 2020; Yang Y et al, 2020). 
Biomarkers such as the interleukins (specifically interleukin-1ß, IL-1ra, IL-6, IFN ɤ, and TNF α, 
amongst others), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (CXCL10, IP-10), and serum ferritin are 
elevated in patients with COVID-19 with evolving acute lung injury (Xu et al, 2020; Ye et al, 
2020). We will study the prognostic value of these biomarkers and their relevance to the severity 
of ARDS (Jiang et al, 2005; Liu et al, 2020) and COVID-19 (Zhang et al, 2020; Cao X, 2020). 
Our study is focused on COVID-19 pneumonia which, not surprisingly, had higher prevalence and 
greater mortality with increasing severity of ARDS of all nonpulmonary etiologies, likely due to 
increasing hypoxemia, fluid overload, and ongoing ischemia. We will also assess multiple organ 
dysfunction to more broadly evaluate viral damage. Clearly there is an unmet medical need to find 
a therapeutic intervention to prevent the onset of ARDS and other acute organ dysfunction in 
patients with COVID-19. 
 Scoring systems 
[IP_ADDRESS] Berlin ARDS definition 
ARDS was first described by [CONTACT_462118] 1967, describing a syndrome 
characterized by [CONTACT_462119], severe hypoxemia, diffuse lung infiltrates, and 
decreased lung parenchymal system compliance in the absence of evidence for congestive heart 
failure (Ashbaugh et al, 1967; Cutts et al, 2016). In 1988, Murray et al. introduced the Lung Injury 
Score (LIS), an assessment tool for ARDS, which incorporates four parameters on a scale of 0 → 
4: (1) ratio of PaO 2 to FiO 2, (2) total respi[INVESTIGATOR_347991], (3) level of PEEP, and (4) extent of 
radiologic infiltrates (Murray et al, 1988). Six years later, the American-European Consensus 
Conference (AECC) on ARDS defined ARDS as respi[INVESTIGATOR_462061] a 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio < [ADDRESS_591647] x-ray, and 
a pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] ≤ 18 mmHg or no evidence of left atrial hypertension 
(Bernard et al, 1994; Raghavendran and Napolitano, 2011).  
The AECC definition was readily adopted by [CONTACT_462120]; however, issues 
with the original definition required some adjustments, including PaO 2/FiO2 ratios adjusted for 
ventilator settings, increase reliability of the chest x-ray criteria, and distinguishing hydrostatic 
edema (Phua et al, 2008). The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by [CONTACT_462121] (Ranieri et al, 2012; Ferguson et al, 2012). The degree 
of hypoxemia divided the Berlin Definition into three categories (Table 1).

[IP_ADDRESS] Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) 
There are many quantitative scoring instruments to assess the number and severity of multiple 
organ dysfunctions, including the Denver Postinjury Multiple Organ Failure score (Sauaia et al, 
2009), Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS; Marshall et al, 1995), and the 
Predisposition, Infection, Response, and Organ Failure (PI[INVESTIGATOR_274317]) Sepsis Classification System 
(Granja et al, 2013), amongst others.  The sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score; 
Table 2), previously known as the sepsis-related organ failure assessment score (Vincent et al, 
1996), is used to track a patient's status during the stay in an ICU to determine the extent of organ 
function or rate of failure. This score has been compared with the other scoring systems, and with 
few exceptions, results in better sensitivity, specificity, and a balance between the two for mortality 
and organ dysfunction (Hutchings et al, 2017; Granja et al, 2013; Fröhlich et al, 2016; Soo  et al, 
209; Ulvik et al, 2007). The SOFA score is based on six different scores, one each for the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurologic systems.

microbial stimuli, a common framework of events exists regardless of disease context which 
includes activation of pattern recognition receptors, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
and recruitment of leukocytes to affected tissues (Kopf et al, 2010; Nourshargh and Alon, 2014; 
Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). The interactions between recruited leukocytes and endothelial cells 
has been studied in detail to understand the exact processes that allows immune cells to bind to 
and infiltrate into injured or infected tissues. Endothelial receptors for leukocyte adhesion, 
including various selectins ( e.g., E-selectin), integrins and members of the immunoglobulin family 
(e.g., PECAM1), have been identified yet other unknown receptors remain. Although 
inflammation is beneficial in eliminating microorganisms, abnormal and damaged cells during 
disease, it can also cause organ dysfunction and failure due to an excessive or unrelenting response 
that involves the overproduction of cytokines, cytotoxicity, and cell death (Kuchroo et al, 2012). 
LSALT, a peptide drug with the sequence NH3-LSALTPSPSWLKYKAL-COOH, binds to 
dipeptidase-1 (DPEP-1) but does not inhibit its biologic enzymatic activity, potentially minimizing 
off-target or other adverse effects. LSALT peptide inhibits leukocyte recruitment in multiple 
experimental disease models through the direct inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to DPEP-1 present 
in lungs, kidney, and liver (Choudhury et al, 2019; Figure 4). DPEP-[ADDRESS_591649] for leukocyte adhesion discovered by [CONTACT_462112].

LSALT peptide was discovered by [CONTACT_462123] a combinatorial 
phage display library17 was used to isolate specific peptide-displaying-phage that homed to the 
liver and lungs of mice during an inflammatory condition. In brief, neutrophils were isolated from 
C57/BL6 mice. RNA isolated from these neutrophils were then converted into cDNA. These

 neutrophil-derived cDNA’s were then fused into the coat protein gene of T7 phage thereby 
[CONTACT_57148] a library called T7N. This resulted in a random pool of T7 phages which presented 
various neutrophil peptides on the surface. These phage display libraries were subtracted by 
[CONTACT_462124]. Unbound phage were then isolated from the culture and injected into neutrophil-
depleted mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Phage that bound to the lung and liver 
endothelium were recovered, isolated and re-injected into another group of mice to enrich for the 
specific homing phage. This process was repeated five times in vivo to identify enriched phage 
clones that specifically homed to the lungs and liver. After isolation, phage were screened on the 
basis of their ability to inhibit neutrophil recruitment in the liver sinusoids in the presence of LPS 
by [CONTACT_462125]. A specific peptide-displaying phage was isolated that inhibited the 
adhesion of neutrophils in the liver sinusoids in response to LPS in vivo. This phage subclone 
expressed the peptide NH3-LSALTPSPSWLKYKAL-COOH and designated as LSALT peptide.  
 Pre-Clinical Data for Dipeptidase-I and LSALT Peptide in AKI 
[IP_ADDRESS] DPEP-1 expression and function in kidney, liver, and lung  
DPEP-1 expression and localization were characterized in renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (TEC) 
cultured from human nephrectomy tissue samples were labeled with either zonula occludens-1 
(ZO-1), a tight junction protein found on TEC, and DPEP-1. Confocal microscopy confirmed the 
expression of DPEP-[ADDRESS_591650]-translational glycosylation as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_462126]. Functional activity of DPEP-1 was determined in various samples using 
fluorescent enzyme activity assay that demonstrated high levels of dipeptidase expression or 
activity in both human and mouse lung, liver, and kidney tissue. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Specificity of LSALT Peptide binding to DPEP-1  
DPEP-1 as a binding target for LSALT peptide was confirmed by [CONTACT_462127], canine, or 
human DPEP-1 in Cos-1 cells and treated with fluorescently labeled LSALT peptide. Analysis 
with fluorescent confocal microscopy of these cells demonstrated that LSALT peptide was bound 
only to cells expressing DPEP-1. This specific interaction was confirmed using a biotin-labeled 
LSALT peptide immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_462066]-1. Total protein lysates from DPEP-1 
overexpressing cells were treated with biotin-labeled LSALT peptide and the protein complex was 
pulled down with neutravidin conjugated beads before analysis by [CONTACT_462128]-
DPEP-1 antibody. Immunoblot analysis revealed that DPEP-1 interacted with LSALT peptide but 
not non-specific control peptide indicating specificity of LSALT peptide binding to DPEP-1. 
To ensure LSALT peptide would not target similar proteins, other members of the dipeptidase 
family were also assessed. Human DPEP-1, DPEP-2, and DPEP-3 were transiently expressed in

28 
 Cos-1 cells before being treated with fluorescent-labeled LSALT peptide. Analysis by [CONTACT_462129]-1 expressing cells but not DPEP-2 or 
DPEP-3 expressing cells. 
DPEP-1 enzyme activity was tested using a fluorometric assay originally described by [CONTACT_462130] 1995 (Heywood and Hooper, 1995). Enzymatic activity of DPEP-1 was confirmed 
in lysates from human, rat, and mouse derived DPEP-1 expressing cells. Cilastatin or 
penicillamine, known functional inhibitors of DPEP-1, abrogated the enzymatic activity of both 
human and mouse DPEP-1. When cells expressing human DPEP-1 were treated with LSALT 
peptide, no significant decrease in DPEP-1 enzymatic activity was detected indicating that LSALT 
peptide binds to DPEP-1 but does not inhibit its enzymatic activity.  
To determine whether the catalytic region of DPEP-1 was required for LSALT peptide interaction, 
a catalytically inert human DPEP-1 (E141D) was transiently expressed in Cos-[ADDRESS_591651] on LSALT peptide binding on cells as compared to normal DPEP-
1 or negative mutant controls (H215). Loss of enzymatic activity in the catalytically inert DPEP-
1 (E>D) was confirmed using the fluorometric assay (Gaber et al, 2011). Protein expression level 
of catalytically inert DPEP-1 (E141D) in Cos-1 cells was also confirmed by [CONTACT_259771]. 
In a human in vitro static neutrophil adhesion assay, LSALT peptide inhibited neutrophil adhesion 
to activated endothelium at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL. 
[IP_ADDRESS] DPEP-1 plays a role in renal ischemia reperfusion injury 
Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). A reduction 
in renal blood flow followed by [CONTACT_462131]. Renal IRI results in inflammation 
that includes leukocyte infiltration, renal hemorrhage, and tubular cell necrosis. Inflammation 
plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of renal IRI, however there are currently no 
therapeutic strategies in human AKI that directly target this pathway. To determine the potential 
impact of LSALT peptide in renal IRI, a survival model of murine renal IRI was employed where 
a vascular clamp is placed on the renal pedicle of a unilateral nephrectomized mouse to induce 
warm ischemia and subsequently released to induce reperfusion injury. A significant inflammatory 
response can be observed in the kidney as early as 2 hours of renal IRI with large numbers of 
monocytes and neutrophils infiltrating into the tubular/interstitial space. Furthermore, because of 
immune cell infiltration and extravasation, loss of endothelial integrity can also be observed as 
blood vessels become leaky and no longer retain their web-like organization. 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], mice undergoing renal IRI developed oliguria/anuria over the course of 2 days due 
to loss of kidney function measured as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr). Treatment of mice 
with LSALT peptide (10 µg/kg) prior to renal IRI ameliorated AKI allowing mice to maintain 
normal urine output and preserving renal function. A similar effect on AKI was also seen with 
cilastatin (35 µg/kg), a chemical inhibitor of DPEP-1, albeit less effective than LSALT peptide.

29 
 Furthermore, dose response experiments demonstrated that LSALT peptide effectively inhibited 
the inflammatory response to renal IRI at a dose as low as 100 ng/kg. 
Use of another DPEP-1 targeting peptide, GFE-1 (10 µg/kg), also demonstrated protection against 
renal IRI induced inflammation in a similar manner as LSALT peptide (10 µg/kg; Choudhury 
thesis, 2018). 
[IP_ADDRESS] DPEP-1 plays a role in lung & renal inflammation during endotoxemia and sepsis 
Sepsis is the result of overwhelming bacterial infection and systemic activation of inflammatory 
pathways. Accumulation of leukocytes in tissues/organs is responsible for many sepsis 
manifestations including lung injury (ARDS) and AKI.  
To evaluate the effect of the LSALT peptide in models of sepsis, mice were administered lethal 
doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without pre-treatment with the LSALT peptide (given 
as a single dose before the LPS). All mice receiving LPS intravenously alone succumbed within 
48 hours. Mice pretreated with a single dose of LSALT peptide survived. Pathology of the lungs 
in mice LPS plus LSALT peptide demonstrated significantly less inflammation and injury 
compared to mice receiving LPS alone. Similarly, LSALT peptide prevented the accumulation of 
neutrophils and monocytes in the kidney. In a more physiologic model of sepsis, LSALT peptide 
was also protective in terms of survival and AKI. Mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture and 
followed for 48 hours. Mice were untreated (no antibiotics) or pre-treated with a single dose of the 
LSALT peptide. Mice receiving the LSALT peptide demonstrated less kidney inflammation at [ADDRESS_591652]-intravenous dosing of 100, 250, and 450 
mg/kg in rats.  Terminal elimination half-lives of 0.66 – 1.17 hr and MRT obs values of 0.58 – 0.85 
hr were observed for LSALT peptide. The AUC 0-∞ was linear and close to proportional with dose. 
LSALT peptide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_462067], likely 
from endopeptidase activity as measured by [CONTACT_450]. In mouse studies, at least one 
LSALT proteolytic fragment remains biologically active. Some of the proteolytic fragments have 
been detected in human plasma for as long as 120 minutes. LSALT peptide is undetectable in 
whole blood in the absence of phosphoric acid due to proteolytic digestion. LSALT peptide 
however is compatible with blood and does not induce red blood cell hemolysis. Work is ongoing 
to identify the LSALT peptide volume of distribution, tissue biodistribution, and excretion. 
 Toxicology and Safety 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LSALT peptide in mice and rats is 100 and 450 mg/kg, 
respectively, which is several logs above the minimum effective dose of 100 ng/kg to prevent 
organ inflammation and injury in mice. In dogs, the MTD of LSALT is 20 mg/kg. In all mouse 
studies, no LSALT peptide-related toxicity has been observed at therapeutic doses.

groups of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg/day were evaluated. The control group was administered the 
vehicle used to prepare the LSALT peptide dosing formulations (0.9% sodium chloride, USP).  
The LSALT peptide dose formulations and the control vehicle were administered to rats by 
[CONTACT_462133] a dose volume of 1 mL/kg based on the most recent body weight of 
each animal. The progression or regression of any effects was evaluated during an additional 14-

 The dose level of 15 mg/kg resulted in manifestation of pseudo-allergic (anaphylactoid) infusion 
reactions. The clinical signs appeared shortly after dosing and consisted of reddening of the skin 
around the eyes and mouth, head flicking, facial edema, hives/reddening on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_462068], and/or 
reddened eyes and muzzle. Pseudo-allergic reactions were typi[INVESTIGATOR_462069]. Affected animals were treated with diphenhydramine by [CONTACT_51215]. 
These reactions occurred during infusion and disappeared shortly after the infusion was completed. 
Other clinical signs were sporadic and not considered to be related to treatment with the test item. 
These reactions may likely diminish by [CONTACT_462137] 
≥ 15 mg/kg.  
Pseudo-allergic reactions following intravenous administration of peptides/proteins in dogs have 
been reported and occur in response to the infusion of biotherapeutics. Non-clinical infusion 
reactions do not necessarily predict responses in humans (Mease et al, 2017; Cohn et al, 2007; 
Roselló et al, 2017).  
Repeated dosing in the dose range of 2.5 to 15 mg/kg had no statistically significant effects. There 
were no differences in vital signs, body weight, or food consumption between the treated and 
control groups during the study. Changes in hematology and clinical chemistry were mild, 
generally within normal ranges, and unlikely of clinical significance. No changes in gross 
pathology and histopathology were attributed to the test item.  Gross findings noted upon necropsy 
of Main Study animals included a white-tan area of capsular thickening and contraction in the 
spleen of one mid-dose female and marked enlargement, redness, and protrusion of the right third 
eyelid in the eye of one high-dose female. These gross findings were considered incidental and 
unlikely to be test item-related. There were no statistically significant findings on organ weights 
that could be attributed to the test item treatment. 
The NOAEL in dogs is 2.5 mg/kg. 
 Preliminary Safety in Humans

 Study Rationale 
According to a report by [CONTACT_462138], more than [ADDRESS_591656] 
description of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 in China (Mullard, 2020). A further [ADDRESS_591657] 300 trials will either be ongoing or 
initiated studying various cures for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from antivirals such as remdesivir, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], and ritonavir, to repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other 
immunomodulators, to cellular and vitamin interventions. The question raised in this article is: 
“Do we need 300 trials? Is that a good use of resources?” 
Coupled with this very recent article (published April 18, 2020) is an article by [CONTACT_462139] 
(published on April 17, 2020) questioning the priority of successful treatments of infectious 
diseases, which is obviously a primary endpoint of every ID study, without addressing concern for 
patients who progress to life-threatening sequelae of COVID-19 infections, including ARDS, 
septic shock, and multi-organ failure. These are serious conditions that result from immune 
responses to the virus (as discussed in the Introduction of this protocol). About one-quarter of 
patients presumably eradicated from a viral infection still die due to the underlying conditions 
resulting from host immune responses to the viral infection (Versluys and Boelens, 2018; Louis et 
al, 2012). [CONTACT_462159] asks a very important question in her article: It is equally as important to ask 

Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
33 
 the question: “How do we survive infections?” as it is to ask the familiar question: “How do we 
fight infections?”   
Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) is a devastating complication for patients infected 
with microorganisms, including COVID-19. Currently, there are no effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_462070]. Inflammation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of lung injury related 
to viral pneumonia and COVID-19. Recent pathologic and molecular studies confirm a prominent 
role for neutrophils and other inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated lung 
injury (Zhou et al, 2020; Varga et al 2020).  
Similarly, acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with COVID19 has important clinical implications 
with more than two thirds of patients experiencing prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death (Hirsch 
et al, 2020). While the pathophysiology of COVID19-associated AKI is not fully understood, 
inflammation related to direct viral infection of kidney cells, renal ischemia or systemic illness 
(sepsis or cytokine storm) are believed to play a role (Batlle et al, 2020; Diao et al, 2020). 
Given its favorable toxicology and clinical pharmacology profiles, the administration of LSALT 
peptide to target lung and kidney inflammation and prevent or minimize ARDS or AKI during a 
COVID-[ADDRESS_591658]. During 
the course of their disease, approximately 17 – 42% of COVID-[ADDRESS_591659] half of those patients died while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (Chen 
et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020; Wang et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020). 36.6% of patients developed 
AKI in the series by [CONTACT_462140][INVESTIGATOR_059]. Of the patients who were discharged, a large proportion were left with significant 
kidney dysfunction (Hirsch et al, 2020). How many had cleared the virus is unknown from the 
literature.  
Clearly, a therapeutic intervention that prevents life-threatening ARDS is needed. Even a 20 – 30% 
reduction in ARDS incidence or severity during COVID-[ADDRESS_591660] on 
clinical outcomes and health systems, including mortality, critical care, and ventilatory capacity. 
LSALT peptide has shown activity in animal models of inflammation including lung, kidney, and 
liver injury in the context of bacterial sepsis and its safety profile has been well-described in 
healthy adult subjects. Thus, the critical next step is the proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19. We are attempting to answer the question: “How do we 
survive infections?” 
 Dose Justification 
In order to identify a potential starting dose in the Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with 
COVID-19 using the existing data, toxicology data from the 14-day dog toxicology study were 
relied on; these are considered to be the most appropriate as the NOAEL in rats (50 mg/kg) is 
much less sensitive than the dog. In the 14-day dog toxicology study, the NOAEL dose was 
established as 2.5 mg/kg/day. The FDA’s Guidance for Industry entitled “Estimating the 
Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy 
Volunteers” (FDA, 2005) was used to determine the human equivalent dose (HED) for an infected

34 
 adult weighing 70 kg. This patient represents the mid-range of the weight of COVID-19 patients 
intended to be included in the Phase 2 trial. The dog NOAEL dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day converts to a 
HED of 1.4 mg/kg/day. Applying a safety factor of 10 results in an initial starting dose of 
approximately 0.14 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day. The study dose of 5 mg over 2 hours is substantially 
less than the HED and safe according to the Phase 1 results.

5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 Overall Study Design and Plan – Description 
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept study 
of LSALT peptide as prevention of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) and acute kidney 
injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).  
After assessing the risk of ARDS and satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient 
will be randomized to 5 mg LSALT peptide or blinded placebo to be given intravenously once 
daily for a maximum of 14 days. Physical and respi[INVESTIGATOR_462028], vital signs, and adverse 
events will be recorded throughout the study, including Day 28 (EOS). Blood chemistries, 
hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, ECG, SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_591663] x-ray (CXR) will 
be assessed at Day 1 (Screening/Baseline) prior to initiation of study drug, and on Day 3, EOT, 
and at EOS, as well as when clinically indicated. The ECG at EOS will only be obtained if 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
37 
 clinically indicated. An additional CXR will be obtained at time of clinical improvement. 
Cytokines/biomarkers and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed at Day 1 (Screening/Baseline) 
prior to initiation of study drug, and on Days 1, 3, and EOT at 1 (mid-dose) and 2 hours (end of 
infusion) of drug therapy, and a single blood sample at EOS for cytokines/biomarkers only. Where 
applicable, a urinary pregnancy test will be obtained at Screening in women of childbearing 
potential. When clinically indicated, questionnaires (APACHE II, SOFA) will be obtained at 
Baseline, EOT, and EOS; venous blood gas (VBG) or HCO 3 (bicarbonate) levels may be 
substituted for arterial blood gas (ABG) if it is standard-of-care (SOC) or in the patient’s best 
interest, and results in comparable APACHE II and SOFA scores (Brown et al, 2016). Other 
questionnaires (Berlin Definition and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale) will be 
assessed at Baseline, Day 3, EOT, and EOS. IgG, IgA, and IgM antiviral antibodies will be 
collected at Baseline and EOS. Patients will be maintained on the SOC per institutional guidelines, 
including prophylaxis or treatment of VTE, throughout the study.  
Patients will be randomized to one of two blinded treatment regimens: 
1. [ADDRESS_591664] of 
care (SOC) for the treatment of COVID-19 as defined by [CONTACT_462141]/or physician 
practice. Co-morbidities and concomitant medications will be reviewed daily and documented in 
the patient’s eCRF. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential consequence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be assessed and prophylaxis will be included as SOC for every patient 
(Zhai et al, 2020; Klok et al, 2020). Please refer to antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-
19 (COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with COVID-19, 
p197; 17-December-2020).   
 Number of Patients (Planned) 
Thirty (30) patients will be randomized to active drug (LSALT peptide) and 30 patients will be 
randomized to matching placebo. Patients and, if necessary, the Legal Authorized Representative 
(LAR), the Investigational Staff, and the Sponsor and its representatives will not know the 
randomization schemata. The Pharmacist at the site will be unblinded and prepare drug/placebo 
for injection.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate patients on a continuing basis for 
primarily safety assessments but also the adequacy of treatment based upon clinical data of the 
patient, target drug concentrations, and data obtained from the AB001 PK study in healthy subjects 
to offer recommendations to the Sponsor. In the absence of adverse events or any safety issues 
during the course of study, the DSMB may recommend continuance or suspension of the study 
due to futility or safety issues. The DSMB will meet at least monthly if not more frequently based 
upon enrollment throughout the study period.  Per protocol, at no time will patients be dosed for 
more than [ADDRESS_591665] patient being enrolled into study.

 Discussion of Study Design 
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate 
LSALT peptide compared with placebo in a defined number of adult hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462071]-19. This is a 1:1 randomization comparing 5 mg LSALT peptide daily with 
matching placebo. LSALT peptide or drug-free saline will begin immediately once the patient 
meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria at the start of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462072], blood chemistries, coagulation,  hematology, ECGs, SARS-CoV-2 tests, CXRs, 
biomarkers, and PK will be recorded periodically throughout the 28 day study. When clinically 
indicated, questionnaires (APACHE II, SOFA) will be obtained at Baseline, EOT, and EOS; 
venous blood gas (VBG) or HCO 3 (bicarbonate) levels may be substituted for arterial blood gas 
(ABG) if it is SOC or in the patient’s best interest, and results in comparable APACHE II and 
SOFA scores (Brown et al, 2016). Other questionnaires (Berlin Definition and modified Medical 
Research Council Dyspnea Scale) will be assessed at Baseline, Day 3, EOT, and EOS. Patients 
will be maintained on SOC, including prophylaxis or treatment for VTE, per institutional 
guidelines throughout the study. Dosing will end on Day 14, or at cure or increasing severity of 
ARDS, or at death. Patients will be followed clinically, and safety and efficacy measures will be 
recorded at end of study (EOS; Day 28) or death, whichever occurs first.

41 
 assessments until Day 28, or if not possible then for all assessments necessary to determine the 
value of the primary endpoint at Day 28.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Early Termination of Treatment 
For any discontinuation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_462073]. If the reason for discontinuation is an AE, the specific 
event or the main laboratory abnormality will be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_462074]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_462075]. 
If circumstances prevent the patient from completing all scheduled evaluations, every attempt will 
be made to complete all procedures listed in Section 8.2.5. 
[ADDRESS_591670] 
 Study Medication Supply 
LSALT peptide and matching placebo will be sent to the sites per the randomization schemata. 
Drug receipt/administration logs and temperature logs will be maintained by [CONTACT_462142]. The unblinded Pharmacist/designate will ensure that the total 
number of vials in the drug dispatch log is present in the shipment from the Sponsor. The 
Pharmacist/designate will also ensure that there is no evidence of breakage of the drug vials. The 
Sponsor/designate must be notified immediately if any discrepancy is identified in the drug or 
temperature log or if any breakage occurs. 
 Description and Formulation of Study Product 
LSALT peptide will be supplied to the study site in aqueous solution at -20°C as a single 
concentration (1 mg/mL) in a glass vial with restricted access to the site Pharmacist or designate. 
The LSALT peptide vials will be labeled in English or the local language in the country of study 
and according to local regulations (Appendix 1). 
 Study Drug Dosage and Preparation 
LSALT peptide or an equivalent volume of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) will be diluted in 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution to a volume of [ADDRESS_591671] of the LSALT peptide inventory using the Drug Accountability Form. 
A coded label will be affixed to the patient eCRF to identify placebo and LSALT peptide-treated 
subjects. 
 Conditions for Storage and Use 
All study medication will be stored in the research pharmacy prior to dispensing, or in a locked 
freezer accessible only to the pharmacy team. Study drug (LSALT peptide and commercially-
available drug-free saline) should be stored frozen at -20°C (-4°F) in a temperature-monitored 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
42 
 freezer; a record of daily temperatures during the study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_462143]. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual on specifics of storage and other related information. 
 Study Drug Administration 
The dose will be one of the following for each patient:  
A. 100 mL of 5 mg IV LSALT peptide infusion over 2 hours once daily 
B. 100 mL drug-free IV saline infusion over 2 hours once daily.   
The frozen study drugs (LSALT peptide or saline) will be warmed to room temperature by [CONTACT_462144]. As 
warming time may vary, every effort should be made to allow ample time to the unblinded 
Pharmacist for the completion of the warming procedure. Post-preparation, the drug product and 
placebo will be stored for no longer than 4 hours at room temperature (68°F/20°C) or no longer 
than 24 hours when refrigerated (35°F/2°C) prior to administration to the patient to minimize the 
risk of excessive growth of adventitious microbial contamination. Times of post-preparation to 
infusion and storage temperatures will be documented in the pharmacy records and eCRF.  
Study drug will be administered once daily at a consistent time throughout the study. A missed 
dose of study medication can be administered up to 8 hours before the next scheduled dose; 
otherwise, the missed dose should not be administered to the patient and the deviation should be 
noted on the eCRF.  
 Patient Numbering 
Each patient will be assigned a unique 6-digit patient number by [CONTACT_5984]. The patient 
number will consist of a 3-digit clinical investigational site number assigned by [CONTACT_1034], 
followed by a 3-digit patient number ( e.g., 001) assigned by [CONTACT_5984]. 
The clinical site and/or pharmacy, if applicable, is responsible for maintaining a current log of 
patient number assignments and bottle numbers of the investigational product administered to each 
patient. The patient’s unique patient number is required to be entered on all clinical investigation 
documentation ( i.e., eCRFs, labeling of clinical materials and samples containers, drug 
accountability logs, etc.). 
 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The actual treatment given to individual patients 
is determined by a randomization schedule. A fixed block randomization schedule will be prepared 
to assign patients to 1 of 2 treatments: LSALT peptide 5 mg once daily or matching placebo in a 
1:[ADDRESS_591672]/delegate will keep 
accurate records of the quantities of the study drug dispensed/distributed, used, and returned by 
[CONTACT_462145]. 
The Sponsor or delegate will provide drug product accountability forms to assist the 
Pharmacist/delegate, when applicable, in maintaining current and accurate inventory records 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, [ADDRESS_591673] will verify the quantities received and return the acknowledgment to the Arch 
Biopartners Clinical Trial Material (CTM) Coordinator. The drug product will not be used without 
Arch Biopartners or designate approval in writing. The unblinded Pharmacist will record study 
drug accountability which includes the coded identification of the patient to whom the study drug 
is dispensed, the quantity and the date of dispensing, and any returned or unused study drug, as 
well as a full record of CTM storage temperatures. This record is in addition to any study drug 
accountability information recorded on the eCRF. These records will be readily available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_462146]/or Arch Biopartners audits and are open to regulatory 
authority inspection at any time. 
Noncompliance is defined as receiving less than 80% or more than 120% of study drug during the 
study period. Noncompliance should be discussed with the Project Manager, or delegate, and is to 
be noted both in the source documentation and in the eCRF.  
At the end of the study, all unused study drug will be destroyed on site according to site procedures. 
If the site does not have procedures in place for on-site destruction, the study drug will be returned 
to the Arch Biopartners CTM Coordinator or designate for destruction. 
Based on entries in the site electronic study drug accountability forms, it must be possible to 
reconcile study drug delivered with those used and returned. All study drug must be accounted for 
and all discrepancies investigated and documented appropriately. 
The unblinded Pharmacist is responsible for maintaining accountability for the receipt, dispensing, 
and return of all study medication to the clinic. 
 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Medications having the potential to interfere with the evaluation of efficacy or safety are excluded 
throughout the trial (review Sections 5.4.1 Inclusion criteria and 5.4.2 Exclusion criteria). Current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_462076]-19 
treatment guidelines ( e.g., WHO or US NIH, institutional guidelines) are permitted if not part of 
another investigational study. All concomitant medication usage needs to be documented in the 
eCRF.

 Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Blood samples for determination of LSALT peptide concentrations and related metabolites 
(degradation products) and cytokines will be obtained at Baseline prior to initiation of drug, and 
at the mid-point of the 2-hour drug infusion and immediately following the end of the 2-hour 
infusion on Days 1, 3, and EOT A single blood sample will be obtained at EOS for measurement 
of cytokines/biomarkers only. 
 Safety Assessment 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_462147]: 
 TEAEs 
 Clinical laboratory tests (Appendix 2) 
 Vital signs including pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], body 
weight  
 Physical examinations 
 12-lead ECG 
 Radiologic findings. 
Additional assessments may be conducted as considered appropriate. Clinical labs, vital signs, 
ECG measurements, and radiologic findings may be repeated if needed to corroborate or refute 
abnormal findings. Both the original and replicate assessments should be recorded in the eCRF. 
 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient participating in a clinical 
trial. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not considered related to the study 
medication. AEs will be collected from the initiation of treatment until 30 days following the final 
dose. Pre-existing known clinically significant conditions observed at screening should be 
recorded as medical history. 
This definition also includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or 
dose), reasons for re-admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or reasons for surgical procedures (unless for minor 
elective surgery for a pre-existing condition). It also includes adverse events commonly observed 
and adverse events anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the study medication. Any 
laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_462077]. 
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is also defined as any adverse event occurring after 
start of study medication and within the time of residual drug effect ([ADDRESS_591675] 
administration of the study medication), or a pre-treatment adverse event or pre-existing medical 
condition that worsens in intensity after start of study medication and within the time of residual 
drug effect. 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
46 
 Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate sign(s) and 
symptom(s) are recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record. 
Note that death is not an adverse event but the cause of death is. An exception is the adverse event 
of sudden death of unknown cause. Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226944]; however, the 
reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138]. Procedures are not adverse events; the reasons for conducting the 
procedures are. In general, only the reason for conducting the procedure will be captured as an 
adverse event. However, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978], a procedure can be captured along with 
the reason for conducting the procedure. 
An overdose or medication error is not an adverse event unless it is temporally associated with an 
unfavorable or unintended sign or symptom. 
While pregnancy in and of itself is not a SAE, for the purposes of this trial, should a pregnancy 
occur in a subject or subject’s partner, it should be reported on a Pregnancy Reporting form within 
24 hrs of being aware and be followed until an outcome is received. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_462078]-serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) is 
any untoward medical occurrence or effect that occurs at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening ( i.e., an immediate risk of death) 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event. 
An adverse event caused by [CONTACT_162835] a criterion 
listed in the definition above is fulfilled. 
Important adverse events that may not result in death, may not be life-threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient’s safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above. 
Serious adverse events also include any other event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_462079].

 [IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events 
Throughout the duration of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_462081]. All AEs 
(expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, whether observed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_462082], and whether or not thought to be drug-related, will be reported and followed until 
resolution or until they become stable. 
The description of the AE will include description of the event, start date, stop date, intensity, if it 
was serious, relationship to test drug, change in test drug dosage, if the patient died, and if 
treatment was required. Events will be recorded as one of the following severity/causality 
categories below (CTCAE v5.0): 
Severity Definition  
Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not

Category Definition  
Unrelated Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes and does not meet criteria listed 
under possible or probable.  
Unlikely Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. May have been 
produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_124888].  
Possible Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration but may have been also 
produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_124888].  
Probable Clear-cut temporal association with administration with improvement on cessation of 
investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational medic inal product.  
Definitely There is evidence of exposure to the test product, for example, reliable history or acceptable 
compliance assessment; the temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the drug is 
reasonable; the AE is most likely to be explained by [CONTACT_462148]; the challenge is positive; re-challenge (if feasible) is positive; the AE shows a pattern 
consistent with previous knowledge of the drug treatment.  
Adverse events with the causality assessed as possible, probable, and definitely are categorized as 
related to study medication and are called adverse drug reactions.

 are at the discretion of the Investigator. If the patient withdraws consent for further participation 
at the Unscheduled Visit, the eCRF forms for the Premature Withdrawal / Early Termination Visit, 
and the End of Study Form should be completed rather than the Unscheduled Visit form. 
 Appropriateness of Measurements 
Prevention of ARDS will reduce morbidity and mortality in infected patients, amongst others. 
 Data Quality Assurance 
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
PIs and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_462086], and periodic monitoring and site audits by [CONTACT_62049]. The data will be entered into the clinical trial database and verified for accuracy. 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED AND SAMPLE SIZE 
 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size (n=60) was determined based on medical judgement and a desire to assess safety 
in a limited number of patients, prior to further study and patient availability: 30 patients (active) 
and 30 patients (placebo). 
 Patient Populations 
 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The Full Analysis Set is defined as patients who received any amount of at least one dose of study 
medication, with assignment to treatment as randomized. 
 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The Per Protocol population is defined as patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were 
within the acceptable compliance range (≥80% and ≤120%), and completed the study with no 
major protocol violations.  The Per Protocol population will be finalized prior to breaking the blind 
for final reporting. 
 Safety Population 
The safety population is defined as all patients who received at least one dose (partial or complete) 
of the study medication, assigned to treatment according to the treatment actually received. 
 Statistical Methods 
In general, continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (the number of 
non‑missing values [n], mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). All 
categorical variables will be summarized with frequency counts and percentages, as applicable.   
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed which will describe all analyses to be 
performed. The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock and unblinding. 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
55 
 
 Demographic, Medical, and Disease History 
All baseline characteristics, demographics, and medical history (by [CONTACT_6764]) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_462149]. For continuous variables, n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be presented. For categorical 
variables, frequency counts and percentages will be presented. No formal statistical analysis 
methods will be employed. 
Summary and/or data listings of the prior, concomitant medications, in particular AEDs, and class 
of medication will be provided. 
 Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] 
(e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow oxygen (≥ 6 L/minute), 
or ECMO) and free of the need for continued renal replacement therapy (RRT) on Day 28. The 
need for continued RRT at Day [ADDRESS_591679] 3 days (Day 26, 27, 
or 28) or an eGFR on Day 28 <10 mL/min/1.73 m2.       
Analyses for the primary and the key secondary endpoints will be performed on the FAS and PP 
populations, with the analysis on the FAS as the primary analysis; all other efficacy endpoints will 
be analyzed on the FAS population only. 
Time to event variables will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared 
between treatment groups using either Log-rank tests or Cox’s Proportional Hazard model 
adjusting for baseline covariates, as necessary.  For continuous variables assessed at multiple time 
points a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach will be used or Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) if assessed at a single time point post-baseline.  For categorical endpoints 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) methods will be used, or a logistic regression approach, in the 
case of continuous covariates.  
Additional details regarding precise endpoint definitions (including transformations, as 
applicable), analysis model specifications and alpha-level control for primary and important 
secondary endpoints associated with multiplicity will be provided in the SAP, to be finalized prior 
to unblinding the study.  
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
All plasma concentration data will be summarized using N, mean, SD, % coefficient of variation, 
median, minimum, and maximum by [CONTACT_323923]. Attempts will be made to correlate 
LSALT peptide concentrations with cytokine levels. 
 Safety Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
All safety analyses will be conducted on all patients who are in the Safety Population. AEs will be 
coded to system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA version 20.0 or higher. All AEs 
occurring after the initiation of the study treatment (TEAEs) will be collected, including events 
present at baseline that worsened during the study. 
Protocol AB002  Arch Biopartners Inc. 
March 17, [ADDRESS_591680] to incidence of AEs (the number of patients reporting at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a specific 
AE), incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_162845], incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_462150], and incidence of AEs causing withdrawal and incidence of SAEs. Regarding severity 
and attribution summaries, the most extreme outcome (highest severity and closest to study drug 
related) will be used for those patients who experience the same AE on more than one occasion. 
Written narratives will be provided for all serious, unexpected, or other significant AEs that are 
judged to be of special interest because of their clinical importance. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical Laboratory examination will be performed prior to treatment and during treatment. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the observed values and change from baseline of each 
of the clinical laboratory results by [CONTACT_10659]. Shift tables describing abnormality shifts 
from baseline to after treatment and follow-up (Day 28) will be created. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs, ECG, and Chest X-rays 
Vital signs, 12-lead ECG parameters, and chest x-rays will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by [CONTACT_462151]. 
 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis apart from that provided to the DSMB for the purpose of ensuring safety of 
patients will be conducted.  
 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462087]. These meetings will include an assessment of differences in the number of subjects 
with an unfavorable outcome for the primary endpoint, as well as observed imbalances in severity 
or risk factors and the totality of data, including adverse event profiles not associated with an 
unfavorable primary endpoint value.  Consideration will also be given to the limited information 
available in the early stages of the study and a potential for unfavorable trends with very few 
subjects due to chance alone. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Indices 
 The observed adverse event profile of the patients on the treatment arm exceeding the incidence 
and/or severity of adverse events observed in the placebo arm to a significant degree at any 
time during the study. 
 Primary endpoint: there will be no more than a 1-subject difference in the number of subjects 
with an unfavorable outcome for the primary endpoint after the first 6 subjects completed 
active treatment compared with placebo (in favor of placebo). Subsequently, for the total 
number of [ADDRESS_591681] difference in the primary endpoint 
(in favor of placebo) and no more than a 3-subject difference for the remaining subjects.  
Otherwise, the DSMB will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462088].

March 17, [ADDRESS_591682] relative reduction in the incidence rate of only 20 percent ( i.e., a rate of 22.4% for LSALT 
from an assumed incidence rate of 28% for placebo), with probabilities in the range of 6% or less 
for these unfavorable outcomes at the end of each cohort, under this assumption. 
 Missing Data  
Although significant missing data with respect to the primary endpoint is not anticipated for a 
study of this duration (due to the nature of the endpoint), methods for handling missing data and 
intercurrent events, including for secondary endpoints will be specified in the SAP.  These methods 
will be consistent with missing data due to death as having a worst possible outcome.    
10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 Source Data and Records 
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by [CONTACT_462152], which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The

Primary 
Endpoints: 
 Effectiveness: 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom  from any documented AF, atrial 
flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting >30 seconds in duration through the 12-month 
follow-up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs (with the exception of previously 
failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed).   
 Any arrhythmia that occurs within the blanking period or the AAD Optimization period will not be considered a failure. The rhythm status used for evaluation of this endpoint will be derived from regularly scheduled monitoring (i.e., Holter, Zio
TM-
Patch, or 30 second ECG) as well as any symptom driven monitoring that is performed.  The following scenarios shall constitute a failure of the primary effectiveness endpoint: 
1. Any documented AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting >30 seconds 
duration that occurs at any time beginning at the 6-month visit and through the 12-month visit.  
2. Any previously failed class I or III AAD administered at a dose higher than 
baseline and between the 6-month visit and the 12-month visit.  
3.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The objective of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of a Dual Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911076] (DEEP)  for patients presenting with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation 
or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation utilizing the AtriCure Bipolar System and AtriCure 
Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Clip in an endoscopic or open ablation procedure, followed by [CONTACT_911231][INVESTIGATOR_911044],  irrigated, power controlled ablation catheters for endocardial lesions.  The endocardial procedure will be staged to occur after [ADDRESS_1279864] epi[INVESTIGATOR_911058].  
The data collected in this clinical study will be  used to support a PMA submission to the FDA for 
the AtriCure Bipolar System. 
 Background on Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, particularly in the elderly, and is an important risk factor for stroke.  AF accounts for 34% 
of arrhythmias as the principal diagnosis.
2 The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) defines atrial 
fibrillation as a supraventricular arrhythmia that is characterized by [CONTACT_911232].  It is understood by [CONTACT_911233], that AF consists of atrial “triggers” that induce AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_911077].  AF leads to thromboembolism and stroke in appr oximately 5-10% of high-risk patients and the risk increases with 
age
2.  Because there are no effective atrial contract ions during AF, blood stasis occurs in the atria 
(particularly in the appendages) and thrombi sometimes form.  The American Heart Association estimates that in the [LOCATION_002], AF is responsible for over 70,[ADDRESS_1279865] benign state but can progress to be intractable.  In an effort to bring uniformity to the various degrees that AF can present, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2012 AF expert consensus statement has recommended the following AF classification scheme based upon the patterns of duration and mode of termination:  
Paroxysmal :  R e c u r r e n t  A F  ( ≥2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) that terminates spontaneously within seven 
days.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_179153] < 48 hours duration that are terminated with electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion should also be classified as paroxysmal AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Persistent :  Continuous AF, which is sustained beyond seven days, or lasting greater than 
48 hours and less than seven days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. 
Longstanding Persistent :  Continuous AF of greater than 12 months’ duration.  
Permanent:   Patients with AF in whom a decision has been made not to pursue restoration 
of sinus rhythm by [CONTACT_61076].1 
 
This classification system has been recognized by [CONTACT_911234].

Rev: H   
 
Atrial Fibrillation Treatment 
Atrial Fibrillation is treated either by [CONTACT_14181]-arrhyt hmic drugs (AADs) or by [CONTACT_911235], 
which includes catheter ablation and/or surgical ablation.  Traditionally, patients who present with symptomatic early onset AF are first prescr ibed AADs.  Patients who are symptomatic and 
refractory to AADs become potential candidates for interventional procedures.  The [ADDRESS_1279867] received up to two (2) failed catheter ablations for the treatment of AF.  
Catheter ablation techniques are designed to isolate or ablate the atrial triggers that induce AF 
and modify the abnormal atrial substrate that sustains AF when indicated.  Since the majority of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is induced by [CONTACT_911236], catheter ablation is used 
most commonly to isolate the pulmonary veins in patients with PAF.  In the persistent forms of AF, it is essential to add other measures, such as linear lesions to modify the substrate 
responsible for sustaining AF.  While multiple catheter ablations have proven to be successful for 
PAF, catheter ablation has enjoyed substantially less success when used for the persistent forms (non-paroxysmal) AF.
5, 6, [ADDRESS_1279868]. James Cox in the 1980’s has excellent long-term results but remains too invasive to be widely applied in all patients with AF, 
especially as a stand-alone procedure.  It was based on intraoperative mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911078] (>5cm diameter) macro-reentrant circuits in all patients during all epi[INVESTIGATOR_298261].  These large macro-reentrant circuits were unstable and often remained in one area for only [ADDRESS_1279869] the resultant sinus impulse activate the entire myocardium of both atria except for the isolated pulmonary veins.  The success rates of the Cox-Maze III procedure were 98% at 5 years
8, 98% at 8.5 years9, and 94% at 15 
years.10 
 
The introduction of the AtriCure Bipolar System has led to the development of the Cox-Maze IV 
procedure, so-called because it is performed with an ablation device rather than by [CONTACT_941] “cut-and-sew” technique of the Cox-Maze III.  The ultimate goal is to perform a minimally invasive endoscopic lesion set compatible with the Cox-Maze III pattern on the beating heart, without the need for cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_911237].  The lesions include 
pulmonary vein isolation in pairs with the AtriCure Bipolar System plus roof and floor linear 
ablation lines that convert the pulmonary vein isolation lesions into a “box” lesion of all 4 veins and the intervening posterior left atrial wall as was done in the Cox-Maze III procedure.  A “mitral line” extending from the “box lesion” down to the mitral valve annulus may be added by [CONTACT_911238].  The cavo-tricuspid isthmus lesion will be added during the follow-up Endocardial EP 
Ablation Procedure. 
 The Cox-Maze IV has been performed in an open chest setting on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_911239]: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279870]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
success rates as high as 95%.11  However, the associated complications of being on by[CONTACT_911240].  With the development of endoscopic ablation instruments and the use videoscopic 
assisted techniques (VAT), the cardiac surgeon has the option to perform a limited maze 
procedure off by[CONTACT_6476].  Such minimally invasive  thoracoscopic ablation limited maze procedures 
have produced a wide range of results (35% to 90%) depending upon the lesion set and the definition of success.
12 
 Catheter ablation has been utilized to treat indivi duals with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent 
AF, however with less promising outcomes than surgery.  Although frequently used to isolate triggers such as the PVs in order to treat paroxysmal AF, catheter ablation for Persistent or Longstanding Persistent AF has been less effective due to the limitations of the current catheter technology to perform reliable transmural linear lesions.
13  The results for a recent catheter 
ablation registry of more than 20,000 procedures reports success rates for the treatment of 
persistent forms of AF of less than 60%.14  Furthermore, Kuch recently published his 5-year results 
with single and multiple catheter ablations for the persistent forms of AF and found that the 
success rate at 5 years for single catheter ablation was 20% and for multiple catheter ablations was 45%.
7 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911079]’s Bipolar System is highly effective at creating reliable transmural ablation lines, the success rates for minimally invasive endoscopic ablation are challenged by [CONTACT_26423]-optimal mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911080]-Maze IV procedure.  A minimally invasive endoscopic ablation procedure combined with conventional catheter mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911081]-Maze IV procedure through 
a minimally invasive off pump approach. 
 Consequently, the proposed staged epi[INVESTIGATOR_911082].  Working together, the cardiac surgeon and 
electrophysiologist can combine their techniques and technologies to offer Persistent and 
Longstanding Persistent AF patients a true minimally invasive Cox-Maze IV option.  During this epi[INVESTIGATOR_911083], the endocardial catheter component of the procedure is introduced for mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911084].  The endocardial catheter can also be used for ablation to optimize a surgical lesion that may not have achieved conduction block and also to perform the cavo-tricuspid and mitral 
isthmus lesions which are key components of the Cox-Maze IV lesion set.  This procedure is 
currently being performed by [CONTACT_911241] a group of patients with less effective treatment alternatives.  
Feasibility Clinical Investigations Conducted by [CONTACT_911242]. These studies are described below: 
 
CP2009-1: DEEP Hybrid Feasibility Study 
This was AtriCure’s initial feasibility IDE clinical study that examined the safety and effectiveness of a combined hybrid approach for the treatment of Persistent or Longstanding Persistent atrial 
fibrillation.  A total of [ADDRESS_1279871].  This procedure was performed 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279872]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
in the same procedure room. 
 
A decision was made by [CONTACT_911243] a second feasibility study that have a staged approach as described below.  Subjects enrolled in this study were followed for 2 years. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absence of atrial fibrillation (AF) at the 12-month follow-up based on a 14-day auto trigger event 
monitor, i.e., no epi[INVESTIGATOR_298261], atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting > [ADDRESS_1279873] 4 weeks (except amiodarone which 
must be 12 weeks), prior to assessment.  The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 68.4% 
(95% CI 43.4, 87.4) of the 19 subjects with Holter data available.  No epi[INVESTIGATOR_911085] 19 subjects at 12-month follow-up.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint was not met in 6 subjects due to atrial tachycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; in [ADDRESS_1279874] AF, either on Holter or based on permanent pacemaker interrogation.    
Although the sample size was small for a meaningful interpretation and the analysis was intended 
to be exploratory, the rate of freedom from AF (68.4%) at 12 months is consistent within the range given in the literature for this patient population.  CP2012-1: Staged DEEP Feasibility Study 
AtriCure developed a second feasibility clinical study that was based on the earlier DEEP hybrid 
study.  A staged approach was developed by [CONTACT_911244][INVESTIGATOR_911086] 1-[ADDRESS_1279875] logistical advantages over a combined, single-session 
hybrid procedure. 
 A total of 30 subjects were enrolled in the feasibility study, with 25 subjects treated with the surgical index procedure and 24 received the endocardial ablation procedure.  The Thirty (30) Day Safety Data and annual report has been submitted to the FDA.  Subjects are in follow-up and primary endpoint effectiveness data has not be evaluated as subjects are currently returning for 
12-month follow up evaluations to assess freedom of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting 
> 30 continuous seconds.  Based on the feasibility study results, AtriCure believes that a multi-center, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_265005] a staged epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542]/endocardial approach is warranted. 
 
Devices Used to Perform Epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542]/Endocardial Ablation The AtriCure Bipolar System is intended to form the basis of the Cox-Maze IV lesion set with the aid of catheter-based techniques and technologies.  The catheter technologies are utilized for comprehensive mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911087], lesion gap closure (as needed), and the creation of cavo-tricuspid isthmus lesions provided via electro-anatomic 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911088]-based ablation.  The creation of the mitral isthmus lesion will be conducted 
if the subject presents in mitral isthmus dependent flutter at the time of the Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure.

3.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS 
3.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom from any  documented AF, atrial flutter, or atrial 
tachycardia lasting >30 seconds duration through the 12-month follow-up visit in the absence of 
Class I or III AADs (with the exception of previously failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed).  Any arrhythmia that occurs within the blanking period or during the “AAD Optimization Period” 
visit will not be considered a failure (Visit 5 up to Visit 10).  The rhythm status used for evaluation 
of this endpoint shall be derived from regularly scheduled monitoring (i.e., Holter, Zio™ Patch, or 30 second ECG), as well as any symptom driven monitoring that is performed.   The following scenarios shall constitute a failure of the primary effectiveness endpoint: 
1. Any documented AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting >30 seconds duration) that 
occurs at any time beginning at the 6-month visit and through the 12-month visit.  
2. Any previously failed class I or III AAD administered at a dose higher than baseline and 
between the 6-month visit and the 12-month visit. 
3. Any newly introduced class I or III AAD usage beginning at the 6-month visit through the 
12-month visit.   
4. DC cardioversion for AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia that takes place at any time 
beginning at the 6-month visit through the 12-month visit.  
5. Catheter ablation or surgical treatment for AF, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia that takes 
place at any time beginning at the 3-month visit and ending at the 12-month visit. 
6. Two or more repeat catheter ablations within the 2
nd blanking period 
7. The use of a non-study device for creation of any lesions during the surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_911089], atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW) will not be considered procedure failures. 
 
For this study, AtriCure defines failure of an antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) to include ineffectiveness or intolerance of the AAD.

3.[ADDRESS_1279889] a "blanking period" following any intervention for cardiac arrhythmias.  
During the blanking period, neither a recurrence of the pre-interventional arrhythmia that was treated nor a new arrhythmia resulting from the in tervention itself is considered to represent a 
"failure" of the interventional procedure.  The traditional blanking period for the interventional treatment of atrial fibrillation has been [ADDRESS_1279890] for approximately 90 days following the specific intervention: 
 To allow the surgical lesions and later the catheter ablation lesions to fully heal; and 
 To allow the electrophysiological characteristics of the atrium, such as local refractory 
periods, conduction velocity, etc., to return to their pre-intervention baselines.  Even in patients who have a cut-and-sew Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation, in which "healing" of the lesions is not an issue, the blanking period is still [ADDRESS_1279891] blanking period is from the time of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911093] 
(which is approximately 90 days).  The 2nd blanking period is [ADDRESS_1279892] Endocardial EP 
Ablation Procedure.  During these intervals, the effectiveness of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542]/Endocardial Ablation Procedure is not evaluated for arrhythmia recurrence and re-intervention to address atrial dysrhythmia may be performed.

5.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911063] 
5.1.1 General Description 
Note: A recommended surgical technique is presented below. It is recognized that individual 
patient anatomic variation, surgical conditions, or surgeon preference may necessitate 
modifications to the outlined procedures.  Regardless, surgeons must adhere to all AtriCure 
devices instructions for use (IFU).  The Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911103], 
adequate blood products, external and internal defibrillator pad/paddles, proper anesthesia 
administration, and monitoring capabilities.  The goal of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911104] a set of lesions that are based upon the standard Cox-Maze IV lesion set without requiring the surgeon to perform either 
the left atrial “mitral line” or the right atrial “flutter line” (CTI), both of which are difficult or impossible 
to perform from outside the heart.  Ganglionated Plexi (GP) shall also be tested and ablated as 
appropriate. 
It is recommended that the left atrial appendage be excluded in all subjects if the anatomy will accommodate the procedure with the AtriClip PRO.  
 
Measures to Identify and Protect the Esophagus and Phrenic Nerve Structures during the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911105]-Esophageal Fistula (AEF) occurrences, please use the following techniques whenever the MLP1 or MCR1 are used to ablate: 
 Determine the location of the esophagus utilizing thoracoscopic visualization and the TEE 
probe. 
 Prior to energy delivery, the Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe should be 
retracted from the area of ablation as a measure to protect the esophagus and other surrounding tissue structures. 
 Ablation : Ablations should be visualized, and atrial tissue should be elevated up and away 
from the posterior pericardium with the ablation device(s) in order to avoid collateral injury 
to surrounding tissue. 
 Post Ablation: Prior to repositioning the device and prior to resting the atrium onto the 
posterior pericardium, the device should remain in place for 30 seconds while simultaneously quenching the device, the ablated tissue, and the surrounding tissues with saline. This will allow these areas to adequately cool. 
 In addition, it is required that an acid reducing agent be prescribed 7-days prior to the 
procedure and continued for a minimum of 30-days post procedure.  [Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended, however; if the patient cannot tolerate PPIs, an H2 receptor antagonist or other acid reducing agent can be prescribed.] 
 Esophageal temperature monitoring will not be used during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911054].     
 
To decrease the risk of phrenic nerve injury, please use surgical techniques to identify and retract the phrenic nerve (see Section 5.1.5).

The subject is prepped and draped so the surgeon has access to the entire lateral thorax 
bilaterally, the sternum, and both groin areas in case they should be needed for urgent access. 
 Non-sterile external defibrillator pads are placed behind the right shoulder and on the left 
flank, away from port sites.  Alternatively, if sterile external defibrillator pads are available, 
one can be placed over the sternum and one directly posterior on the back of the subject. 
General anesthesia is induced, and the subject is intubated using a dual-lumen endotracheal 
tube, in order to allow unilateral (single-lung) ventilation. If the placement of the dual-lumen 
endotracheal tube (single lung isolation) is not achieved, the subject shall not have the 
study procedure performed.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) must be performed prior to any epi[INVESTIGATOR_911112]. The purpose of TEE is to assess for presence of thrombus .  If a thrombus is 
present in the left atrium on TEE, the subject shall not have the study procedure performed.  
 If the subject continues to meet all study eligibility criteria, the following steps are performed:  Note: The transesophageal echocardiography probe should be retracted from the area of ablation prior to energy delivery as a measure to protect the esophagus and other surrounding tissue/structures. 
5.1.5 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911064] - Detailed Technique AtriCure Device Energy Delivery Parameters 
The following AtriCure devices may be used for this surgical ablation procedure and are described 
below in Section 6.0: 
a. EMR2/EML2 Clamp 
b. Isolator Long Pen TT (MAX5) 
c. Coolrail Linear Pen (MCR1)

EMR2/EML2 Clamp When using the AtriCure devices for ablation, the time necessary to create a transmural lesion 
depends on tissue thickness, composition, and the length of tissue captured between the 
electrodes.  The following table describes the average expected time (seconds) and energy delivery (joules) for respective tissue thickness.  Values are expressed per unit volume of tissue

Right Side Endoscopic Port Placement 
This phase of the operation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_911116].  Starting on the subject’s right side, a 5mm or 10mm diameter port is introduced in the mid-axillary line in the area of the third or fourth intercostal space.  Endoscopic visualization is helpful in safely inserting this initial port.  CO2 insufflation is performed to expand the field and depress the diaphragm.  A 0- or 30-degree scope is recommended to obtain good visualization throughout the thorax, once absorptive atelectasis of the lung has taken place. 
 
The other ports (5mm or 10mm diameter) are placed on the subject’s right side.  One port is placed in the mid-clavicular line in approximately the second intercostal space, and the other port in the mid-axillary line in approximately the 6
th or 7th intercostal space.  Each of these ports are 
placed so that instruments passed through them can access the transverse sinus, behind the superior vena cava and immediately cephalad to the right atrial appendage as well as the oblique sinus.  At the discretion of the surgeon, a fourth port may be placed to aid exposure or retraction. 
 Right-Side Pericardium & Associated Great Vessel Exposure  
Working through these port sites, the right pericardium is opened from the diaphragm to the level 
of the aorta, approximately [ADDRESS_1279916] wall (ensure that these retraction sutures do not stretch the phrenic nerve).
 
 
Access to the floor of the left atrium is now obt ained to create the exposure necessary to construct 
the inferior connecting lesion that will join the two pulmonary vein isolations along the floor  of the 
left atrium.  The oblique sinus is opened by [CONTACT_911256] a wide opening to the posterior left atrium.
 
 Determine the location of esophagus visualizing endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_911117]. 
 
Access to the dome of the left atrium is now obtained to create the exposure necessary to construct the superior connecting lesion that will join the two pulmonary vein isolations along the 
roof of the left atrium.  Attention is now directed to the space between SVC and its attachments 
to the right superior pulmonary vein, and the right pulmonary artery.  This space is made up of thin connective tissue and is opened by [CONTACT_911257].  Using blunt dissection, this  tissue is now teased away from the posterior 
SVC until the transverse sinus is entered.  With the superior vena cava now mobilized and elevated, one should be able to advance the scope into the transverse sinus and under the ascending aorta to visualize the dome of the left atrium and typi[INVESTIGATOR_911118] (LAA) with the video scope.
 
 
After dissection of the area between the great vessels (the right superior pulmonary vein, the 
pulmonary artery and the superior vena cava) the Wolf Lumitip dissector and Glidepath are introduced in the most caudad port through the oblique sinus superiorly towards the area between 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279917]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
the pulmonary artery and the right superior pulmonary vein. (Note: The clear plastic Glidepath 
tape is merely a leader, the other end of which attached to the inferior jaw of the bipolar 
radiofrequency ablation clamp). 
 
Once the light from the lighted dissector has been identified shining through the tissue, blunt 
dissection can be then used to help deliver the tip of the dissector through the pericardial 
reflections.  Sharp dissection or use of the Bovie to deliver the tip should be avoided. 
 
Once the tip of the lighted dissector has been de livered, the Glidepath clear plastic sheath placed 
over the lighted dissector is now controlled with a grasper and withdrawn from the chest wall, and the lighted dissector angle is reduced while the lighted dissector is removed.  This will bring the red rubber portion of the glide path into position and the tip is now connected to the end of the 
Synergy clamp.  A purse string suture can be helpful at the skin insertion site for the bipolar clamp 
to maintain the pneumothorax. 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911119]5 to determine entrance conduction by [CONTACT_911258], (alternatively, exit conduction via pacing if the subject is in normal sinus rhythm) on the right superior vein, the right inferior vein, and the crux between the superior and inferior veins.  This testing routine will be repeated after the ablations have been completed.
 
 
Right-Side Ganglionated Plexi-Detection & Ablation  
The MAX 5 is utilized to deliver high frequency stimulation to locate the presence of active 
ganglionated plexi (GP).  These are located by [CONTACT_911259] a bradycardic response (greater than 50% increase in R-to-R interval that occurs when one stimulates directly over a ganglionated plexi).  The MAX5 is then used to ablate the GPs as outlined by [CONTACT_911260]. al
15 (utilizing the GP 
ablation map).  GPs should be retested to confirm denervation is successful.  Note: At the surgeon’s discretion, the surgeon may wait to perform the ganglionated plexus ablation after the right pulmonary vein antrum is isolated.  
Right Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation  
The closed AtriCure bipolar clamp (EMR2) is then introduced through the most-caudad port site, 
by [CONTACT_911261].  By [CONTACT_911262], the inferior jaw of the clamp is then delivered behind the right-sided pulmonary veins.  It is manipulated until the jaws are over the antrum of the left atrium and away from the pulmonary veins.  Four (4) to eight (8) energy deliveries using the clamp are typi[INVESTIGATOR_911120]. 
 
Pulmonary vein isolation/block will be defined as  pulmonary veins showing epi[INVESTIGATOR_911121]/or exit block.  To assess pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), place the MAX5 or MLP1 on the pulmonary vein ensuring complete contact [CONTACT_911263].  Check entrance block via sensing with the “Pen”.  If the subject is in sinus rhythm, initiate pacing to check for exit block.  Repeat  the ablation procedure with the bipolar clamp as 
necessary to achieve block. 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279918]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 
Note: Perform the ganglionated plexus ablation at this time, if not previously performed.  
 Roof and Floor Lines  
At this point, an MAX5 or MLP1 may be passed through the most cephalad port site and used to 
obtain a baseline electrogram at a point that will fall within the “box” created on the posterior wall of the left atrium.  This baseline electrogram shoul d show transmitted electrical activity from the 
atrium. 
 
Note:  The TEE probe should be withdrawn as a precaution against damage to the esophagus.  
 MCR1 and MLP1 Device Usage Next, the MCR1 and/or the MLP1 is now introduced through a caudal port side and directed under the SVC and into the transverse sinus so that the electrodes are well positioned over the dome of the left atrium.  Great care needs to be made to visualize the phrenic nerve and it is helpful to have the superior pericardial traction sutures placed on tension to make sure that the phrenic nerve is pulled well away from the electrodes.
 
 
A linear ablation is performed from the right superior pulmonary vein isolation line (PVI) across the roof of the left atrium directed towards the left superior pulmonary vein (“Roof Lesion”).  In most cases when looking through the transverse sinus, the left superior pulmonary vein and left atrial appendage can be visualized.  Next, a lesion is placed from the right inferior pulmonary vein isolation line (PVI) toward the left inferior pulmonary vein (“Floor Lesion”).  Care should be made to ensure this lesion to intersect the right PVI line.  Also, care and visualization should be utilized in making sure that this lesion is directed toward the left inferior pulmonary vein and not to the ventricle. 
 To decrease the risk of Atrio-Esophageal Fistula (AEF) occurrences, please use the following techniques whenever the MLP1 or MCR1 are used to ablate: 
 Determine the location of the esophagus utilizing thoracoscopic visualization and the TEE 
probe. 
 Prior to energy delivery, the Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe should be 
retracted from the area of ablation as a measure to protect the esophagus and other 
surrounding tissue structures. 
 Ablation : Ablations should be visualized, and atrial tissue should be elevated up and away 
from the posterior pericardium with the ablation device(s) in order to avoid collateral injury 
to surrounding tissue. 
 Post Ablation: Prior to repositioning the device and prior to resting the atrium onto the 
posterior pericardium, the device should remain in place for 30 seconds while simultaneously quenching the device, the ablated tissue, and the surrounding tissues with saline. This will allow these areas to adequately cool. 
 In addition, it is required that an acid reducing agent be prescribed 7-days prior to the 
procedure and continued for a minimum of 30-days post procedure.  [Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended, however; if the patient cannot tolerate PPIs, an H2

receptor antagonist or other acid reducing agent can be prescribed.] 
 Esophageal temperature monitoring will not be used during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911054].      
 
Completion of Right Sided Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911122].  At this time, the surgeon will add small radiographic clip markers at the intersection of the right superior pulmonary vein isolation and the roof lesion as well as the right inferior pulmonary vein isolation and the floor lesion to assist the EP with the location of the box lesions.  The pericardium on the right side, must be closed.  A chest tube is placed, the lung inflated and visualized.  The ports are then withdrawn.  The subject should be ventilating both lungs effectively. 
 
Left Side Endoscopic Port Placement, Pericardial Access & Phrenic Nerve Protection  
Next the subject’s left side is approached, similar to the right side, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_911123].  Working through these ports, the left lung is deflated, and the pericardium is visualized.  The phrenic nerve is visualized, and the pericardium is now gently grasped and opened typi[INVESTIGATOR_911124].  As on the right side the opening of the pericardium and the extension of the opening need to be done with great care to not injure the phrenic nerve.  The pericardiotomy is now extended both superiorly and inferiorly. By [CONTACT_911264], one can extend the pericardiotomy more posteriorly than on the right facilitating the exposure of the inferior LA.  Superiorly, the pericardium is opened to above the left superior pulmonary vein to provide exposure to the dome of the left atrium and the left atrial appendage.  
 
When extending the incision cephalad, care must also be taken not to injure the recurrent 
laryngeal nerve as it courses beneath the aorta. 
 
Traction sutures are frequently not necessary on the left side, but if needed they can be placed 
to optimize exposure if indicated.  Again, these sutures need to be placed with great care to not injure the phrenic nerve.  Electrical Assessment of Left Pulmonary Veins, Ganglionated Plexi & Ligament of Marshall Division 
Using the video scope, one should be able to visualize the right sided roof lesion through the transverse sinus.  The MAX5 is placed and baseline electrograms from the pulmonary veins are recorded.  High frequency stimulation is then per formed to locate any active ganglionated plexi 
and their positions are noted and ablated as described below.  Following this, the Ligament of Marshall may be divided.  The MID1 and Glidepath tape is introduced and directed around the left pulmonary veins with the illuminated tip surfacing just medial to the point of the divided Ligament of Marshall.  The Glidepath tape is then withdrawn as a pulley around the pulmonary veins. 
 
Left Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation & Ganglionated Plexi Ablation  
The EML2 is attached to the Glidepath tape and then introduced through the most caudad port 
site.  Using the Glidepath tape, the inferior clamp jaw is introduced behind the pulmonary veins.  Care must be taken to always visualize the top jaw of the clamp during placement.  After advancement of the clamp, the entire pulmonary vein antrum is included into the jaws.  The clamp 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279920]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
is closed on the pulmonary vein antrum with four (4) to eight (8) energy applications are delivered, 
changing the position of the clamp each time.  The clamp is withdrawn and the MAX5 and MLP1 is again introduced.  Sensing in the pulmonary vein s should now show electrical silence indicating 
entrance block so that no atrial electrical activity is transmitted into the veins.  Alternatively, if the subject is in sinus rhythm, one can pace in the pulmonary veins and look for exit block. 
 
Note:  Pulmonary vein isolation/block will be defined as pulmonary veins showing entrance and/or 
exit block. 
 
Left Sided Ganglionated Plexi Ablation  
Additionally, the MAX5 and/or MLP1 is used to stimulate the areas where active Ganglionated 
Plexi were previously located.  If these sites have not been ablated by [CONTACT_911265], they may now be ablated by [CONTACT_911266].  Completion of Roof & Floor Lesions to Connect Right and Left Pulmonary Vein Isolation 
Lesions, Connecting Line from LSPV to LAA 
The clamp is withdrawn and the MLP1 and/or MCR1 is introduced through a caudad port site.  The left atrial appendage and the pulmonary artery are retracted for better visualization into the transverse sinus.  One should readily see the Roof lesion line created from the right side as it is directed towards the left superior pulmonary vein.  The MCR1 and/or the MLP1 is now used to complete the roof lesion so that it connects the right superior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line over to the left superior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line.  Likewise, the Floor lesion coming from the right inferior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line is now fully extended to the left inferior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line, thus boxing out the posterior wall. 
 To decrease the risk of Atrio-Esophageal Fistula (AEF) occurrences, please use the following techniques whenever the MLP1 or MCR1 are used to ablate: 
 Determine the location of the esophagus utilizing thoracoscopic visualization and the TEE 
probe. 
 Prior to energy delivery, the Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe should be 
retracted from the area of ablation as a measure to protect the esophagus and other 
surrounding tissue structures. 
 Ablation : Ablations should be visualized, and atrial tissue should be elevated up and away 
from the posterior pericardium with the ablation device(s) in order to avoid collateral injury 
to surrounding tissue. 
 Post Ablation: Prior to repositioning the device and prior to resting the atrium onto the 
posterior pericardium, the device should remain in place for 30 seconds while simultaneously quenching the device, the ablated tissue, and the surrounding tissues with saline. This will allow these areas to adequately cool. 
 In addition, it is required that an acid reducing agent be prescribed 7-days prior to the 
procedure and continued for a minimum of 30-days post procedure.  [Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended, however; if the patient cannot tolerate PPIs, an H2 receptor antagonist or other acid reducing agent can be prescribed.] 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279921]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 Esophageal temperature monitoring will not be used during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911054]. 
 
The left atrial posterior wall isolation should be assessed via sensing and/or pacing maneuvers.  To do so, place the MAX5 or MLP1 and assess fo r entrance and/or exit conduction block.  To 
demonstrate block, there should be no atrial electrical activity inside the left atrial posterior box or unable to pace and capture outside the box.  The MAX5 is advanced and directed toward the center of the box in order to confirm absence of atrial electrical activity.  This indicates “entrance block.”  In normal sinus rhythm, the MAX5 should be used to pace the heart from within the posterior box.  (With the pacing device set at [ADDRESS_1279922]’s intrinsic rate.)  The output of the pacing device should be increased to maximal output of 20 milliamperes (mA).  If pacing is unable to capture this should confirm “exit block.”  If the box is not complete, at this time additional lesions may be necessary. 
 
Note – it is only possible to demonstrate bi-directional (i.e., entrance and exit) block in a subject in sinus or other paceable rhythm.  If the subject is in atrial fibrillation, pacing is not possible and only entrance block will be used to demonstrate conduction block.  Lastly, using the MAX5 and/or MLP1 and/or the MCR1, a connecting lesion is made from the LSPV to the base of the LAA.  At this time, the surgeon will add small radiographic clip markers at the intersection of the left superior pulmonary vein isolation and the roof lesi on as well as the left inferior pulmonary vein 
isolation and the floor lesion to assist the EP with the location of the box lesions. 
5.1.6 Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Exclusion 
The left atrial appendage should be managed using the AtriClip PRO (PRO1 or PRO2) device.  
Only if the surgeon deems that the AtriClip Pro device is not able to be utilized for Left Atrial Appendage exclusion because of anatomical limitations, the surgeon may utilize a stapling device in accordance with surgical standard of care (SOC).  If the surgeon determines it is not feasible or safe to address the LAA, the appendage may be left intact. 
 General Placement of the AtriClip PRO: The PRO1 is introduced into the chest through the incision (the PRO2 fits through a trocar) at the 
[ADDRESS_1279923] the base of the Left Atrial Appendage.  Using soft 
endoscopic forceps or a Kitner in the surgeon’s right hand, the open AtriClip device is passed 
over the tip of the left atrial appendage.  The tip of the appendage is gently teased into the AtriClip.  The device is then lowered into the base of the appendage.  The skillful manipulation of the endoscope will allow the surgeon to see all angles and visualization surrounding structures and 
assess whether the appendage is fully contained within the AtriClip.  Awareness of the proximity 
of the circumflex artery and its relationship to the targeted location at the base of the left atrial appendage is critical. Using the transesophageal echo (TEE) to help guide placement, the AtriClip is applied on the left atrial appendage ensuring the alignment and complete closure of the LAA.  Refer to the IFU for proper AtriClip size selection.  
AtriClip Deployment at Base of LAA  
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279924]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
When the surgeon is satisfied with the AtriClip position, the surgeon releases the activation lever 
on the device, allowing the AtriClip to close upon the appendage.  At this point, it is important to 
identify the subject’s QRS electrograms to ensure that there are no QRS changes, and no 
coronary vessels have been occluded.  Transesophageal echo (TEE) is examined to ensure that the entire appendage is included within the AtriClip and there is no blood flow to the appendage.  A TEE with Doppler will be performed to verify exclusion of the LAA and assess for any residual pouch and also evaluate the base of the LAA along the entire length and depth of the excluded appendage.  If not completely excluded, the AtriClip is re-opened and re-deployed. When the 
AtriClip is satisfactorily positioned around the ba se of the appendage, the deployment tab is pulled 
on the applier to fully deploy the AtriClip to the base of the left atrial appendage. 
 Once deployed, carefully squeeze the activation lever to retract the pull bar against the loop.  Providing counter pressure on the AtriClip per the surgeon’s discretion, carefully remove the 
applier deployment loop from the LAA, leaving the AtriClip undisturbed.  Gently remove the 
AtriClip applier device from the thoracic cavity.  After placing the AtriClip LAA Exclusion Device on the Left Atrial Appendage and removing the deployment tool, the surgeon will place the Isolator Pen (MAX5) near the Apex of the LAA.   The 
ASU/ASB dial will be set to PSS on the O.R. lab and the Pen will sense for atrial electrograms. The surgeon will then ask the O.R. lab operator to initiate pacing while the pen is in contact [CONTACT_911267].  Pacing should be performed at 20 BPM above the intrinsic rate.  Electrical isolation of the LAA from the Left Atrium is confirmed if there are no atrial electrograms present during sensing from the LAA or there is no capture during pacing, i.e., the heart rate stays constant and does not equal the pacing rate.    
 Surgical Stapler Method The surgeon should introduce a stapling device and carefully position it around the base of the LAA.  Using the transesophageal echo (TEE) to help guide placement, the stapler is closed on the base of the atrial appendage and it is amputated.  The amputated LAA is withdrawn from the 
stapler.  A TEE should be performed to evaluate the base of the LAA along the entire length and 
depth of the excluded appendage. If it is determined that exclusion is not complete (i.e., there is blood flow between the LAA and the LA at any point), additional thoracoscopic methods such as sutures or clips may be used to exclude the LAA completely.  Closure & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911125]-approximated with a single suture using a laparoscopic suturing 
device such as the commercially available Endo Stitch™ device.  If closure of the pericardium seems to be putting any tension on the deployed AtriClip, this step is not performed.  A chest tube is placed, the lung inflated and visualized.  The ports are then withdrawn.  The subject should be ventilating both lungs effectively.  Sterile dressings are applied. 
 
Restoration of Sinus Rhythm
 
If the subject is not in sinus rhythm at the end of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911058], electrical cardioversion may be performed, at the discretion of the surgeon, understanding that these subjects are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_911126]. The subject is then transferred to the post-operative care ward.

 Discontinuation  of oral anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin) post ablation is generally not 
recommended in subjects who have a CHA
2DS or CHA 2DS 2VAS C score of ≥ 2. 
 The decision  regarding the use of oral anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin) for longer 
than two (2) months following ablation should be made by [CONTACT_099], based on the 
subject’s risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF. 
 
To monitor anticoagulation for subjects on the following anticoagulation therapy, the following laboratory tests are recommended and should be measured at each follow up visit according to institutional SOC.  Any additional anticoagulation testing may be performed according to institutional SOC or the physician’s discretion.

5.3 Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure  All subjects should return between Day 91 – Day [ADDRESS_1279932] be used for endocardial left sided catheter ablation; no other device should be used for ablation purposes in 
the left atrium. During ablation, it is recommended that power not exceed 50 watts and 35 watts, 
if the catheter is perpendicular to the tissue.  Refer to the relevant Instructions for Use for further details. The use of phased array intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) during the procedure is encouraged to guide the transeptal puncture and catheter ablation process.  
Note: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used during the Endocardial EP Ablation 
Procedure.  The transesophageal echocardiography probes should be retracted from the area of ablation prior to energy delivery as a measure to protect the esophagus and other surrounding tissue structures. Note: The order of the below EP procedure (e.g., right-to-left or left-to-right) may be performed 
according to institutional practices.  However, the electrophysiologist should bear in mind the 
following: 
 Monitoring for cavo-tricuspid isthmus lesion and mitral isthmus lesion re-conduction after 20 minutes or longer following initial lesion creation is required.  
 Heparin shall be administered to maintain an ACT of > 300 seconds prior to any left atrial catheter-based ablation maneuvers.

Pre-Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure Antiarrhythmic Medications
 
If subject was placed on an AAD following the surgical procedure, it is recommended that the AAD should be discontinued for at least five (5) days (or 5 half-lives) prior to performing the EP catheter procedure to allow adequate drug washout (amiodarone should be discontinued 45 days 
prior to the Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure).  
 
Pre-Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure Antithrombotic Medications
 
To protect subjects from bleeding or thromboembolic events, investigators may utilize their institutional procedures for anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, in recognition of various oral anticoagulants available as well as individual subject factors such as CHADS
2 or CHA 2DS 2VASc 
score.  Subjects may undergo their Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure on therapeutic levels of their oral anticoagulant (e.g., INR 2.0 - 2.5 for warfarin held for 12-24 hours prior to the procedure or based on institutional SOC) in order to protect against thromboembolic events.

general anesthesia may be used, per institutional SOC.  The subject is prepped and draped according to institutional SOC, to allow access to femoral, jugular, and /or other access sites as 
needed. 
 Measures to Protect the Esophagus and Phrenic Nerve Structures during the Endocardial 
EP Ablation Procedure  
During the endocardial procedure, standard institutional techniques should be utilized to mitigate, to the extent possible, any potential collateral injury to the esophagus and phrenic nerve structures as a result of ablation.  These techniques may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1279937]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 Use of intracardiac ultrasound (ICE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to 
guide the catheter ablation process. Note: Transesophageal echocardiography probes 
should be retracted from the area of ablation prior to energy delivery as a measure to protect the esophagus and other surrounding tissue structures. 
 Use of an esophageal temperature probe, positioned under fluoroscopy such that it is as 
close to the tip of the ablation area as possible. 
 Register Baseline CT/MR image with electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816], to define 
anatomic structures. 
 Phrenic Nerve Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Prior to energy delivery near the ostium of the right superior 
pulmonary vein, SVC, or roof of LAA, perform pacing to identify phrenic nerve location 
relative to planned ablation site(s). 
o Pacing at high output (e.g., 10 mA) is recommended. 
o If a 3-dimensional electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911131], sites where 
diaphragmatic pacing is documented should be noted on the map. 
 
Catheter Conduction Block Assessment & Ablation Steps

by [CONTACT_911268]: 
 
Diagnostic Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure Placement Insert multi polar Coronary Sinus (CS) catheter into coronary sinus for standard EP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911132].  Also, a multi electrode diagnostic HIS catheter may be placed in position for help in guidance of CS cannulation and transeptal puncture at physician’s discretion.  
Cavo-tricuspid Isthmus Lesion (CTI)
 
If subject has undergone prior catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation or Atrial Flutter, this lesion line 
may have been created at the time of previous ablation.  In this instance, the EP should check for bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block, and, if required, perform additional cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation. 
 
The cavo-tricuspid isthmus lesions are created according to standard institutional practices.  Check for bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmu s block should be performed on all subjects and re-
checked after a standard waiting period of 20 minutes.  Check Conduction Block of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911133] a circular mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228], check for both right and left pulmonary veins isolation for entrance and exit block. Check the Posterior Box fo r entrance and exit block.  This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_911134]; however, this may also be achieved utilizing a voltage map with a 3-D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816].  
Gap Closure  
Note: If block has not been achieved, it is required for the electrophysiologist to deliver additional 
ablations to the targeted site in an effort to achieve block (i.e., “gap closure”).  If additional energy delivery is performed, the lesion must be rechecked for block.  
If an atrial arrhythmia is present/induced during conduction block testing, then it should be 
mapped and ablated.  If atrial fibrillation (AF) is induced, then complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911135].

 Mitral Isthmus Lesion
 
Note: If the subject presents to the Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure in mitral isthmus dependent Atrial Flutter (“Peri-Mitral Flutter”), the mitral isthmus line must be completed by [CONTACT_911269].   
 
The literature suggests that this will be necessary in only 15-20% of subjects.  Note: Proof of block in the box and bilateral pulmonary vein isolation should be assessed before any mitral line is initiated. 
 
The mitral isthmus line will be initiated by [CONTACT_911270].  
The maneuver will be facilitated by [CONTACT_911271] t he left inferior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line 
or the inferior floor line, completing the mitral isthmus line.  Lesions in the coronary sinus may be 
needed to complete this lesion.  (Note: If the EP is unable to complete the Mitral isthmus line from this posterior approach, the EP 
may utilize a more anterior approach.  The Mitral Line will be performed entirely by [CONTACT_911272] ).  
 Re-check Conduction Block of Mitral Isthmus Lesions Re-check bidirectional block of Mitral Isthmus Lesion should be assessed after 20 minutes 
following completed ablation. 
 Definition of Conduction Block  
For this study, endocardial entrance and exit block via pacing maneuvers will be used to assess pulmonary vein isolation and left atrium posterior wa ll isolation.  Pulmonary vein isolation/block 
will be defined as pulmonary veins showing endocardial entrance and exit block with either a 
lasso (circling mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169228]) or other multipolar  catheters.  Endocardial bidirectional block via 
pacing maneuvers will be used to assess the cavo-tricuspid isthmus and mitral isthmus lesions.  
Particular attention should be paid to block across the mitral isthmus line.   
Note: It is only possible to demonstrate bidirectional (i.e., entrance and exit) block in a subject in 
sinus or other paceable rhythm.  If the subject is in atrial fibrillation, they will not be able to be paced and only entrance block will be used to demonstrate conduction block.  Utilization of local capture should be the goal, understanding that this may not always be demonstrated.  Isoproterenol or Adenosine Testing (Optional)  
Per investigator discretion, once confirmation of block, or following mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911137], isoproterenol or adenosine may be administered based on institutional practices.

For purposes of this protocol, complex fractionated atrial electrograms are defined as: 
(1) atrial electrograms with two or more deflections with fractionated baseline complexes, with 
continuous activity over a 10-second recording time; or  
(2) atrial electrograms with a cycle length ≤ [ADDRESS_1279940] be in stable position when recording these electrograms.  A visual inspection approach (i.e., a standard EP recording system with the ablation catheter in stable position for [ADDRESS_1279941] the CFAE and capture the raw data from the procedure) will be used
18 19 
.  Note: For purposes of this study, representative intracardiac electrograms at each target CFAE site should be recorded (both pre- and post-ablation).  Note: Investigational sites should review annotated pre-ablation electrogram recordings of 
ablated CFAE(s) to confirm whether the local CFAE met the protocol-definition of CFAEs (as 
defined above).  This activity may be performed following completion of the EP procedure, given the potential to unduly extend procedure time as a result of performing this analysis during the procedure.  
Identified local CFAE(s) may be ablated using the RF based, irrigated, power controlled, ablation 
catheters for endocardial lesions. During ablation, it is recommended that power not exceed 50 watts and 35 watts if the catheter is perpendicular to the tissue.  Refer to the relevant Instructions for Use for further details.  The objectives for CFAE ablation are as follows: 
 Technical criterion: Eliminate local CFAE (i.e., post-ablation CFAE electrogram recording 
is abolished as compared to pre-ablation CFAE electrogram recording). 
 Procedural criterion: Termination of atrial fibrillation to either organized atrial tachycardia 
or sinus rhythm.  If local CFAE(s) are elim inated, but the arrhythmia continues as 
organized atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, the atrial arrhythmia should be mapped and ablated, with the ultimate goal of attaining sinus rhythm.

5.3.[ADDRESS_1279943] Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure & Longer-Term Antithrombotic Therapy To protect subjects from either post-surgical bleeding or thromboembolic events, a recommended 
process for antithrombotic therapy is provided as  outlined below.  Investigators may utilize their 
institutional procedures for anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, in recognition of various oral anticoagulants available as well as individual subject factors such as CHADS
[ADDRESS_1279944]– Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure If oral anticoagulants were stopped prior to the EP procedure, or INR levels decrease to < 2.0, the Investigator should determine the potential need for anticoagulant therapy in accordance with institutional SOC based upon subject characteristics.  Intravenous unfractionated heparin may be used as a bridge to resumption of INR 2.0 – 3.0.  Alternatively, a direct thrombin or Factor Xa 
inhibitor can be administered following ablation.  Regardless, the investigators should be mindful 
of risks for bleeding and balance against the potential for thromboembolism, in the post-ablation setting.  For subjects who undergo their EP procedure with therapeutic levels of their oral anticoagulant, the oral anticoagulant may be resumed. The use of enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) is not permitted.  Management of anticoagulation therapy should be in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_911142]-operative period.  
 Longer Term Follow-Up Post Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure Oral anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin or dabigatran is recommended for all subjects for at least three (3) months following the EP procedure.  The decision regarding the use of oral 
anticoagulant therapy for longer than [ADDRESS_1279945]’s risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF. Note: Discontinuation of oral anticoagulation therapy (e.g., Warfarin) post-ablation is generally not recommended in subjects who have a CHADS

To monitor anticoagulation for subjects on the following anticoagulation therapy, the following laboratory tests are recommended and should be measured at each follow up visit according to institutional SOC.  Any additional anticoagulation testing may be performed according to institutional SOC or the physician’s discretion. 
 warfarin (Coumadin) - International Normalized Ratio (INR) 
 dabigatran (Pradaxa) – when necessary utilize aPTT or ECT to assess for anticoagulant

5.3.[ADDRESS_1279947] EP Procedure (2nd Blanking Period) Antiarrhythmic Medication Therapy – AAD 
Management and Recommended Guideline 
Following the EP ablation procedure, a subject may be continued on an AAD for up to 90 days 
(which shall be called the Post Endocardial EP ablation procedure blanking period). If the subject 
is in sinus rhythm at the 3-month post endocardial EP ablation procedure, the subject’s AAD therapy will be discontinued. If the atrial arrhythmia returns, the subject may be returned to AAD therapy utilizing an AAD that the subject previously  failed at a dose not exceeding those previously 
failed from baseline.  The 3-month period between the blanking period and the 6-month visit will 
be utilized for AAD medication optimization. An ar rhythmia will not be considered an effectiveness 
failure during this time period.  AAD medication must be optimized prior to the 6-month visit, at 
which time any arrhythmias will be counted towards the effectiveness endpoints. At the 6-month visit, if the subject is in sinus rhythm on a previously failed AAD at a dose not exceeding previously failed, the subject may remain on the AAD.   
Re-ablation to treat Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Tachycardia, and Atrial Flutter following 
Endocardial EP Catheter Ablation  
Subjects that experience atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter may be treated with a catheter ablation if deemed medically necessary following the Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure. 
 
Second Blanking Period Catheter Ablation 
 Subjects that experience a non-manageable, atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia and atrial 
flutter within the blanking period may be treated with an additional catheter ablation. 
 An ablation of an atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter would not be considered 
a failure within the blanking period. 
 Re-intervention is encouraged to be performed during the 90-day blanking period but may be 
performed anytime during the study if deemed medically necessary.

RF based, irrigated, power-controlled ablation catheter shall be used in a consistent manner as 
outlined in the product Instructions for Use. 
 Right Atrium 
Ablation catheters used for endocardial lesions in the right atrium (referred to as “RA ablation

 Further, the procedure should incorporate electro-anatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The electrophysiologist 
may also use additional commercially approved catheters for the cavo-tricuspid isthmus lesion, 
at the physician’s discretion.  The use of cryo balloon catheters will not be permitted.  Electrophysiologists may use irrigated or non-irrigated RF ablation catheters, depending on the Electrophysiologist’s preference.  
AtriCure Bipolar System 
The AtriCure Bipolar System used in this clinical study consists of a radiofrequency (RF) generator (Ablation Sensing Unit, model ASU2, AtriCure) ( Figure 3), a switchbox console (ASU 
Source Switch or matrix, model ASB3) (Figure 3), two (2), single use, bipolar RF clamp (models EMR2 and EML2) (Figure 4), three (3) single use bipolar RF Pens: the Isolator Long Pen TT 
(model MAX5), the Coolrail Linear Pen (model M CR1), the Isolator Linear Pen (model MLP1) 
(Figures 5, 6, 7 respectively); the Glidepath Tape (accessory)(model GPT100) (Figure 8 ); and 
the AtriClip PRO LAA Exclusion System (PRO1 or PRO2) ( Figures 9 and 10 ). 
 6.1 Generator and Switch Matrix  
The Ablation and Sensing Unit (ASU2) is a radiofrequency (RF) generator used to power AtriCure 
Devices which include the Isolator Synergy Clamps, Isolator Long Pen TT, and Coolrail Linear Pen, and the Isolator Linear Pen.  The ASU2 is a portable, reusable device that produces and delivers bipolar RF energy near the AM frequency band.  The device consists of a main printed circuit board, Power Entry Module, Footswitch Interface, and Feedback Indicators contained 
within a box enclosure.  The ASU2 controls and delivers the voltage and current output to the 
device and determines the duration of each ablation.  The footswitch is the input device used to activate RF energy delivery.  When the footswitch  is activated (depressed) the ASU2 provides 
power to the selected devices according to a predefined algorithm.  Upon reaching the predetermined threshold (voltage and/or current relationship) the ASU2 will light a visual indicator and sound an audible tone signaling the end of the ablation cycle.  RF energy output may also be 
terminated by [CONTACT_911274]. 
 The ASU2 is used in conjunction with the Switch Matrix (ASB3).  The ASB3 is an accessory interface module or source switch allowing various AtriCure devices to connect to the ASU2 at the same time.  A total of 3 devices may be co nnected to the ASB3 simultaneously but power is 
delivered to only one device at a time as determined by [CONTACT_28024].  The device to be used (powered) is selected by [CONTACT_911275]3.  Both the ASU2 and ASB3 consoles are cleared for use with the EMR2 and EML2 model clamps to ablate cardiac tissue during surgery via 510(k) submission K101174. The ASU2 was cleared

for use with the Isolator Long Pen TT (MAX5) for the cardiac ablation indication via 510(k) 
submission K050459.  The ASU2 and ASB3 are cleared for use with the Isolator Linear Pen for 
cardiac tissue ablation indication via 510(k) submission K100501.  The ASU2 and ASB3 are also 
cleared for use with the Coolrail Linear Pen for the ablation of cardiac tissue under K073605.

The hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_911145]: Isol ator Synergy Clamps - available in models 
EMR2, a clamp which curves to the right, and EML2, a clamp that curves to the left.  Both models were first cleared for cardiac tissue ablation via 510(k) submission K101174. 
 
The proposed clamps deliver the same bipolar RF energy which is delivered via electrodes housed within the insulating jaws of the clamps.  The devices differ only in geometry of the jaws and in the mechanism for closing the device jaws.  Comparative bench and animal testing for the proposed devices supporting their safe and effective use has been submitted to FDA in 510(k) submissions. 
 
The clamps all have two parallel pairs of electrodes on the device jaws, and an in-line handle with syringe- type actuation and button release mechanism.  The electrode pair is formed by [CONTACT_911276], linear electrodes, one on each opposing jaw of the clamp.  The electrodes on each jaw are spaced 0.5 mm (0.02”) from the center line of the jaw and 1.0 mm (0.04”) apart from each other.  The bipolar RF energy is delivered between directly opposing linear electrodes in the 
electrode pair.  Alternating current flows from the proximal electrode of an electrode pair located 
on the inner surface of the top insulated jaw to the distal electrode of an electrode pair located on the opposing surface of the bottom insulated jaw.  RF energy is delivered to one electrode pair at a time; each pair functions completely independently of the other.  Since the bipolar RF energy delivery switches or alternates between each electrode pair, the mode of and amount of energy delivery per unit volume of tissue clamped between the jaws of the hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_911146].

accessing the cardiac tissues.  Upon closing the jaws, the proximal jaw of the end-effector closes 
to the distal jaw in a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_911147]” motion.  The jaw is passive until the aperture is closed to 8 
mm at which point, the proximal jaw is in parallel with the distal jaw and remains parallel until it is 
re-opened.

6.3 Isolator Long Pen TT (MAX5) 
The Isolator Lon Pen TT (Pen) is a hand-held, single use, bipolar RF ablation device.  The Pen 
was cleared for surgical ablation of cardiac tissue under K050459.  The clearance for the Pen 
was expanded to include temporary cardiac pacing, sensing, recording, and stimulation for the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias during cardiac surgery under K061593.  The Pen is available in two configurations, the MAX1 which has a shorter shaft, and the MAX5, which has a longer shaft.  The devices are identical with the exception of the length of the shaft.  
The Pen resembles a standard pen or wand type ablation device and is always under the direct 
control and visualization of the surgeon.  The Pen produces linear and spot lesions on cardiac tissue.  It is designed to deliver dry bipolar RF energy to the tissue through the two electrodes on the device end effector.  A handle is connected to the malleable shaft, which is connected to the end effector.  Current flows from one electrode, through the tissue to the other electrode to create 
bipolar ablation lesions on cardiac tissue.  When the Pen is connected to an auxiliary pace, sense, 
or stimulation device; the Pen is designed to provide temporary pacing or monitoring.

6.4 Coolrail Linear Pen (MCR1) 
The Coolrail Linear Pen (Coolrail pen) is a handheld, single use, dry, bipolar RF ablation device.  
The Coolrail pen was originally cleared for surgical ablation of cardiac tissue under K073605.  The end effector of the Coolrail pen is longer than that of the Isolator Long Pen TT to facilitate the 
creation of longer linear lesions.  The device is  designed with internally cooled electrodes to 
produce continuous, full-thickness lesions on the beating heart.  The fluid tubing throughout the 
cable and end-effector provides a closed loop of internal cooling (non-irrigated) functioning to cool the electrodes which reduces surface heating (thermal heating).  
The Coolrail pen is comprised of an end effector, shaft, handle, cable, and pump system container 
(PSC).  The end effector consists of one pair of electrodes separated with insulating material, two internally cooling fluid tubes (not in contact [CONTACT_502989]), thermal sensor, and sensor wires.  The end effector is connected to a pi[INVESTIGATOR_911148].  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_911149] a clevis, which allows the end effector to be moved into three positions (-25°, and +25° from inline at 0°) by [CONTACT_28024].  The clevis is attached to a malleable shaft.  The handle is attached to the shaft.  Fluid tubes, thermistor 
wires, and RF signal wires pass through the malleable shaft, handle, and cable to the PSC. 
 The pump system container houses the fluid pump, fluid reservoir, and thermistor logic.  The fluid pump is capable of pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_911150].  The fluid reservoir is capable of maintaining the pressure in the system so that the pump system can 
operate efficiently.  The thermistor logic determines the temperature of the electrodes and shuts 
down the RF energy if the temperature exceeds 55°C.  The thermistor is centered along the length and width of the electrodes.  It is insulated from the tissue and measures the temperature of the electrodes only.  The temperature threshold is set to ensure that the device is functioning properly (i.e., there is enough fluid in the system, there is no obstruction in the fluid path, and the pump is 
functioning properly).  The light-emitting diode (LED) on the PSC will light up if the system has 
exceeded the temperature threshold or if the system has not been filled with fluid.

6.5 Isolator Linear Pen (MLP1) 
The Isolator Linear Pen is a single subject use electrosurgical instrument designed for use only 
with the ASU and ASU Source Switch (ASB).  The Pen is used to ablate cardiac tissues and as a surgical pacing and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911151] K100501.  When the Pen is connected 
to the ASU, the ASU provides the bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy flowing between both 
electrodes of the Pen.  The Operator controls t he application of this RF energy by [CONTACT_911277].  When the Pen is connected to an auxiliary pace, sense, or stimulation device; the Pen is designed to provide temporary pacing or monitoring.

the Isolator Clamps and may be used to aid in positioning the jaws of the clamp.  One end of the 
Glidepath attaches the distal jaw of the Isolator Clamp, while the other may be pulled by [CONTACT_911278]. 
 The GPT100 (snap-fit model) connects to the distal jaw of the EMR2 or EML2 Clamp via a snap pin (Figure 4 & 8).  The GPT100 remains fixed on the EMR2/EML2 after being snapped into place.  
6.7 AtriClip PRO LAA Exclusion System (PRO1 or PRO2) The AtriClip PRO LAA Exclusion System (Figures 9 & 10) consists of a self-closing, sterile, 
implantable Clip which is pre-loaded on a disposable Clip applier.  The AtriClip PRO1 was 
originally cleared under K093679.  The AtriClip PRO2 was originally cleared under K160454.  The 
frame assembly of the implantable Clip consists of two Nitinol (nickel titanium) springs connecting 
two opposing titanium tubes (core), which are covered with a Polyurethane elastomer.  This assembly is covered with a knit braided polyes ter fabric, composed entirely of Polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET).  The Nitinol springs are biased toward the closed position allowing the device to close in the absence of opposing forces (Figure 10).  When closed, the Clip applies uniform pressure over the length of the Clip to ensure consistent, reproducible, and secure exclusion of 
the LAA.  The AtriClip PRO LAA Exclusion S ystem does not contain natural rubber latex 
components.

Patient will be counseled regarding AEF warning signs and treatment.  The Patient Educational Brochure and Patient Emergency Wallet Card will be provided to the patient and will be reviewed. 
 
Neurologic Assessment  – The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) should be performed after the NIH 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) has been determined and graded.  The same individual who performed the NIH Stroke Scale should perform the Modified Rank in Scale (mRS) assessment.  Study staff must 
be trained prior to administration of the scales (NIHSS requires certification).    
Targeted Physical Examination – A targeted physical exam (PE) includes an assessment of the 
following body systems:  General Appearance, Cardiovascular, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and Musculoskeletal.  
A more thorough PE may be conducted according to institutional SOC.  If any findings are noted during the PE, the finding should be recorded in the source documents as medical history or as an adverse event, as appropriate.  The finding shall be recorded in the eCRF as required per the 
Safety section of the protocol (Section 10.0 ). 
 
Weight, Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  – The subject’s weight, blood pressure and heart rate 
will be assessed using the site’s SOC.  AFEQT  – The AFEQT is a self-administered questionnaire.  The completion of the instrument 
should take about 5 minutes.  In the clinic or doctor’s office, the AFEQT questionnaire should be administered prior to seeing and/or being examined by [CONTACT_911282]’ responses are not influenced by [CONTACT_88235]’ evaluation.  If other questionnaires are to be

8.1.2 Data Collection 
An EDC system will be utilized by [CONTACT_212644] (medical records and/or source document works heets) onto common eCRFs. This system is a 
web-based, secure electronic software application This system was designed and is developed and maintained by [CONTACT_179200] a manner that is compliant with national and international GCP data protection/data privacy and electronic record/electronic signature (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11) regulatory requirements.  The platform software has been validated in accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection and US Safe Harbor 
Certification.  Prior to being released for data entry, validation of the study level components (i.e., 
data entry screens, associated edit checks and workflow) will be conducted in accordance with approved user acceptance testing procedures. Access to this system will be controlled so that only authorized users will have the ability to enter into the system.  The system is considered a closed system according to 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records: Electronic Signatures.  
The EDC system will be used to facilitate the collection of all study data at the site. Designated 
site personnel will be responsible for entering subject data into the EDC system. All external and Sponsor internal users will be trained on the EDC application at a level dependent on their planned function.   
An EDC digital User Manual will be available under the help menu within the Clindex® website to 
assist in the collection and entry of source data into the electronic casebook. Investigative study sites will be asked to enter subject data into the eCRFs no later than [ADDRESS_1279990] and signed electronically.

in Appendix 3. 
 
The Investigator and the study staff will also be trained in general aspects of the procedure, study 
administration, content and manner of administrati on of the questionnaires, all procedures in the 
protocol, and the procedure for electronic data acquisition and transmission.  Site personnel will be trained on the study protocol by [CONTACT_205836] a combination of teleconferences, Web-Ex conferences and on-Site training, as appropriate.  Training will be documented.  It is ultimately 
the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all clinical site personnel participating in this study 
are trained. 
8.1.11 Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_179224]: 
 The rights and well-being of the subjects are protected; 
 The reported study data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; and 
 The conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), applicable GCPs, and with applicable local/regional regulatory 
requirements. 
 
AtriCure, as Sponsor of this study, will be responsible for monitoring this study.  The monitor’s 
duties are to aid the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_911176], legible, well-organized and easily retrievable data.  In addition, the monitor will be responsible for assuring the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_911177]. Approaches to monitoring include on-site visits and may include a remote visit, as appropriate and the rationale 
and frequency for monitoring will be at the Sponsor’s discretion. The extent and nature of 
monitoring will be predetermined and based on considerations such as the objective, design, complexity, and endpoints of the study and mutually agreed to by [CONTACT_1034]. The frequency of monitoring will be determined for each site based on factors including:  the planned enrollment, the rate of enrollment, and the current study conduct.  Study conduct can be evaluated remotely 
based on compliance percentage, discrepancy rate and discrepancy type.  Monitors will be trained 
on and comply with established standard operating procedures as well as a written monitoring plan specified by [CONTACT_1034].  In order to perform the monitoring role effectively, the monitor must verify eCRF entries with source documents.  The monitor must be given access to primary subject data which supports

the information recorded on the eCRF, i.e., hospi [INVESTIGATOR_11533], appointment books, original laboratory 
records, etc.  Access to these documents must also be given should the regulatory authority in 
the instance of an external inspection.  Since a subject has the right to refuse access to these 
documents on the grounds of confidentiality, consent to access is included in the informed consent document, which the subject signs.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_911178].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_335930]-operate 
with the monitor at each visit for the review and verification of eCRFs and any additional records 
that may have been previously arranged between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_911179]. 
8.2 Changes to Protocol, Protocol Deviations and Protocol Amendments 
8.2.1 Changes to Protocol 
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without 
agreement by [CONTACT_335958]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/EC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logi stical or administrative aspects of the study 
(e.g., change in monitor(s), change of telephone number(s)). In the event of an emergency 
situation, the Investigator must notify the Monitor or AtriCure immediately.  A full written report of 
the situation must be forwarded to the IRB/Ethics Committee who approved the original protocol and AtriCure within [ADDRESS_1280000] the study in accordance with this protocol; however, protocol 
deviations may occur during the course of the study.  Protocol deviations are events occurring during the conduct of the study which are not in compliance with the protocol and for which an amendment has not been granted. Protocol deviations can be committed by [CONTACT_1034], the PI, or study subject. A deviation can be identified from a number of sources. Potential sources include 
but are not limited to a member of the PI’s staff, the monitor during monitoring visits, or a member 
of the data management or statistical groups when entering or analyzing data.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s representative are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_911286] a protocol deviation.  Regardless of the source, it is crucial to document the deviation and record all corrective actions. Protocol deviations will be reported in the final report. 
 
The process for capturing deviations will be detailed in the monitoring plan.  The process will require that documentation describe the deviation, appropriate actions taken, and will be included in the study file for the respective PI [INVESTIGATOR_335934].  The study site representative will be advised to record the deviation and relevant discussion with the Sponsor about the deviation in subject source documents. 
 
Protocol deviations affecting the scientific soundness of the study or the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, will be reported by [CONTACT_978], as required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. Protocol deviations will be summarized and grouped into relevant categories for analysis and may include, but not be limited to, subjects who: 
 Entered the study although they did not satisfy the eligibility criteria; or 
 Developed withdrawal criteria during the study, but not removed.

8.2.3 Protocol Amendments 
If it becomes necessary to amend the protocol, then the nature of the amendment will be agreed 
between the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator(s) and this will be recorded with a justification for the amendment. The appropriate IRBs/EC w ill be informed of amendments prior to 
implementation of the change. 
9.0 STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Clinical Study Objective 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive cardiac 
surgical ablation utilizing the AtriCure Bipolar System and AtriClip PRO LAA Exclusion System in 
a Dual Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911180] (DEEP) for the treatment of persistent or 
longstanding persistent AF.  It is expected that this combined technology will provide a substantial increase in effectiveness over the current treatment options, with only a moderate increase in safety risk. 
9.2 Primary Endpoints 
9.2.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom from any  documented AF, atrial flutter, or atrial 
tachycardia lasting >30 seconds in duration (or for the entire length of a 30-second ECG tracing) 
through the 12-month follow-up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs (with the exception of 
previously failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed).  Any arrhythmia that occurs within the blanking period or during the AAD optimization period, prior to the 6-month visit will not be considered a failure.  The rhythm status used for evaluation of this endpoint shall be derived regularly scheduled monitoring as well as any symptom driven monitoring that is 
performed.  For the purposes of this study, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW) will not be considered procedure failures.  The 12-month follow-up window utilized for this endpoint is based on time from the catheter 
ablation procedure.  However, if a subject refu ses the second stage of the DEEP procedure, i.e., 
the catheter ablation procedure, or experiences a safety event or medical condition precluding 
the catheter ablation procedure, every attempt will be made to continue collecting follow-up data, 
including their primary effectiveness status at 12 months after the surgical procedure (the 3-month blanking and AAD optimization periods measured from the surgical ablation procedure in this case).  If their status cannot be ascertained, the endpoint will be missing, and thus subject to 
missing value methods below. 
 9.2.2   Primary Safety Endpoint  The primary safety endpoint is a composite endpoint consisting of any one or more of the following 
events if they are adjudicated by [CONTACT_911224] (SAEs) and related to device/procedures as follows: 
1. AtriCure Bipolar System, AtriClip Pro LAA E xclusion System, within 30 days of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911181]; or 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280002]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
2. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_911053] 30 days following the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911054]; 
or 
3. The endocardial index procedure (or a repeat endocardial ablation procedure performed 
during the blanking period) within 7 days following an endocardial ablation procedure 
 
Events except as otherwise specified for a particular condition include: 
a. death (regardless of cause) b. stroke 
c. transient ischemic attack (TIA) 
d. myocardial infarction (MI) e. pulmonary or systemic embolism f. pericarditis resulting in an effusion that leads to hemodynamic compromise or requires 
pericardiocentesis, prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169252] 48 hours, requires a new 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or persists for more than 30 days following the ablation procedure 
g. excessive bleeding, defined as one or more of the following: 
i. re-operation to control bleeding within [ADDRESS_1280003]-endocardial ablation procedure, if related 
to an AtriCure device or to the procedure; 
ii. receipt of ≥ [ADDRESS_1280004]-endocardial ablation procedure, if related to the device or procedure; 
iii. conversion to sternotomy or thoracotomy that requires ≥ [ADDRESS_1280005], or repair of a cardiac injury 
h. wound infection at surgical site requiring re-operation for wound debridement 
i. atrio-esophageal fistula (from the time of surgical procedure through 12-month follow-up 
visit) 
j. permanent phrenic nerve paralysis, defined as paralysis that remains unresolved at the 12-
month follow-up visit 
k. permanent pacemaker implantation that is a direct result of injury to the specialized 
conduction system (SA node or AV node) during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_911052]  
l. pulmonary vein (PV) Stenosis of >70%, as measured at any time after the catheter ablation 
procedure through the 12-month follow-up visit 
m. major vascular access complications, including development of a hematoma, an 
arteriovenous fistula, or pseudoaneurysm that requires surgical intervention or transfusion, 
or that prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], or require a new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
9.[ADDRESS_1280006] (ADE) rates are likely higher in persistent populations due to the fact that these patients tend to be older, have longer AF history, and have more congestive heart failure than paroxysmal populations
22.  Thus, studies reporting results for aggregated AF populations tend to 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280007]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
be more favorable than what is seen in strictly persistent populations.   
 
Based on the premises delineated above, the sample size calculations for powering the two 
primary endpoints are given in the following sections.   Effectiveness  The 12-month effectiveness rates after various dual/hybrid surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_911182], as most are from single center studies with varying 
procedural techniques and varying degrees of rhythm monitoring
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.  Some sites 
reported on surgical-only procedures, others on concomitant epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542]/endocardial procedures, staged 2-part procedures, and combinations of these designs.  Based on a detailed review of this literature and the two feasibility studies performed with the AtriCure Bipolar System, the lead 
investigators for this study believe that a 70% effectiveness rate after 12 months of follow-up is a 
reasonable estimate for the primary success endpoint.  While estimates of effectiveness success after catheter ablation also vary widely, primarily due to length of follow-up, severity of AF, and the definition of failure utilized, the overall success in a 
persistent population at 12 months, as defined by [CONTACT_148188], is believed to be less than 
60%.  In particular, the only regulatory trial for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with posted trial results, the Medtronic Ablation Frontiers TTOP trial, which utilized a similar population with a less stringent endpoint of a 90% reduction in AF after only 6 months of follow-up 3 months beyond the blanking period), had a success rate of 55.8% 
30, 31, 32.  A recent study in Spain (SARA) reported 
that 60.2% (59 of 98) of persistent AF patients (where LS persistent patients were excluded) were 
free of any recurrence of >30 s at 12 months follow-up33.  A report of 5-year outcomes in a LS 
persistent AF population of 202 patients showed that 35% remained in SR at 1 year after a single 
catheter ablation and 58% remained in SR at 1 year after multiple procedures, with persistent AF duration a highly significant predictor of relapse
34. 
 
Based on a thorough review of the literature, an OPC of 60% success was chosen as the 
acceptable lower confidence limit for effectiveness in the combined persistent and LS persistent populations of this study.  Thus, the goal for the primary effectiveness endpoint is to establish that the DEEP procedure significantly increases effect iveness relative to an OPC of a 60% catheter 
ablation success rate.  Using the expected effectiveness success rate of 70% for the DEEP procedure, a one-sided alpha=0.025 level of significance, and a normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution with continuity correction, a sample size of N=182 is required to ensure 80% 
power.  Safety  Due to the groundbreaking new procedure that will be utilized in this trial, there are no regulatory 
trials with reported safety results for any type of similar minimally invasive procedure.  The 
published literature for similar procedures is sparse and safety events are not reported with any consistency.  Thus, the only realistic estimate of safety event rates is derived from the most recent 
feasibility trial.  Based on this trial, a best estimate of the primary safety event rate over the dual procedures is 19%.  
Patients with persistent AF are at increased risk of ischemic stroke and heart failure, while they 
may also be at increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke due to oral anticoagulation.  In addition, their 
quality of life and ability of work can be greatly affected by [CONTACT_911287] e and by [CONTACT_911288]: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280008]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
used to treat the disease.  All of the patients in this study will have tried and failed at least one 
treatment and many have failed several treatments, whether multiple AADs or AADs and catheter 
ablation.   
 The patients themselves and their treating physicians are willing to tolerate a substantial level of risk, if the reward is a similarly substantial level of benefit.  The tolerable risk level, from the perspective of both the patients and the treating physicians, is related more to the subset of events that would cause permanent damage (i.e., death, stroke, MI, permanent and significant phrenic 
nerve damage) than to the overall level of procedure-related SAEs.  It is believed that the rate of 
this subset of events will be quite low in the proposed study and that the benefit to the patient in terms of AF reduction or resolution, substantially reduced stroke risk, heart failure risk, and bleeding risk, and a substantial increase in quality of life will be the expected benefits. There have been no regulated trials in this persistent AF population for a treatment that has 
produced the magnitude of benefit expected in this trial, and thus there is no comparable 
published standard for acceptable risk in relation to benefit.  Rather, the acceptable risk level is proportionate to a patient’s current risk profile and quality of life, based on their AF, and the anticipated level of benefit from the proposed treatment.    
For these reasons, the clinicians involved in this study have agreed that a 28% rate of safety 
events, as specifically defined in the primary safety endpoint, and with the expected mix of permanent vs. resolvable events, is an acceptable risk level in relation to the expected benefits of this treatment.  In order to have an 80% chance of showing that  the DEEP procedure has a primary safety event 
rate of <28% (UCL) when the actual underlying rate is 19%, a sample size of N=192 subjects is required.  This sample size calculation is based on a one-sided α=0.025 level of significance and 
assumes a normal approximation to the binomial distribution with continuity correction.  Overall Sample Size 
The primary effectiveness and safety endpoints require similar numbers of patients, with the 
effectiveness endpoint driving the overall sample size.  Due to the potential for significant loss to follow-up prior to the primary effectiveness endpoint at 12 months. In order to allow for an attrition rate of approximately 20%, this study will treat up to 220 subjects.   
9.4 Randomization Randomization is not applicable, as this is a single arm study design. 9.5 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations are defined for utilization in the data analysis: 
 Intent to treat patient population (ITT):  The ITT subject population will include all 
enrolled subjects who have met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 Safety Population : The safety population will include all enrolled subjects that undergo 
induction of anesthesia. 
 Per protocol patient population (PP): The PP patient population will include all subjects 
who complete both the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911183]. 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280009]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 AtriClip Effectiveness population: The AtriClip effectiveness population will include all 
ITT subjects for whom an attempt (entrance of the AtriClip into the chest wall) is made to 
place an AtriClip device. 
The primary effectiveness analysis will utilize t he ITT patient population.  Secondary effectiveness 
analyses will be conducted on the ITT and the PP patient populations. All safety analyses will utilize the safety population.  
9.6 Secondary Endpoints 
9.6.1 Secondary Endpoints – Effectiveness 
For labeling purposes, to be tested if the primary effectiveness endpoint is a success: 
1. Exclusion of the LAA, defined as defined by [CONTACT_911225] (<3 mm residual 
communication with LAA and < 10mm residual pocket) between the LA and LAA.  This endpoint will be measured at the 12-Month (Visit 11) (approximately [ADDRESS_1280010] AtriClip placement). The AtriClip effectiveness population will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
 
Based on a literature review of peer-reviewed research that was performed for the EXCLUDE trial (add reference here for the trial), a weighted average rate of 77.5% exclusion at 3 months was derived as a reasonable expectation of success, based on a combination of cut and sew and stapling procedures
35-44.  That same trial resulted in actual exclusion rates of 95.7% (67/70) 
for intra-procedural success and 98.4% (60/61) for 3-month success.  Utilizing the most 
conservative of these results gives a 95% lower confidence limit of just under 88% for an exact 
binomial confidence interval. 
 
In the current study, it is believed that the placement of a clip will provide a significant benefit to the patient with extremely low added safety risk.  A success rate of over 80% will exceed 
the 77.5% expectation of success based on other exclusion methods, with less risk of injury 
than those methods
35-44, and is a reasonable expectation based on the EXCLUDE results that 
showed a lower bound of just under 88%.  The associated hypothesis test, based on an exact binomial confidence interval, will be as follows: 
80 . : . 80 . :2 2   p H vs p Ha o 
Exploratory endpoints: 
2. Exclusion of the LAA, defined as lack of fluid communication (<3 mm residual communication 
with LAA and <10 mm residual pocket) between the LA and LAA. The endpoint will be 
measured intra-procedurally (Visit 2), and at the Endocardial EP Ablation Procedure (Visit 5). The AtriClip effectiveness population will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
3. Acute procedural success of surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_911054], defined as the percentage of 
subjects with successful electrical isolation/bloc k of all pulmonary veins, as well as the “box”.  
The ITT and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
4. Acute procedural success of endocardial catheter procedure, defined as the percentage of 
subjects with successful electrical isolation/block of all pulmonary veins and the “box”, as well as bi-directional block of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus.  The ITT and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
5. Freedom from Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Tachycardia, Atrial Flutter without AAD, defined as no 
documented event >30 seconds in duration (or for the entire length of an ECG tracing) with no utilization of AADs beyond the blanking and AAD optimization period, except as previously failed without an increase in dose.  This endpoint will be measured through the 12-month, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year visits (Visits 11-15) via cumulative ECG monitoring.  The ITT and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint.

6. Freedom from Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Tachycardia, Atrial Flutter regardless of AAD, defined as 
no documented event >30 seconds in duration (or for the entire length of the ECG tracing) 
regardless of AAD usage.  This endpoint will be measured through the12 month, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 
5-year visits (Visits 11-15) via cumulative ECG monitoring.  The ITT and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
7. Freedom from any documented AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting >10 minutes 
duration through the 12-month follow-up visit in the absence of Class I or III AADs (with the 
exception of previously failed AADs at doses not exceeding those previously failed). The ITT 
and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint. 
8. Change in Quality of Life, defined as the total AFEQT score measured at the 12-month follow-
up visit minus the score at the baseline visit. The score will be calculated per the AFEQT 
scoring manual.  The ITT and PP populations will be utilized for analysis of this endpoint.

Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280012]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
This endpoint will be measured at the 12-month, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year (Visits 11-15) follow-up 
visits. 
4. Emergency Room Visits for AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia, defined as the number of 
visits in the past 12-month period.  This endpoint  will be measured at the 12-month, 2-, 3-, 4-, 
and 5-year (Visits 11-15) follow-up visits. 
9.7 Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
The study will be considered successful if both the primary safety and primary effectiveness 
endpoints are statistically significant at the 0.025 level (one-sided). 
9.7.[ADDRESS_1280013] of a comparison of the proportion 
of patients who fail to complete the trial without a primary safety endpoint event to a historical control rate that is based on results from the feasibility trials.   Adverse events will be adjudicated in accordance with section 12.1. The proportion of primary safety failures will be calculated with subjects as the experimental unit (i.e., the subject will be considered a failure if a primary safety 
event was experienced within the timeframes defined in the endpoint).  The numerator of the 
proportion will be the number of subjects who hav e a primary safety event, and the denominator 
will be the total number of subjects.    A normal approximation to the binomial distribution, Z-test will be conducted at a one-sided 
α=0.[ADDRESS_1280014] the following hypothesis that the proportion of failures is 
significantly lower than the OPC:

where ps = the proportion of primary safety failures in the safety population.  The safety population 
will be the primary population for this analysis.  Missing values will be treated as described in the 
Missing Values section below.  
Primary Effectiveness  
The statistical analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint will consist of a comparison of the 
proportion of patients who remain a primary effectiveness success at the 12-month visit to a historical control rate that is based on results from the feasibility trials and published literature.  The proportion of primary effectiveness successes will be calculated with subjects as the 
experimental unit (i.e., the subject will be considered a success if no primary effectiveness failure 
was recorded from the 6-month visit through the 12-month visit).  The numerator of the proportion 
will be the number of subjects who are a primary effectiveness success, and the denominator will 
be the total number of subjects.    An exact, one-sample binomial test will be conducted at a one-sided α=0.[ADDRESS_1280015] the following hypothesis that the proportion of effectiveness successes is significantly higher than the OPC:

9.7.2 Secondary Analyses 
All secondary statistical analyses of primary endpoint s will be exploratory.  All analyses will be 
conducted using appropriate statistical methods as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) for the study.  These will include analyses of  the populations and subgroups as specified 
in this protocol and may also include additional populations and/or subgroups. 
9.[ADDRESS_1280017] will be conducted at a one-sided α=0.[ADDRESS_1280018] the following hypothesis that the proportion of subjects in the AtriClip effectiveness 
population with LAA exclusion at the 12-Month Visit ([ADDRESS_1280019] AtriClip placement) is 
significantly higher than 80%: 
80 . : . 80 . :2 2   p H vs p Ha o 
 The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be utilized for patients who do not have TEE testing at the 12-Month Visit.  This method is considered conservative based on the 
EXCLUDE study
35, which showed a higher exclusion rate at 3 months than at the time of clip 
placement (98.4% vs. 95.7%). 
 The remaining secondary endpoints will be exploratory and as such, the data will be tabulated without formal statistical testing.   
9.[ADDRESS_1280020] 12-month ECG readings available, will be analyzed as follows: 1) Last observation carried forward (LOCF): Any subject who is missing a scheduled testing 
will be considered an effectiveness success or failure at that scheduled visit based on their status up to and including their last testing. 
2) Worst case:   Any subject with no primary effectiveness failure recorded and with no 12-month 
test data will be considered a failure. 
3) Best case: Any subject with no primary effectiveness failure recorded and with no 12-month 
test data will be considered a success. 
4) Break-even :  If the study endpoint is met using the best-case methodology and is not met 
using the worst-case methodology, a break-even analysis will be performed to determine the 
number of subjects with missing endpoint data who would be required to be a success in order

to meet the endpoint. 
 
All secondary endpoints for LAA exclusion will utilize the LOCF method for missing values. No 
missing values will be imputed for the remaining secondary endpoints.  If a subject is missing a value for one of these secondary endpoints, they will not be included in the analysis of that endpoint.  The number of patients with non-missing values will be reported for each endpoint.  9.10 Site and Subgroup Heterogeneity 
Primary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be reported by [CONTACT_3725], by [CONTACT_547], and by 
[CONTACT_911289] (longstanding vs. non-longstanding). In addition, logistic regression models will be utilized to test for statistically significant differences in the endpoints due to site regions (US and OUS),  gender, and classification of persistent AF (longstanding vs. non-longstanding), while also adjusting for age, BMI, baseline comorbid conditions, LVEF, total length 
of AF, and number of previous catheter ablations. P-values will be reported for each covariate 
and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be reported for gender and for classification of persistent AF.   This overall goal of this study is to show sa fety and effectiveness in a representative population 
of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and thus it is not powered for separate analysis of individual subpopulations.  
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS RF ablation using bipolar energy applied epi[INVESTIGATOR_911185] 10 years and the risks are well understood. More recently standalone (or sole therapy) surgical ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation has been reported by [CONTACT_911290], and with varying degrees of effectiveness (depending on the lesion set, procedure, and subject population).  Risks and benefits to the subjects are described 
in the Clinical Risk/Benefit Analysis (Appendix 4).  Adverse Event Definitions  are found in 
Appendix 5. 
10.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event: 
Adverse Event (AE): any undesirable clinical occurrence or change from patient’s baseline (or 
pre-device procedure) condition, whether it is considered device related or not. Adverse Event Identification: a condition that is one of the following: 
a) A unique symptom or event that is a change from the subject’s baseline status 
b) A series of symptoms or events that can be categorized as a single entity based on 
definitions found herein 
c) A specific diagnosis responsible for a clinical change d) A worsening or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition 
 
Serious Adverse Event: Serious Adverse Event (SAE): any adverse event is considered serious if it results in death, is life threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), results in disability or permanent 
damage, causes congenital anomaly/birth defect, r equires intervention to prevent impairment or 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280022]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
damage, or other serious (important medical events) which may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. 
 
Note: “Death” should not be reported as an adverse event.  The cause of death should be reported 
as an adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown. 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life-threatening problem or death caused by, 
or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects [21 CFR part 812.3(s)].  
Pre-existing Condition vs. Adverse Event:  
A pre-existing condition is defined as a medical condition that is present before treatment 
(treatment being defined as induction of anesthesia) and is to be reported as part of the subject’s medical history.  It must be reported as a new AE if the intensity, frequency, or the character of the condition worsens during the study treatment and the AE was determined to have the 
relationship to the study procedures and/or study devices. 
 To avoid confusing pre-existing conditions with AEs during data analysis, the study sites must make all attempts to provide start dates for all baseline medical conditions. Any pre-existing condition that now meets the stated criteria as an AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF as an exacerbation of the pre-existing condition and the start date will be recorded as the time when the 
exacerbation occurred. 
10.2 Events Expected to Occur with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911186], the following events are not considered reportable (recorded on eCRF) 
because they are normally expected to occur in conjunction with treatment for persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation procedures, or are associated with customary, standard care of patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery or catheter ablation procedures. 
 Chest pain without associated enzyme/ECG changes 
 Post-operative pain/post-procedure pain 
 Post-anesthesia emesis, nausea, or headache (within 48 hours of procedure) 
 Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following procedure, even if requiring 
correction 
 Low grade temperature increase (≤  101°F or 38.5°C) 
 Dizziness: Imprecise term commonly used to describe various symptoms such as 
faintness, giddiness, imbalance, li ghtheadedness, unsteadiness or vertigo 
 Elevated White Blood Count, outside the standard laboratory normal value, without signs 
and symptoms of infection 
 Post-Operative/post-procedure hematocrit dec rease from baseline measured in the OR, 
prior to the first incision, not associated with hemodynamic changes, remaining above 25% and requiring < 2 units PRBC’s 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280023]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 Minor, localized tenderness, swelling, induration, oozing, etc. at surgical site or catheter 
insertion site 
 Sinus bradycardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention 
 Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention 
 Thrombocytopenia: does not become an AE until treatment is administered 
 Atelectasis: collapse of lung tissue affecting par t or all of one lung; the alveoli are deflated. 
This is not considered to be an AE unless treatment other than Chest PT is required or it 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – Note: this event is expected for surgical procedure only 
 Hyperglycemia: The use of insulin in the post op period does not constitute hyperglycemia 
if during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  An elevated blood sugar of less than 250 mg/dl during the first [ADDRESS_1280024] op does not constitute hyperglycemia 
 Pleural effusion unless treatment with thoracentesis or chest tube insertion is required – 
Note: this event is expected for surgical procedure only 
 Pericardial effusion without hemodynamic compromise or treatment 
 Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter / Atrial Tachycardia with or without cardioversion 
 Junctional Rhythm requiring temporary pacing 
Note:  Subjects will undergo general anesthesia and therefore will also be subject to general anesthesia-associated complications and morbidity. These are also not considered reportable (recorded on eCRF) adverse events. 
 Pre-planned Surgical Procedures 
Any pre-planned surgical procedures at the time of informed consent will not be considered reportable (recorded on eCRF) (whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911187]).  Any blood transfusions during preplanned operative procedure are not considered reportable adverse 
events. 
Note: This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the Investigator / investigational site for the purpose of adverse event reporting.  The Investigator should utilize his/her own clinical judgment in evaluating adverse experiences and may decide that the above events should be reported as adverse events. 
10.3 Adverse Event Classification The Investigator is required to provide: 
 Time interval of the event; 
 Date of event onset and outcome of the event, or date of death; 
 Severity of the event; 
 Action taken for the medical management of the event; 
 Relationship of the event; and 
 Indication of whether the event is serious. 
 
Time Interval of Adverse Event 
The time interval of the occurrence of the adverse should be assessed in relationship to timing of 
the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911188].  Severity of Adverse Events  
The intensity of an AE should be assessed.  A change in severity may constitute a new reportable AE. The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each adverse event: 
 MILD:  Awareness of experience, but easily tolerated. No medical intervention required. 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280025]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 MODERATE:   Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activities. Medical intervention 
required. 
 SEVERE:   Inability to carry out usual activities. Medical intervention (including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]) required. 
10.4 Relationship of Adverse Events  
It is the PIs responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE.  Adverse events will be assigned 
an attribution according to the Investigator’s best judgement of primary cause.  Events will be categorized by [CONTACT_911291] (ASU2, ASU3, ASB2, EMR2, EML2, 
MAX5, MCR1, MLP1), or the AtriClip (PRO1 or PRO2), procedure [ablation procedure (epi[INVESTIGATOR_371531]) or general cardiac surgical procedure, subsequent intervention], concomitant 
medications, pre-existing condition, intercurrent condition, intercurrent intervention, or unknown.  
 Device Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event, which in the judgment of the Investigator, 
results from use of the AtriCure Bipolar System, the AtriClip or the endocardial ablation devices.  
Procedure Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event which, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
results as a consequence of the procedure (epi[INVESTIGATOR_911189], subsequent intervention) and is not specifically related to the use of the AtriCure Bipolar System.  
Concomitant Medication-Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event is considered to be 
concomitant medication related when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it is reasonable to 
believe that the event is associated with concomitant medications used in conjunction with the investigational device and is not otherwise specific to the investigational device (e.g. bleeding associated with anticoagulation medication).  
Pre-Existing Condition-Related Adverse Event :  An adverse event is considered to be related 
to a pre-existing condition when, in the judgment of the Investigator, it is reasonable to believe 
that the event is associated with the subject’s pre-existing condition and is not specific to the investigational device, ablation procedure, or general cardiac surgical procedure. Pre-existing conditions that are aggravated or become more severe during or after the procedure should be 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if the event may be more appropriately classified 
as device-, ablation procedure-, or general cardiac surgical procedure-related.  Intercurrent Condition : It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated with an 
intercurrent condition/co-morbidity.  
Intercurrent Intervention: It is reasonable to believe that the event is directly associated with an 
intercurrent intervention which was performed for reasons other than to address a device or 
ablation/general cardiac surgical procedure related complication.  Unknown  – A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that cannot be determined to 
be related or unrelated to Investigational devices/procedure/drug given information.Reasonable 
justification need to be provided. 
 The following definition should be used in determining the relationship of an adverse event: 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280026]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
 Related  – A clinical event (including abnormal result) that presents a known or suspected 
relationship between the following categories and the event.   
o investigational devices (ASU2, ASU3, ASB2, EMR2, EML2, MAX5, MCR1, MLP1), or 
the AtriClip (PRO1 or PRO2);  
o procedure (ablation procedure, epi[INVESTIGATOR_371531]) or general cardiac surgical 
procedure, or subsequent intervention  
o concomitant medications, pre-existing condition, intercurrent condition, intercurrent 
intervention, or other.  
10.5 Reporting Procedures For Adverse Events 
10.5.1 General Reporting Requirements - Non-Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator (or designee) will record all AEs (both serious and non-serious and regardless 
of relationship) in the source documents.  AEs will be reported on the eCRF (except those in 
Section 10.2 as described) from the time of treatment (induction of anesthesia) through Visit 11.  
Only the AEs listed to be collected (Section 10.5.2) in the annual visits (2–5-year visits) will be 
reported on the eCRF.  Prior to induction of anesthesia , any events will be considered patient medical history.  Standard medical terminology should be used when recording AEs.  The information as described in 10.[ADDRESS_1280027] also be adhered to by [CONTACT_737]: 
 Use separate Adverse Event Form to document each series of events. 
 The Adverse Event Form must be electronically signed by [CONTACT_253374]-
Investigator (if applicable). 
 It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of SAEs as required by [CONTACT_162500]/EC procedures and in conformance with FDA requirements. 
Note: It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of non-serious adverse events, 
as required by [CONTACT_911292]. 
10.5.2 Reporting Requirements – Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Events 
Serious and any unanticipated adverse events up to Visit 11 ([ADDRESS_1280028] endocardial 
procedure) must be reported by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) by [CONTACT_911293], within [ADDRESS_1280029] treatment (induction of anesthesia) through Visit [ADDRESS_1280030] Exit, SAEs are reported on 
the eCRF if they are any of the following: death (regardless of cause), stroke, transient ischemic 
attack (TIA), myocardial infarction (MI), pul monary or systemic embolism, permanent pacemaker 
implantation, device related, procedure related, or UADE.  
In the event of system outages or technical difficulties, serious and any unanticipated 
adverse events may be submitted via e-mail to [EMAIL_3531].  Upon 
availability of the system or resolution of the technical difficulties, the event will be recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 The Investigator (or designee) shall send a written report including a narrative description of the 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280031]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
serious and/or unanticipated adverse event to AtriCure or their designee within three (3) working 
days of the initial report.  The Investigator should follow all unresolved serious adverse events 
until the events are resolved, or the subject has exited the study, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  AtriCure, Inc., or their designee, in cooperation with the Investigator, will assess all serious adverse events considered device-related for potential reportability to the FDA as an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) in accordance with 21 CFR Part 812.46(b). If a 
UADE determination is made, the Investigator and Sponsor will comply with UADE reporting 
requirements per 21 CFR Part 812.150.  The Sponsor shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs/ECs and participating Investigators within ten (10) working days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the UADE.  Thereafter the Sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA requests.  Similarly, the Investigator shall submit 
to their reviewing IRB a report of any UADE as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten 
(10) working days (or per local IRB requirements) after the Investigator first learns of the effect.  The Investigator (or designee) shall provide documentation of the UADE report/notification sent to their IRB to AtriCure (or designee). 
Note: It is also the responsibility of the Invest igator to inform their IRB of other SAEs (i.e., 
non-UADEs) as required by [CONTACT_11577]/EC procedures and in conformance with FDA requirements.  
 If the subject reports any adverse events that are potentially serious during the follow-up 
evaluation period, the subject should return to the investigator’s facility for further evaluation of the event. 
 Note:  If the subject exhibits symptoms s uggestive of pulmonary vein stenosis, CT/MR 
imaging should be performed. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_1280032] Death and Atrio-esophageal Fistula 
The investigator (or designee) must report any reported death (determined to be device or 
procedure related) and/or atrio-esophageal fistula during conduct of this study to the sponsor, 
within [ADDRESS_1280033] electronically sign the electroni c adverse event form. A copy of medical records, 
supporting documents (CT scans, ECGs, consult records), death records, death certificates and an autopsy report (if performed) are required to be sent to the AtriCure or designee within 10 days following the death.  
 
Any reported death (determined to be device or procedure related) and atrio-esophageal fistula during the conduct of this study, will be reported to the FDA within [ADDRESS_1280034] deaths (determined to be device or procedure related and atrio-esophageal 
fistula must be reported to the IRB/EC in accordance with IRB/EC requirements.

11.0 STUDY OVERSIGHT  
11.1 Independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) Adjudication 
An independent, non-investigator, clinical events committee comprised of practicing 
cardiothoracic surgeon, electrophysiologist, and neurologist will act as physician adjudicator(s) under the direction of AtriCure, Inc.  This physician(s) will be responsible for the review and validation of reported adverse events that occur over the course of the study per the Independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) Charter.  The  clinical events committee adjudicator(s) shall 
classify each of these adverse events based on severity and association to the device and/or procedure.  During the review of the events, the physician(s) shall be blinded to the clinical site as much as possible.  A Clinical Events Co mmittee (CEC) Charter will be developed prior to the 
start of study enrollment.  The CEC Charter shall include consistent definitions for each type of event and shall outline the review process. 
 
SAEs will be submitted for adjudication up to 12 months (Visit 11), after the patient has had their endocardial procedure.  In addition, non-serious AEs occurring within [ADDRESS_1280046] (DSMB) The DSMB will be assembled prior to subject enrollment.  The DSMB will be compromised of

biostatistician who are not investigators in the study.  The membership of the committee shall 
remain anonymous to the investigational sites to reduce any potential bias. 
In the safety monitoring role, prior to enrollment of any subjects, the DSMB will establish a charter 
including a mission statement, operating procedures, and proposed monitoring criteria for the study, including any required interim analysis time points for assessing safety and proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  The specific stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911195].  Written minutes of all m eetings shall be developed after each DSMB meeting 
and major conclusions shall be documented.  Meeting summaries shall be included in reports to the IRBs/ECs as appropriate.

An independent ECG core laboratory will be utilized for assessment of the following data collected on subjects. All data submitted to the core laboratory will be reviewed and the core laboratory will interpret the reading.  
 Visit 10 and Visit 11: ECG collected at follow-up study visits 
 Visit 10 and Visit 11: Continuous ECG monitoring recordings (Holter or ZioTM Patch) 
 Visit 10 thru Visit 11: Symptom driven monitoring 
All ECG monitoring shall be performed in accordance with the core laboratory’s recommended protocol which is provided to the sites in the Study Reference Manual.  Imaging Core Laboratory 
Left Atrial Appendage: An independent core laboratory will be utilized for assessment of the 
complete exclusion of the LAA defined by [CONTACT_911225] (<3 mm residual communication with LAA and < 10mm residual pocket) between the LA and LAA. Images to be sent by [CONTACT_911297]:  
 Visit 5: (TEE) Endocardial Procedure Visit 
 Visit 11: (CT/CTA/MRI) 12-month post Endocardial Procedure Visit.    
 Pulmonary Veins: If a subject exhibits symptom s suggestive of pulmonary vein stenosis, the 
baseline and subsequent CT/MR imaging will be submitted by [CONTACT_911298].   
 Images sent to core lab (as applicable) for Visit 4, Visit 10, Visit 11 
Consistent with the recommendation from the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus 
Statement in Surgical and Catheter Ablation of AF, PV stenosis is categorized as mild < 50%, 
moderate 50-70% and severe ≥ 70% reduction in the diameter of a PV or PV branch. 
 Esophagoscopy Core Laboratory Esophagoscopy (EGD): An independent core laboratory will be utilized for adjudication of any 
esophageal injuries discovered on the post epi[INVESTIGATOR_911196].  All data submitted to the 
core laboratory will be reviewed and the core laboratory will provide adjudication. An esophagoscopy at Visit [ADDRESS_1280048] reports, images, data and relevant documents will be

APPENDIX 1 – CORONARY ANOMALIES 
 
Congenital coronary abnormalities of significance may occur in association with other congenital 
abnormalities (e.g. supravalvular aortic stenosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, dextro-transposition of the 
great vessels).  Isolated congenital coronary artery anomalies of ectopic arterial origin, course and distribution are uncommon. Examples include anomalous origin of le ft coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, 
coronary artery fistula to any of the four cardiac chambers or great vessels, anomalous origin of 
a coronary artery from the contralateral sinus of valsalva with traversing of the vessel of the vessel 
across the base of the heart by [CONTACT_911299], posterior to, or between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  Derivation of the entire coronar y circulation from a single ostium is a rare 
coronary anomaly. In this case too, one or more components of the coronary circulation must pass across the base of the heart by [CONTACT_911299], posterior to, or in between the aorta and 
pulmonary artery.  
 An intra-atrial myocardial or intra-cavitary anomalous course of the right coronary artery in the right atrium is has been reported. Report of an intra-atrial myocardial or intra-cavitary anomalous course of the left coronary in the left atrium has not been identified. 
 
Observation has been noted in a patient with an anomalous course of the left coronary artery originating from the left sinus of valsalva but coursing posterior away from the pulmonary artery trunk and out onto the roof of the left atrium.  The atypi[INVESTIGATOR_911201].  This anomalous course of the left coronary artery on the roof of the left atrium was problematic in that the course of the artery traversed the usual location of the left atrial roof radiofrequency 
ablation line of the thoracoscopic atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. 
 To identify patients with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_911202], the following is a standardized pre-intervention evaluation recommended in all patients: 
1) All patients in whom catheter-based endocardi al ablation or surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_911203] a standard CTA with contrast and 6mm cuts for definition of pulmonary vein anatomy. 
2) In addition, post-processing imaging with 0.2mm cuts is performed for better definition of 
coronary anatomy. 
3) Radiologic interpretation includes specific mention and description of origin and course of 
coronary arteries.

 Persistent  = is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond seven days but no more 
than one year, or lasting greater than 48 hours and less than seven days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. 
 Physician’s note indicating continuous AF ≥ 7 days but no more than one year, or AF 
lasting > 48 hours and < 7 days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical 
cardioversion; AND 
 Two electrocardiograms from any form of rhythm monitoring (e.g., 12-lead ECG, Holter, event monitor, Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR), Pacemaker etc.) documenting continuous AF, with electrocardiograms taken at least 7 days apart, for subjects with sustained AF ≥ 7 days.   
 
 Longstanding Persistent  = is defined as continuous AF of greater than one year duration. 
 Physician’s note indicating continuous AF > one year; AND 
 24-hour Holter or other form of continuous rhythm monitoring (e.g., event monitor, Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR), pacemaker etc.) obtained within 90 days prior to the 
index procedure showing continuous AF.   
Note: If subject does not have continuous AF documentation before consent, it can be 
obtained during the screening period to ensure accurate classification. 
Note: The performance of a successful cardioversion (sinus rhythm ≥ 30 seconds) within 
12 months of an ablation procedure with documented early recurrence of AF within 30 
days should not alter the classification of AF as Longstanding Persistent. _________________________                           _________________________

APPENDIX 3 – INVESTIGAT OR TRAINING PLAN 
 
Investigator Selection  
AtriCure will select investigators who are qualified by [CONTACT_911302] 21 
CFR 812.43(a).  In order to be considered for participation in this study the surgeon must be proficient in the MIS/TT cardiac surgical ablation procedure and EPs must be proficient in trans-septal approach for ablation of cardiac arrhythmia.  Investigator Training Program 
The DEEP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911205] a Cardiothoracic Surgeon (CTS) and an Electrophysiologist (EP) to complete separate procedures, approximately 91-[ADDRESS_1280066] be completed prior to treatment of subjects in the study at their site.  The objective of the Investigator Training Program  will be to familiarize all DEEP Investigators 
(Surgeon and EPs) on the DEEP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911206] (including the operation and use of 
investigational devices) and the study protocol.  Surgeons will also receive specialized surgical procedure training to ensure they are accomplished on all aspects of the protocol specific surgical procedure.  This training program will ensure standardization of surgical techniques for the creation of the DEEP lesion set, an understanding of the principals of EP mappi[INVESTIGATOR_911207].  
A two-phase training program will be conducted.  Any Surgeon or EP Instructors utilized in the 
Moderated Phase (Phase II) of the training program will have recognized and documented expertise in the hybrid (surgical/EP) approach for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and the management of patients who have undergone a hybrid procedure.  
Phase I 
Surgeon - Self Paced Training Course 
Surgeons will complete a self-paced training course.  The course will consist of a review of the protocol and the DEEP Physician Guidebook, which is a consolidated description of the procedural aspects of the hybrid epi[INVESTIGATOR_911208] a concentration on dissection and mobilization techniques.  The surgeon will also review a 
video compi[INVESTIGATOR_911209].  Completion of Phase I will 
be documented (DEEP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911210]).   EP – Self Paced Training Course EPs will complete a self-paced training course using the DEEP Physician Guidebook.  The 
course will consist of a review of the protocol, published literature review and a video compi[INVESTIGATOR_911211] (i.e., the lesion set).  Completion of Phase I will be documented (DEEP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911210]).   
Phase II 
Surgeon - Moderated Training Course  
The surgeons will participate in a Moderated Training Course.  The didactic training session will 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280067]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021

be presented with site initiation and will include: 
 Review of the disease state (Persistent & Longstanding Persistent AF) 
 Operation/Instructions for Use of Investigational Product 
 Details of the procedure (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911212]) 
 Indicators of Procedural success 
 Pre- and Post-operative patient care and rhythm status follow-up 
 Discussion of best practices for MIS/TT cardiac ablation and the DEEP approach including 
operative complications (prevention, recognition and management), post-operative 
subject management and recognition and management of clinical scenarios associated with DEEP. 
 
EP - Moderated Training Course 
The EPs will participate in in a Moderated Training Course after the completion of Phase I.  The didactic training session will be presented with site initiation and will include: 
 Review of the disease state (Persistent & Longstanding Persistent) 
 Details of the procedure (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911212]) 
 Indicators of Procedural Success 
 Pre- and Post-procedure patient care and rhythm status follow-up 
 Discussion of best practices of the DEEP approach including operative complications 
(prevention, recognition and management), post-procedure subject management and 
recognition and management of clinical scenarios associated with DEEP. 
Completion of Training 
Investigators will not be permitted to begin treatment of subjects until they have completed both 
phases of the training program and have completed the DEEP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_911210].  Investigators who have substantial experience in the hybrid approach to the treatment of AF and are serving as investigator instructors may begin treating subjects without undergoing investigator training.  All investigators, regardless of experience, must participate in the protocol and study specific training provided at the Site Initiation Visit and/or 
Investigators Meetings as described in the study protocol.
 
 
Initial Study Subject Procedures 
During all initial Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911213] a site, a clinical and/or technical expert 
from AtriCure will be present in the operating room.  For investigators who have not had 
substantial prior experience with MIS/TT surgical cardiac ablation (greater than 15 cases in the 
preceding 12-month period from site initiation), a proctor will also be present during the initial surgical study procedure.  The proctor will be a qualified surgeon who has served as an instructor in the Investigator Training Program or is experienced in the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911214].

APPENDIX 5 – ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS 
 
BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS 
 Anemia : Hematocrit below 25%. 
 Coagulopathy: Bleeding in the presence with abnormal clotting studies.  Hemodilutional Anemia : Anemia associated with fluid volume overload as a result of 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476].  HIT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia): Low blood platelet count as a result of the 
medication heparin. Must have lab evidence of HIT +.  
Leukopenia: Leukopenia is defined as leukocyte count of < 3.5 x10
9/liter for more than 3 days. 
 
Neutropenia: Neutropenia is defined as ANC <1000 per mm3 for more than 3 days. 
 Thrombocytopenia: A persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets. This is not 
considered to be an AE until treated.  
CARDIAC DISORDERS  
Arrhythmias (other than Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter or Atrial Tachycardia) 
Bradycardia : Abnormally low heart rate (<60 bpm) requiring treatment (implantation of a 
temporary or permanent pacemaker, or medication). 
 
SVT: Tachycardia in which QRS is narrow and P waves are present and associated. In certain 
SVT’s the QRS may be wide (>120msec) when it is aberrant and in some the P wave may be invisible as it maybe superimposed on the QRS (AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia).  
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) : A regular heart rhythm originating from the ventricle with a 
frequency of 160 to 200 beats per minute that requires intervention. 
 Ventricular fibrillation (VF): A rapid irregular ventricular rhythm due to multiple reentrant 
activities associated with essentially zero cardiac output.  
Atrioventricular (AV) Block 2
nd degree: Second-degree (AV) block is characterized by 
[CONTACT_911304]. This may take the form of progressive 
prolongation of the P-R interval until there is a nonconducted beat with no QRS (Mobitz I or Wenckebach) or intermittent non-conducted P waves without preceding prolongation of the P-R interval or subsequent shortening of the interval (Mobitz II). This excludes block due to premature 
atrial beats. 
 3
rd degree: Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) exists when more P waves than the 
QRS complexes exist, and no relationship exists between them (no conduction).  Angina: A tight or heavy feeling in the chest, discomfort which spreads from the chest to the arm, 
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280075]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
back, neck, jaw, or stomach, numbness or tingling in the shoulders, arms or wrists, shortness of 
breath, and nausea. 
 
Atrial thrombus: Thrombus formation or detection within the atrium. 
 Cardiac Arrest: Absent or inadequate contraction of the left ventricle of the heart that immediately 
causes body wide circulatory failure.  
Cardiac Tamponade (Pericardial effusion) : Defined as the development of a significant 
pericardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an AF ablation procedure. A significant 
pericardial effusion is one which results in hemodynamic compromise and requires elective or urgent pericardiocentesis. A pericardial effusion of 1 cm or more (by [CONTACT_51541]) will also be considered a significant pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion  should also be classified as 
“early” or “late” depending on whether it is diagnosed during or following initial discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Documentation of CT Scan/MRI/ECHO findings and subsequent treatment such as 
thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis. 
Cardiogenic Shock : Patient exhibits cardiogenic shock (systolic pressure < 80mm Hg and 
PCWP > 20mm Hg or cardiac index <1.8 liters/minute/m
2 or intra-aortic balloon pump or 
intravenous inotropes are needed to maintain a systolic pressure>80 mm Hg) for any time within 24 hours prior to index procedure. 
 
Congestive Heart Failure: Documentation of one of the following: 
 Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) 
 Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to heart failure 
 Elevated PCW with associated SOB or x-ray consistent with congestion. 
 
May be related to fluid overload in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease.   
 Heart Failure: A clinical syndrome resulting from a cardiac disease which comprises ventricular 
systolic or diastolic function or both. Heart failure results when the heart is unable to generate a cardiac output sufficient to meet the demands of the body without unduly increasing diastolic 
pressure. Heart failure may be manifested by [CONTACT_179231] (i.e., 
fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, confusion) or by [CONTACT_179232] (e.g., dyspnea, chest rales, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, distended neck veins, congested liver, peripheral edema). We will not distinguish between congestive and chronic heart failure for purposes of this protocol.  
Myocardial Infarction: 
The diagnosis requires at least one of the following: 1. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_911217]/or fall of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis with at least one of the following: 
a) Ischemic symptoms 
b) Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG 
c) ECG changes indicative of ischemia  (ST segment elevation or depression) 
d) Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion 
abnormality; and/or 
2. Pathological findings of an acute myocardial infarction.  
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280076]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
Myocardial Infarction in the context of catheter or surgical AF Ablation : The 
presence of any one of the following criteria:  
1. Detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST-T changes or new LBBB), 
which may persist for more than one hour;  
2. Development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG;   
3. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall abnormality  
 Pericardial effusion/bleeding: Fluid detected in the pericardial space by [CONTACT_179233] (e.g., echocardiography) with hemodynamic compromise and requiring treatment with pericardiocentesis. 
 
Pericarditis : Irritation or inflammation of the pericardium associated with pain on inspi[INVESTIGATOR_179175]. Clinical signs may include shallow respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pericardial friction rub and ECG changes (ST elevation across the precordial leads).  
Sick sinus syndrome : also called sinus node dysfunction, is a group of abnormal heart rhythms 
(arrhythmia) presumably caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary 
pacemaker.  Unstable Angina : Angina which increases in frequency, intensity, or duration, which occurs at 
rest, or which is new in onset. Unstable angina is a syndrome that is intermediate between stable angina and myocardial infarction: it is characterized by [CONTACT_137914] "crescendo" pattern of chest pain that lasts longer than instable angina, occurs at rest or with less exertion than instable angina, or is less responsive to medication.  Unstable angina and myocardial infarction are considered acute coronary syndromes.  
GASTROINTESTINAL/GENITOURINARY DEFINITIONS 
 
Atrioesophageal Fistula: A connection between the atrium and the lumen of the esophagus. Evidence supporting this diagnosis includes documentation of esophageal erosion combined with evidence of a fistulous connection to the atrium su ch as an air emboli, an embolic event, or direct 
observation at the time of surgical repair.  A CT scan or MRI scan are the most common methods of documentation of an atrial esophageal fistula.  An esophagoscopy should NOT be performed as it may result in air insufflation into the left Atrium.  Aortoesophageal Fistula : Abnormal passage from aorta communicating with the esophagus (for 
the purposes of the protocol - likely resu lting from an esophageal perforation or burn). 
Presentation of aortoesophageal fistula may include hematemesis (possibly massive). Diagnosis may be obtained with a contrast CT scan, aortography, esophagoscopy, or barium swallow.  A possible outcome of aortoesophageal fistula is sepsis, which may be diagnosed with blood cultures.  
Esophageal Dyskinesia : diffuse spasms of the esophagus which may occur as the result of 
vagal nerve injury  
Esophageal Injury : Any evidence of a mild complication such as erosion or ulceration or a major 
complication such as puncture, dissection, or perforation to the esophagus.   
 
Study Number: CP2014-[ADDRESS_1280077]: Clinical Study Protocol  Dated 11May2021 
Rev: H   
 
Gastric Motility Disorders : multiple gastric disorders may occur post AF ablation such as 
constipation, atony, weight loss, early satiety, diarrhea or GI disturbance.  
Gastroparesis: delayed gastric emptying resulting in paresis of the stomach.  As the vagus 
nerve controls the contractions of the stomach, this may occur when the vagus nerve is 
damaged, and the muscles of the stomach and intestines do not work normally.  
GI Bleed : Detection of frank blood or hemoglobin in the stool which requires medical intervention 
including but not limited to transfusion, medication, surgical intervention, prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210], or re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Renal Complications: 
Renal Failure: Inability of the kidneys to filter toxins resulting in a serum creatinine 
increase to > 2.0 mg/dl and one of the following: 
 increase of 2.0 mg/dl in serum creatinine over any previous value 
 50% or greater increase in creatinine over baseline procedural value 
 requirement for dialysis 
 
Renal Insufficiency: An increase in serum creatinine of ≥1.0 mg/dl over previous value. 
 Renal failure that requires dialysis: a significant decrease in renal function requiring dialysis. 
 
Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage: Bleeding into the retroperitoneum characterized by [CONTACT_911305], decreasing hemoglobin, abdominal distention, peritoneal signs, flank and/or hip pain, and increasing bruising.

made with fluoroscopy in which a quick “sniff” (i.e., patient inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) results in observation of 
paradoxical elevation of the ipsilateral diaphragm.  Often causes shortness of breath on activity. 
 
Hemoptysis: A cough that produces bloody sputum. 
 Pleural Effusion : Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space evidenced by x-ray, 
echocardiography, CT Scan or other appropriate diagnostic technique and which requires drainage. 
 
Pneumothorax: Air in the thoracic cavity associated with partial collapse of a lung with chest tube 
drainage required.  Pulmonary Edema: Pulmonary edema is present if there is fluid accumulation in the lungs 
caused by [CONTACT_137908]. This condition must be confirmed by [CONTACT_911307].  Pulmonary Embolism : Pulmonary embolism diagnosed by [CONTACT_179240] V/Q scan or angiogram 
or spi[INVESTIGATOR_783774]. 
 Pulmonary Hypertension : Patient has mean pulmonary artery pressure that is greater than [ADDRESS_1280086] and/or greater than 30 mmHg during exercise as measured by [CONTACT_137910].  
Pulmonary vein stenosis: Defined as 70% diameter stenosis of one pulmonary vein or 50% 
diameter stenosis of more than one vessel. PV stenosis is manifest as dyspnea at rest, may be associated with hemoptysis and must be confirmed by [CONTACT_137911] (using CT or MRI).  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]: Need for mechanical ventilation beyond 48 hours of completion of surgical 
procedure(s), or the need for re-intubation and ventilator support occurring at any time within 30 
days of the surgical procedure, outside the setting of an additional operation.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448] : Deterioration of patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_141105]. 
 
VASCULAR DEFINITIONS 
 Atrial Embolism : Angiographic evidence of embolic occlusion in any arterial distribution. 
 
Arterial Occlusion/Thrombosis at Access Site : Angiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of 
occlusion at the access site, 
 Arteriovenous Fistula: A traumatic communication between an artery and vein documented by [CONTACT_911308]-Operative Excessive Bleeding : Defined as [ADDRESS_1280087]-index surgical procedure.

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) : Angiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of thromboembolic 
occlusion in the lower extremities.   
 Embolism (including air emboli and thromboemboli) : The blockage of an artery by [CONTACT_179242], which can include a thrombus or an air bubble.  
Hematoma: Development of a collection of blood > 5 cm’s under the skin requiring compression 
or additional treatment to resolve.  Hemorrhage: Any bleeding which results in a drop in hematocrit from pre-procedure level of 
greater than or equal to 6 points (2 grams of HGB) or a Hct < 30, or blood loss that requires 
transfusion or results in substantial hemodynamic compromise requiring treatment. Hemorrhage 
will be considered serious if it requires > 2 units of blood in a 24-hour period or results in hemodynamic compromise.   Hypertension: Systolic BP > 140 mmHg, or diastolic > 90 mmHg, or requiring specific medical 
therapy.  Hypotension: Any prolonged systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg associated with symptoms and 
requiring intravenous vasopressor medications.  
Limb Ischemia : Limb ischemia is manifested by [CONTACT_137905], associated with non-
healing wounds and gangrene. Limb ischemia should be confirmed by [CONTACT_179243]. 
 Peripheral Ischemia: Deficient supply of blood to the blood vessels outside the heart and brain that is due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood.  
Post-Operative Late Bleeding : Hemorrhage requiring > 2 units beginning 48 hours after 
procedure through 30 days and attributed to index procedure. 
 Procedural Bleeding : Bleeding occurring during the procedure requiring 3 or more units of blood 
transfused, beginning within the operating room and ending 48 hours after the procedure 
(attributed to index procedure). 
 Thromboembolism: Formation of a thrombus (masses composed of insoluble fibrin, deposited platelets, accumulating WBCs, and entrapped RBCs) that obstructs vascular blood flow locally 
and detaches and embolizes to occlude blood flow downstream. Diagnostic confirmation should 
be made with angiography or ultrasound. 
 Thrombophlebitis: Inflammation of a vein with formation of a thrombus. 
 Thrombus : Blood clot that obstructs a blood vessel.

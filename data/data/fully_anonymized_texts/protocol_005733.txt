the small trials where women were  randomized to labor induction or expectant management.  Thus, 
whether labor induction at 39 weeks of gestation modifies maternal and  perinatal outcomes, compared 
with expectant management, remains unknown.  
This protocol describes a randomized trial of 6000 women to assess whether a policy of elective  induction 
of labor at 39 weeks of gestation compared with  expectant management will improve outcomes.  
1.2 Primary Hypothes is 
Among nulliparous women with singleton uncomplicated term pregnancies, elective induction of labor at 
39 weeks, compared with expectant management, reduces the risk of severe neonatal morbidity and 
perinatal m ortality . 
1.3 Purpose of the S tudy Protocol  
This protocol describes the background, design and organization of the randomized clinical trial and may 
be viewed as a written agreement among the study investigators.  The Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) and the Network Advisory Board review the protocol.  Before recruitment begins, 
the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_22443] (NICHD) Maternal -Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network Steering Committee,  and the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each clinical center.  Any changes to the protocol during the study period require the approval of the Steering Committee and the IRBs; major changes also require the approval of the DSMC.  
A manual of operations supplements the protocol with detailed specifications of the study procedures.  
[ADDRESS_1270467] dates pregnancy, defined as a gestation that persists beyond 294 days or 42 weeks’ gestation, is 
associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality.[ADDRESS_1270468] suggested that a policy of induction of labor at 41 
weeks can improve pregnancy outcomes.  In 2006 a Cochrane review was conducted of all trials in which 
women were randomized to induction of labor at 41- 42 weeks or expectant management with fetal 
surveillance (including the MFMU Network’s trial).  The investigators found that a policy of induction of 
labor at or beyond 41 completed weeks was associated with fewer (all -cause) perinatal deaths (RR 0.3 
95% CI 0.09, 0.99), with no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the cesarean section rate for women in the induction group (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.76, 1.12).
[ADDRESS_1270469] of these studies examined maternal complications in 
multivariable models and found that gestational age beyond 39 weeks was predictive of increased risk 
even when controlling for known confounders such as maternal age, ethnicity, education, parity, length of 
labor, induction, and birth weight .

Statistical significance compared with  rate of outcome in the previous week gestation: * p<.01 , ** p<.[ADDRESS_1270470] also demonstrated that the rates of adverse neonatal outcomes are increased in pregnancies 
that extend beyond 39 weeks.4,6  In a study of singleton deliveries in Scotland between 1985 and 1996, 
Smith showed that the risk of perinatal death (stillbirth or neonatal deat h) nad irs at 39 weeks.8  In a study 
of deliveries registered in an area of London, the rate of stillbirth increased progressively with advancing 
gestation from 37 to 43 weeks.10  Abnormal neonatal acid- base status has been shown to increase in 
pregnancies delivered beyond 39 weeks.6,11   
In a retro specti ve cohort study of singleton, cephalic, low -risk neonates delivered at t erm, Caughey et al . 
concluded that neonatal complications of term pregnancy increase in a continuous , rather than in a 
threshold fashion.  In this cohort the incidence of severe neonat al complications was increased 1.5 -2 fold 
in pregnancies delivered at 40 -41 weeks compared with  those delivered at 39 weeks ( Table 2).6  Other  
investigators reported similar trends in neonatal morbidity for  pregnancies advancing beyond 39 
weeks.7,11,12

In contrast  with  maternal outcomes, there is clear evidence that adverse neonatal outcomes are more 
common when elective delivery is undertaken at term but prior  to [ADDRESS_1270471] amount between 37 -39 weeks (0.7/1000 to 1.4/1000 respectively) , the risk of more 
common adverse events (e.g. , RDS, mechanical ventilation) is increased by a factor of 2 to 12.14,15  
Overall, elective delivery prior to 39 weeks is associated with an increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_905042].  
2.3 Resu lts from MFMU Network Studies  
Secondary analyses of NICHD MFMU Network data are consistent with the findings  above for both 
maternal and neonatal outcomes.  In the MFMU Network trial of fetal pulse oximetry (FOX), a secondary 
analysis of 4086 women found t hat the risks of a composite maternal outcome ( treated uterine atony, 
blood transfusion, or peripartum infection ) and cesarean delivery increased with increasing gestational 
age from 39 to 41 or more completed weeks ( p value for trend < 0.001) .16 
In the Cesarean Registry, a composite outcome of death or adverse neonatal outcome increased from 8% 
to 11.3 % as gestational age increased  from 39 to 41 weeks  in women undergoing elective repeat cesarean 
delivery.14  Also, in the cohort of  women in the FOX trial  referenced above , risks of  a similar composite 
adverse neonatal outcome increased with increasing gestational age after 39 weeks.16 Based on Caughey et  al 2005; severe neonatal complications defined as birth trauma, seizures,  intracranial hemorrhage, 
sepsis, meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1518], respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]

2.4 Potential Risks and Benefits of Planned Elective Induction of Labor before 
41 weeks  
If neonatal risks nadir at approximately 39 weeks, and if the risks of maternal and neonatal complications 
increase monotonically  after 39 weeks, the question arises -  do the risks of pregnancy prolongation 
beyond 39 weeks outweigh the risks of labor induction?  Whereas planned cesarean delivery in the absence of medical or obstetric complications is performed at [ADDRESS_1270473], a number of studies compared outcomes in women undergoing both indicated and elective 
inductions with  those of spontaneously laboring women.20,23-26  By [CONTACT_905076] (e.g., preeclampsia), it is possible that the higher r ates of cesarean delivery 
observed in the induction group were due to the pregnancy complications and not the induction per se.  
Other studies have evaluated elective induction of labor  separately .17,18,21,22,24,27,[ADDRESS_1270474] appropriate one, because women who are induced 
at 39 weeks are not guaranteed the alternative of an immediate spontaneous l abor.  In other words, 
women and their providers cannot choose between elective induction and spontaneous labor, but between elective induction and expectant management.  Expectant management at 39 weeks may result in a 
proximate spontaneous labor but also may result in circumstances (e.g. , preeclampsia, need for labor 
induction at 42 weeks) that increase the risk of cesarean.
[ADDRESS_1270475] with  the prior studies that used spontaneously laboring comparison groups, revealed that elective 
induction at 39 weeks or greater, for either women with a favorable or unfavorable cervix, did not 
increase the cesarean delivery rate.  Specifically, for nulliparas with a favorable cervix ( modified Bishop 
score ≥ 5) the cesarean delivery rate was 21% in the electively induced group vs. 20% in the expectantly  
managed group (p = 0.84).  Similarly there was no significant difference in the cesarean rate for women 
with an unfavorable cervix (43% vs. 34%, p =.16).  This study calls into question the long -standing 
dogma that elective induction of labor prior to [ADDRESS_1270476] had several fundamental methodological flaws.  For e xample, women are often induced 
for indications which themselves may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes; in such 
a case of “confounding by [CONTACT_35151]”, adequate adjustment for the confounding factors may be difficult if 
not impossible.  There is not evidence that elective induction (i.e., an induction without an underlying 
medical or obstetric induction) specifically is associated with adverse long -term neurodevelopmental 
[ADDRESS_1270477] typi[INVESTIGATOR_905043]; this comparison is inappropriate and not clinically relevant,36 as 
spontaneous labor is not a choice but an event.  Indeed, many women who are not “induced” at a given gestational age will ultimately require induction or oxytocin augmentation at a later gestational age, or 
experience an obstetric complication which itself may be associated with a risk of adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcome, a risk that may have been prevented had the women been induced earlier .  
Thus, the clinically meaningful comparison is labor induction versus expectant management.  Yet, there 
are no data that suggest that elective induction compared with expectant management increases the risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders or other adverse long -term outcomes.

Nevertheless, meta- analysis of these data generated by [CONTACT_905077] a reduction in the 
frequency of cesarean section with induction (RR 0.89 ; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97 ).2  Although it did not 
address elective induction, the Hypertension and Pre -eclamp sia Intervention Trial At Term (HYPI[INVESTIGATOR_905044] ), a 
randomized trial comparing induction to expectant management for women with hypertensive disease of 
pregnancy, also demonstrates that labor in duction may not increase the risk of cesarean  (14% in the

3 Study Design  
3.1 Primary Research  Question  
This randomized trial will address the primary research question: does elective induction of labor in 
nulliparous women at 39 weeks improve peri natal  outcome compared with expectant management? 
3.2 Secondary Research Questions  
Secondary research questions this study will address are: 
•Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduce the risk of any of the
maternal outcomes listed in  Section 4.7.2?
•Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks modify the patient- center ed
out
comes listed in section 4.7.2?
•Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduce the risk of any of thefetal and neonatal outcomes listed in section 4.7.3?
•Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks modify the utilization of the
medical resources listed in section 4.7.4?
•Does the proposed effect of elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks var
y
a
ccording to any of the subgroups listed in section  5.5?
3.3 Design Summary  
The study is a randomized controlled multi- center clinical trial of 6000  women at 38 weeks 0 days to 38 
weeks 6 days randomized to one of two  arms at participating MFMU Network clinical centers.

3.4.2 Gestational Age Determination 
Gestational age is determined in the fo llowing manner, and is denoted “project gestational age”.  The 
“project EDC”, which is based on the project gestational age, cannot be revised once a determination  has 
been made.  If the pregnancy is conceived by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -vitro fertilization, project gestational age is calculated 
from the date of embryo transfer and the embryo age at transfer.  If the pregnancy is conceived 
spontaneously (including ovulation induction and artificial insemination ) information from the earliest 
[ADDRESS_1270483] gestational age.  The 
following algorithm i s used:   
•The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) is determined, and a judgment made as t o
w
hether or not the patie nt has a “sure” LMP date.
•If the LMP date is unsure, measurement (s) obtained at the patient’ s first dating ultrasound
examination is  used to determine the project gestational age. The first dating ultrasound must
have been conducted before 14 weeks 0 days by [CONTACT_905078].
•If the LMP  date  is sure, project gestational age is determined by a comparison between th e

research authorization documents, as required by t he HIPAA Privacy Rule, following the guidelines of its 
own institution.  A copy of the signed c onsent form will be provided to the patient.   
Women who are not fluent in English will be enrolled by a person fluent in their language.  Both verbal 
and writte n informed consent and authorization will be obtained in that language; if this is not possible 
the patient will be excluded.  
3.6 Randomization Method 
Randomization for  consenting women will occur at 38 weeks 0 days to 3 8 weeks 6  days  of gestation.  
Consenting women will be assigned to induction of labor at 39 weeks 0 days t o 39 weeks 4 days or 
expectant management in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomization sequence prepared and maintained centrally by [CONTACT_92412] (BCC).   
The simple urn method will be used to generate the randomization sequences because it provides a high 
probability of balance in treatment assignments, it is unpredictable, and it allows an explicit 
randomization analysis to be conducted with re lative ease.

4 Study Procedures  
4.1 Screening for Eligibility  and Consent  
All nulliparous women with a singleton gestation between 34 and 38 weeks are potentially eligible for 
screening.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed with the patient’s chart.   
If a patient appears to meet the criteria for the trial , she will be tol d about the study and asked for written 
informed consent to participate in the trial.  Consent may be obtained anytime from [ADDRESS_1270488] be obtained during this 
exam.  Table 5 provides the scoring system that uses the following three components to derive the

•Obstetrical history including outcome (s) of any prior pregnancies
•Social history: marital status, alcohol use, and tobacco use
•Current pregnancy complications
4.4 Study Procedures  
Women randomized to induction of labor will undergo induction via oxytocin at 39 weeks 0 days to 39 
weeks 4 days.  Those with an unfavorable cervix (modified Bishop score < 5) will first undergo cervical 
ripening ( method left to the discretion of the patient’s physician) in conjunc tion with or followed by 
[CONTACT_905080] a contraindication arises. 
Women randomized to expectant management will have at least weekly follow -up visits with their 
providers and, unless a medical indication is present, will continue pregnancy until at least 40 weeks 5 
days of gestation.  Antepartum fetal testing will be initiated no later than 41 weeks 6 days according to 
policies at each center. All patients will undergo induction via oxytocin by 42 weeks 2 days.  
4.5 Patient Management and Follow -up 
Patients in the induction of labor group (as well as patients in the expectant management group that undergo induction of labor) should be allowed adequate time to labor before considering the induction 
“failed” and proceeding to cesarean section.  An induction will be considered “failed” if at least [ADDRESS_1270492] elapsed since both rupture of membranes and use of a uterine stimulan t and the patient remains in 
latent labor .  It is expected that the fetal heart rate will be monitored while the patient is being induced 
(including ripening) and during labor and that patients will stay in th e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905045] (including ripening ) is started.   Mechanical ripening using a Foley catheter  without saline 
infusion  is permitted without monitoring and may be used in an outpatient setting according to policies at 
each center.   
For patients in the expectant management group, only a valid medical indication should warrant delivery 
before [ADDRESS_1270493] and the BCC will be notified within seventy -two hours of any maternal 
death, peri natal death, or life -threatening maternal event by [CONTACT_6968]/phone/fax, if the event occurred in a 
MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For any maternal death, perinatal death, or life-threatening maternal event 
occurring outside a MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the adverse event must be reported to the NICHD and the 
BCC within twenty -four hours of being notified.  These and other adverse events deemed serious, 
unexpected and definitely, possibly or probably related, will be immediately (within twenty -four hours of 
notification) forwarded by [CONTACT_92418] , NIH representative, and any other DSMC 
member who requests notification.  If a death is reported, a copy of the patient’s medical record will be 
made.   
Adverse events which do  not qualify under the above definition must be reported to the BCC within [ADDRESS_1270494] follow -up of specific events.  All a dverse events 
will be considered along with other interim safety data in the DSMC  deliberations.

5 Statistical Considerations 
5.1 Data Relevant to the Primary Outcome  
To estimate the rate of the primary outcome in the expectant management group, data from the MFMU 
Network’s APEX study were evaluated.  APEX was an observational study of approximately one-third of 
all deliveries at 25 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905048], collected over a three -year period.  For this analysis 
only nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy delivered at 39 weeks 0 days to 42 weeks 0 days 
were included; those with diabetes, hypertension before 38 weeks, previa and abruption were excluded, 
yielding a cohort of 24,683 women.  A composite outcome as close as possible to the proposed composite primary outcome for this trial was evaluated in these women.  However, APEX only included pregnancies 
with fetal heart tone s on admission for delivery and therefore stillbirth would be slightly underestimated.  
In addition, presence of thick meconium was used as a surrogate for meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1518].  The 
outcome rate in this cohort was 2.3% excluding presence of thick meconium ; with thick meconium 
present the outcome rate was 9. 3%.  The real primary outcome rate could be expected to be between these 
two estimates.    
Also, among women in the FOX trial, risks of adverse neonatal outcome at term (neonatal composite 
outcome including death, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], seizure, sepsis, intubation and ventilator support, 5 minute 
Apgar score of 3 or less or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) were 3.7% at 36-38 weeks, 3.5% at 39 weeks, 3.8% at 40 weeks and 5.0% at ≥ 41 weeks .
38   
Therefore the neonatal composite outcome rate  for pregnancies expectantly managed beyond 39 weeks 
would be expected to be between  3.5% and 5%.  This is consistent with other literature presented in 
Chapter 1. 
5.2 Sample Size and Power  
5.2.1 Primary Outcome  
Table 6 shows the sample sizes per group (rounded up to the next 10) to detect a 35-40% reduction in the 
primary outcome, with 80% to 90% power, assuming type I error of 5% 2-sided and primary outcome rate 
in the expectant management arm between 3. 5% and 5%.  Some women will labor after randomization 
but prior to when  their randomized assignment could be implemented (i.e. , before 39 weeks).  In addition, 
some women may undergo an elective induction off-protocol before 40 weeks, 5 days without a specific 
indication.  These ‘crossovers’ would therefore behave more like the elective induction group; and it is 
assumed that t heir primary outcome rate would be the same as that of the elective induction group.  This 
has the effect of reducing the effect size slightly depending on the proportion of crossovers: for example with 5% crossovers, the 40% nominal reduction becomes 39%.  
Sample sizes were ad justed to take into account that between 5 and 10% of the women in the expectant 
management group will behave more like the elective induction group.  The actual effect sizes are shown 
in parentheses in the table.  Data from observational studies suggest t hat a policy of induction of labor at 39 weeks may result in an 
equivalent reduction in adverse outcome.
6, 46  Using a type I error of 5% 2 -sided and power of 85%, and 
an estimate that 7.5% of women in the expectant management group will be crossovers, 3000 women in 
each group (tot al N= 6000) would be needed to detect the actual reduction in primary outcome of 38% .   
If the primary outcome rate is as high as 5%, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1270496] a 33-
34% reduction in the primary outcome with at least 85% power, again assuming that 7.5% of women will 
be crossovers.   
[ADDRESS_1270497] Sizes  
5.2.2 Cesarean Delivery  
Assuming that the rate of cesarean delivery is 30% in the expectant management group, a sample size of 
6000 women  also yields more than 90% power to detect a nominal 15 % increase or decrease even after 
adjusting for 7.5% crossovers.    Reduction in Primary

data would be presented to the DSMC before any comparison by [CONTACT_19313], and the committee would be 
charged with making a recommendation regarding potential revision of the sample size in addition to 
addressing the feasibility of answering the primary research question . 
5.4 Interim Analysis  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) meets in person at least once per year and more 
often if recommended by [CONTACT_942].  Before each of the annual meeting s, a formal detailed report 
will be written by [CONTACT_92412] (BCC) which presents a ll baseline variables, 
protocol adherence, side effects, all adver se events reported , as well as center performance in terms of 
recruitment, data quality, loss to follow -up and protocol violations.   
Once sufficient patients have been accrued into the trial, the report will also include a formal interim analysis evaluati ng the primary outcome by [CONTACT_1570].  For this evaluation, a cohort of patients is 
chosen consisting of all patients randomized before a certain date so that the analysis cohort does not depend on gestational age at delivery.   
The main statistical i ssue relevant to interim analysis is the problem of performing multiple tests of 
significance on accumulating data.  For this trial, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets will be 
used to characterize the rate at which the type I error is spent.
[ADDRESS_1270499] to the 
timing of the interim analyses.  A symmetric stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_92406]- deMets 
procedure.  The upper boundary which describes the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_628886] 1- sided 
type I error of .025 and the Lan- deMets generalization of the O’Brien -Fleming boundary.   
The lower boundary will be based on a less stringent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]: 1-sided type [ADDRESS_1270500]. If this  conditional power is low (under 10 
percent) the DSMC may consider termination for futility if the accrual rate is slow , with confidence that 
the Type II error is not greatly inflate d.[ADDRESS_1270501] prevails throughout particular 
18 
October 31, 2013 
subgroups of patients.  Indeed, NIH guidelines require investigators to evaluate consistency between the 
genders and across racial subgroups (see Section 5.5.1).  It should be noted, however, that subgroup 
analyses have been greatly abused, particularly when there is no overall treatment difference.54  There is a 
strong temptation to search for a specific subpopulation in which the therapy is nevertheless effective.   
Yusuf et al. concluded “ the overall ‘average’ result of a randomized clinical trial is usually a more 
reliable estimate of the treatment effect in the various subgroups examined than are the observed effects 
in individual subgroups .”[ADDRESS_1270502].  
•Race/ethnicity (see below)
•Modified Bishop score (< 5 and ≥  5)
•Body mass index (obese and non- obese)
Loss to follow-up will be defined as no information regarding stillbirth or neonatal outcome.  Th ere 
should be a low loss to follow -up rate.  It is possible that a woman would deliver at a non- Network 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; however, a record release will be obtained at enrollment to ensure that delivery and neonatal information can be obtained.  However, to determine whether the results are robust , a sensitivity analysis 
will be performed including patients lost to follow up with different assumptions regarding their outcome.  
Since many of the secondary endpoints are dichotomous variables like the primary outcome, standard 
statistical methods for rates and proportions will be appropriate.  The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used 
to compare continuous variables, and survival analysis methodology may be used to compare time- to-
event variables.  
In general, analyses of data will be conducted to address the primary and secondary research questions of 
the trial, and other interrelationships among elements of study data of interest to the investigators and of 
relevance to the objectives of the study.  
5.5.1 Racial/Ethnic Subgroup Analysis 
The racial/ethnic composition of patients of women recruited into the MFMU Network trials varies.  
Assuming for this trial that the composition is 2 5% African -American and 30% Hispanic, similar to the 
ongoing STAN trial, there is  limited power ( 40-50%) to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome in 
the separate subgroups.

6.2 Web Data Entry  System  
For this protocol, web data entry screens corresponding to the study forms listed above will be developed 
and maintained by [CONTACT_92424].  Clinical center staff will enter data into the MyS QL database 
located at the BCC through a web data management system (MIDAS).  The data are edited on -line for 
missing, out of range and inconsistent values.  A Users’ Manual documenting this system is provided to the centers by [CONTACT_92425].   
6.3 Centralized Data Management System  
Daily data conversions from the MySQL database create up -to-date SAS datasets.  Data are reviewed 
weekly using edit routines similar to those implemented on -line during data entry, as well as additional 
checks for data consistency within or across forms.  A database of resulting potential data problems is 
20 
October 31, 2013 
generated in MIDAS for initial review by [CONTACT_628922], who then evaluate the comments keyed in 
association with edits on missing or unusual values.  Valid edits will be flagged in MIDAS for resolution 
at the clinical centers.   
At regular intervals, specialized data reviews comparing data availability and consistency across forms 
are run by [CONTACT_92427] a specific subset of data .  These reports are also 
submitted to the centers for correction or clarification.  
An audit trail, consisting of all prior versions of each data form as entered in the computer for each patient, is maintained so that the succession of corrections can be m onitored. 
6.4 Performance Monitoring 
The BCC will present regular reports to the ARRIVE Subcommittee, the Steering Committee, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.   These include:  
•Monthly R ecruitment R eports - reports of the number of women screened and enrolled by [CONTACT_905084]
h
a
nd by [CONTACT_905085].  Weekly or bi -weekly reports are provided electronically if needed.
•Quarterly Steering Committee Reports - reports detailing recruitment, baseline patient
characteristics, data quality, incidence of missing data and adherence to study protocol by [CONTACT_905086], are provided quarterly to the ARRIVE Subcommittee and all other members of th e
S
teering Committee.
•Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Reports - for every meeting of the DSMC, a report is
prepared which includes patient recruitment, baseline patient characteristics, center performan ce
in
formation with respect to data quality, timeliness of data submission and  protocol adherence (i n
ad
dition to safety and efficacy data).  The reports also include adverse events, loss to follow -up
an
d all outcome variables as described previously in this protocol.

7 Study Administration 
7.1 Organization and Funding 
The study is funded by [CONTACT_22443] (NICHD).  The study is conducted by [CONTACT_92431] -Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) 
Network, consisting of fourteen clinical centers, the Biostatistical Coordinating Center (BCC) and the 
NICHD , and is administered under cooperative agreements between each of the centers and the NICHD .  
Each of the funded institutions is represented by a Principal Investigator.  A complete description of the organization of the MFMU Network is provided  in the MFMU Network Policy Manual.    
7.1.[ADDRESS_1270504] of the study at each of 
their centers including: recruitment and treatment of patients as specified in the protocol, accurate data 
collection and the transmission of information to the Steering Committee.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1270505] of a group of experts 
who are not affiliated with research being conducted by [CONTACT_92432] -fetal medicine, neonatology and biostatistics/epi[INVESTIGATOR_623].  The role of the board includes the 
review and prioritization of proposed studies, in addition to the identification of scientifically and 
clinically important questions and ideas that might be conducted by [CONTACT_92433].  The NICHD Program 
Scientist convenes and attends the meetings.  
7.[ADDRESS_1270506].  
7.2.2 Protocol  Subcommittee  
The subcommittee consists of a  chair (who is an investigator from one of the clinical centers), 
investigators from one or more other clinical centers, BCC staff, nurse coordinators, outside consultants 
22 
October 31, 2013  
(if appropriate), and the NICHD Network Program Scientist.  The Protocol Subcommittee is responsible 
for the preparation and conduct of the study, and reporting the progress of the study to the Steering 
Committee.  
7.2.3 Publications Committee  
The Publications Committee is a standing committee of the Steering Committee.  The functions of this 
committee are to develop publication policies and to review all manuscripts and abstracts prior to 
submission.  The goals of this committee are fair and appropriate authorship credit and high quality 
publications.  
7.2.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Dat a and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), a group of individuals not affiliated with any of the 
participating institutions, was established by [CONTACT_92434].  Before the trial can begin, the protocol must be 
approved by [CONTACT_942].  During the conduct of the study, the committee is charged with monitoring 
the emerging results for efficacy and safety, in addition to center performance and protocol adherence.   
Recommendations by [CONTACT_92435], early termination for efficacy, or 
for unexpected safety problems.  R ecommendations are made to the NICHD and disseminated to the 
Steering Committee.  
[ADDRESS_1270507] be certified to start the trial before 
recruitment at that center can begin.  The certification requirements are designed to ensure that personnel 
involved in the trial are committed to the study and proficient in study proce dures, and that the center has 
satisfied regulatory requirements.  Each center is required to obtain IRB approval for the study before they are certified to begin the trial.   
8.2 Recruitment  and Data Collection Period 
Approximately 160,000 women deliver  at M FMU Network centers annually.  The APEX study database 
was queried to determine what proportion of all deliveries would be eligible for ARRIVE.  A total of 17,960 pregnancies out of 115,502 or 15.5% satisfied the eligibility criteria.  In addition, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_905050].  A total of 204 women were queried to find out whether they would consent to this trial if it were presented to them.  A total of 55% responded ‘yes’, 13% responded ‘maybe’ and 32% responded ‘no’.  Assuming  only 20% percent of the 160,000 deliveries 
are available (due to, for example, certain sites or care providers not participating), 15.5% satisfying eligibility criteria and a 55% consent rate, this translates to 2700 patients per year.  Assuming no limit on 
the ability to schedule inductions at 39 weeks, t he study would easily be completed within 30 months.  Training/Certification

24 
October 31, 2013 
Allowing an additional six months (i.e., 3 years in total), w ith only 30 of the 36 sites participating , 
translates to 67 patients per year pe r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (1.3 women per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_360031]) which should be feasible. 
Thus the overall recruitment goal is 167 women per month.     
8.3 Final Analysis  
After a two -month period for completion of data entry for the trial and close-out of the delivery and 
prima ry outcome , the data set will be locked and available for the primary and other main analys es.

Appendix B Sample Informed Consent Form  
Research Study Title :  A Randomized Tr ial of I nduction V ersus E xpectant Management ( ARRIVE ) 
Sponsor:   Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) 
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Principal Investigator:   ___________________________Phone  (____)  ___ - ____ 
Introduction  
You are invited to take part in a research study.  This consent form provides the information about the 
risks and benefits of the study.  A member of the research team is available to answer your questions and 
to provide further explanations.  You are free to choose whether or not you will take part in the study.  If 
you agree to take part in the research, you will be asked to sign this consent form.  This process is known 
as informed consent.    
Research Purpose  
You are being invited to participate because you are pregnant, having your first baby, and are planning to labor.  The goal of the study is to determine whether coming to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905051] (i.e., labor induction) at  39 weeks of pregnancy can improve the baby’s health at birth 
when compared with  waiting for labor to start on its own.  
Many doctors wait until [ADDRESS_1270508] 
shown that being induced at 39 w eeks of  pregnancy may improve the baby’s outcome.  Some older 
studies have suggested a higher risk of cesarean, but other recent studies have not shown this increased risk.  No studies like this one have been done before in the [LOCATION_002].  This study i s planning to enroll 
6,[ADDRESS_1270509] the existing prenatal care ( that is , waiting for start of labor).  
Procedures  
If you consent to the study, when you are within one to two weeks of your due date, you will be 
randomized (like  flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of two groups.  In one group (the “induction of labor” group), 
you will have your labor started through the use of medicine within a few days of reaching 39 weeks of 
pregnancy.  Depending upon how open your cervix is (the cervix is the opening to your uterus or birth 
canal), your doctor will decide the best way to start your labor. In the other group (the “expectant 
management group”) you will continue with your pregnancy until either you begin labor or your care 
provider determines that you need to be delivered or you re ach 4 1-42 weeks of gestation ( 1-2 weeks after 
your due date).   
Regardless of  which group you are in, your care provider will check your cervix (the opening of your 
uterus or birth canal ) during a pelvic examination.  This may have already been done as a p art of regular 
care within three days of your being randomized in which case it would not have to be repeated.  I f you  
receive medication to help open your cervix or start  your labor, your baby’s heart rate will be monitored 
all the time  you are receiving the medication  and when you are in labor .  Once you receive medication to  
help open your cervix or start your labor  you should expect to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905052].   All other 
care during your pregnancy and during labor will be at the discretion of your care provider.  After delivery, research staff will review your medical chart for clinical and outcome informati on such as 
any treatments or medicines given during labor and whether you had a vaginal delivery or cesarean 
section.  They will also review the medical chart of your newborn.  The research team will collect 
information regarding your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905053] t hat of your newborn until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
[ADDRESS_1270510] time  to plan for delivery  in the future . 
Alternative Procedures  
The alternative to this study is not to participate.  Women who do not take part in this study will continue 
with their pregnancies until either they  begin labor or their care provider determines there is a reason that 
they need to be delivered before labor begins (i.e., the standard care during pregnancy). 
Costs  
There will be no cost to you to take part in the research study.  The costs of your labor,  delivery and care 
after delivery  will be billed to you or your insurance company in the usual manner.  
Compensation  
(THIS SECTION WILL BE CENTER SPECIFIC.) You will be paid $XX to compensate you for the time 
and travel associated with the research study.  
Payment for Injury or Harm  
(THIS SECTION WILL BE CENTER SPECIFIC.) This hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905054].  
In the event of such injury, treatment  will be provided but it is not provided free of charge.  Since this is a 
research study, payment for any injury resulting from your participation in this research study may not be 
covered by [CONTACT_92442].  
Right to Withdraw From the Research  Study  
This study is voluntary and it is up to you to decide whether or not you want to participate.  You are free 
to withdraw your consent and stop taking part in this research study at any time without giving a reason.  
Refusal to take part or the decisi on to withdraw from the study will involve no penalty or loss of benefits 
to which you are otherwise entitled.  Y our refusal will not affect your legal rights or quality of health care 
that you will receive at this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Any significant new informatio n which becomes available during 
your participation in this research, and which may affect your health, safety, or willingness to continue in 
this research study, will be given to you.

July 20, [ADDRESS_1270518] dates pregnancy, defined as a gestation that persists beyond 294 days or 42 weeks’ gestation, is 
associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality.[ADDRESS_1270519] suggested that a policy of induction of labor at 41 weeks can improve pregnancy outcomes.   In 2006 a Cochrane review was conducted of all trials in which 
women were randomized to induction of labor at 41- 42 weeks or expectant management with fetal 
surveillance (including the MFMU Network’s trial).  The investigators found that a policy of induction of labor at or beyond 41 completed weeks was associated with fewer (all -cause) perinatal deaths (RR 0.3 
95% CI 0.09, 0.99), with no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the cesarean section rate for women in the induction group (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.76, 1.12).
[ADDRESS_1270520] of these studies examined maternal complications in 
multivariable model s and found that gestational age beyond 39 weeks was predictive of increased risk 
even when controlling for known confounders such as maternal age, ethnicity, education, parity, length of 
labor, induction, and birth weight .

Statistical signi ficance compared with rate of outcome in the previous week gestation : * p<.01, ** p<.[ADDRESS_1270521] also demonstrated that the rates of adverse neonatal outcomes are increased in pregnancies 
that extend beyond 39 weeks.4,6  In a study of singleton deliveries in Scotland between 1985 and 1996, 
Smith showed that the risk of perinatal death (stillbirth or neonatal death) nadirs at 39 weeks.8  In a study 
of deliveries registered in an area of London , the rate of stillbirth increased progressively with advancing 
gestation from 37 to 43 weeks.10  Abnormal neonatal acid -base status has been shown to increase in 
pregnancies delivered beyond 39 weeks.6,11   
In a retro spective cohort study of singleton, cephalic, low -risk neonates delivered at t erm, Caughey et al . 
concluded that neonatal complications of term pregnancy increase in a continuous , rather  than in a 
threshold fashion.   In this cohort the incidence of severe neonatal complications was increased 1.5 -2 fold 
in pregnancies delivered at 40 -41 weeks compared with  those delivered at 39 weeks ( Table 2).6  Other  
investigators reported similar trends in neonatal morbidity for pregnancies advancing beyond 39 
weeks.7,11,12

In contrast  with maternal outcomes, there is clear evidence that adverse neonatal outcomes are more 
common when elective delivery is undertaken at term but prior  to [ADDRESS_1270522] amount between 37-39 weeks (0.7/1000 to 1.4/1000 respectively) , the risk of more 
common adverse events (e.g. , RDS, mechanical ventilation) is increased by a factor of 2 to 12.14,15  
Overall, elective delivery prior to 39 weeks is associated with an increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_905060].   
2.3 Results from M FMU Network Studies 
Secondary analyses of NICHD MFMU Network data are consistent with the findings  above for both 
maternal and neonatal outcomes.  In the MFMU Network trial of fetal pulse oximetry (FOX), a secondary 
analysis of 4086 women found that the ri sks of a  composite maternal outcome (treated uterine atony, 
blood transfusion, or  peripartum infection ) and cesarean delivery increased with increasing gestational 
age from 39 to 41 or more completed weeks (p value for trend < 0 .001) .16 
In the Cesarean Registry, a  composite outcome of death or adverse neonatal outcome increased from 8% 
to 11.3 % as gestational age increased  from 39 to 41 weeks  in women undergoing elective repeat cesarean 
delivery.14  Also, in the cohort of  women in the FOX trial  referenced above , risks of  a similar composite 
adverse neonatal outcome increased with increasing gestational age after 39 weeks.16 Based on Caughey et al 2005; severe neonatal complications defined as birth trauma, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, 
sepsis, meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1518], respi[INVESTIGATOR_905061] 20, [ADDRESS_1270523] adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.  
2.4 Potential Risks and Benefits of Planned Elective Induction of Labor before 
41 weeks 
If neonatal risks nadir at approximately 39 weeks, and if the risks of maternal and neonatal complications 
increase monotonically  after 39 weeks, the question arises - do the risks of pregnancy prolongation 
beyond 39 weeks outweigh the risks of labor induction?  Whereas planned cesarean delivery in the 
absence of medical or obstetric complications is performed at [ADDRESS_1270524], a number of studies compared outcomes in women undergoing both indicated and elective 
inductions with those of spontaneously laboring women.20,23-26  By [CONTACT_905076] (e.g. , preeclampsia), it is possible that the higher rates of cesarean delivery 
observed in the induction group were due to the pregnancy complications and not the induction per se.   
Other studies have evaluated elective induction of labor  separately .17,18,21,22,24,27,[ADDRESS_1270525] appropriate one, because women who are induced 
at 39 weeks are not guaranteed the alternative of an immediate spontaneous labor.   In other words, 
women and their providers cannot choose between elective induction and spontaneous labor, but between 
elective induction and expectant management.  Expectant management at 39 weeks may result in a 
proximate spontaneous labor but also may result in circumstances (e.g. , preeclampsia, need for labor 
induction at 42 weeks) that increase the risk  of cesarean.[ADDRESS_1270526] with the prior studies that used spontaneously laboring comparison groups, revealed that elective 
induction at 39 weeks or greater, for either women with a favorable or unfavorable cervix, did not increase the cesarean delivery rate.  Specifically, for nulliparas with a favorable cervix ( modified Bishop 
score ≥5) the cesarean delivery rate was 21% in the electively induced group vs. 20% in the expectantly  
managed group (p = 0.84).  Similarly there was no significant difference in the cesarean rate for women 
with an unfavorable cervix (43% vs. 34%, p =.16).  This study calls into question the long-standing 
dogma that elective induction of labor prior to [ADDRESS_1270527] had several fundamental methodological flaws.  For example, women are often induced 
for indications which themselves may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes; in such 
a case of “confounding by [CONTACT_35151]”, adequate adjustment for the confounding factors may be difficult if 
not impossible.   There is not evidence that elective induction (i.e., an induction without an underlying 
medical or obstetric induction) specifically is associated with adverse long -term neurodevelopmental 
July 20, [ADDRESS_1270528] typi[INVESTIGATOR_905062]; this comparison is inappropriate and not clinically relevant,36 as 
spontaneous labor is not a choice but an event.  Indeed, many women wh o are not “induced” at a given 
gestational age will ultimately require induction or oxytocin augmentation at a later gestational age, or 
experience an obstetric complication which itself may be associated with a risk of adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcome, a risk that may have been prevented had the women been induced earlier .  
Thus, the clinically meaningful comparison is labor induction versus expectant management.  Yet, there 
are no data that suggest that elective induction compared with expectant management increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders or other adverse long-term outcomes.

7 Nevertheless, meta- analysis of these data generated by [CONTACT_905077] a reduction in the 
frequency of cesarean section with induction (RR 0. 89; 95% CI 0. 81 to 0.9 7).2  Although it did not 
address elective induction, the Hypertension and Pre -ecla mpsia Intervention Trial At Term (HYPI[INVESTIGATOR_905044] ), a 
randomized trial comparing induction to expectant management for women with hypertensive disease of 
pregnancy, also demonstrates that labor induction may not increase the risk of cesarean  (14% in the

8 3 Study Design  
3.1 Primary Research Question 
This randomized trial will address the primary research question:  does elective induction of labor in 
nulliparous women at 39 weeks improve peri natal outcome compared with expectant management?  
3.2 Secondary Research Questions 
Secondary research questions this study will address are:  
• Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduce the risk of any of the 
maternal outcomes  listed in Section 4.7.2? 
• Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks reduce the risk of any of the  
fetal and neonatal outcomes listed in section 4.7.3 ? 
• Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous  women at 39 weeks modify the utilization of the 
medical resources listed in section 4.7.4 ? 
• If the two groups show a difference in the incidence of the primary outcome  or cesarean, d oes the 
proposed effect of electi ve induction of labor  in nulliparous women at 39 weeks vary according to 
any of the subgroups  listed in section  5.5? 
3.3 Design Summary 
The study is a randomized controlled multi -center clinical trial of 6 000 women at 38 weeks 0  days to 38 
weeks 6 days randomized to one of two arms at participating MFMU Network clinical centers.  
• Elective induction of labor between 39 weeks 0 days and 39 weeks 4 days  
• Expectant management (unless a medical indication arises) until at least [ADDRESS_1270532] gestatio nal age (see below).

3.4.2 Gestational Age Determination  
Gestational age is determined using criteria proposed by [CONTACT_628892], the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the Society for Maternal -Fetal 
Medicine47 and is denoted “project gestational age”.  The “project EDC”, which is based on the project 
gestational age, cannot be revised once a determination  has been made.  If the pregnancy is conceived by 
[INVESTIGATOR_2993]-vitro fertilization, project gestational age is calculated from the date of embryo transfer  and the embryo 
age at transfer.  If the pregnancy is conceived spontaneously (including ovulation induction and artificial 
July 20, 2017 
9 insemination ) information from the earliest dating ultrasound and the last menstrual period  are used to 
determine project gestational age.  The following algorithm is used:   
• The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) is determined, and a judgment made as to 
whether or  not the patie nt has a “sure” LMP date.  
• If the LMP date is unsure, measurement (s) obtained at the patient’ s first dating ultrasound 
examination is used to determine the project gestational age.  The first dating ultrasound must 
have been conducted before 14 weeks 0 days by [CONTACT_905078] (CRL).   
• If the LMP  date is sure, project gestational age is determined by a comparison between the 
gestational age by [CONTACT_85651].  The first dating ultrasound must 
have been conducted before [ADDRESS_1270534] ultrasound by [CONTACT_905095] 8 weeks 6 days  CRL ± 5 days

3.6 Randomization Method 
Randomization for consenting women will occur at 38 weeks 0 days to 3 8 weeks 6  days of gestation .  
Consenting women will be assigned to induction of labor at 39 weeks 0 days t o 39 weeks 4 days or 
expectant management in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomization sequence prepared and maintained centrally by [CONTACT_92412] (B CC).   
The simple urn method will be used to generate the randomization sequences because it provides a high 
probability of balance in treatment assignments, it is unpredictable, and it allows an explicit 
randomization analysis to be conducted wi th relative ease.

4.1 Screening for Eligibility  and Consent  
All nulliparous women with a singleton gestation between 34 and 38 weeks are potentially eligible for 
screening.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed with the patient’s chart.   
If a patient appears to meet the criteria for the trial, she will be told about the study and asked for written 
informed consent to participate in the trial.  Consent may be obtained anytime from [ADDRESS_1270539] be obtained d uring this 
exam.  Table 5 provides the scoring system that uses the following three components to derive the modified Bishop score :

• Cervical length or effacement  
• Fetal station

4.4 Study Procedures  
Women randomized to induction of labor will undergo induction via oxytocin at 39 weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 4 days.  Those with an unfavorable cervix (modified Bishop score < 5 ) will first undergo cervical 
ripening (method left to the discretion of the patient’s physician) in conjunc tion with or followed by 
[CONTACT_905080] a contraindication arises. 
Women randomized to expectant management will have at least weekly follo w-up visits with their 
providers and, unless a medical indication is present, will continue pregnancy until at least 40 weeks 5 days of gestation.  Antepartum fetal testing will be initiated no later than 41 weeks 6 days according to 
policies at each center. All patients will undergo induction via oxytocin by 42 weeks 2 days.  
4.5 Patient Management and Follow -up 
Patients in the induction of labor group (as well as patients in the expectant management group that 
undergo induction of labor) should be allowed adequate time to labor before considering the induction 
“failed” and proceeding to cesarean section.  An induction will be considered “failed” if at least [ADDRESS_1270543] elapsed since both rupture of membranes and use of a uterine stimulan t and the patient remains in 
latent labor .  It is expected that  the fetal heart rate will be monitored while the patient is being induced 
(including ripening) and during labor  and that patients will stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905045] (i ncluding ripening) is started.   Mechanical ripening using a Foley catheter without saline 
infusion is permitted without monitoring and may be used in an outpatient setting according to policies at each center.   
For patients in the expectant management group, only a valid medical indication should warrant delivery before [ADDRESS_1270544] and the BCC will be notified within seventy -two hours of any maternal  
death, perinatal death, or life -threatening maternal event by [CONTACT_6968]/phone/fax, if the event occurred in a 
MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For any maternal death, peri natal death, or life -threatening maternal event 
occurring outside a MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , the adverse event must be reported to the NICHD and the 
BCC within twenty -four hours of being notified.  These and other adverse events deemed serious, 
unexpected and definitely, possibly or probably related, will be immediately (within twenty -four hours of 
notification) forwarded by [CONTACT_92418], NIH representative, and any other DSMC 
member who requests notification .  If a death is reported, a copy of the patient’s medical record will be 
made.   
Adverse events which do  not qualify under the above definition must be reported to the BCC within [ADDRESS_1270545] follow-up of specific  events.  All a dverse events 
will be considered along with other interim safety data in the DSMC  deliberations.

16 5 Statistical Considerations  
5.1 Data Relevant to the Primary Outcome 
To estimate the rate of the primary outcome in the expectant management group, data from the MFMU 
Network’s APEX study were evaluated.  APEX was an observational study of approximately one-third of 
all deliveries at 25 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905048], collected over a three-year period.  For this analysis only nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy delivered at 39 weeks 0 days to 42 we eks 0 days 
were included; those with diabetes, hypertension before 38 weeks, previa and abruption were excluded, 
yielding a cohort of 24,683 women.  A composite outcome as close as possible to the proposed composite 
primary outcome for this trial was evalu ated in these women.  However, APEX only included pregnancies 
with fetal heart tones on admission for delivery and therefore stillbirth would be slightly underestimated.   
In addition, p resence of thick meconium was used as a surrogate for meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_905065].  The 
outcome rate in this cohort was 2.3% excluding presence of thick meconium ; with thick meconium 
present the outcome rate was 9. 3%.  The real primary outcome rate could be expected to be between these 
two estimates.    
Also, among women in t he FOX trial, risks of adverse neonatal outcome at term (neonatal composite 
outcome including death, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], seizure, sepsis, intubation and ventilator support , 5 minute 
Apgar score of 3 or less or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) were 3.7% at 36 -38 weeks, 3.5% at 39 
weeks, 3.8% at 40 weeks and 5.0% at ≥ 41 weeks.
38   
Therefore the neonatal composite outcome  rate for pregnancies expectantly managed beyond 39 weeks  
would be expected to be between  3.5%  and 5% .  This is consistent with other literature presented in 
Chapter 1.  
5.2 Sample Size and Power  
5.2.1 Primary Outcome  
Table 6 shows the sample sizes per group (rounded up to the next 10) to detect a 35 -40% reduction in the 
primary outcome, with 80 % to 90% power, assuming type I error of 5% 2-sided and primary outcome rate 
in the expectant management arm between 3.5% and 5%.  Some women will labor after randomization 
but prior to when  their randomized assignment could be implemented (i.e., before 39 weeks).  In addition, 
some women may undergo an elective induction off -protocol before 40 weeks, 5 days without a specific 
indication .  These ‘crossovers’ would therefore behave more like the elective induction group; and it is 
assumed that t heir primary outcome rate would be the same as that of the elective induction group.  This 
has the effect of reducing the effect size slightly depending on the proportion of crossovers: for example 
with 5% crossovers, the 40% nominal reduction becomes 39%.  
Sample sizes were adjusted to take into account that between 5 and 10% of the women in the expectant 
management group will behave more like the elective induction group.   The actual effect sizes are shown 
in parentheses in the table.  
Data from observational studies suggest that a policy of induction of labor at 39 weeks may result in an 
equivalent reduction in adverse outcome.6, 46  Using a type I error of 5% 2 -sided and power of 85%, and 
an estimate that 7.5% of women in the expectant management group will be crossovers , 3000 women in 
each group (total N= 6000) would be needed to detect the actual red uction  in primary outcome of 38% .   
If the primary outcome rate is as high as 5%, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1270546] a 33-
34% reduction in the primary outcome with at least 85% power, again assuming that 7. 5% of women will 
be crossovers .

5.2.2 Cesarean Delivery  
Assuming that the rate of cesarean delivery is 30% in the expectant management group, a  sample size of 
6000 women  also yields more than  90% power to detect a nominal 15% increase or decrease even after 
adjusting for 7.5% crossovers.     Reduction in Primary

charged with making a  recommendation regarding potential revision of the sample size in addition to 
addressing the feasibility of answering the primary research question . 
5.4 Interim Analysis 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) meets in person at least once per year and more 
often if recommended by [CONTACT_942].  Before each of the annual meeting s, a formal detailed report 
will be written by [CONTACT_92412] (BCC) which presents a ll baseline variables, 
protocol a dherence, side effects, all adverse events reported, as well as center performance in terms of 
recruitment, data quality, loss to follow -up and protocol violations.   
Once sufficient patients have been accrued into the trial, the report will also include a formal interim 
analysis evaluating the primary outcome  by [CONTACT_1570].  For this evaluation, a cohort of patients is 
chosen consisting of all patients randomized before a certain date so that the analysis cohort does not depend on gestational age at d elivery.   
The main statistical issue relevant to interim analysis is the problem of performing multiple tests of significance on accumulating data.  For this trial, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets  will be 
used to characterize the rate at which the type I error is spent .
[ADDRESS_1270549] to the 
timing of the interim analyses.  Asymmetric stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_92406] -deMets 
procedure.  The upper boundary which describes the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_628886] 1-sided 
type I error of .0 25 and the Lan -deMets generalization of the O’Brien -Fleming boundary.   
The lower boundary will be based on a less stringent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  1-sided type [ADDRESS_1270550]. If this conditional power is low (under 10 
percent) the DSMC may consider termination for futility if the accrual rate is slow, with confidence that 
the Type II error is not greatly inflate d.
[ADDRESS_1270551] prevails throughout 
July 20, 2017 
19 particular subgroups of patients.  Indeed, NIH guidelines require investigators to evaluate consistency 
between the genders and across racial subgroups (see Section 5.5.1).  It should be noted, however, that subgroup analyses have been greatly abused, particularly when there is no overall treatment difference.
52  
There is a strong temptation to search for a specific subpopulation in which the therapy is nevertheless effective.   Yusuf et al. concluded “the overall ‘average’ result of a randomized clinical trial is usually a 
more reliable estimate of the treatment effect in the various subgroups examined than are the observed 
effects in individual subgroups .”
[ADDRESS_1270552].  
•Race/ethnicity (see below)
•Modified Bishop score (< 5 and ≥  5)
•Body mass index (obese and non-obese)
•Maternal age  (< 35 and ≥  35 years)
•Admitting provider specialty (see below)
Loss to follow -up will be defined as no information regarding stillbirth or neonatal outcome.  There 
should be a low loss to follow -up rate .  It is possible that a woman would deliver at a non-Network 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; however, a record release will be obtained at enrollment to ensure that delivery and neonatal 
information can be obtained.  However, to determine whether the results are robust, a sensitivity analysis 
will be performed including patients lost to follow up with different assumptions regarding their outcome.  
Since many of the secondary endpoints are dichotomous variables like the primary outcome, standard 
statistical methods for rates and proportions will be appropriate.  The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare continuous variables, and survival analysis methodology may be used to compare time -to-
event variables.  
In general, analyses of data will be conducted to address the primary and secondary research questions of 
the trial, and other interrelationships among elements of study data of interest to the investigators and of relevance to the objectives of the study.  
5.5.1 Racial/Ethnic Subgroup Analysis  
The racial/ethnic composition of patients of women recruited into the MFMU Network trials varies.  Assuming for this trial that the composition is 2 5% African -American and 30% Hispanic, similar to the 
ongoing STAN  trial, there is limited power ( 40-50%) to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome or 
cesarean in the separate subgroups .

form is briefly d escribed below:  
• AR01   Screening Log.  
• AR02   Eligibility and Randomization Form is completed for all patients eligible  and consenting 
for the study, and documents the project gestational age and randomization digital cervical exam . 
• AR04   Baseline Form is completed for all randomized patients.  This form includes detailed 
demographic and social data, and medical and obstetrical history.  
• AR05   Clinic and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905066] , urgent care

urgent care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56877]   
6.2 Web Data Entry  System  
For this protocol, web data entry screens corresponding to the study forms listed above will be developed 
and maintained by [CONTACT_92424].  Clinical center staff will enter data into the MySQL database 
located at the BC C through a web data management system (MIDAS).  The data are edited on -line for 
missing, out of range and inconsistent values.  A Users’ Manual documenting this system is provided to 
the centers by [CONTACT_92425].   
6.3 Centralized Data Management System  
Daily data conversions from the MySQL database create up -to-date SAS datasets.  Data are reviewed 
weekly using edit routines similar to those implemented on-line during data entry, as well as additional 
checks for data consistency within or across forms.  A database o f resulting potential data problems is 
July 20, 2017 
21 generated in MIDAS for initial review by [CONTACT_628922], who then evaluate the comments keyed in 
association with edits on missing or unusual values.  Valid edits will be flagged in MIDAS for resolution 
at the clinical cen ters.   
At regular intervals, specialized data reviews comparing data availability and consistency across forms are run by [CONTACT_92427] a specific subset of data.  These reports are also 
submitted to the centers for correction  or clarification. 
An audit trail, consisting of all prior versions of each data form as entered in the computer for each patient, is maintained so that the succession of corrections can be monitored.  
6.4 Performance Monitoring 
The BCC will present regular reports to the ARRIVE Subcommittee, the Steering Committee, and the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.   These include:  
• Monthly Recruitment Reports - reports of the number of women screened and enrolled by [CONTACT_905096].  Weekly or bi -weekly reports are provided electronically if needed.  
• Quarterly Steering Committee Reports - report s detailing recruitment, baseline patient 
characteristics, data quality, incidence of missing data and adherence to study protocol by [CONTACT_138554], are provided quarterly to the ARRIVE Subcommittee and all other members of the 
Steering Committee.  
• Data an d Safety Monitoring Committee Reports - for every meeting of the DSMC, a report is 
prepared which includes patient recruitment, baseline patient characteristics, center performance 
information with respect to data quality, timeliness of data submission and protocol adherence (in 
addition to safety and efficacy data).  The reports also include adverse events, loss to follow-up and all outcome variables as described previously in this protocol.

7.1 Organization and Funding 
The stud y is funded by [CONTACT_22443] (NICHD).  The study is conducted by [CONTACT_92431] -Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) 
Network, consisting of fourteen clinical centers, the Biostatistical Coord inating Center (BCC) and the 
NICHD , and is administered under cooperative agreements between each of the centers and the NICHD.  
Each of the funded institutions is represented by a Principal Investigator.  A complete description of the 
organization of the MFMU Network is provided in the MFMU Network Policy Manual.    
7.1.[ADDRESS_1270554] of the study at each of 
their centers including: recruitment and treatment of patients as specified in the protocol, accurate data

7.1.[ADDRESS_1270555] of a group of experts 
who are not affiliated with research being conducted by [CONTACT_92432] -fetal medicine, neonatology and biostatistics/epi[INVESTIGATOR_623].  The role of the board includes the 
review and prioritization of proposed studies, in addition to the identification of scientifically and 
clinically important questions and ideas that might be conducted by [CONTACT_92433].   The NICHD Pro ject 
Scientist convenes and attends the meetings.  
7.[ADDRESS_1270556].  
7.2.2 Protocol  Subcommittee  
The subcommittee consists of a chair (who is an investigator from one of the clinical centers), investigators fr om one or more other clinical centers, BCC staff, nurse coordinators, outside consultants 
July 20, 2017 
23 (if appropriate), and the NICHD Network Pro ject Scientist.  The Protocol Subcommittee is responsible 
for the preparation and conduct of the study, and reporting the progress of the study to the Steering 
Committee.  
7.2.3 Publications Committee  
The Publications Committee is a standing committee of the Steering Committee.  The functions of this committee are to develop publication policies and to review all manuscripts and abstracts prior to 
submission.  The goals of this committee are fair and appropriate authorship credit and high quality 
publications.  
7.2.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), a group of individuals not affiliate d with any of the 
participating institutions, was established by [CONTACT_92434].  Before the trial can begin, the protocol must be 
approved by [CONTACT_942].  During the conduct of the study, the committee is charged with monitoring 
the emerging results for eff icacy and safety, in addition to center performance and protocol adherence.   
Recommendations by [CONTACT_92435], early termination for efficacy, or for unexpected safety problems.  Recommendations are made to the NICHD and d isseminated to the 
Steering Committee.  
July 20, [ADDRESS_1270557] be certified to start the trial before 
recruitment at that center can begin.  The certification requirements are designed to ensure that personnel 
involved in the trial are committed to the study and proficient in study procedures, and that the center has satisfied regulatory requirements.  Each center is required to obtain IRB approval for the study before they are certified to begin the trial.   
8.2 Recruitment  and Data Collection Period 
Approximately 16 0,000 women deliver  at MFMU Network cent ers annually .  The APEX study  database 
was queried to determine what proportion of all deliveries would be eligible for ARRIVE.  A total of 17,960 pregnancies out of 115,502 or 15.5% satisfied the eligibility criteria.  In addition, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_905067].  A total of 204 women were queried to find out 
whether they would consent to this trial if it were presented to them.  A total of 55% responded ‘yes’, 13% responded ‘maybe’ and 32% responded ‘no’.  Assuming  only 20% percent of the 160,000 deliveries 
are available (due to, for example, certain sites or care providers not participating), 15.5% satisfying 
eligibility criteria and a 55% consent rate, this translates to 2700 patients per year.  Assuming no limit on 
the ability to schedule inductions at 39 weeks, t he study w ould easily be completed within 30 months .  Training/Certification

Data processing 
July 20, 2017 
25 Allowing an additional six months (i.e., 3 years in total), with only 30 of the 36 sites participating , 
translates to 67 patients per year per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (1.3 women per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_360031] ) which should be feasible.  
Thus the overall recruitment goal is 167 women per month.     
8.3 Final Analysis 
After a two -month period for completion of data entry for the trial  and close-out  of the delivery and 
primary outcome , the data set will be locked and available for the primary and other main analyse s.

Research Study Title :  A Randomized Tr ial of I nduction V ersus Expectant M anagement (ARRIVE ) 
Sponsor:   Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)  
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  
Principal Investigator:   ___________________________Phone  (____)  ___ - ____  
Introduction  
You are invited to take part in a research study.  This consent form provides the information about the 
risks and benefits of the study.  A member of the research team is available to answer your questions and to provide further explanations.  You are free to choose whether or not you will take part in the study.  If you agree to take part in the research, you will be asked to sign this consent form.  This process is known 
as informed consent.    
Research Purpose  
You are being invited to participate because you are pregnant, having your first baby, and are planning to 
labor.  The goal of the study is to determine whether coming to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905068] (i.e., labor induction) at  39 weeks of pregnancy can improve the baby’s health at birth 
when compared with waiting for labor to start on its own.  
Many doctors wait until [ADDRESS_1270559] 
shown that being induced at 39 weeks of  pregnancy  may improve the baby’s outcome.  Some older 
studies have suggested a higher risk of cesarean, but other recent studies have not shown this increased risk.  No studies like this one have been done before in the [LOCATION_002].  This study is planning to enroll 
6,[ADDRESS_1270560] the existing prenatal care (that is, waiting for start of labor). 
Procedures  
If you consent to the study, when you are within one to two weeks of your due date, you will be 
randomized (like  flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a coin) to one of two groups.   In one group (the “induction of labor” group), 
you will have your labor started through the use of medicine within a few days of reaching 39 weeks of pregnancy .  Depending upon how open your cervix is (the cervix is the opening to your uterus or birth 
canal), your doctor will decide the best way to start your labor . In the other group (the “expectant 
management group” ) you will continue with your pregnancy until ei ther you begin labor or your care 
provider determines that you need to be delivered or you reach 41-4 2 weeks of gestation ( 1-2 weeks after 
your due date).   
Regardless of  which group you are in, your care provider will check your cervix (the opening of your 
uterus  or birth canal ) during  a pelvic examination.  This may have already been done as a part of regular 
care within three days of your being randomized in which case it would not have to be repeated.  If you 
receive medication to help open your cervix or start your labor , your baby’s heart rate will be monitored 
all the time  you are receiving the medication  and when you are in labor .  Once you receive medication to  
help open your cervix or  start your labor  you should  expect to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905069].   All other 
care during your pregnancy and during labor will be at the discretion of your care provider.  
After delivery, research staff will review your medical chart for clinical and outcome information such as 
any treatments or medicines given  during labor and whether you had a vaginal delivery or cesarean 
section.  They will also review the medical chart of your newborn.   The research team will collect 
information regarding your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905070] .

Alternative Procedures  
The alternative to this study is not to participate.  Women who do not take part in this study will continue 
with their pregnancies until either they begin labor or their care provider determines the re is a reason that 
they need to be delivered before labor begins (i.e., the standard care during pregnancy).  
Costs  
There will be no cost to you to take part in the research study.  The costs of your labor, delivery and care 
after delivery  will be billed to you or your insurance company in the usual manner.  
Compensation  
(THIS SECTION WILL BE CENTER SPECIFIC.) You will be paid $XX to compensate you for the time 
and travel associated with the research study.  
Payment for Injury or Harm

ARRIVE  Protocol Changes – April 27, 2017  
1.The following research questions and secondary outcomes were deleted from  the
pr
otocol to keep the primary manuscript more focused and allow secondary papers  to
foc
us on these outcomes .
a.Section 3.2 Secondary Research Questions – deleted:
i.Does elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks modify
the patient-centered outcomes listed in section 4.7.2?
b.Section 4.7.2 Maternal Secondary Outcomes (and Appendix A Design Summary)–deleted:
i.Patient-reported outcomes including feelings of control during childbirth,as measured by [CONTACT_905102],
50 and two questions regarding
pain experienced during childbirth using a visual analog scale51
c.S
ection 4.7.3 Fetal and Neonatal Secondary Outcomes – deleted:
i.Macrosomia > 4500 g, large for gestational age (LGA) defined as > 90th
per
centile weight for gestational age, assessed specifically by [CONTACT_905103]
r
ace of the infant based on [LOCATION_002] birth certificate data52
ii.S
mall for gestational age defined as < 5th  and < 10th percentile weight for
gestational age, assessed specifically by [CONTACT_905104] d
on U
nited States birth certificate data52
d. Section 4.7.4 Utilization of Medical Resources –  deleted:  
i. Number of clinic visits post randomization to admission for delivery  
ii. ER/u rgent care/triage visits post randomization to delivery  
iii. Non-stress tests, biophysical profiles (BPPs), modified BPPs, ultrasounds 
done other than BPP, Doppler, contraction stress tests  
iv. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14001]  
v. Intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) or fetal scalp electrode placement 
vi. Use of induction and ripening agents, maximum dose of oxytocin  
vii. Antepartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905072]. Length of neonatal intensive care unit or intermediate care stay  
ix. Post discharge resource utilization including inpatient and outpatient visits 
for mother or baby  
2. Section 3.2 Secondary Research Questions –  clarification regarding when subgroup 
analyses would be per formed, to be consistent with the analysis plan:  
a. Added:  ‘If the two groups show a difference in the incidence of the primary 
outcome or cesarean’ before ‘Does the proposed effect of elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at 39 weeks  vary according to any of the subgroups 
listed in section 5.5?’  
3. Section 4.7.1 Primary Outcome –  clarification of the definition of the primary component 
intracranial hemorrhage to include:  
a. Intraventricular hemorrhage grades III and IV, subgaleal hemorrhage, subdural 
hematoma, or subarachnoid hematoma  
4. Section 5.5 Analy sis Plan: 
a. Added ‘or cesarean’ to the following sentences:  
i. If the two groups show a difference in the incidence of the primary 
outcome or cesarean, interactions will be evaluated and subgroup 
analyses conducted to determine whether the effect prevails throughout 
particular subgroups of patients.  
ii. Assuming for this trial that the composition is 25% African-American and 
30% Hispanic, similar to the ongoing STAN trial, there is limited power 
(40-50%) to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome or cesarean 
in the separate subgroups. 
b. Added the following subgroups:  
i. Maternal age (< 35 and ≥ 35 years)  
ii. Admitting provider specialty  
c. Added the following paragraph regarding admitting provider specialty subgroup analysis:  
i. Although admitting provider specialty is not a baseline variable, this 
variable will be evaluated for subgroup analysis i f the two groups show a 
difference in the incidence of the primary outcome or cesarean, and if the test for interaction is significant. Elective induction of labor may be 
perceived as an intervention more likely utilized by [CONTACT_905105], therefore it is important to demonstrate whether a treatment 
effect is present among patients treated by [CONTACT_905106].

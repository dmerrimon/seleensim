and Efficacy of N1539 Administered Preoperatively in 
Open Unilateral  Total Knee Arthroplasty  
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   
Meloxicam  Phase of Development:   3b 
Objectives:   The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of preoperative administration 
of N1539 on opi[INVESTIGATOR_746803].  
Secondary objectives are to assess:  
• The safety and  tolerability of preoperative administration of N1539 compared to placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on postoperative pain compared to 
placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on healthcare utilization costs 
compar ed to placebo.  
Methodology:   This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in 
adult subjects undergoing elective open unilateral total knee arthroplasty .  The surgical procedure will 
be conducted in an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746804] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271477] ≥[ADDRESS_1021749] will be screened for eligibility within 28 days before undergoing surgery on Day 1.   
Before surgery, approximately 200 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
N1539 30 mg or placebo administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection in ≤[ADDRESS_1021750] study dose + 1 day (LSD+1).  S ubjects will 
also receive an appropriate  prophylactic IV antibiotic and tranexamic acid 1 gram IV  30 to 90 minutes 
before surgery  (Appendix B ). 
Following administration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_746805] (ie, time of first incision), 
subjects will receive the first dose of study drug according to randomization.  All subjects will then 
undergo the surgical procedure according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with 
institutional standards. 
Just prior to wound cl osure, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 30 mL with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.5 mg expanded in a 
volume of 90 mL  normal saline will be  injected  locally  into various areas of the surgical site as 
described in Section  5.2.3.   
At the end of the surgical procedure (Hour 0, defined as the time of last suture, staple, or steri- strip 
placement ) and through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], postoperative pain management will be according to the 
protocol (Section  5.13).  Other standard of care procedures associated with the surgical procedure will 
be carried out according to the investigator’s  clinical practice and in accordance with institutional 
standards.  Subject s may also receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV)  according to FDA prescribing information .

Efficacy analysis:  Efficacy endpoints will be tabulated by [CONTACT_746905]; descriptive statistics will be provided, including sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, or frequency (number of subjects and 
percentage) distribution of each category for categorical variables.   
Treatment effect will be evaluated using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_746836], pain intensity related endpoints, and OBAS related endpo ints; the ANCOVA model 
will include treatment effect and investigational sites as a covariate.  Difference in LS means will be 
compared between the treatment groups. 
Kaplan -Meier survival analysis will be carried out for time to event endpoints, including survival 
curves, 25%, 50% and 75% tiles estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and log-
rank test.  Cox proportional hazards analysis will also be performed for time to event endpoints; the 
model will include the treatment effect and the  investigational sites; hazards ratio and corresponding 
95% CI will be presented. 
Treatment effect on PGA scores will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated their pain 
control as good, very good, or excellent using CMH test controlling for anal ysis center.  CMH test 
will apply to other category variables, such as proportion of subjects who took any opi[INVESTIGATOR_746837].   
Safety analysis:   The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 20 or higher) will be 
used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term.  AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Clinical laboratory parameters collected after th e first dose of study 
drug w ill be evaluated by [CONTACT_23992] t o baseline; subjects with potentially clinically significant 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be identified and tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].   The number and proportion of subjects with abnormal wound healing observations will be 
summarized b y treatment group. 
Healthcare Utilization analysis: A separate SAP will be constructed for analysis of Health Care 
Utilization and total costs as recorded on the UB 04.  This SAP wil l detail the objectives, methods for 
conducting the relevant analyses, and the format for presentation of the findings.  Subject cohorts of interest will be defined and the variables to be measured as well as the steps in data processing and analyses will also be presented .

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. N1539 (meloxicam) Injection, for  Intravenous Use  
Meloxicam , a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) of the enolic acid class, was first 
approved for oral use in the [LOCATION_002] in 2000 and has a well- established safety 
profile in commercial use as an effective treatment for osteoarth ritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis.  
Meloxicam administered orally has a slow onset of action, largely due to poor water 
solubility, and is not currently approved for the treatment of acute pain.  It has a 
prolonged absorption, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration ( Tmax) 
approximately 5 -6 hours following oral administration ( Degner  1997; Turck  1997a ), 
which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility.  By [CONTACT_746906], N1539 
administered by (intravenous) IV bolus injection has been shown to have a rapid onset of action . 
In the N1539 clinical studies, m eloxicam exposure was consistently greater after 
administration of N1539 via IV bolus injection compared to oral administration of Mobic 
at equivalent doses.  As expected, N1539 administered as an IV bolus injection resulted 
in substantially higher maximum observed concentration (C
max) and earlier  time to 
maximum concentration ( Tmax) compared with oral administration of Mobic at equivalent 
doses over a range of 15 to 60 mg.  Eight to 12 hours after administration of equivalent doses of IV and oral meloxicam, plasma concentration -time curves were similar.  The 
C
max and area under the concentration- time curve ( AUC ) for N1539 administered IV 
were similar across studies.   
Ad hoc analyses from the Phase 1 studies demonstrated that a single dose of N1539 
30 mg administered by [CONTACT_746907] a slightly more than 2 -fold high er 
AUC ∞ and 4.65-fold higher C max relative to a single dose of Mobic [ADDRESS_1021777] 
FDA approved dose, administered orally .  Importantly meloxicam p lasma concentrations 
were sustained for 24 hours after N1539 IV administration  making N1539 suitable for 
once a day dosing. 
In the clinical program for N1539 for the management of moderate to severe acute pain, a 
total of 2075 subjects were evaluated for safety in 11 clinical studies: 109 subjects were 
healthy volunteers who were enrolled in the four Phase 1 studies and 1966 were postoperative subjects who were enrolled in the seven Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1021778] 
commonly performed orthopedic procedures. As of 2010, total knee replacements were 
becoming increasingly common with over 600,000 performed annually in the Unit ed 
States (UpToDate®). Among older patients in the [LOCATION_002], the per capi[INVESTIGATOR_746839] 1991 to 2010 (from 31 to 62 per 10,000 Medicare enrollees annually) (Cram 2012) and this number is expected to grow by 673 
percent to 3.48 million procedures by 2030 ( Kurtz 2007). A variety of pathologic 
conditions affecting the knee can be treated with total knee replacement, leading to pain relief, to restoration of function, and to mobility.   
Severe postoperative pain, which remains  one of the main problems after total knee 
arthroplasty , can  negatively affect postoperative recovery .  Over the last [ADDRESS_1021779] prescribed  IV patient -controlled analgesia, femoral nerve block, and 
continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_746840] 24 and 48 hours with and without a femoral block 
(Maheshwari 2009). Unfortunately, these techniques have been found to have 
shortcomings, not the least of which has been  suboptimal pain control and unwanted side 
effects  (Maheshwari 2009 ).  
Improvements in pain management techniques in the last decade have had a major impact 
on the practice of total hip and knee arthroplasty; however, a gold standard has not been established .  Although there are a number of treatment options for postoperative pain, 
there appears to be a shift towards multimodal approaches using systemic, local, and 
regional analgesia to minimize opi[INVESTIGATOR_746841]- related side 
effects  (Maheshwari 2009 ). 
In a double-blind, randomized study by [CONTACT_746908], (2017) a m ultimodal pain 
management regimen that included injections of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], morphine, and the NSAID 
ketorolac was shown to provide postoperative pain relief and resulted in less opi[INVESTIGATOR_746842] [ADDRESS_1021780] of preoperative administration 
of N1539 on opi[INVESTIGATOR_746843].

 Secondary objectives are to assess:  
• The safety and tolerability of preoperative administration  of N1539 compared 
to placebo  
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on postoperative pain 
compared to placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on healthcare utilization 
costs compared to placebo . 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in 
adult subjects undergoing elective open unilateral total knee arthroplasty.  The surgical 
procedure will be conducted in an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746804] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271477] ≥[ADDRESS_1021781] will be screened for eligibility within 28 days before undergoing surgery on Day 1.   
Before surgery, approximately 200 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive eith er N1539 30 mg or placebo administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus 
injection in ≤[ADDRESS_1021782] study dose + 1 day (LSD+1).  Subjects will also receive an appropriate prophylactic IV antibiotic and tranexamic acid 1 gram IV 30 to 90 minutes before surgery ( Appendi x 
B). 
Following administration of spi[INVESTIGATOR_746805] (ie, time of first incision), subjects will receive the first dose of study drug according to randomization.  All subjects will then undergo the surgical procedure according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.  
Just prior to wound closure, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 30 mL with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.5 mg expanded in a volume of 90 mL normal saline will be injected locally into various area s 
of the surgical site as described in Section  5.2.3.   
At the end of the surgical procedure (Hour 0, defined as the time of last suture, staple, or 
steri-strip placement) and through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], postoperative pain management 
will be according to the protocol (Section  5.13).  Other standard of care procedures 
associated with the surgical procedure will be carried out according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.   Subject s may also 
receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for PONV  according to FDA prescribing 
information . 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002

5.7. Blinding and Unbinding of Study Drug  
All doses of study drug will be prepared by [CONTACT_318802](s) of the 
healthcare team at the research center according to the subject’s randomization.   
Doses of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_746912].  
The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan for that subject depends on which study drug he or she received.  Unless the subject 
is at immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_318804]’s data.   
If a subject’s data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the sponsor, the 
investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next 
business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
Blinded study personnel will administer each dose of study drug .  The exact date and 
time each dose is administered will be recorded in the subject’ s eCRF.  
5.9. Drug Accountability 
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study drug s when they are received.  The 
study drug must be handled and stored as described and dispensed only to those subjects formally entered into the study. 
At the completion  of the study, and after reconciliation of all delivery and usage records, 
any unused study drug  supplied by [CONTACT_351549] (or 
designee) or destroyed per written instructions from the sponsor. 
5.10. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study drug  will be provided in study labeled packaging for preparation for use in this 
study.

 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as 
provided in this protocol.  During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs a nd SAEs, as detailed in 
this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether 
or not considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value deemed clinically  significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless of causal 
relationship, must be reported as an AE. 
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or 
indication under study 
• Exacerbation of a chroni c or intermittent preexisting condition, including either 
an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination finding) 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not wor sen 
• The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of causality, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study drug through end of the study (ie, Day 30).   
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 43 of 65 
 7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE i s defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (ie, presents an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred; this does not include an AE had it occurred in a more serious 
form may have caused death).   
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to perform normal life functions.   
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
•  Results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
•  Is a congenital anomaly or bi rth defect (in the offspring of a subject using the 
study drug regardless of time to diagnosis). 
•  Is considered an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is 
serious when considering importa nt medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed that define 
a SAE. Examples of such medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of a SAE. Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746879] a SAE. 
SAEs will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF after the signing of informed consent 
through the end of the study (ie, Day 30). If an investigator becomes aware of a SAE or death that occurs more than [ADDRESS_1021809] receives study drug and the 
investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug, he/she is obligated to 
report the SAE to the sponsor. 
7.3. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE.

 7.3.1. Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, using his or her clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE 
recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with everyday activities 
• Moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on the 
subject’s or event’s outcome or on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning (s ee Section  7.2).  
7.3.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator must record the causal relationship of each event  in the eCRF, and 
additionally for SAEs, on the SAE reporting form .  An investigator's causality assessment 
is the determinatio n of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused or contributed to an AE .  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug 
and the AE .   
• Not related: The AE  is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another 
drug or event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not sugges t a causal relationship).    
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before transmitting the SAE reporting form and  completing the AE eCRF page(s). The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and amend the SAE report ing form and AE eCRF page(s) 
accordingly.  
7.3.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator will assess the o utcome of the event(s) by [CONTACT_137582]: 
• Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject returned to baseline.  
• Resolving:  At last observation, the event was improving. 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 45 of 65 
 • Resolved with sequelae:  The event resolved but the subject is left with residual 
problems (eg, functional deficits)  
• Not resolved: At the last observation, the event was unchanged.  
• Unknown:  There were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) of the event, and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death ( Fatal):  To be selected for the one AE, which in the judgement of the 
investigator was the primary  cause of death.  
7.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition. All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_746915], the condition stabilizes, the event 
is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Any additional events that are relevant to the ongoing event will be documented. 
The investigator will ensure that follow -up information relevant to SAEs is provided to 
the sponsor and includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or  updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting 
form and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_1275]. The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor 
within the time  frames outlined in Section  7.5. 
7.5. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1021810] BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours).

Protocol REC- 17-[ADDRESS_1021811] extent possible: 
• AE record  
• Medical history  
• Prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test 
results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information. In rare 
circumstances and in the absence of e- mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_746917], with a copy of the SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_208895] m ail. Initial 
notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the 
SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event. The form must be updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information 
received on all SAEs must be forwarded to the sponsor by [CONTACT_137586].  
7.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section 7.5 “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the 
Sponsor.” The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_746918], be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met. 
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, expectedness of the SAE will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_456].  A SAE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
The s ponsor will determine whether the SAE meets regulatory reporting criteria (ie, 7 - or 
15-day report) in compliance with loca l and regional law. If so, the sponsor (or the 
sponsor’s representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
The sponsor will report SAEs to the central IRB/EC and the investigator will be report 
SAE to their local to institutional review board (IRB) /EC. Investigator letters are 
prepared according to sponsor policy and are forw arded to the investigators as necessary. 
An investigator letter is prepared for any SAE that is attributable to study drug, serious, 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 47 of 65 
 and unexpected. The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) r equirements regarding the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  
7.7. Special Reporting Situations: Pregnancy  
Any s ubject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study drug 
administration and should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject should be instructed to also notify the investigator immediately if she beco mes 
pregnant within [ADDRESS_1021812] be notified of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see Section  7.[ADDRESS_1021813] information). 
Any uncomplicated pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be 
reported for tracking purposes only. All subject pregnancies that are identified during or 
after this study, where the estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred 
within 30 days of receiving study drug need to be reported, followed to conclusion 
(delivery or termination), and the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued 
from the study. The investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form, according to the usual timelines and directions for 
SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5. Monitoring of the pregnancy should continue 
until conclusion of the pregnancy; and follow-up detailing the outcome of the pregnancy submitted using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless ther e is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_429001] a contraceptive 
medication. Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs.  
Any SAEs associated with pregnancy (eg, congen ital abnormalities/birth 
defects/spontaneous miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be 
reported as such using the SAE report form according to the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5.

24JAN2018  
Page 51 of 65 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Population 
The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one injection of 
study drug.  All safety evaluations will be based on the safety population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Population (Modified Intent -to-Treat)  
The efficacy population (ie, modified intent- to-treat [m ITT]) will consist of all subjects 
who receive at least one injection of study drug and have the scheduled surgery.  All efficacy evaluat ions will be based on the efficacy population. 
8.1.2. Test Hypothesis and P Value Justification 
Each efficacy analysis will be performed to assess the differences between the 2 
treatment groups; N1539 [ADDRESS_1021821] at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Nominal p -value will be reported as is .   
8.1.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise,  no imputation will be done for missing data.  However, AEs 
with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and AEs with missing relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related ” for the purpose of analysis; and the 
missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
8.1.4. Definitions for Assessment Windows  
For the purpose of data analysis, baseline  measures will be the last measurements taken 
before the subject receives the first do se of  study drug . 
8.1.5. Derived Variables  
The study SAP will provide detail d escription for each endpoint derivation methodology, 
including censoring rules for each time to events, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_746889] (mg) for each time period,  missing data (time) imputation rules, total

The extent of exposure for the study drug treatment will be assessed via number of doses 
received . 
8.4.2. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 20 or higher) will be used to 
classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term.  An event is 
considered treatment emergent if the event onset date/time is on or after the first dose of 
study drug or if a prior condition is worsened after the first dose of study drug.  AEs will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  AE summaries will be provided for all treatment 
emergent AEs, study drug related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs. 
AEs that lead to premature discontinuation from the study or to death wil l be listed 
separately via data listings.

Informed consent is a process that is initiated  prior to the individual’s agreeing to 
participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Template informed consent forms will be provided by [CONTACT_746922].  Final consent forms will be IRB/IEC approved and 
accepted by [CONTACT_456]. The subject will be asked to read and review the consent 
document.  The investigator or designee will explain the study to the subject and answer 
Protocol REC- 17-[ADDRESS_1021824]’s comprehension of the purpose, procedures, and potential risks of the study and 
of their rights as research subjects.  Subjects will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The subjects should have the 
opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to 
agreeing to participate.  The subject will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject must be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records.  The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the 
source document and the form signed before the subject undergoes any study- specific 
procedures.  The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_746923].    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Confidentiality  
 Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456].  Any subject records or data that are transferred  to the sponsor will contain the identifier; subject names or any 
information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.  The investigator will keep a Master Subject List on which the identifier and full name, address, and telephone number of each subject are listed.  The Master Subject List will be 
stored in a secure location at the site and will not be shared with the sponsor.  It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to inform subjects as part of the informed consent process that r epresentatives of the sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory agencies may review all 
records that support their participation in the study.  The Investigator will comply with all privacy laws to which he/she is subject. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate 
financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  Investig ators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
9.2. Quality Assurance  
• All subject data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRFs unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically ( eg, 
laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_1189].  
• The investigator must maintain accur ate documentation (source data) that 
supports the information entered in the CRF.

current approved version of the protocol, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
9.3. Study and Site Closure  
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions 
arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site 
should be closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study 
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, study monitor, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP ( eg, ICH guidelines, regulatory 
agency guidelines)  
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study 
that one could believe with a high degree of certainty that subjects are being 
exposed to the investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable 
data 
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate

 APPENDIX B:   CLINICAL CARE PROTO COL  MEDICATIONS    
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis:  
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis before and after surgery will be administered 
according to standard practice, based on the subject’s individual needs, at the discretion 
of the investigator and surgeon, and taking into consideration the American College of 
Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)  
guidelines for orthopedic surge ry. 
Perioperative  Concomitant Medications:  
• 30 to 90 minutes before surgical procedure administer : 
− Acetaminophen 650 mg by [CONTACT_1966] ( PO) (administered with sips of water)  
− Gabapentin 600 mg PO (administered with sips of water)  
− Tranexamic acid 1 gram IV  (a second dose of tranexamic acid may be given 
approximately [ADDRESS_1021833], at the discretion of the surgeon). 
− Prophylactic IV antibiotic  
• Before the start of the surgical procedure: 
Following adminis tration of intrathecal anesthesia (ie, 7.5 mg to 15 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) 
and before the start of surgery, administer 1st dose  of study drug by [CONTACT_746909]  
≤15 seconds according to randomization. 
• Intraoperative 
Fentanyl and morphine or other morphine derivatives may be administered 
intraoperatively (during the course of the surgical procedure); however, dosing with fentanyl (and morphine or other morphine derivatives) is to be avoided within the 30 
minutes prior to the anticipated conclusion of the surgical procedure.  The time and dose of fentanyl (and morphine or other morphine derivatives) administered will be recorde d. 
Other opi[INVESTIGATOR_746850]- or intraoperatively, as this may 
confound or influence the subjects’ demand for opi[INVESTIGATOR_746851] (Hour 0 through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]). 
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and other medications (except for analgesic agent s) that are used 
for subject well -being during the intraoperative period may be administered according to 
the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.  The 
time and dose of a ny medication administered during the intraoperative period will be 
recorded.  
• Intraoperative:  Prior to wound closure administer : 
Local infiltration of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% [ADDRESS_1021834] nerve density as shown in Table 4 .

 Postoperative  Concomitant Medications:  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454]: 
Starting at Hour 0 and continuing through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], pain intensity that is not 
adequately controlled with study drug may be treated with IV and PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_746901].  Conversion fro m IV to oral analgesia should be made once subjects are 
tolerating liquid intake.  
− Morphine [ADDRESS_1021835] hour and then 1 to 8 
mg IV Q1H PRN 
− Oxycodone im mediate release (IR) 5 mg PO Q4H (maximum of 10  mg 
Q4H PRN)  
• Acetaminophen : 
All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1021836] dose of study drug (LSD+1) . 
No other analgesic agents except for study drug, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (described above), acetaminophen (through LSD+1), and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] f or venous thromboembolism prophylaxis 
according to the investigator and institutional standards (Section  5.1) are permitted . 
• Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting: 
Subject s may receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV)  according to FDA prescribing information . 
Study Drug: 
Additional doses of study drug will be administered every 24 hours (±1 hour) after the 
first dose.  Dosing will continue until the subject is either discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746844].   The investigator may 
administer a final dose of study drug up to 4 hours ahead of schedule in subjects who are to be discharged.

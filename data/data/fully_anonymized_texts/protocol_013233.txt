survival. 
2.0 Background 
 
High dose chemoradiotherapy supported by [CONTACT_891398], umbilical 
stem cells, or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially 
curative therapy for patients with hematological malignancies.   Many preparative 
regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplant use high-dose chemotherapy with or 
without total body irradiation (TBI).  Comparative studies of TBI and non-TBI 
based regimens have not shown significant differences in efficacy (1).  Because 
of the known side effects associated with TBI (cataract formation, second 
malignancies, hormonal deficiencies), chemotherapy only regimens have a 
potential for major advantages, especially in children.   
 
Thiotepa-Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide 
We have extensive experience with the chemotherapy-only regimen consisting of 
Thiotepa, Busulfan (Bu), and Cyclophosphamide (Cy) with advanced 
malignancies (2, 3).  Bu-Cy is a well established preparative regimen for 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematological malignancies 
(4).  Thiotepa was added to this regimen because of its ability to cross the blood-
brain barrier (5), its in vitro activity against hematological malignancies (6), and 
its non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_891382]-CY.  More than 50 children were treated 
with thiotepa (250 mg/m 2 x 3 days), adjusted-dose busulfan x 3 days (AUC 
1200-1800/micromol/min/L) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 days).  All 
stem cell sources were used including related and unrelated peripheral blood 
stem cells and bone marrow as well as unrelated cord blood (CB) stem cells.  
Two of the 23 patients receiving CB as a stem cell source failed to engraft and 
went on to receive a second transplant. Infection was a frequent cause of death 
in the early years of this study.  With the improvement in HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diagnostic 
techniques, new antibiotics, and overall supportive care, the morbidity and 
mortality from all causes declined. Regimen related toxicities (grade 3-4) were 
predominantly esophagitis, mucositis, emesis, and hepatic dysfunction.  Three 
patients developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD).  All three were transplanted 
prior to the availability of the IV formulation of busulfan.  The erratic absorption of 
BU orally may have contributed to hepatotoxicity since no patients receiving the 
IV formulation of BU developed VOD. Of the 16 patients treated with active

disease at the time of transplantation, only the patients with AML did well.  See

Clofarabine as an antileukemic agent 
Clofarabine is a second-generation deoxyadenosine analog designed to 
improve efficacy and minimize the toxicity of other analogs.  It has a cytotoxic 
activity against a wide variety of leukemias and solid tumors.  Although phase I 
studies are dose finding studies, the pediatric phase I study performed at M D 
Anderson Cancer Center showed definitive responses (7). Of the 25 patients 
with multiple relapsed or refractory leukemias, five patients obtained a 
complete response and an additional 3 patients obtained a partial response for 
an overall response rate of 32%.  The phase II study (8) that enrolled 61 
pediatric patients served as the basis of the FDA approval of clofarabine in 
2004.   
 
Clofarabine in stem cell transplant 
Protocol 2006-0200 (Busulfan-Fludarabine-Clofarabine with allogeneic stem 
cell transplant for advanced refractory acute myeloid leukemia, 
myelodysplastic syndrome and advanced, Gleevec refractory chronic myeloid 
leukemia. A randomized phase II study) is investigating the efficacy of 
fludarabine and clofarabine in combination with busulfan.   
 
The study is designed to determine which of the following combinations is 
optimal.  Patients are being treated on one of the following 4 treatment arms: 
1) Busulfan-fludarabine (30mg/m 2/day) clofarabine (10mg/m 2/day) 
2) Busulfan-fludarabine (20mg/m 2/day) clofarabine (20mg/m 2/day) 
3) Busulfan-fludarabine (10mg/m 2/day) clofarabine (30mg/m 2/day) 
2008-0363 
November 11, 2013
Page 5 of 27
 
4) Busulfan- clofarabine (40mg/m 2/day) 
 
The busulfan dose is adjusted based on pharmacokinetic data to ensure a 
constant AUC daily dose of 6,000 microMol-min (+ 5%). 
 
To date more than four patients have been enrolled on each treatment arm.  
All patients treated on this protocol have engrafted.  The regimen related 
toxicities are tolerable (no grade III or IV non-hematological toxicities).  
Although it is too early to analyze some of secondary endpoints, relapse rate, 
long-term and overall and disease-free survival, only two patients have had 
progressive disease. 
 
Preliminary results of 2008-0363 
We recently presented a poster at ASBMT/IBMTR detailing preliminary results 
of Protocol 2008-0363.  We have [ADDRESS_1248024] blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_891383].  Several patients had active disease at the 
time of transplant.  One patient shortly after engraftment had disease 
progression.

3.0 Background Drug Information 
 
3.1. Thiotepa: 
CHEMISTRY 
Thiotepa, an ethylenimine derivative, is a polyfunctional alkylating agent. The 
drug is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder, containing 15 mg of thiotepa. 
The drug is reconstituted with sterile water for injection resulting in a drug 
concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml. the reconstituted solution has a pH of 
approximately 5.5-7.5. The solution should be further diluted with Sodium 
Chloride Injection before use. 
 
STABILITY 
Both thiotepa powder for injection and reconstituted solutions of the drug should 
be stored at 2-8ºC, protected from light at all times. Reconstituted solutions are 
stable for [ADDRESS_1248025]. Variable 
absorption also occurs through serous membranes, such as the pleura and 
bladder, and from IV injection sites. 
Absorption through the bladder mucosa may range from 10% to almost 100% of 
the instilled dose and is enhanced by [CONTACT_891399]. 
Following IV administration of thiotepa C14, serum concentrations of radioactivity 
reportedly begin to decline within [ADDRESS_1248026] for 72 hours.

3.3 Busulfan (IV BusulfexTM): 
CHEMISTRY 
Busulfan is an antineoplastic alkylating agent. It is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution 
provided in a mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethyleneglycol 400 
(PEG400). It is supplied in 10 ml single use ampoules at a concentration of six 
(6) mg busulfan per ml. Each ampoule contains 60 mg of busulfan in 3.3 ml of 
DMA and 6.7 ml of PEG400. When diluted in normal saline or D5W to a 
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, the resulting solution must be administered within 
eight (8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour infusion of the drug. 
 
STABILITY 
Ampoules should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C (35-46°F). Stable at 4°C for at 
least twelve (12) months. Additional stability studies are in progress. DO NOT 
use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. 
DO NOT use if the solution is cloudy or if particulates are present. 
Solution Preparation: Prepare the busulfan solution as follows (The patient is to 
receive a dose of 130 mg/m2 of busulfan): mix into normal saline to a final 
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. In each bag 6.0 mg busulfan (1.0 ml at 6 mg/ml and 
11 ml saline) should be added to compensate for drug lost in the tubing with each 
infusion (approximately 12 ml at 0.5 mg/ml is lost in the tubing when using the 
controlled rate infusion pump). 
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS. 
 
PHARMACOLOGY 
Busulfan interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA through DNA 
alkylation, and ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid function. 
 
PHARMACOKINETICS 
The pharmacokinetic data suggests that the plasma decay of the formulation fits 
an open one-compartment model with linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range 
of 12 mg-130 mg/m2. 
The drug is slowly excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid. Ten to 
fifty percent (10-50%) of a dose is excreted as metabolites within twenty-four (24) 
hours. 
 
KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS AND TOXICITIES 
Dose limiting toxicity is expected to be hematological when used without stem 
cell support. Other toxicities seen frequently following high-dose busulfan in 
preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation include: VOD, nausea, 
vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis, seizures, rash, and an -like syndrome. 
 
3.4 Thymoglobulin: 
Thymoglobulin® (Rabbit antithymocyte globulin, Genzyme Corporation) will be 
used as an in vivo immunosuppression. 
 
2008-0363 
November 11, 2013
Page 9 of 27
 
CHEMISTRY 
Thymoglobulin is a polyclonal anti-lymphocyte preparation. The drug is supplied 
as a sterile lyophilized powder, containing 25 mg of antithymocyte globulin. It is 
reconstituted 50  500 mL of saline or dextrose solution. 
 
STABILITY : 
The lyophilized powder should be stored in a refrigerator at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F). 
Thymoglobulin should be used within [ADDRESS_1248027] is stable for 36 months at 5-3°C (41 4°F), and 12 months at 37°C (98.6° 
F). Reconstituted product is stable for 72 hours at room temperature 20 to 25°C 
(68 to 77°F). 
Immediately before intravenous administration, dilute reconstituted 
Thymoglobulin in isotonic saline or dextrose solution to a total infusion volume of 
50 to 500 mL (usually 50 mL of IV admixture solution per 25 mg vial). The 
recommended route of administration is intravenous infusion through an in-line 
0.22 micron filter into a high-flow vein.  
 
PHARMACOLOGY 
Mechanism of action: Possible mechanisms by [CONTACT_778947]: T-cell clearance from the circulation and 
modulation of T-cell activation, homing, and cytotoxic activities. Thymoglobulin is 
thought to induce T-cell depletion and modulation by a variety of methods, 
including Fc receptor-mediated complement-dependent lysis, opsonization and 
phagocytosis by [CONTACT_179968], and immunomodulation leading to long 
term depletion via antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and activation of 
apoptosis. 
 
KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS AND TOXICITIES: 
The most common adverse reactions are fever, chills, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, rashes, systemic infections, abnormal renal function tests, 
and serum sickness-like symptoms. Other reported side effects are arthralgia, 
chest and/or back pain, diarrhea, dyspnea/apnea, nausea and vomiting.

gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, peripheral edema, cough exacerbation, 
infection, sepsis and bone marrow suppression including severe neutropenia. 
 
3.6 Filgrastim: 
MODE OF ACTION 
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte-stimulating factor that acts on hematopoietic 
cells to stimulate proliferation, differentiation, and some end-cell functional 
activity. 
 
STORAGE AND STABILITY 
Filgrastim should be stored at 2° to 8° C. Prior to injection, Filgrastim may be 
allowed to reach room temperature, however, any vials left at room temperature 
for greater than 24 hours should be discarded. Vials should not be shaken. Vials 
should be inspected for sedimentation or discoloration prior to administration. If 
sedimentation or discoloration is observed, the vials should not be used. 
 
ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION

3.8    
 
CHEMISTRY 
The Distribution (Vd) is 0.48-0.71 L/kg; crosses placenta; crosses into CSF.  
Protein binding is 10-60%. Hepatically metabolized to active metabolites acrolein, 
4-aldophosphamide, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and nor-nitrogen 
mustard.  Bioavailability is >75%.  Half-life elimination is 3-12 hours.  Excretion in 
urine (<30% as unchanged drug, 85% to 90% as metabolite). 
 
PHARMACOLOGY 
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that prevents cell division by [CONTACT_12783]-
linking DNA strands and decreasing DNA synthesis. It is cell cycle phase non-
specific. Cyclophosphamide also possesses potent immunosuppressive 
properties.  It is a pro-drug metabolized by [CONTACT_891402]: 
 Leukopenia, anemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, increased AST, ALT, 
mucositis, diarrhea, headache, dizziness. Cardiomyopathy, non-specific ST 
changes on EKG. At doses greater than 200mg/kg, Cy can cause fatal 
myocardial necrosis with clinical heart failure.  Hemorrhagic cystitis, SIADH, fluid 
retention, hemorrhagic cystitis are possible. Teratogenic, may cause secondary 
neoplasms, anaphylaxis (rare). 
 
3.9 Mesna (sodium -2-mercapto ethane sulphonate): 
 
Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by 
[CONTACT_91629] (cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide).  It has no intrinsic 
cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy.  Mesna binds with 
acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite produced by [CONTACT_91629], to produce 
a non-toxic thioether and slows the rate of acrolein formation by [CONTACT_12787] 
4-hydroxy metabolites of oxazophosphorines. At the doses used for 
uroprotection, mesna is virtually non-toxic.  However, adverse effects which may 
be attributable to mesna include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
altered taste, rash, urticaria, headache, joint or limb pain, hypotension and 
fatigue.

6.2.1 Thiotepa administration : Thiotepa will be dosed at 5 mg/kg for patients 
who are within 20% of their ideal body weight.  Patients greater that 20% of 
their ideal body weight will be dosed using adjusted body weight. Thiotepa 
will be administered on Day -8 by [CONTACT_271409]-rate pump, 
 
6.2.2 Clofarabine administration : Clofarabine will be dosed per actual body 
weight/actual body surface area. No arbitrary dose adjustment(s) based on 
a perceived need for such modifications of a chemotherapeutic agent in 
high-dose chemotherapy is allowed for clofarabine, since insufficient data 
regarding the impact of such modification(s) on engraftment and 
toxicity/disease-control are available. 
 
Clofarabine is administered at a dose of 40 mg/m2 diluted in NS to produce 
a final concentration of 0.15mg/mL to 0.4mg/mL on each of four (4) 
consecutive days (Days -6 through -3). The doses of Clofarabine are to be 
given immediately preceding busulfan. Intravenous fluids should be 
administered at a rate of approximately 1.5 L/m2/days (125 cc/hr in adults) 
starting the evening before the start of this chemotherapy, after the last 
dose of Busulfan. 
 
6.2.3 Busulfan administration : Pharmacokinetic-guided (PK-guided) treatment: 
  
for pediatric patients 12 years of age and younger, no dose adjustment(s) 
based on a perceived need for modification is allowed for busulfan. For 
children 13 years of age and older and for 
2. This busulfan dose will be administered on Day 7, 
it will be will be given by [CONTACT_271409]-rate infusion pump. The 
pharmacokinetic-guided daily high-dose busulfan dose(s) will be started 
immediately upon completion of the daily Clofarabine doses (on the day 
clofarabine is given). The busulfan doses will be diluted in normal saline 
and administered daily by [CONTACT_778936]. 
 
Busulfan is administered at the dose calculated to achieve a systemic 
exposure dose of 5,000 Mol-min in normal saline for three (3) consecutive 
days (Days -5 to -3), starting immediately after the completion of 
Clofarabine, see below. The Busulfan dose on Day -5 to Day -3 will be 
based on the pharmacokinetic studies to target an AUC of 5,000 -min 
± 10% in this program. This PK-guided, adjusted dose, will be administered 
in an identical fashion to the previously used 130 mg/m2 dose. 
 
The PK adjusted dose of busulfan = Target AUC x busulfan mol. wt 
(0.2463) x busulfan gross clearance normalized to body surface area 
(L/min)+ the dose uninfused in the IV line.

Page 17 of 27
 
If it is not feasible to perform pharmacokinetic monitoring, patients  13 will 
receive a fixed Busulfan dose of 130 mg/m2/day for 3 days. PKs are 
required for children <13 y.o. 
 
Please see special precautions for administration of IV Busulfan. IT IS 
MANDATORY, THAT ACETAMINOPHEN NOT BE USED, BETWEEN 
DAY 9 AND DAY 0, SINCE IT INTERFERES WITH THE METABOLISM 
OF BUSULFAN AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SERIOUS LIVER 
DAMAGE. 
 
Other drugs known to interfere with the metabolism of clofarabine and/or 
busulfan should not to be concomitantly used during the chemotherapy 
administration up to and including the day of transplantation. In particular, 
drugs that are known to affect the hepatic cytochrome P450-systems (such 
as the azoles) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be omitted for at least 
[ADDRESS_1248038] day +1. 
 
6.2.4 Anti-thymocyte globulin: Patients with HLA-haploidentical related donors 
will not receive Thymoglobulin.  Patients receiving a graft from a matched 
unrelated donor or 1-antigen mismatched donor will receive Thymoglobulin; 
1.25 mg/kg on Day 4 and 1.75 mg/kg on Day 3. Thymoglobulin will be 
administered as per regular departmental routines, and will be infused in 
the afternoon of respective days so not to interfere with the chemotherapy 
administration. 
 
6.3 PBSC/Marrow Processing and Infusion 
NOTE: Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_1248039] procedures for ABO 
incompatibility. The cells may be infused fresh or after cryopreservation. 
 
 
ALLOGENEIC MARROW OR HLA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR STEM 
CELL TRANSPLANTATION: PBPC or marrow cells may be collected and 
infused on the day of the transplant or infused after cryopreservation. The 
2008-0363

goal is to infuse >3.0 X 108 marrow mononuclear cells/kg, 5 X 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg from peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC), or a CB with a 
minimum of 2 x 107 total nucleated cells/kg. 
 
For infusion of fresh or cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells, the patient 
should be premedicated with IV steroid(s) and IV diphenhydramine per 
departmental guidelines. A normal saline intravenous drip will be established. 
 
6.4 Supportive Care 
NOTE: This section indicates recommended guidelines regarding supportive 
care. The Investigator may elect to follow other procedures as per 
departmental routines and guidelines. All concomitant medications (i.e. 
supportive care) administered to the patient during the study will be 
documented in the  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1248040] dose of Bu. 
 
6.4.2 Antiseizure prophylaxis is to be given to all patients according to 
department guidelines.  
 
6.4.3 All patients should receive supportive care (allopurinol, menstrual 
suppression, prophylactic antibiotics, empi[INVESTIGATOR_126342], IV Ig, transfusions 
of blood products, hyperalimentation, etc.) as clinically indicated, according 
to departmental guidelines. 
 
6.4.4 Patients may receive G-
size) s.c. starting on Day +1 CB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_513132] +7 for bone marrow 
and peripheral blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_891390] 0.5 per microliter for 3 
days. 
 
6.4.5 GVHD prophylaxis for peripheral blood and bone marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_891391]. Tacrolimus administered at starting dose of 
0.015 mg/kg (ideal body weight) as a 24 hour continuous infusion daily, to 
be changed to oral dosing when tolerated. Tacrolimus is to be tapered as 
indicated after transplant day 90, if no GVHD is present. Tacrolimus is 
adjusted trough level of 5-15 ng/mL. Methotrexate 5 mg/m2 will be 
administered intravenously on days 1, 3 and 6 and Day +[ADDRESS_1248041] transplant. 
The Day 11 methotrexate dose may be held as indicated if mucositis is 
present. 
 
CB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_891392]. Instead of 
methotrexate, patients with CB receive MMF from Days -3 to +30 (stop at 
day +30 if GVHD is not present). If the patient has acute GVHD requiring 
systemic therapy, MMF therapy may be prolonged. MMF is dosed 15 mg/kg 
2008-0363 
November 11, 2013
Page 19 of 27
 
orally twice daily, with a maximum dose of 1 gram twice daily. IV route can 
be used if PO is not tolerated (same dosing).  Patients receiving 
haploidentical stem cell products will receive tacrolimus at doses described 
above and MMF will be dosed TID.  These agents will start on day +5. 
 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1248042] transplant cyclophosphamide administration with Mesna:  
Premedication:  Patients will receive a dose of Mesna 10 mg/kg IVPB just 
prior to the first dose of cyclophosphamide (Cy), that will be repeated 
every 4 hours for a total of ten (10) doses.  Patients will also receive 
ondansetron (or a comparable anti-emetic) and dexamethasone prior to 
each dose of Cy.  
 
Patients will receive Cy on days + 3 and + 4 at a dose of 50 mg/kg per 
dose. Patients weighing within 20% above their ideal body weight will be 
dosed according to actual body weight. Patients weighing more than 20% 
above their ideal body weight will be dosed according to the adjusted body 
weight. Formula to calculate adjusted body weight: Adjusted BW (Kg) = 
IBW + 0.5 (Actual body weight-IBW). The first dose of cyclophosphamide 
must be administered 60 to 72 hours following the start of marrow 
infusion.  
 
Cy will be mixed in D5W to a maximum concentration of 20mg/ml and 
given by [CONTACT_271409]-rate infusion  pump.  Patients should be well hydrated.  
It is recommended to receive IV Fluids at a rate of 150 ml/hour starting the 
evening (Day +2) before the first dose of Cy (minimum of [ADDRESS_1248043] dose) and continued for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1248044] dose. 
For pediatric patients, it is recommended to receive IV Fluids at a rate of 
125 ml/m2/hr starting the evening (Day +2) before the first dose of Cy 
(minimum of [ADDRESS_1248045] dose) and continued for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1248046] dose.

Is defined for the purpose of this trial as the failure to reach an ANC >0.5 X 
109/L within [ADDRESS_1248052] 
100 days after transplantation but who develop a sustained ANC <0.5 x 109/L 
(three consecutive days) will be classified as secondary graft failure, unless 
this is correlated with progression / recurrence of the underlying malignancy.

9.0  Statistical Consideration 
 
Statistical Considerations 
We will monitor the data for safety/toxicity following the methods of Thall and 
Simon (10). The primary outcome of this study will be the survival rate at [ADDRESS_1248054] 60 patients. 
 
The toxicities will be monitored and scored on a daily basis. All regimen related 
toxicities for unexpected non-hematological toxicities will be reviewed with the 
Chair of the Clinical Research Committee (CRC) after the first three patients and 
after six patients. If two or more patients out of the first three patients experience 
a grade IV regimen related toxicity, accrual will be halted for review. 
 
A Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_891396] a 90% chance 
that the true toxicity rate exceeds the target toxicity rate of 0.25. We will employ 
the following monitoring rule for grade 3 and 4 severe adverse events.  (See 
section 10.2.1). 
 
We will stop the trial if P(toxicity > 25% | data) > 0.90. That is, given the 
outcomes from the patients who have already been evaluated, if we determine 
that there is more than a 90% chance that the toxicity rate is more than 25% we 
will stop the trial. This decision rule gives the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. We assume 
a beta (0.5, 1.5) prior distribution for the toxicity rate. This prior distribution has a 
mean of 0.[ADDRESS_1248055] deviation of 0.25. Stop the trial if 
 
[ # of pts with toxicity / # of pts evaluated ] 
 
>/= 5/10, 6/12, 7/15, 8/18, 9/21, 10/24, 11/28, 12/31, 13/34, 14/38, 15/41, 16/44, 
17/48, 18/51, 19/55, 20/58. 
 
The operating characteristics of this study design are shown in Table 1. 
 
 
 
Table 1.  Operating Characteristics of Safety Monitoring Rule 
2008-[ADDRESS_1248056] completed the study we will estimate the toxicity rate with a 90% 
credible interval. For example, if we complete the study with 10 of 60 patients 
with toxicity, then the 90% credible interval for the toxicity rate will be 0.09 to 
0.25. We will also report the posterior probability that the toxicity rate is 
greater than 25%. We will use the Kaplan-Meier (11) product limit method to 
estimate overall survival and relapse-free survival rates with 95% confidence 
intervals at the conclusion of the study. 
 
10.0  Adverse Events 
 
10.1 Definitions 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical event, including 
worsening of increased frequency of an event present at baseline, in a subject 
registered in this study and receiving either of the preparative regimens in 
combination with stem cell transplantation. 
 
Transplant related adverse events:  
For the purpose of this study, common transplant related AE are those known to 
be related to the preparative regimen and stem cell infusion occurring up to [ADDRESS_1248057] transplant. 
 
The following common transplant related events will be captured in the database 
any time when observed: cytopenias post-transplant, including secondary graft 
2008-[ADDRESS_1248058] 
disease. 
 
Serious Adverse Event : any adverse event occurring that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
· Death 
· Life-threatening 
· Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
· In patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
· Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
Attribution 
The Investigator will determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the 
use of the study drugs or procedures and/or participation in this study. This 
relationship will be described as follows: 
Definite: The event is clearly related. 
Probable: The event is likely related. 
Possible: The event may be related. 
Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related. 
Unrelated: The event is clearly NOT related. 
 
10.2 Assessment of Adverse Event 
Ad
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. 
 
10.2.1 Adverse Events Not Considered Serious (regardless of the grade, these 
events are expected to be reversible): 
1. Related to myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia, bleeding, platelets 
and RBCs transfusions. 
2. Fever: Non Neutropenic or Neutropenic without infection 
3. Infections in the presence or absence of neutropenia 
4. Readmissions (lasting <10 days) 
5. Cytopenias post transplant including secondary graft failure 
6. Low blood pressure due to dehydration requiring fluid replacement 
7. Fluid overload leading to cardiac dysfunction 
8. Mucositis 
9. GI related: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea 
10. Organ dysfunction: cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, CNS and/ or renal.

13. Stem Cell Transplant Syndromes: Cytokine Storm, VOD, TTP, 
hemorrhagic cystitis, interstitial pneumonitis (including pulmonary 
hemorrhage), GVHD (acute and chronic). 
 
10.2.2 Adverse Events Considered Serious: 
1. Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306660]/or organ failure requiring 
extensive supportive care (i.e. dialysis, mechanical ventilation). 
2. Readmissions from any cause resulting in a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(>10 days). 
3. Graft Failure/ rejection. 
4. Any expected or unexpected event resulting in an irreversible condition 
and/or leading to death. 
 
10.2.3 Abnormal Lab Findings Due to Underlying Disease 
In this study, patients are expected to experience changes in laboratory 
parameters such as electrolyte imbalances, uric acid changes, liver 
function abnormalities, including elevations of GPT, GOT, LDH and 
alkaline phosphatase. These changes are due to the underlying disease 
and the nature of the treatment including transplantation and 
chemotherapy. These expected changes will not be considered Adverse 
Events and will not be recorded in the eCRF unless in the view of the 
investigator they are judged clinically significant 
 
10.2.4 Study specific AE relationship: Based on the objectives of this study 
incidence of GVHD and graft failure will be considered as adverse events 
definitive related to the study. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1248059] is taken off study while an event is unresolved, 
this will be followed until resolution unless another therapy is initiated. 
Pre-existing medical conditions will be recorded only if the condition 
worsens during active treatment. 
 
The Investigator or Designee will complete and maintain adequate source 
documentation which may include progress notes, laboratory reports, 
discharge summaries, and other original records. The information will be 
stored in a secured location. 
 
10.4 AE Reporting 
Upon the Investigator's awareness of adverse events occurring during 
subject participation, these events will be reported to the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to institutional guidelines and the BMT AE 
Reporting Policy (refer to Appendix E).

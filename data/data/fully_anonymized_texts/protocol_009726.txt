[ZIP_CODE]  Manufacturer: Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Study Rationale: Inhaled nitric oxide has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary hemodynamics in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).    We hypothesize that inhaled nitrite provides a therapeutic approach for patients with PAH for the following reasons: 1. Inhaled nitrite therapy provides a potent, effective treatment that will vasodilate the pulmonary circulation (reduce pulmonary vascular resistance), reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure, and increase cardiac output.  2. This study will provide valuable efficacy and safety insights into the interactions between NO and nitrite, both direct NO generators, with or without background PH therapy, particularly phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (PDE-5I), on pulmonary hemodynamics and right heart function.  3. This study will also provide novel assessments of right ventricular global myocardial function.  4. The results obtained from this study will also lay the groundwork for future large-scale clinical trials that are needed to investigate the efficacy of inhaled nitrite and/or its long-term effects on pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension.    Study Objectives: The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of inhaled nitrite delivered in a dose escalation manner in patients  that may be on background pulmonary hypertension therapy; endothelin receptor antagonist (ETRA), PDE-5I, or prostacyclin analog on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in subjects with pulmonary hypertension.   Study Hypothesis: • We hypothesize that inhaled nitrite treatment will improve clinical parameters of pulmonary vascular and right heart function. Our primary endpoint will be the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) measured by [CONTACT_137910].  • We hypothesize that inhaled nitrite treatment will improve global right ventricular function.

Study Aims: Specific Aims:  1. To determine the efficacy of inhaled nitrite, on the change in pulmonary vascular resistance measured by [CONTACT_137910].  2. To explore the effect of inhaled nitrite on echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters measured: SVR, RV systolic (dP/dtmax/IP, PWRmax/EDV, RV EF, TAPSE), RV diastolic function (dP/dtmin, Tau), Pulmonary vascular impedance / Wave Intensity.  3. To evaluate the safety of inhaled nitrite on systemic blood pressure in patients on background therapy for PAH.  4. To identify the pharmacokinetic relationships of nitrite measures of drug exposure and plasma cGMP, using blood sampling.    5. To identify the changes in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, using analysis of platelets.  6. To compare effects of inhaled nitrite on pulmonary vascular resistance with inhaled NO gas at [ADDRESS_1228881] of inhaled nitrite delivered in a dose escalation manner on the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension undergoing right heart catheterization.  A total of 50 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study which will entail a single right heart catheterization. The study population consisted of subjects with WHO group I PAH (n=20), WHO group II PH (n=20) and subjects with WHO group III PH (n=10) will receive the dose escalation paradigm:  • Each subject will receive a starting dose of 45 mg inhaled nitrite (AIR001 Inhalation Solution), followed by a second dose of 90 mg inhaled nitrite, based on safety and tolerability.

Subjects on oral background PAH therapy (ETRA or PDE-5I) will be instructed to hold their regular PAH regimen on the day of the study visit.    Baseline pulmonary artery hemodynamic assessment, echocardiogram, micromanometry measured simultaneous pressure and flow velocity signals will be performed prior to inhaled nitrite treatment.  Responses to 40 ppm inhaled NO will be measured before nitrite nebulization via a non-rebreather face mask to assess baseline, pre-AIR001 vasodilator responsiveness.  Subjects will receive a starting dose of 45 mg (placed in the nebulizer cup) of inhaled nitrite (AIR001), with one subsequent planned dose of [ADDRESS_1228882] dose. During the study, right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics will be measured continuously, and cardiac output measured at 15 minute intervals, as well as noninvasive systemic blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be tested for the changes in hemodynamics and calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with inhaled nitrite.   Subjects will be monitored closely for changes in blood pressure during the study.  .The presence of severe systemic hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_1228883]-dose will be monitored closely.  Blood samples may be collected for Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) concentration determination, pharmacokinetics (PK) and platelet mitochondrial analysis at pre dose and the end of the each peak dose of nitrite (approx.. [ADDRESS_1228884] inhaled dose).  PK and cGMP measurements will be made on mixed venous blood using PCW pullback samples and venous blood will be collected for platelet mitochondrial analysis.   Subjects will be monitored carefully for occurrences of adverse events, laboratory test abnormalities, and changes in vital signs.

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a relatively rare and devastating illness characterized by [CONTACT_879601].[ADDRESS_1228888] Physicians consensus statement reports that the incidence ranges from one to two cases per million.2 PAH shows a female bias with F:M ratio of 2.3:1. The median age at diagnosis is 36. In the NIH registry, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension required a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than [ADDRESS_1228889]-order relative with PAH. Familial PPH is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance, and has been mapped to a locus designated PPH1 on chromosome 2q33 that produces loss of function mutations in BMPR2.3 Bone morphogenetic proteins, members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of signaling molecules, regulate cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, morphogenesis and cell fate determination. Identified defects of this receptor are predicted to disrupt ligand binding, kinase activity, and heteromeric dimer formation – cellular processes that may ultimately be important in the maintenance of blood vessel integrity.   Familial and sporadic PAH appear to be phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_879579]. The median survival for all subjects in the NIH registry was 2.8 years; the one, three, and five year survivals were 68%, 48%, and 34%, respectively.[ADDRESS_1228890] improved to 87%, 63%, and 54%, respectively.[ADDRESS_1228891] that early symptoms are nonspecific ensures that subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_879580].  Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by [CONTACT_879602] a high resistance to blood flow. The development of clinical PPA may be contingent on a genetic susceptibility (“hit” one) combined with an inciting injurious event(s) to the pulmonary artery EC (“hit” two) that renders it dysfunctional. The inciting event(s) probably cause a state of recurrent or chronic pulmonary vascular injury and repair, resulting in an excessive and adverse vascular remodeling process with associated alterations in gene expression.

Inhaled NO for Pulmonary Hypertension Nitric oxide released from the endothelium as a gas or attached to transport molecules activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle after binding to its heme group, resulting in increased cyclic GMP.  Cyclic GMP activates GMP-dependent kinases that decrease intracellular calcium concentration in smooth muscle, producing relaxation.  Nitric oxide also inhibits synthesis of a potent constrictor peptide, endothelin-1, an action that may contribute to vasodilation.  Inhaled NO may prove efficacious in patients with sickle cell disease and secondary pulmonary hypertension due to its ability to selectively dilate the pulmonary vasculature.10, 11  Nitric oxide diffuses to ventilated alveoli and dilates the blood vessels subserving these gas exchange units but is then inactivated by [CONTACT_33308], preventing systemic hypotension.  This results in a selective reduction in pulmonary artery pressures.  Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a potent acute vasodilator and results in improved hemodynamics in the 15% of PAH subjects who demonstrate vasoreactivity.  However, the usefulness of NO for chronic therapy is limited by [CONTACT_879603].  In subjects who demonstrate vasoreactivity during an acute challenge with inhaled NO or a prostanoid challenge, therapy with calcium channel blockers has been demonstrated to result in improved symptoms and survival.  In subjects who do no not demonstrate an acute vasodilator response, available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879581], ETRA, and PDE-5I. Inhaled NO is now one of the currently used drugs for vasodilator challenges in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and therefore will be used as a comparator for nitrite responses in the current study.  Inhaled NO will be delivered using FDA approved doses of 40 ppm for approximately 5-15 minutes as used routinely in the catheterization laboratory for evaluation of pulmonary vascular responses in patients with PAH.  At doses up to 80 ppm (40 ppm will be used in this study) inhaled nitric oxide rarely produces adverse effects.  Buildup of NO-O2 reaction products in tubing such as NO2, a molecule that can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_879582], can occur if the NO delivery system is not purged daily.  The system will be purged prior to use, and inhaled levels of NO2 maintained well below [ADDRESS_1228893] methodologies to evaluate pulmonary arterial vasodilatory capacity.  1.3.4 Effects of nitrate and nitrite on mitochondria and metabolism.  Mitochondria are critical for oxidizing fuels (i.e., glucose, fatty acids, amino acids) for cellular energy production.  Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria dysfunction, characterized by [CONTACT_879604], altered mitochondrial ROS generation or decreased substrate metabolism is associated with insulin resistance within skeletal muscle.  A human in vivo study by [CONTACT_879605]. These findings suggest that dietary nitrate enhances the efficiency of energy generation through direct effects on muscle mitochondria and may have implications in the metabolic syndrome where mitochondrial dysfunction may play a central role.  During ischemia nitrite is reduced to NO and N2O3 by [CONTACT_879606]: Inhaled Nitrite in Pulmonary Hypertension                                                                     PI: [INVESTIGATOR_879575], MD PRO11080686 _________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Considering emerging data on the role of nitrite and NO in regulating mitochondrial function, we plan to obtain fresh platelets to utilize with extracellular flux analysis (XF analysis (XF24, Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA), a high throughput methodology to evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetics. We aim to measure platelet cell mitochondrial function before and after nitrite inhalation studies. Further, platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics will be measured along with thrombotic activation in patients with pulmonary hypertension. 1.3.4. Effects of Inhaled Nitrite and Interaction between Inhaled Nitrite and Background Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879584].  NO produced from eNOS is subject to rapid inactivation reactions with hemoglobin that greatly limit its lifetime in blood. Recent studies also indicate that NO formed from eNOS is can be oxidized to nitrite by [CONTACT_879607].12 Nitrite transport in blood provides an endocrine form of NO that can be shuttled from the lungs to the periphery, while limiting the exposure of authentic NO to the scavenging red cell environment. Then during the rapid hemoglobin deoxygenation from artery-to-vein, nitrite is reduced back to NO via reactions with hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other heme containing enzymes, such as xanthine oxidoreductase. Once formed, nitrite is a potent vasodilator, potentially regulating basal blood flow and hypoxic vasodilation 14, 20-25 Nitrite limits ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in heart, liver and brain26-28.  Additionally, nitrite limits hypoxic pulmonary vasodilation in a deoxyhemoglobin- and pH-dependent fashion29.  Given the central role of NO in vasoregulation, the association of decreased NO bioavailability in PAH and recently emerging signaling actions of nitrite, a strong foundation of knowledge supports that inhaled nitrite can reduce pulmonary pressures in patients with PAH.

The above supports that inhaled nitrite could potentially exert the same actions as inhaled NO, by [CONTACT_879608]. Nitrite therapy has advantages over inhaled NO: ease of administration (intermittent use with a standard nebulizer), better availability, and lower cost.  Pre-clinical data from a new-born sheep model of hypoxemia-induced fetal pulmonary hypertension indicate that a single nebulized dose of sodium nitrite produced the same vasodilatory effect as 20 ppm inhaled NO (Figure 1). From this, we hypothesize that (a) low-dose, nebulized nitrite can reduce pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with PAH.  Nitrite reverses experimental mouse hypoxia-induced PAH.   Chronic exposure of mice to hypoxia (10% O2) results in pulmonary vascular remodeling, characterized by [CONTACT_879609], increased right ventricular pressures (RVP) and right ventricular hypertrophy. Treatment with low concentrations of nebulized nitrite (dosing and delivery as described in experimental plan), either once or three times per week, significantly prevented the development of PAH, as defined by [CONTACT_879610] (Figure 2, A-C).  Additionally, nitrite treatment 2 weeks into the hypoxic exposure, after the establishment of PAH, halted the progression of PAH and reversed increases in right ventricular pressures. Thus, inhaled nebulized nitrite inhibited both the development of hypoxia-induced PAH and reversed established PAH.   Nitrite reverses monocrotaline-induced PAH.   To determine whether the effects of nitrite therapy on PAH were specific to chronic hypoxia, we examined an additional model of experimental PAH, sodium monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. Similar to its effects in the hypoxia model of PAH, nitrite reduced monocrotaline-induced PAH (Figure 3 A-D).  Nitrite treatment significantly reversed monocrotaline-induced right ventricular hypertrophy and protected against increases in right ventricular pressures.

        1.3.5 Rationale for Dose of Nitrite The low doses of nitrite used in these treatment regimens –  less than 45 mg or 13% of the dose used in the emergency treatment of cyanide poisoning – do not produce methemoglobin levels greater than 3% and have not been associated with clinically significant hypotension.  Aires Pharmaceuticals, who licensed intellectual property pertaining to inhaled nitrite from the NIH, has completed a Phase 1a single dose escalation study designed to define the maximum tolerated dose of inhaled sodium nitrite delivered to normal volunteers following electronic nebulization.  These data, presented in abstract form at the [ADDRESS_1228895] dose (176 mg) a significant decrease in systemic blood pressure and increase in heart rate was found.  At the maximal tolerated dose (MTD);(125 mg) there was an increase in HR (+24 +/-5 bpm) without significant changes in systolic (-3 +/- 2 mmHg) or diastolic (-3 +/- 2 mmHg) blood pressure.  Bioconversion of nitrite was demonstrated by [CONTACT_380972].  Methemoglobin levels increased at the highest doses administered, but remained less than 3.5% in all subjects.  Pharmacokinetic modeling demonstrated dose-proportional increases in peak and AUC plasma nitrite.    Note that in 80 volunteers in phase I studies at the NIH methemoglobin levels never rose higher than 3%.  If levels of methemoglobin rise above approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, a subject may appear cyanotic and experience dyspnea, due to the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin (methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen).  Levels above 50% can cause seizures, hypotension, coma and death.    The effects of the interaction between FDA approved oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371468] (ETRA and PDE-5I) and inhaled nitrite are unknown. It is possible that the combination of the drugs

The patient will be carefully monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter during drug administration and intravenous fluids and vasopressors will be immediately available for the treatment of symptomatic hypotension. In addition we propose a dose escalation regimen to ensure careful drug dose titration.  1.4   SIGNIFICANCE Inhaled nitric oxide has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary hemodynamics acutely in subjects with pulmonary hypertension.  It has been demonstrated to lower pulmonary arterial pressure acutely in preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension, putatively through a mechanism of sustained NO release.  Repeat dosing of inhaled sodium nitrite has also been demonstrated to result in sustained improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics and in pulmonary vasculopathy in animal models of pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesize that inhaled nitrite provides an innovative therapeutic approach for patients     with PAH for the following reasons: 1) Inhaled nitrite therapy provides a potent, effective treatment that will vasodilate the pulmonary circulation (reduce pulmonary vascular resistance), reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure, and increase cardiac output.  2) This study will provide valuable efficacy and safety insights into the interactions between NO and nitrite, both direct NO generators, with or without background PH therapy, particularly PDE5I, on pulmonary hemodynamics and right heart function.  3) This study will also provide novel assessments of right ventricular global myocardial function.  4) The results obtained from this study will also lay the groundwork for future large-scale clinical trials that are needed to investigate the efficacy of inhaled nitrite and/or its long-term effects on pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension.    2.

Screening (Day 0): The potential study subjects are followed on a routine basis in the UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute (HVI), Comprehensive Lung Center (CLC) or an inpatient at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840], are well known or referred to the study investigator. Initial screening evaluations including physical examination, medical history, and clinical laboratory assessments will be conducted to determine study eligibilities during a routine clinic visit at the UPMC HVI, CLC or inpatient at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840]. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.   Experimental Procedures (Day 1): The study visit will occur on the same day subjects are scheduled for their clinically indicated right heart catheterization or who volunteer for a research right heart catheterization for this specific study. Subjects on oral background PAH therapy (ETRA or PDE5I) will be instructed to hold their regimen on the day of the study visit.    Subjects will be evaluated for additional medical history, physical examination, vital signs and pulse oximetry since screening. Laboratory testing will be repeated if baseline laboratory values are clinically significant and warrant repeat testing or inadvertently not collected at the screen visit.  An echocardiogram with documentation of TRV for estimation of right ventricular systolic pressure and assessment of LV systolic and diastolic function will be performed pre and post nitrite inhalation.    Right heart catheterization is performed routinely as a clinical standard of care procedure for diagnostic purposes in this disease population. The standard right heart catheterization is performed with a balloon tipped, flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter), inserted through a sheath in the internal jugular vein. As per standard clinical protocol, hemodynamic recordings of right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output, are made at baseline, and then repeated following pulmonary vasodilator challenge with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO, which is part of the standard clinical right heart catheterization when assessing pulmonary hypertension).  Responses to 40 ppm iNO will be measured before nitrite nebulization to assess vasodilator responsiveness.  As a part of this protocol the subjects may undergo an additional hemodynamic measurement using a micromanometer pressure catheter that may be inserted via the Swann-Ganz catheter distal port.  Measurements with micromanometer and/or Swann-Ganz catheter will be made with simultaneous flow velocity from transthoracic echocardiographic doppler ultrasound at baseline just prior to nebulized AIR001 administration and at the time of the final hemodynamic assessment (60 minutes after second dose). This portion of the study that involves the micromanometer instrumentation is expected to add an additional 5-10 minutes onto the procedure.  Subjects will receive nebulized AIR001 doses escalated based upon safety and tolerability.  The dose of inhaled nitrite will be delivered via electronic nebulizer. During the study right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics will be measured as well as noninvasive systemic blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be tested for the changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) using standard clinical protocol hemodynamic recordings of right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output at time zero, and approximate timelines 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after completion of each nebulization dose.

Subjects removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  2.5. SAFETY MONITORING  Prior studies suggested that hypotension and methemoglobinemia may occur with the use of sodium nitrite. The study treatment of inhaled nitrite will be used safely with careful monitoring and prompt discontinuation of the study treatment in response to systemic hypotension with definitions of dose limiting toxicity as outlined in Table 1.  All subjects will be studied in UPMC Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_879586], and with continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation. Subjects will also be monitored closely for methemoglobin levels during the study treatment.    Following study drug treatment, subjects will be evaluated as an outpatient at the clinic on Day 30 (+/- 5 day window). In addition, an interval telephone assessment will occur on Day 3. Subjects will be followed for evidence of acute or delayed adverse effects from the study treatment and to assess their clinical status. All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_879614], through the study and until the final study visit. Subjects continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_143027]. If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used.  In addition to these formal evaluations, subjects will be encouraged to immediately contact [CONTACT_63789]/or the study coordinator with questions, concerns, or to report new symptoms that occur during their study participation. If appropriate, based upon the evaluation, medical treatments will be provided to subjects, including appropriate referral to physicians or other services at the UPMC.   2.6. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_879587] 1 above, study treatment will be discontinued if any of the following occurs:  • A decrease in systolic BP > 40 mm Hg drop from pre-dose baseline; • Desaturation > 10% from baseline; • A single occurrence of venous methemoglobin level >5%; • Severe DLT criteria met and symptomatic or requiring fluids or treatment; • Any serious adverse event thought to be possibly related to the study treatment.     2.7.

As per standard clinical protocol, hemodynamic recordings of right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures, in addition to cardiac output, are made at baseline, and then repeated following pulmonary vasodilator challenge with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO, which is part of the standard clinical right heart catheterization when assessing pulmonary hypertension).  As a part of this protocol the subjects may undergo an additional hemodynamic measurement using a micromanometer pressure catheter that will be inserted via the Swann-Ganz catheter distal port. The micromanometer catheter will record high fidelity pressure signals for the measurement of pulmonary arterial input impedance. Measurements with micromanometer will be made with simultaneous flow velocity from transthoracic echocardiographic ultrasound at baseline just prior to nebulized AIR001 administration and at the time of the final hemodynamic assessment (60 minutes after second dose). This portion of the study that involves the micromanometer instrumentation is expected to add an additional 5-10 minutes onto the approximate 4 hour procedure. Cardiac Output (CO) Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped through the left ventricle of the heart in a time interval of one minute.  There are a number of ways to calculate CO.  Thermodilution and/or Fick cardiac index are 2 means which will be used for measuring CO for this protocol.  The CO will be the average of the recorded CO collected.    Cardiac Index (CI) Cardiac index is a measurement that relates the CO from the left ventricle in one minute to body surface area (BSA) therefore determining cardiac function to size of the individual.  CI is calculated by [INVESTIGATOR_609]/BSA.   2.12.2. Pulmonary Capi[INVESTIGATOR_879589] (PCWP) provides an indirect estimate of left atrial pressure (LAP). PCWP is measured by [CONTACT_380982]-tipped, multi-lumen catheter (Swan-Ganz catheter) while it is in a branch of the pulmonary artery. Just behind the tip of the catheter is a small balloon that can be inflated with air (~1 cc). The catheter has one opening (port) at the tip (distal to the balloon) and a second port several centimeters proximal to the balloon. These ports are connected to pressure transducers. When properly positioned in a branch of the pulmonary artery, the distal port measures pulmonary artery pressure and the proximal port measures right atrial pressure. The balloon is then inflated, which occludes the branch of the pulmonary artery. When this occurs, the pressure in the distal port rapi[INVESTIGATOR_380951], and after several seconds, reaches a stable lower value that is very similar to left atrial pressure (normally about 8-10 mmHg). The balloon is then deflated and pulmonary artery pressure can again be recorded. The same catheter can be used to measure cardiac output.  Blood samples will be withdrawn from the tip of the wedged catheter at baseline (pre-dose), and at 15 minutes after each dose of inhaled nitrite (45 mg dose and 90mg).  2.12.3  Echocardiography

Percutaneous Oxygen Saturation and Methemoglobin The device (Masimo Rainbow SET® CO-Oximeter) selected for use in this clinical trial has been validated to provide accurate determinations of both SaO2 and methemoglobin levels under conditions of hypoxia and methemoglobinemia. Continuous SaO2 and methemoglobin monitoring will occur prior to study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1228917] dose of AIR001.  2.12.5. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Studies Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed on all subjects enrolled to measure the concentration of inhaled nitrite and its metabolites in blood. The evaluation of the relationship beteween dosage and blood concentrations, and the relationship between blood concentrations and pharmacologic effects will provide valuable mechanistic information about the effects of inhaled nitrite on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in Subjects with Pulmonary Hypertension.  To determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of the inhaled nitrite, blood samples will be collected at pre-nitrite dosing and at the end of nebulization at the presumed peak nitrite concentration for each tolerated dosage time points; approximately [ADDRESS_1228918] inhalation.  Vital signs, blood pressure and pulse oximetry will be measured and monitored closely at each time points. Samples will be immediately centrifuged and frozen at -20°C until the time of analysis.    PK samples will be accurately recorded for the collection time. Covariate information, e.g., age, body weight, height, disease type, concomitant medications, laboratory values, etc., will be obtained at the study visit. This is expected to yield an information-rich data set through dense sampling, enabling better characterization of the PK relationship of inhaled nitrite in subjects with PAH.   2.12.6. Laboratory Testing  Peripheral blood samples will be evaluated for baseline and follow-up comparison purposes which include complete blood count with differential, platelets, electrolytes, glucose, BUN, serum creatinine, liver function tests, PT/PTT, and nt-ProBNP.  Urine pregnancy test may be performed only on female of child-bearing potential on Day [ADDRESS_1228919]’s choice.  Lab results will be added to research chart for comparison.  All 30-day samples will be analyzed at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_879619]-BNP which may be processed and analyzed through the Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine (PACCM) research lab.   Baseline laboratory results within 6 months of screen visit may be used as baseline comparison and will not be repeated for research purposes.  Blood samples may be collected on study visit 1 if baseline screening results are deemed clinically significant and warrant repeat testing or inadvertently not collected at screen visit.

Additional Laboratory Testing Blood samples may be collected for Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) concentration determination and platelet mitochondrial will be collected at the end of nebulization at the at pre dose and the end of the peak dose of nitrite may be collected.  cGMP measurements will be made on mixed venous blood using PCW pullback samples and venous blood will be collected for platelet mitochondrial analysis. These de-identified blood samples will be sent to the research lab on the 12th floor BST for processing.    2.12.8. Specimen collection and management Specimen Collection / Documentation At each sampling time, one mL of blood will be withdrawn and discarded to assure that the solution used to maintain catheter patency does not dilute the sample.  Blood samples will be accurately recorded for the actual sample collection time. Each research PK sample will be labeled with subject’s unique identifier, sample date, scheduled sample collection time, and actual sample collection time.  Covariate information, e.g., age, body weight, height, disease type, concomitant medications, laboratory values, etc., will be obtained at each time point. This is expected to yield an information-rich data set through dense sampling, enabling better characterization of the biomarkers in this patient population.   Specimen Handling and Labeling (De-Identification) Specimens collected will be properly labeled. All research biological specimens and all records associated with the samples will be labeled only with a unique code that contains no personal identifiers. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subject’s identity will be kept in a secure location in the investigator’s office, and will not be available to staff managing samples at the research laboratories.   Immediately upon receipt of the biological specimens, all attempts will be made to process, isolate, collect, and store the specimens. The code number and date on which the specimen is frozen, all other information about the specimen, and subsequent processing will be entered on the specimen processing worksheet.  Specimen Management and Storage Specimens in excess of immediate assay requirements may be stored indefinitely in a locked freezer under the control of the principal investigator.  The blood samples will be stored after appropriate coding to remove patient identifiers. The coding information linking patient identifiers to the stored samples will be maintained in a locked, secure area that will be accessible only to the study investigator. Subjects may request to have their samples destroyed at any time. These samples will be destroyed immediately upon receipt of the subjects’ written request to do so. Identification of which samples to destroy will be available from the coding information linking patient identifiers to the stored samples as described earlier in this paragraph.   Restrictions to Direct Access of Specimens Specimens will be kept in the responsible study investigators’ laboratories indefinitely and will be under the control of the principal investigator.  Investigators or other personnel not involved with the management or operations of the study are not permitted direct access to the specimens.

T-test will be performed to determine difference of mean values for outcome variables at baseline and highest tolerated nitrite.  The secondary endpoints will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) to compare the overall cardiopulmonary hemodynamic effects and the PK endpoints (eg: AUC) for all doses of nitrite.  Safety Analysis Adverse events (AEs) will be grouped by [CONTACT_6764]. AEs occurring pre-treatment, during active treatment and post-treatment will be summarized separately. The number and percentage of subject experiencing at least one AE of any type, AEs within each body system and AEs within each preferred term will be tabulated and listed. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, AEs by [CONTACT_764], drug related AEs, severe adverse events (SAEs), and for AEs leading to withdrawal.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis PK endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The actual sampling times will be used in calculating PK parameters using non-compartmental methods. The PK endpoints namely, AUC, Incremental recovery, t½, Cl, AUClast, Cmax will be analyzed using a multiplicative linear mixed effect models.  Handling of missing data: Every effort will be made to collect complete data on each study day. With respect to safety evaluation, it is not planned to impute missing data.  3.   HUMAN SUBJECTS

RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  4.1 RECRUIMENT METHODS  The potential study subjects will be recruited from the UPMC Heart and Vascular (HVI) and Comprehensive Lung Center (CLC) or inpatients at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]. Potential subjects will be first identified or referred to the investigator who may also be the primary care or treating physician.  The investigator who may already have knowledge of and access to subjects' information may review the subjects’ records to identify potential research subjects for the study. After identifying potentially eligible subjects, the investigator will then approach these subjects to discuss the research opportunity.   To minimize the possibility that subjects will feel obligated to participate, investigators will reinforce with their subjects that participation is voluntary, that they do not have to participate, and the decision not to participate will not affect their care, now or in the future. The investigator will also allow subjects to make further inquiries if they are interested.   4.2 INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation.  Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation in this study will be provided to the subjects and their families.  Consent forms describing in detail the study procedures and risks are given to the subject and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to enrolling in the study.  Consent forms will be IRB approved and the subject will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise.  The subjects will sign the informed consent document prior to being enrolled in the study.  The subjects should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records.  The rights and welfare of the subjects

Following this verbal explanation, potential subjects will be provided with a local IRB approved consent form and will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will provide adequate opportunity for the subject to consider all options, answer any additional questions the potential subject may have. Every effort will be made to ensure that subjects have comprehended the study information prior to obtaining subject's voluntary agreement to participate.  In addition, older potential participants whose competency to consent is in question will be tested for sufficient comprehension and recall of the information presented. Prospective subjects who do not remember the important facts about participation in the research study after repeated testing will not be included in the study. The investigators will also assess whether a participant understands experimental procedures over time, including assessment throughout the full duration of participation in the study.  The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records.  The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_34693].  5.   POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  5.1 POTENTIAL RISKS  As with any experimental procedure, there may be adverse events or side effects that are currently unknown, and certain of these unknown risks could be permanent, severe or life threatening.  Every attempt will be taken to minimize these risks.    Risks of Sodium Nitrite Inhalation Solution: The first-in-man clinical study of AIR001 Inhalation Solution, Study AIR001-CS01, was a dose escalation study designed to identify the dose limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose, and the pharmacokinetics of AIR001 administered.  The most important safety finding was a decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the highest dose tested, [ADDRESS_1228928] doses administered, but remained less than 3.5% in all subjects.    As with any drug product administered via inhalation, it is possible that susceptible individuals, such as those with unrecognized asthma, will develop bronchospasm upon exposure to inhaled sodium nitrite solution.  There were no changes in pulmonary function noted in AIR001-CS01, which excluded subjects with asthma or abnormal baseline pulmonary function tests.

Risks of Nitric Oxide Inhalation: The inhalation of NO is usually well tolerated without side effects. Infrequent risks: decrease pulmonary vascular tone, but because of its short biological half-life will be metabolized or inactivated before reaching the systemic circulation.  Other risks: Massive overdoses of nitric oxide are fatal (from 500-1000ppm).  Risks of Sildenafil/Tadalafil (PDE-5 Inhibitor): These medications are commonly used and FDA approved to treat Pulmonary Hypertension.  These medications may lower blood pressure significantly if taken together with some other medications like nitroglycerin.  AIR001 may cause similar effects in this study in combination with PDE-5I. Subjects will be closely monitored throughout the entire procedure and should blood pressure drop significantly with the first inhaled dose of AIR001, study participant will not receive the next higher dose.  Risks of Blood Drawing: The amount of blood to be drawn over the course of this research study could be a maximum of [ADDRESS_1228930] may feel lightheaded or faint when blood is drawn. This is usually due to nervousness and is not usually serious. Rare risks include infection, and bleeding.   Risks of Echocardiography: This is a noninvasive procedure. There is no known risk associated with this procedure.  Risks of Right heart Catheterization: Common risks: pain at the needle entry site and slight risk of bleeding around the site. bruising at site, lightheadedness or dizziness during the needle stick. Infrequent risks: puncturing the lung which would require a chest tube insertion, irregular heartbeats which usually stop when the long tube is removed from the heart. Very rare complications include cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, low blood pressure, infection, or embolism caused by [CONTACT_879622].  Risks of the Use of Micromanometer Catheter during Catheterization: The micromanometer pressure and flow catheter are FDA approved, and have been used for clinical/investigative indications for over 25 years. Moreover, these catheters do not pose any inherent risk to patients. The catheter will be placed through the clinical Swann-Ganz catheter that is within the preexisting jugular venous sheath. This obviates the need for an additional

Risks of Medications used during Catheterization: The medications used for sedation are relatively brief in duration and should wear off within several hours.  The side effects are listed below for each drug.  1 % Lidocaine: will be used to numb the area prior to the insertion of the cardiac catheter into      either your neck or groin vein. A common side effect is slight burning at the site which dissipates quickly.   Fentanyl: Common side effects include temporary light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting or sweating.   Midazolam: Common side effect includes drowsiness. Infrequent side effects are nausea,    vomiting. Breathing problems are rare.  Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, itching, etc.) to lidocaine, fentanyl, or midazolam are rare.  Risks of Chest X-Ray during the Catheterization A chest x-ray may be done, if clinically indicated, on participants that a neck vein is used for the catheterization.  A chest X-ray performed for the purpose of this research study involves exposure to radiation. Each chest X-ray will result in a radiation dose of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_1228932] sensitive organs of their body. There is no minimum amount of radiation exposure that is recognized as being totally free of the risk of causing genetic mutations (abnormal cells) or cancer. However, the risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure received from participation in this study is considered to be low and comparable to everyday risks.   Reproductive Risks:   It is not known if the study drug can affect an unborn baby. Therefore, subjects should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_56035].  If subjects are physically able to father a baby, subjects must use an effective method of birth control while on this study.  If subjects become aware that they or their sexual partner is pregnant during the course of their participation in this research study, subjects must contact, as soon as possible, the study investigator.   Risks of Breach of Confidentiality:  Participation in this research study does involve the potential risks of a breach of confidentiality of the medical record information and associated privacy of the participants.  This research study will result in identifiable information that will be placed into the subject’s medical records held at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589]. The nature of the identifiable information resulting from participation in this research study that will be recorded in the medical record includes laboratory test results. This potential for breach of confidentiality could impact future insurability, employability, or have other personal consequences for the subjects.  5.2.

Protection Against General Risks of Study Procedures All research interventions/activities will be conducted in private patient care areas. The collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being collected.  All demographic and clinical information about the subject will be stored on an electronic password-guarded study database under the supervision of the investigator for this protocol. The electronic database has not been validated to be in full compliance with the FDA regulations at [ADDRESS_1228933] confidentiality of subjects.  Access to the database will be limited to the data manager and staff under the supervision of the PIs.   To prevent excessive blood sampling, a single withdrawal of blood for a combination of clinically indicated and this research study will not exceed 5% of the circulating blood volume, and the cumulative withdrawal over 1 month will not exceed 10% of the circulating blood volume. In addition, careful attention will be made to cardiovascular status and hemoglobin evaluation.  Specimens will be stripped of subject identifiers and stored securely according to a similar coding protocol as described above. These specimens will be stored safely in the custody of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_879590]. These Investigators will limit future access to any remaining sample to only those investigators with prior IRB approval for their studies.  All staff involved in this study are properly credentialed and instructed in the areas of testing, confidentiality, and safety.

Adverse Event Reporting: The study investigators will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the following definition of an adverse event.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse event definitions  Adverse event. Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study; regardless of the causal relationship of the event with the investigational drug or study treatment(s).  Associated with the use of the investigational drug or study treatment(s).  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_879625](s).  Disability.  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  Life-threatening adverse event.  Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., does not include an adverse event that, had it actually occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  Serious adverse event. Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355817] (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility as a result of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244]; to include transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427807].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical adverse event (e.g., for a preexisting condition not associated with a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition; admission for a protocol-specified procedure) is not, in itself, a serious adverse event.    Unexpected adverse event.  Any adverse event, the frequency, specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information described in the clinical protocol(s) or elsewhere in the current IND application, as amended.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording/Reporting requirements  Eliciting adverse event information Clinical study subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at study visits.  Recording requirements

For all adverse events, sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event should be classified as a serious adverse event) and; 2)  an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse event and the investigational drug or study treatment(s).     Adverse events or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator.  Abnormal test findings An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are met:  • The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].  • The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy    Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed  criteria, does not constitute an adverse event.    • The test finding leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical study  • The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093]-sponsor of the IND application   Causality and severity assessment The investigator-sponsor of the IND application will promptly review documented adverse events and abnormal test findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_879625](s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.  If the investigator-sponsor’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the investigational drug or study treatment(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the investigational drug or study treatment(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator-sponsor’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the investigational drug or study treatment(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.   5.5.6. Reporting of adverse events  [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of adverse events to the FDA Written IND Safety Reports The investigator-sponsor will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 3500 A) to the responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or

Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be provided to all participating sub-investigators.    Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 15 calendar days following the Sponsor’s receipt of the respective adverse event information.  For each written IND Safety Report, the investigator-sponsor and Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. chief medical officer or designee  will identify all previously submitted IND Safety Reports that addressed a similar adverse event experience and will provide an analysis of the significance of newly reported adverse event in light of the previous, similar report(s).  Follow-up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable review division of the FDA as soon as the relevant information is available.  If the results of the sponsor-investigator’s follow-up investigation show that an adverse event that was initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the investigator-sponsor will submit a written IND Safety Report as soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.  Telephoned IND Safety Reports In addition to the subsequent submission of a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 3500A), the investigator-sponsor will notify the responsible review division of the FDA by [CONTACT_879626] 1) associated with the use of the investigational drug or study treatment(s); 2 fatal or life-threatening; and 3) unexpected.  The telephone or facsimile transmission of applicable IND Safety Reports will be made as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after the investigator-sponsor’s initial receipt of the respective human adverse event information.  5.5.7. Reporting adverse events to the responsible IRB  In accordance with applicable policies of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159499] (IRB), the Investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be 1) associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s); 2) serious; and 3) unexpected.  Adverse event reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the respective IRB procedures.   Applicable adverse events will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 10 calendar days following the Investigator’s receipt of the respective information.  Adverse events which are 1) associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s); 2) fatal or life-threatening; and 3) unexpected will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the Investigator’s receipt of the respective information.   Follow-up information to reported adverse event will be submitted to the IRB as soon as the relevant information is available.

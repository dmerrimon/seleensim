Page 3 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/[ADDRESS_103947], assess and incorporate patients’ post -operative 
pain experiences related to pelvic floor surgeries and identify what patients feel is 
important regarding pain experiences and expectations, their management and pre - 
operative education. Second, based  on patient identified themes, assess the impact of 
patient -centered pre -operative education on 1) post -operative narcotic use and return to 
activities and function 2) patient preferences regarding amounts of post -operative 
narcotics prescribed and 3) to a ssess the impact on patient satisfaction and preparedness. 
The central hypothesis  is that the development of patient -centered, pre -operative 
education specifically addressing pain issues and narcotic prescribing practices will 
decrease post -operative narco tic use without curtailing return to normal activity or 
function.  The rationale  for this hypothesis  is that existing  evidence -based,  post-operative 
pain guidelines lack requisite patient input and that aligning patient and surgeon goals 
prior to surgery wi ll help manage post -operative pain expectations, reduce number of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_93986], decrease risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_93987]. Obtaining proof that this approach is clinically feasible and beneficial 
would posit ively influence patient care. The central hypothesis will be tested with the 
following specific aims:  
Specific Aim 1. 1a: To identify patient post -operative pain concerns surrounding pelvic 
floor surgery utilizing qualitative methodology through focus group sessions. 1b: To 
develop and implement pre -operative patient education based on the domains identified  
in specific a im 1a. Patient -centered education will address concerns regarding post - 
operative pain expectations and preferences regarding the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_93988]. Hypothesis: Patients are concerned and apprehensive about post - 
operative p ain related to surgery. The conceptual themes regarding pain issues can be 
incorporated  into pre-operative  patient  education,  expanding  the patient  role in decision - 
making regarding narcotics supplied at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Specific Aim 2. 2a: To randomiz e women undergoing pelvic floor surgery to standard 
pre-operative education versus patient -centered education (as determined by [CONTACT_45061] 1) and 
evaluate whether patient -centered education, compared to routine education, decreases 
narcotic  consumption  without  interfering  with return  to regular  activity  following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954]. 2b: To test whether patient -centered education decreases the quantity of 
narcotics prescribed and/or increases patient satisfaction and preparedness. Hypothesis: 
Patients exposed to pa tient-centered pre -operative education that includes pain 
expectations and patient preference, will decrease quantities of post -operative narcotics 
consumed and prescribed without interfering with return to activities, improving patient 
satisfaction and pr eparedness for surgery.  
Expected  outcomes : Investigation  of post-operative  pain experiences  in women  who have 
undergone pelvic floor surgery will allow creation of patient -centered pre -operative 
educational material and allow inclusion of patients in the s hared decision -making 
process. The resulting positive impact  will be an improved approach to pre -operative 
education and management of post -operative pain in women undergoing pelvic floor 
surgery.

 2. Background  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_93989]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_93990] 7% from 2007 -2012, with concomitant increases in 
narcotic associated emergency room visits and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths.1 A Center for 
Disease  Control (CDC) review reported that long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_93991] -term use. Based on these 
findings,  the CDC  recommended  limiting  narcotic  use for acute,  non-surgical  pain to ≤ [ADDRESS_103948] -operative narcotic prescribing practices, discouraging opi[INVESTIGATOR_93992]. The Washington Medical Directors Group4 
provides particularly useful recommendations (Table 1). Perhaps the most important of 
which are 1) thorough pre -operative counseling, including setting realistic pre -opera tive 
expectations regarding post -operative pain and activity, and 2) optimizing non -narcotic 
analgesics allowing use of the lowest narcotic dose for the shortest duration of time 
(usually < 14 days).  
There  has been  an absence  of significant  improvement  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_93993].2,[ADDRESS_103949] -operative pain 
management that can be disseminated for use by [CONTACT_94021].  
3. Study Design  
This is a single -site mixed  methods  (qualitative  and quantitative  components)  comprised 
of patient focus groups as well as a randomized control trial.  
Aim [ADDRESS_103950] 6 months to a year. Given our patient 
population, we will plan for 2 -3 focus groups conducted in English and 1 -2 focus groups 
conducted in Spanish. Based on internal practice data, approximately 15%  of our patients  
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 5 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/2023   
 are primarily Spanish speaking. Including Spanish -speaking patients will improve the 
generalizability of this study since approximately 25% of Spanish -speakers in the US 
report that they speak minimal to no English.[ADDRESS_103951] each session. The recordings will 
then be de-identified,  transcribed,  reviewed,  and coded  to identify  key words  and phrases, 
which will then be grouped to form preliminary themes. Following each focus group 
session, the transcript will be reviewed and analyzed to identify additional themes and 
emerging concepts. We will revise the  interview guide  as needed prior to each successive 
focus group to ensure that all significant patient themes are identified and explored.  
Following  completion  of the sessions,  identified  themes  will be organized  into domains 
and used to create patient -centered education for Aim 2.  
Aim 2 - This clinical trial will randomize women undergoing pelvic floor surgery to 
standardized routine pre -operative education versus standardized patient -centered pre - 
operative  education  (as identified  in Aim 1) and will compare  group  differences  for the 
following:  
Outcome Measures  
Primary Outcome : 1.Opi[INVESTIGATOR_17010] -- Opi[INVESTIGATOR_93994] (MMEs), within [ADDRESS_103952] reliable 
method  for checking  opi[INVESTIGATOR_20856]. A medication  diary  will document  pattern  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_93995]-narcotic  use and may potentially  serve  as a behavioral  modification  tool for narcotic 
consumption.  
Important  Secondary  Outcomes:  1. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_93996] 6-week follow -up. 2. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information Systems (PROMIS)29 Physical Function SF & Pain Interference 
Questionnaires -- at baseline, 2 and 6 week follow -up. These validated questionnaires 
(available  in English  and Spanish)  measure  patient -reported  physical  activity  and pain in 
the preceding  7 days.30 Raw scores  are translated  into standardized  scores;  mean  T-score 
represent s the average score of the general population and a difference of [ADDRESS_103953] from the mean.  
Other  Secondary  Outcomes:  Patient  Satisfaction  and Preparedness  for Surgery:  We will 
administer Global Questionnaires assessing (1) satisfaction with pre -operative education 
and care and (2) assessing patient’s perceptions regarding preparedness for surgery.  
These  will be administered  to both Spanish  and English  speaking  patients . Questionnaires 
will be scored on a 1 -5 Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). (Other 
validated post -operative satisfaction and preparedness questionnaires are not readily  
available in Spanish ; existing Spanish questionnaires are condition -specifi c -- general or 
urogynecologic post -operative questionnaires are not currently validated .)

4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
We will recruit women cared for by [CONTACT_94022]’s Care Clinic or  Sandoval Regional Medical Center 
undergoing  pelvic  floor  surgery.  Patients  who have  elected  to proceed  will be offered 
study enrollment if they meet the inclusion and do not meet the exclusion criteria.  
The inclusion criteria are: 
1. Subjects are  ≥ 18 years of age 
2. English  or Spanish speaking  
3. Patient  scheduled for pelvic floor surgery  
Exclusion  criteria are as follows:  
1. Unable  to speak  English or Spanish  
2. Using  long acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (e.g. MS Contin, Fentanyl  patch)  
3. Primary  or Pain Healthcare  Provider  recommends  against  study  participation 
(eg. If the patient has a history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_93997], we will contact [CONTACT_94023])  
4. Undergoing  surgeries  that involve:  Neuro/Interstim,  Cysto/hyrdro  distension, 
vaginal botox, mesh excision/complications  
 
Special  populations  such as adults  unable  to consent,  individuals  who are not yet adults, 
pregnant women, and prisoners will not be included in this study.  
We will be excluding women who are unable to speak and understand either  
English or Spanish. The justification for this is the satisfaction surveys are only 
available  in English  and Spanish  and include  the majority  of the patients  care by [CONTACT_88226]. Because these are our secondary objectives, it is important to use these 
standardized  surveys.  Additionally,  we can only conduct  focus  groups  in English  or 
Spanish given our qualitative te am is bilingual only in English and Spanish.  
 
5. Number of Subjects  
This a qualitative  and randomized  control  trial at a single  site – the University  of New 
Mexico’s Urogynecology department.  
Up to 60 participants  will be recruited  for the focus  groups  and up to 198 people  will be 
recruited for the randomized controlled trial at UNM.  
Power  Calculation  & Statistical Analysis : 
Based on our prior qualitative experience; approximately [ADDRESS_103954]  4 focus  groups;  and 
need to recruit 48 subjects.  Given it is possible thematic saturation will not be 
achieved after 4 focus groups; we will recruit additional subjects and complete 
additional focus group until saturation is obtained.  Although a few studies describe  
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 7 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/2023   
 opi[INVESTIGATOR_93998]-Gyn surgery,  we could  not find any studies 
that reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_93999]. 
In order to perform the power calculations necessary for Specific Aim 2 (comparing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_94000]), because the actual number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_94001], we wi ll assume that patient -centered 
pre-operative education will result in a 33% decrease in narcotic consumption 
following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94002]. If we assume that 
controls consume a mean of fifteen 5 mg oxycodone pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (SD of +/ -11 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]), and if 
we assume that the patient -centered group consumes 33% fewer pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (i.e. 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_94003]), we would need a total of 152 participants (76 per 
group) to complete treatment and follow -up for a two -tailed t -test to have  80% power 
at α=0.05. Assuming approximately 30% of patients will cancel surgery after 
randomization  (including  medical  or insurance  issues  or change  their mind)  or will be 
lost to follow -up; we would need to enroll up to 198 women (99 per group) or until 
our designated  power  is met. We will perform  between  group  comparisons  using  Chi- 
squared tests for categorical variables and t -tests for continuous variables. We 
anticipate  that specific  covariates  (e.g. baseline  questionnaire  results,  and narcotic  use 
in last 3 months)  may be confounders  and that multivariable  analyses  will be required 
to evaluate the between group differences in outcomes. Note 1: When studies involve 
consent, an individual is considered a research subject once they have provided 
consent.  If the research includes screening procedures after consent, please indicate 
the number of subjects that need to be recruited and the number that will actually 
participate in the research post -screening.  
6. Study Timeline  
Subjects in Aim [ADDRESS_103955] year (average of 19/month). We will create the database, standardize 
current pre -operative sessions, and prepare the manual of operations and focus group 
script for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_103956] biweekly to weekly focus group meetings during the start -up period of the 
grant cycle. This allows 8 -10 weeks to review our findings and develop a patient - 
centered educational plan. We  will then enroll  up to 198 women or until  our specified 
power is met o ver the next 1 -4 years given the halt of all elective surgeries with the 
Covid pandemic(averaging 11 participants/month). We anticipate finishing 
recruitment by [CONTACT_37112] [ADDRESS_103957] majority of our patients will be

8. Research  Setting  
The study  will be performed  at the University  of New  Mexico  (UNMH)  Women’s  Care 
Clinic and Sandoval Regional Medical Center (SRMC). Potential subjects will be 
recruited in the UNMH and SRMC clinics. After recruitment, they will undergo the 
consent process (written or verbally), and fill out initial questionnaires in the  outpatien t 
offices, by [CONTACT_648], email link to REDCap or HIPAA compliant zoom, whichever works 
best for the participant.  There  are no laboratory  tests in this trial other  than what  would 
be routinely collected for standard of care. There will be no involvement of any 
community advisory board. There will not be any research conducted outside of the 
UNM HSC.  
9. Resources Available  
The previous PI, [CONTACT_94041] joined UNM in [ADDRESS_103963]. Jeppson’s  research  proposal  will pragmatically  study  and implement  an educational 
intervention to decrease post -operative narcotic use. This research augments his 
experience and interest in improving clinical care and patient education. [CONTACT_94041]’s 
thesis project during fellowship, “Improving patient knowledge about sacral  nerve 
stimulation using a patient based educational video” (published in the Journal of 
Urology), clearly demonstrates his commitment to patient education. Although that 
research study evaluated different outcomes, it is similar to this study in that it w as a 
mixed methods project that incorporated patient preferences into educational material.  
[CONTACT_94042] -Gallegos will take over as PI [INVESTIGATOR_94004] a fellow 
and [CONTACT_94043]  has lowered  his FTE with UNM  as he has moved  to a practice  out 
of state.  
The University of New Mexico (UNM) urogynecology division operates at two main 
locations.  UNMH  Women’s  Care  Clinic  located  in northeast  Albuquerque  provides  a full 
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 10 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/2023   
 range  of services  for women  with pelvic  floor  disorders.  The clinic  consists  of eight  exam 
rooms and two treatment rooms.  Our second location is at Sandoval Regional Medical  
Center (SRMC) , a community based facility located in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, a large 
suburb located outside of Albuquerque.  
Research Experi ence:  The Urogynecology Division at UNM has a strong history of 
conducting  high quality  research  and collaboration  with other  investigators  in the US and 
abroad and has consistently met or exceeded recruitment goals on time. We were 
members of the NICHD -sponsored PFDN in the last grant cycle, and have met 
recruitment goals with high rates of follow -up and accurate data collection.  
 
Our group  is well versed  in the importance  of adherence  to protocols,  timely  completion 
of regulatory requirements, effective r ecruitment strategies, and the importance of the 
inclusion of minority subjects. Research is integral to all aspects of Divisional work; 
importantly, all members of the clinical team participate in research efforts.  There are 
weekly research meetings to discuss the progress of the ongoing studies within the 
department, and it is an excellent forum to ensure that all involved are adequately 
informed of their duties, of the protocol, and of the procedures.  
We do not ant icipate that emergency care will be needed for this study, however the 
urogynecology  physicians  are available  on a 24-hour basis,  7 days per week  for their 
patients requiring emergency care.  
10. Prior  Approvals  
There  will not be any approvals  obtained  prior  to commencing  the research.  The study 
was presented for approval by [CONTACT_94024]. The 
signed Departmental Review form can be found in the “supporting documents”.  
This study  does not include  any ionizing  radiation,  biologic  specimens,  or drugs. 
Medications prescribed to participants will be part of their standard of care.  
11. Multi -Site Research  
N/A this is not a multi -site study or a FDA regulated trial. 
12. Study Procedures  
The only procedures subjects will undergo are those that are needed as part of their 
routine  preoperative,  intraoperative  and postoperative  care.  There  are no procedures 
related to the study.  
All surgeries will take place at UNM Main, OSIS or SRMC operatin g rooms. 
Questionnaires and data collection will occur in the Urogynecology clinics at UNM or 
SRMC,  by [CONTACT_648],  HIPAA  compliant  Zoom  or email  link to REDCap,  whichever  is best 
for the participant.  All data will be collected prospectively.

13. Data Analysis  
Power Calculation & Statistical Analysis : Although few studies describe opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d 
prescribing practices following Ob -Gyn surgery, we could not find any studies that 
reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_93999]. In order 
to perform the power calculations necessary for Specific Aim 2 (comparing opi[INVESTIGATOR_94011]), because the actual number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_94012], we will assume that patient -centered pre -operative 
education will result in a 33% decrease in narcotic consumption compared to the control 
group. If  we assume that controls consume a mean of fifteen 5 mg oxycodone pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (SD  
of +/ -11 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]), and if we assume that the patient -centered group consumes 33% fewer 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (i.e. 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_94013]), we would need a total of 152 
participant s (76 per group) to complete treatment and follow -up. Assuming 
approximately 30% of patients will cancel surgery after randomization or will be lost to 
follow -up; we would  need  to enroll  198 women  (99 per group).  We will perform  between 
group comparisons using Chi -squared tests for categorical variables and t -tests for 
continuous variables. We anticipate that specific covariates (e.g. baseline questionnaire 
results, and narcotic use in last 3 months) may be confounders and that mu ltivariable 
analyses will be required to evaluate the between group differences in outcomes.  
 
14. Provisions  to Monitor the  Data to Ensure  the Safety of Subjects  
Subjects will participate in focus groups and then receive preoperative education and 
shared decis ion making on quantity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_94014].  Therefore the 
risks inherent to participation in the study are only minimal.  As this is a minimal risk 
study, our Data Safety Monitoring Plan will entail the review of data monthly by [CONTACT_94025] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a mentoring  co-investigator.  We will assess  for harm  such as over treatment  
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 12 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/[ADDRESS_103968] is not following the study protocol. If a woman is  
withdrawn from the study either at her own discretion or that of the research staff, she 
may continue with the planned surgical procedure performed in the usual fashion.  
To minimize withdrawal from the study, patients will be randomized at their pre - 
operative visit. According to the 2010 CONSORT guidelines, we will analyze all 
participants assessed for eligibility within the study. We will document reasons for 
withdrawal from the study including failure to meet eligibility criteria or participant 
declinin g enrollment into the study. We will report eligibility criteria not met or reasons 
for declining  participation  in the study.  The withdrawal  procedure  is clearly  documented 
in the study consent.  
16. Data Management/Confidentiality  
Randomization assignment will  be generated by a computer based randomization table 
and assigned by a research coordinator.  Assignments will be kept in sealed opaque 
envelopes numbered sequentially, and on the day of the patient’s pre -operative visit, the 
surgeon  will call a research  coordinator  who will open  the next envelope  in the sequence. 
All data collection sheets and questionnaires will contain the subject number and day of 
the clinic visit or day of completion. No other patient identifiers will be collected.  PHI 
including patie nt name, date of birth, phone number, and medical record number will 
need to be collected to track for appointments.  
The data collection,  HIPAA  and consent  forms  will be maintained  in a locked  file cabinet 
in the OBGYN administrative area. A separate folde r will be designated for each 
participant. The offices have the additional security of being badge -access only for 
OBGYN department employees. A key matching study number to subject’s name [CONTACT_94039] a spreadsheet secured on a password protected computer.  
The only PHI collected  will be patient  name,  date of birth,  medical  record  number  and 
telephone number for site use only and to ensure patient follow up. This will not be 
entered into the database, but it will be kept with the other identifying information . 
The data does not include  sensitive  information  or information  requiring  additional

Access to the files and REDCap will be restricted to research personnel and Investigators 
and will be locked  or protected  using  the unique  REDCap  login and password  provided  to 
each co -investigator. The data will be stored for [ADDRESS_103970]  data from  forced  release.  No 
data will be transported to outside locations or shared with external institutions. Focus 
groups will be audio -recorded; the transcriptions will be de -identified and the original 
audio -recordings  will be destroyed  following  manuscript  publication.  There  will be no 
video recordings or photographs taken.  
17. Data and Specimen Banking  
As stated above, the data collection, HIPAA and consent forms will be maintained in a 
locked file cabinet in the OBGYN administrative area. A separate folder will be 
designated fo r each participant. A key matching study number to subject’s name [CONTACT_94040] a password protected computer on a secure UNM OBGYN department server. 
In order to further ensure patient confidentiality, the identifying information will be kept 
separate ly from the numbered study files in a locked cabinet. The data will be maintained 
for [ADDRESS_103971]

Pregnant  women will not be included in the  study, so there  is no risk to embryos/fetuses.  
19. Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
Participation in this study may provide information t hat may help other people who have 
a similar medical problem in the future.  
 
20. Recruitment  Methods  
We will recruit women from  our urogynecology clinical practice  at UNM and SRMC.  
The urogynecology clinics at UNM and SRMC have a large referral population of 
patients who undergo pelvic floor surgery. Participants will be identified in the clinics at 
UNM/HSC and Sandoval Regional Medical Center by [CONTACT_431]. All patients 
scheduled for surgery will be approached for recruitment for the RCT portion of this 
study. The focus group participants will be identified through previous study consents  
that said they would be willing to be contact[CONTACT_5646].  Additionally, the 
urogynecolgy division keeps a computer record of the patients that had urogynecologic 
surgery over the past year as part of our standard care and scheduling.  These patients 
may also be contact[CONTACT_94027] a 
focus group.  Subjects are encouraged to consult with family, friends, and primary health 
care providers, as well as communicate any questions they may have before beginning  
the consent process.  
 
If a woman is withdrawn from the st udy either by [CONTACT_94028], 
or does not desire to participate, she will be offered the same treatment options.  
There  will be  no other  additional materials  to recruit subjects.  
21. Provisions  to Protect the  Privacy Interests  of Subjects  
Focus groups by [CONTACT_94029].  However, participants will be asked 
to keep what was discussed in the focus groups confidential and will be asked to use their 
first names only.  The focus group transcripts will be de -identified.  
Privacy concerns are taken into account with every patient seen at the UNM and SRMC. 
Participants approached and/or interviewed in the clinic setting will be in private offices 
or examination rooms in the UNM or SRMC clinic, where all staff, including resea rch 
staff, are well -versed in sensitive health care discussions and procedures. Telephone 
interviews for recruitment and study data gathering are conducted in the research staff 
area or private physician offices, where all staff have received CITI Training . The office 
area designated for the entire urogynecology research staff is isolated from the clinical 
administrative staff area, providing protection for participants and potential participants 
during screening, recruitment, study -designated calls, and da ta entry.  
 
All study sheets  used to collect  patient information  will be de -identified.  
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 15 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/[ADDRESS_103972] participating in this study will be assigned a unique 
identifier. HIPAA authorization is within the consent. All d ocuments containing personal 
health information (screening logs, consent documents, data forms) are maintained in 
locked file cabinets with access available only to research staff and investigators. Data is 
entered into a password -protected system. No indi vidual identifiers are entered into the 
system. The sole link with personal information is maintained by [CONTACT_32089] a 
password protected computer on a secure UNM OBGYN department server with access 
limited to authorized research staff and investi gators. This information is only to be used 
at the study center.

Page 16 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/2023   
 24. Compensati on for Research -Related Injury  
If participants are injured or become sick as a result of this study, UNM HSC or SRMC 
will provide  emergency treatment  at the study  participant’s cost. No  commitment  is made 
by [CONTACT_94030]. Reimbursement for treatment for all 
related costs of care will be sought from the participant insurer, managed c are plan, or 
other benefits program. The participant will be responsible for any associated co - 
payments or deductibles required by [CONTACT_60737]. Participants will be asked to report 
any illness or injury they believe to be related to the study to the inv estigator or research 
staff. Participants will be given telephone contact [CONTACT_94031] a research subject. They may also be directed  toward the HRPO. This 
language will be stated in the consent document and reviewed during the informed 
consent process. There is no additional risk to participate in this study.  
 
25. Consent Process  
Patients will be approached about the research study at the urogynecology clinics at 
UNM and SRMC, as well as on phone and by [CONTACT_94032], after the patient 
has decided to have surgery. The study consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_94033].  Verbal  consent  will be noted  on the updated  conse nt form  with a space  to 
also sign if the patient has an office visit in person.  Due to the pandemic, research 
coordinators are mainly working from home and going through the consent with 
participants by [CONTACT_94034].  Privacy is still ma intained as the 
coordinator ensures they have a place they can talk privately by [CONTACT_648].  Additionally, 
care will not be withheld if they decide not to participate.  
They  will have  multiple  opportunities  to ask any questions  that they may have,  and they 
will also be provided with the clinic’s contact [CONTACT_94035].  
Subjects  will be reassured  that participation  is completely  voluntary  and does not affect 
their treatment,  their relationship  with their providers,  or the university  to minimize  the 
possibility of coercion or undue influence.  The patients will be asked that they 
understand the opportunity to participate and their complete freedom to decline.  This 
will also be a sked if they understand and if they have any questions.  There is no 
minimum time period needed between informing the patient of the study and time of 
consent.  Subject will be encouraged to take as much time as they need.  
This study will obtain HIPAA author ization prior to enrollment. HIPAA authorization is 
embedded  within  the study  consent  form,  which  will be reviewed  with all participants  by 
[CONTACT_94036].  Specific  information  that will be 
obtained includes prior medical history, surgical history, reproductive health history 
including child bearing, drug allergies, age, and ethnicity. This information will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_37157], not research coordinators, as deemed necessar y for a  
Randomized  trial on  expectations and  pain control  advancement  in surgery: REPAIR  
Page 17 of 21 Version  Date: 2/17/[ADDRESS_103979]  of 
care during preoperative assessment.  
Spanish  speaking  patients  will be included.  We will submit  the translated  documents 
once the study is approv ed by [CONTACT_1201].  
Cognitively  Impaired  Adults  will not  be included  in the study.  
All subjects  will be 18 years  of age or older.  No infants,  children  or teenagers  will be 
enrolled in the study.  
26. Documentation of Consent  
We plan to document consent, and the Consent form is attached. We do not plan on 
collecting/storing  tissue  samples.  We will have  the option  to consent  verbally.  We will 
not be using a script, information sheet, or other mechanism.  
 
27. Study  Test Results/Incid ental  Findings  
We do not intend to share study test or procedure results with study participants. 
Additionally, we do not anticipate that the research being conducted will result in 
incidental findings. Every patient will receive the practice’s standard of  care regarding a 
pre-operative  work  up, which  may include  different  laboratory  tests and imaging  studies, 
as determined by [CONTACT_94037]. These results are not part of the 
research being conducted and will hence be disclosed to the pat ient as appropriate for 
standard of care.  
 
28. Sharing Study Progress or Results with Subjects  
The patients  will not be masked  to their study  arm. We do not intend  to seek out study 
participants to disseminate information once the study is complete. Women who are 
interested  in the results  will be provided  the information  where  to read the manuscript 
once it is published. Study results for individual participants will not be shar ed. 
29. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations  
There  will not be any vulnerable  populations  included  in this study.  Those  electing  for 
surgery  will not be coerced  into doing  so, nor will they be coerced  into participating  in 
this trial.  
 
30. Community -Based  Participatory  Research  
NA. There will be  no involvement  of the community in this research.  
31. Research  Involving American  Indian/Native Populations  
NA. This research  does not specifically  target  this population.  If a Native  American 
woman is a candidate for t his study, she will be offered participation .

I. Waivers  or Alterations  of Consent, Assent,  and HIPAA Authorization  
A. Partial  Waiver of Consent for Screen ing/Recruitment  
We are not requesting a  partial waiver of consent  
Partial  Waiver of HIPAA Authorization for Screening/Recruitment  
We are requesting  a partial  waiver  of HIPAA  authorization  to prescreen  participants. 
Investigators  will review  the medical  records  of potential  participants  in PowerChart 
to determine if they are a good candidate for participation. They may review 
information such as medical history including surgeries and medications.  
The protected health information will not be reused or dis closed to any other person 
or entity,  except  as required  by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized  oversight  of the research  study,  or 
for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information for 
which an authorization or opportunity to agree or obj ect is not required by [ADDRESS_103981] already had 
surgery at UNMH or SRMC.  We will review their medical records through 
PowerChart to ensure they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. PHI that will be 
reviewed in PowerChart will include information such as date of birth, gender 
identity,  and diagnoses.  The only PHI that will be stored  will be the patient’s  name, 
MRN, and the reason they were not approached or included in the study.  This 
spreadsheet  is an encrypted  document  and will be destroyed  at the conclusion  of the 
study.

Study Procedures
Pretreatment EvaluationEligible subjects will be identified from within the patient population
of the study site. There will be no advertisements for study subjects.
On-Study VisitsIntervention Group: All patients in the LMA® Gastro™ group will be
pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen via face mask prior to induction of
general anesthesia. Pre-oxygenation will be administered for 3 
minutes of normal tidal volume breathing or for 8 deep breaths o ver
one minute. 
Once pre-oxygenation is complete, patients will be induced with 0.5-
1mg/kg lidocaine and 1-4 mg/kg propofol.  Upon loss of the patient ’s 
lash reflex, the LMA® Gastro™ will be placed in the patient’s oropharynx.  The cuff should be inflat
ed until the cuff pi[INVESTIGATOR_652181].  Appropriate placement will be confirmed with end tidal CO
2and adequate tidal volumes of at least 
4-5 cc/kg.   Following placement confirmation, sedation will be 
titrated to achieve deep to general anesthesia using a propofol 
infusion at 50 -300 mcg/kg/min.  P ropofol may be supplemented with 
inhalational anesthetics or opi[INVESTIGATOR_652182]
.  
After securing the airway, the patient will be repositioned (if 
necessar y) on the fluoroscopy table in the prone position with head 
facing to the right (although occasionally patient may be positioned in the left lateral decubitus or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) to facilitate the ERCP.  
Positioning is at the discretion of the gastroentero
logist.  After the 
patient is positioned, the anesthesiologist will again confirm that the 
LMA® Gastro™ is positioned properly before allowing the procedure Proprietar y Information of MD Anderson

to begin.  During the procedure, the patient may receive positive 
pressure ventilation keepi[INVESTIGATOR_652183] < 20 mmHg or the 
patient may maintain spontaneous ventilation with or without 
ventilator support, as long as adequate minute ventilation ( ≥5 L/min) 
and appropriate end tidal CO 2(< 45 mmHg) is maintained.
A duodenoscope will be lubricated with KY jelly by [CONTACT_652197]® Gastro™.
Should the LMA® Gastro™ impede completion of the procedure, the 
anesthesiologist will remove the LMA® Gastro™ and either proceed with a native airway or place an endotracheal tube.  T
hisdecision will 
be at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.
Standard Care Group: Patients will be positioned on the fluoroscopy 
table in the prone position with head facing to the right (although 
occasionally patient may be positioned in the left late raldecubitus or 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) to facilitate the ERCP.  Positioning is at the discretion of the gastroenterologist.  Afte r the patient is positioned, the 
anesthesiologist will apply standard nasal cannula at 2
-3 L/minute. 
Patients will be induced with 0.5-1 mg/kg lidocaine and 0.5 - 1 mg/kg 
of propofol and will be started on a propofol drip at 50-200 
mcg/kg /min .  The drip will be titrated to achieve a deep to general 
level of sedation as defined by [CONTACT_388895] (ASA) Contin
uum of Depth of Sedation Scale.  Each 
incidence of desaturation <90% will be noted, as well as the length of 
each desaturation.  The anesthesia provider may utilize nasal trumpets if needed to improve saturations.  The decision to intubate should the pati
entexperience recurrent or prolong desaturations is at 
the discretion of the anesthesiologist and gastroenterologist.

Brief Analysis PlanWe will summarize continuous demographics and clinical variables, 
such as age and anesthesia time, using means, standard deviations, 
medians and ranges. Categorical demographic variables and clinical variables, such as 
gender, incidence of additional airway maneuvers, 
incidence of adverse events and incidence of withdrawal of
duodenoscope from airway to facilitate airway support, w ill be 
summarized through frequencies and percentages.  Fisher’s exact test Proprietar y Information of MD Anderson

will be used to compare the percentage of patients with desaturations 
(SpO 2< 90%) between LMA Gastro and standard nasal cannula groups, 
as well as patient reported sore throat in recovery and other 
categorical variables of interest. Wilcoxon -rank sum test will be used 
to compare continuous outcomes between study arms .  Logistic 
regression model may be fitted to assess the e ffect of important 
covariates on the primary endpoint.
1. OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective: To compare the incidence of desaturation (SpO 2< 90%) between patients 
undergoing ERCP with LMA® Gastro™ vs standard nasal cannula
Secondary Objectives: 
1) To evaluate the incidence of additional airway maneuvers (jaw thrust/chin lift/placement of oral 
airway or/nasal trumpet/intubation)
2) To evaluate the incidence of withdrawal of duodenoscope from the airway to facilitate airway 
support
3) To evaluate the incidence of adverse events
4) To evaluate times related to anesthesia and procedure ( defined as “anes thesia start to anesthesia
end” and “procedure start to procedure end” respectively. Also evaluate time from procedure 
end to anesthesia end)
5) To describe hemodynamics within the two groups (recorded blood pressures, heart rates, oxygen 
saturations, and end tidal CO 2)
6) To evaluate anesthesiologist placing the device (training video viewed, number of practice 
attempts, years of experience)
2. BACKGROUND
There is ongoing debate within the anesthesia an d gastroenterology community concerning the best 
way to manage the anesthetic for patients undergoing ERCP.  Traditionally, anesthesiologists have 
intubated these patients.  However, many ERCP patients are now receiving propofol sedation with a native airway.  It has been demonstrated that moderate propofol sedation frequently progresses to deep anesthesia which is a risk for airway and cardiopulmonary complications.(Bhananker et al., 
2006; Metzner, Posner, Lam, & Domino, 2011; Patel et al., 2005; Perbtani et al., 2016; Sudheer, Logan, Ateleanu, & Hall, 2006)  This type of anesthetic requires constant vigilance on the part of the 
anesthesia provider and, at times, frequent interv entions (chin lift/jaw thrusts or placement of an
oral airway or nasal trumpet).  Furthermore, 28-38% of patients experience oxygen desaturations of < 90% and a small percentage (0.2%) experience aspi[INVESTIGATOR_652184].(Klare et al., 2016; Yang, Farooq, Zwilling, Patel, & Siddiqui, 2016)
Management of a native airway for overweight individuals or for longer procedures is particularly 
challenging.(Cote et al., 2010; Vargo, 2014)  The alternative to propofol sedation with a native airway Proprietar y Information of MD Anderson
'RFXPHQW'DWH

is endotracheal intubation (which is more invasive for the patient, increases anesthesia time, and is 
not without its own risks, such as prolonged muscle paralysis and dental damage).  Osborn et al. demonstrated that it was feasible to perform ERCP with a laryngeal mask airway by [CONTACT_652198].(Osborn, Cohen, Soper, & Roth, 2002)  LMAs are 
generally placed easily by [CONTACT_537946], with a maximum of [ADDRESS_875292] Society.(Frerk et al., 2015)
The LMA® Gastro™ represents a novel device with the ability to facilitate direct endoscopic access 
via the integrated endoscopic channel. The safety of the LMA® Gastro™ for 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ERCP has been demonstrated(Skinner, 10/24/2016), (Hagan, 
2020).  We propose a randomized control trial of the LMA® Gastro™ versus standard nasal cannula 
to elucidate the true oxygenation benefits of this device.  
3. Background Device Information
The LMA® Gastro™ has separate gastric and airway access.  The LMA® Gastro™Airway with Cuff 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]™ Technology from Tel eflex is the only supraglottic airway (SGA) specifically designed to give 
clinicians control of the patients’ airway while facilitating direct  endoscopic access via the integrated 
endoscopic channel.  With the LMA® Gastro™ in place, clinicians can monitor end tidal CO
2for patient 
safety.  The LMA® Gastro™Airway is indicated for airway management in adult patients.
The LMA® Gastro™Airway is a single -use laryngeal mask with a di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)-free 
silicone cuff and airway tube.  The silicone cuff is soft and flexible.  It conforms to patient anatomy 
to create an effective oropharyngeal seal.  The LMA® Gastro™Airway also features Cuff Pi[INVESTIGATOR_652185] –an integrated, cuff pressure indicator that constantly monitors cuff pressure detecting 
changes resulting from fluctuations in temperature, nitrous oxide levels and movements within the 
airway.  It provides at-a-glance feedback, highlighting  changes that could affect patient safety so that 
adjustments can be made when necessary.Proprietar y Information of MD Anderson

7.1 Pretreatment Evaluation
The PI/Co-PI/research coordinator of the study will evaluate the inclusion/exclusion
criteria.  Patients will be approached while in the preoperative area to discuss
participation in the study. The PI/Co-PI/research coordinator will ensure that patients areproperly informed about the study. All study related data will only be collected after thePI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_652187]. 
7.2 Procedure
Intervention Group: Standard ASA monitors will be applied to all patients.  Patients in the 
LMA® Gastro™ group will be pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen via full face mask in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_652188]. Pre-oxygenation will beadministered for 3 minutes of normal tidal volume breathing or for 8 deep breaths over
one minute, or until end expi[INVESTIGATOR_652189] 90%. 
Prior to patient induction, the appropriate size LMA® Gastro™ will be chos en based upon 
manufacturer recommendations and anesthesia assessment.  The inside of the LMA will be sprayed with silkospray.  The LMA® Gastro™ will be fully deflated and the poste rior 
aspect will be lubricated with KY jelly as per manufacturer instructions prior to insertion.  
Once pre-oxygenation is complete, patients will be induced with 0.5-1 mg/kg lidocaine 
and 1-4 mg/kg propofol.  Upon loss of the patients lash reflex, the L MA® Gastro™ will be 
placed in the patient’s oropharynx.  The anesthesiologist may attempt placement for a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_875295] 4-5 cc/kg.  Following placement confirmation, sedation will be titrated to achieve deep to general anesthesia using a propofol infusion at 50-300 mcg/kg/min.  Insufficient sedation with propofol may be supplemented with inhalational anesthetics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and/or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  
After securing the airway, the patient will be positioned on the fluoroscopy table in the 
prone position with head facing to the right (although occasionally patient may be positioned in the left lateral decubitus or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) to facilitate the ERCP.  
Positioning is at the discretion of the gastroen terologist.  After the patient is positioned, 
the anesthesiologist will again confirm that the LMA® Gastro™ is posit ioned properly 
before allowing the procedure to begin.  During the procedure, the patient may receive 
positive pressure ventilation keepi[INVESTIGATOR_652190] <20 mmHg or the patient may 
maintain spontaneous ventilation with or without ventilator support, as long as adequate 
minute ventilation ( ≥5 L/min) and appropriate end tidal CO 2(< 45 mmHg) is maintained.
A duodenoscope will be lubricated with KY Jelly by [CONTACT_652199]® Gastro™.  Should the LMA® Gastro ™ impede completi on of the procedure, 
the anesthesiologist will remove the LMA® Gastro™ and either proceed with a native Proprietar y Information of MD Anderson

airway or place an endotracheal tube.  This decision will be at the discretion of the 
anesthesiologist.  A research assistant will note the frequency of additional airway maneuvers such as chin lift and jaw thrust.
Standard of Care: Upon arrival to the procedure room, standard ASA monitors will be 
applied to all patients. Patients will be positioned on the fluoroscopy table in the prone position with head facing to the right (although occasionally patient may be positioned in the left lateral decubitus or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) to  facilitate the ERCP.  Positioning is at the 
discretion of the gastroenterologist.  After th e patient is positioned, the anesthesiologist 
will apply standard nasal cannula at 2-3 L/minute. A bite block will be placed in the 
patients mouth prior to or simultaneous to beginning sedation. 
Patients will be induced with 0.5-1 mg/kg lidocaine and 0.5 - 1 mg/kg of propofol and will 
be started on a propofol drip at 50-200 mcg/kg/min.  The drip will be titrated to achieve a deep to general level of sedation as defined by [CONTACT_388895] 
(ASA) Continuum of Depth of Sedation Scale.  A duodenoscope will be lubricated with KY 
Jelly by [CONTACT_652200]® Gastro™.  The decision to intubate should the patient experience recurrent (>2 desaturations <90%) or prolonged 
desaturations (desaturation <90% for longer than 1 minute) is at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and gastroenterologist. Insufficient sedation with propofol may be 
supplemented with opi[INVESTIGATOR_54234].  A research assistant will note the 
frequency of additional airway maneuvers such as chin lift and jaw thrust.

All study participants will be assigned a study number.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_652193] a password locked MD Anderson computer.  Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Patient data will be entered 
into a password protected electronic spreadshee t and online database (i.e. REDCap).  Only the 
investigators, who have been invited to participate in the study and who are registered with the IRB, as well as have documented completion of all IRB and HIPAA regulations will have access to patient data, but not the medical record key. 
Electronic records will be stored for [ADDRESS_875300] udy conclusion on the institution’s password 
protected computer, after which time they will be deleted. If there is a breach in confidentiality or violation of IRB and HIPAA regulations, the IRB will be notified in a timely manner (within 7 days) and appropriate actions taken thereafter.  All data used in the analysis and reporting of this investigation 
will be de-identified.  Any photography shall be done in a discrete manner.  Should images run the 
risk of enabling patient identification, identifying characteristics will be obscured electronically prior 
to publication.
In order to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 
all subjects enrolled in the study will be required to provide authorization to disclose Protected Health Information (PHI). This authorization will be included in the informed consent document as 
required by [CONTACT_1201]. In all study reports and in any resulting publications, subjects will not be referred

12. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION AND DATA ANALYSIS
12.1 Randomization
Once patients meet all inclusion criteria, they will be randomized to receive either LMA® 
Gastro™ or standard nasal cannula with a 1:[ADDRESS_875301] a 
significantly smaller percentage of patients with incidence of desaturations less than 90% 
when compared to patients on the standard nasal cannula. The primary endpoint, 'RFXPHQW'DWH
3URWRFRO
'DWH
3DJHRI
incidence of desaturations (SpO 2< 90%), is defined as at any time under sedation during 
procedure a patient has experienced at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_652194] (SpO 2< 90%).  
We assumed the incidence of desaturation (SpO 2< 90%) to be 5% or less in the LMA® 
Gastro™ group(Hagan, 2020). If the in cidence of desaturation (SpO 2< 90%) is 38% in the 
standard nasal cannula group(Klare et al., 2016), then we require 28 patients per group (a total of 56 patients) in order to provide approximately 81% power to detect the difference in incidence of hypoxemia (SpO
2≤90%) using Fisher’s exact test with a two-
sided type I error rate of 0.05 (nQuery Advisor 7.0).
Previous studies had a patient attrition rate of 10% after consent.(Hagan, 2020) Therefore 
we will enroll 64 patients (32 in each study arm) to ensure sufficient evaluable participants. Evaluable patient is defined as a patient who has the assessment for the primary endpoint.

placement on a mannequin 10 times prior to being cleared to begin the study.
b. Data Collection and Management
All study data will either be collected on a paper case report form (CRF) (which will be entered in a
computer database) or will be extracted directly from the EMR to the REDCap database. Each subject
will be assigned a random number code and the key linking the code and the subject identifier willbe stored on an MD Anderson password protected computer. All changes to the CRF will follow GoodClinical Practice guidelines. The Research Manager is responsible for auditing the consistency of thedata transcribed from the paper CRF to the computer. A protocol violation log will be maintainedand all protocol violations will be reported to the IRB.
Members of the research team are responsible for transferring the information to the appropriate 
CRFs.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_652195], or as soon as possible after, the subject procedure or the availabili ty of test results.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_652196](s) to verify that she has reviewed the recorded data.  Upon PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_41473], CRFs will be entered into the passwo rd protected REDCap database for analysis.
Additional clinical monitoring by [CONTACT_652202] ’s discretion.

Summary  
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y [ADDRESS_842857] of care for the long -term secondary prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in patients with myocardial infarction (MI)  or periphera l arterial disease 
(PAD) . However, rates of ischemic recurrences remain high, in part  due to the fact that other 
platelet signaling pathways, such as thrombin -induced platelet aggregation, continue to be activated. 
Vorapaxar is a novel, orally active, comp etitive and slowly reversible protease -activated receptor 
(PAR) -[ADDRESS_842858] of care therapy. This is in part due t o the hyperreactive platelet 
phenotype , which characterizes DM patients, and to inadequate response to oral antiplatelet agents, 
including clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Importantly, in DM patients with prior  MI included in the TRA 2P trial, 
vorapaxar reduced the primary co mposite end point at 3 years by 27% and led to a greater absolute 
risk reduction compared with those without DM. Therefore, vorapaxar is an attractive treatment 
option for DM patients with a prior MI . However, to date the PD effects of vorapaxar in DM 
patients and how these may differentiate from non -DM patients has not been explored. Further, 
current trends in clinical practice are seeing many patients discontinue aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631556]. Hence, the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual antithrombot ic treatment regimen 
combined with  clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458133] ) represents another important area of clinical 
[ADDRESS_842859] DAPT with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631557] . Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed at multiple time point, with different 
assays exploring multiple pathways of platelet aggregation.

 Background and Significance  
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y [ADDRESS_842860] of care for the long -term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events  in patients with 
myocardial infarction (MI) [1]. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_458127] P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor and the 
use of DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458128] (ACS)  [2]. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_631558] , rates of ischemic recurrences remain elevated , especially in high risk patients , 
such as those  with diabetes mellitus (DM)  [2-4]. This is in part  due to the fact that other platelet 
signaling pathways, such as thrombin -induced platelet aggregation, continue to be activated and can 
thus contribute to thrombus formation  [5,6]. In particular, thr ombin is one of the most potent 
platelet activators , and the surface of activated platelets is the main source of circulating thrombin 
[5-7]. Vorapaxar  is a novel, orally active, highly selective, competitive and slowly reversible 
protease -activated recept or (PAR) -1 inhibitor , which  exerts potent  inhibition  of thrombin -mediated 
platelet aggregation  [8,9]. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that vorapaxar has a dissociation 
half-life as long as 20 hours which leads to consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect s [8,9]. 
Importantly, when vorapaxar is added to DAPT , enhanced P2Y 12 inhibition has been shown due to 
the potential interplay between purinergic and thrombin -mediated platelet signaling pathways [10]. 
Recently, vorapaxar (2.5 mg once daily) has been approve d for clinical use by [CONTACT_3361] (FDA) and by [CONTACT_631571] a history of MI or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and 
should be used in addition to standard -of-care antiplatelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  
[11,12]. These indications are largely attributed to the findings of the TRA 2P -TIMI 50 (Thrombin 
Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Eve nts - Thrombolysis 
5 
 in Myocardial Infarction 50) trial  [13]. In particular, the trial showed that the use of vorapaxar in 
addition t o standard antiplatelet therapy  was effective in the secondary prevention of recurrent 
thrombotic events (cardiovascular deat h, MI, or stroke) in patients with previous atherothrombosis, 
particularly those  with prior MI  and PAD , albeit at the cost of increased bleeding  [13,14 ]. 
Patients with DM are known to be at increased risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events, 
which transla tes into worse outcomes, despi[INVESTIGATOR_631559] [ 4,15]. This is in 
part due to the hyperreactive platelet phenotype with upregulation of multiple platelet signaling 
pathways, including thrombin, which characterizes patients with DM  [4]. Importantly,  increased 
platelet reactivity may account for inadequate response (i.e. reduced platelet inhibitory effects) to 
oral antiplatelet agents, including the P2Y [ADDRESS_842861] clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , contributing  to worse 
outcomes [ 4]. Notably , in DM patients and prior MI included in the TRA 2P trial, vorapaxar 
reduced the primary composite end point at 3 years by 27% (p=0.002), and led to a greater absolute 
risk reduction (absolute risk difference: -3.50%) compared with those without DM (absolut e risk 
difference: -1.36%)  with a number needed to treat of 29  [16]. The benefit of vorapaxar was also 
consistent in patients with PAD, although no specific subgroup data are available based on DM 
status [ 17]. Therefore, patients with DM, characterized by [CONTACT_631572], seem particularly attractive for treatment 
with vorapaxar. However, to date the PD effect s of vorapaxar in patients with DM , as well as the 
comparative effects of DM  versus non -DM patients  has not yet been explored.  
Study Rationale  and aims  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_631560] -2P and the potential for an uptake of 
vorapaxar in daily practice, there is limited data on the PD effects of vorapaxar as an add -on therapy 
in key high-risk settings, such as prior MI or PAD patients with DM, where enhanced platelet 
6 
 inhibition by [CONTACT_631573] -1 blockade , may be more clinically beneficial . Further, given the length 
of the TRA -2P trial (median follow -up of 30 months) , many patients were enrolled in the trial while 
on standard DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8258], but then interrupt ed one antiplatelet agent as per 
standard of care [ 13]. Although most patients discontinue clopi[INVESTIGATOR_631561], 
current t rends in clinical practice are seeing many patients discontinue aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631556], which provide s more comprehensive platelet inhibition  compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [18].  
Hence , the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual antithrombotic t reatment regimen combined with 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  (and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458133] ) represents another important area of clinical interest, in order to 
maximize ischemic protection while  reducing the risk of bleeding. Further, the comparative PD 
effects of vorapaxar in addi tion to different combination of antiplatelet therapy in patients with DM 
versus those without DM is currently unknown. A comprehensive understanding of the PD effects 
of vorapaxar as an add -on therapy will thus be informative to the practicing clinician.  Therefore, the 
aim of the proposed investigation is t o assess the PD effects of vorapaxar in addition to DAPT with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631562] , in the setting  of post -MI 
or PAD patients  with and without DM.

[ADDRESS_842863]-MI or PAD patients  with and without DM. Although vorapaxar is approved for use irrespective 
of the timing of the MI, the rationale for including patients after 2 weeks is that this time frame 
allow s clopi[INVESTIGATOR_631563]  [20,21 ]. 
The study will be performed at the Un iversity of [LOCATION_012] Health Science Center at UF Health 
Jacksonville - Division of Cardiology. Patients will be recruited in the Cardiology Clinics of our 
institution and will be screened by [CONTACT_8288], who will verify that all candidates 
meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results from blood tests performed within the last 90 days 
will be considered valid for screening purposes. If these are not available, a blood sample will be 
collected for the screening phase.  
After providing written in formed consent, patients on DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631564] 2.5mg od  in addition to DAPT . Triple therapy ( vorapaxar 2.5mg od plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 
mg od and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg od) will be administered for 30±5 days; then patients will stop aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631565] (vorapaxar 2.5mg od plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg  od) for other 30 ±5 days. 
Blood sampling for PD testing will be conducted at 3 time-point s: baseline (while patients will be 
on standard DAPT ); after 30±5 days of triple  therapy ; 30±[ADDRESS_842864] (7 -10 days). During study treatment major adverse cardiac 
events (death, MI, stroke, and urgent revascularization proce dures) and serious adverse events 
9 
 (bleeding and other adverse events) will be collected  in each group . Bleeding will be de fined by [CONTACT_631574] (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) definition  [22].  
After study completion, patients will resume antiplatelet treatment regimen at the discretion 
of the treating physic ian. A flow diagram of the study design is illustrated below.   
 
 
Laboratory assessments  
Peripheral venous blood samples (20 mL) will be drawn through a short venous catheter 
inserted into a forearm vein and collected in citrate, EDTA, and serum tubes as appropriate for 
assessments. The first 2 -4 mL of blood will be di scarded to avoid spontaneous platelet activation. 
Blood sampling for PD will be performed at 3 time points as indicated above in the study design 
section. Various PD assays will be performed as described below. Given the potential interplay 

10 
 between PAR -1 and P2Y 12 mediated signaling, assessments specific for both pathways will be 
conducted  [10]: 
1. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA)  
2. Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)  
3. VerifyNow P2Y12  
4. Thrombelastograph Coagulation Analyzer TEG 6s Series system (CORA® system)  
5. Serum thromboxane B2  
 
Description of laboratory assays  
1) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) : Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood will be collected in citrated (3.8%) tube s. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel aggregometer 
(Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described [ 23,24 ]. Platelet 
agonists will include AA (1 mM), collagen (3µg/ml ), ADP (5 and 20 µM), TRAP (15 μM), and a 
combination of 2 µg/ml collagen -related peptide + 5 µM ADP + 15 µM TRAP (CAT). The reagent 
cocktail CAT will allow to assess the overall platelet response to a combination of agonists that 
leads to activation of mu ltiple platelet pathways. PRP will be obtained as a supernatant after 
centrifugation of citrated blood at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C 
before use. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) will be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood 
fraction at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. Light transmission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP and to 
100% for the PPP for each measurement. Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and platelet 
aggregation will be determined as the maximal percent cha nge (MPA) in light transmittance from 
baseline using PPP as a reference.  
11 
 2) Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) : VASP phosphorylation (VASP -P) 
is a marker of P2Y [ADDRESS_842865] protoc ol 
using labeled monoclonal antibodies by [CONTACT_458148] -FCM kit (Biocytex 
Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) as previously described [ 25]. PGE1 increases VASP -P levels by [CONTACT_458149]. Binding of ADP to P2Y12 leads to Gi -coupled inhibition of adenylate cyclase. 
Therefore, the addition of ADP to PGE1 -stimulated platelets reduces PGE1 -induced VASP -P 
levels. If P2Y12 receptors are successfully inhibited by [CONTACT_8292], addition of ADP will not reduce 
the PGE1 -stimulated VASP -P levels. The platelet reactivity ratio (PRI) will be calculated after 
measuring VASP -P levels after stimulation with PGE1 (MFI PGE1) and also PGE1 + ADP (MFI 
PGE1 + ADP). The P2Y12 reactivity ratio = ([MFI PGE1] – [MFI PGE1 + ADP]/[MFI PGE1]) x 
100%.  
3) VerifyNow (VN) P2Y12 : The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection 
system which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance 
(Accumetrics, San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instru ctions, as 
previously described [ 25]. The assay is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents 
for the pathways of interest. The VN -P2Y12 assay, by [CONTACT_8293]+PGE1, measures changes in 
platelet function specific to P2Y12 receptor inhibit ors. The assay is based upon the ability of 
activated platelets to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen -coated microparticles aggregate in proportion to 
the number of GP IIb/IIIa receptors expressed. Microbead aggregation is more rapid and 
reproducible if platelets  are activated; therefore the reagents are incorporated into the assay channel 
to induce platelet activation without fibrin formation. Light transmittance increases as activated 
platelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads. The instrument measures this change in 
optical signal and reports results in P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU).  
12 
 4) TEG 6s Series system (CORA® system) : the TEG 6s system (Haemonetics Corporation, 
Braintree, MA, [LOCATION_003]) will be used according to manufacture instructions [ 26]. In brief, the CORA® 
system is a new generation portable thrombelastography technology able to evaluate all phases of 
hemostasis, including time to clot formation, rate of clot formation, strength of clot and residual clot 
strength due to antiplatelet drugs, rate of clot  lysis. Disposable assay cartridges contain all of the 
components necessary to allow the analyzer to prepare samples and perform hemostasis tests. The 
analyzer automatically draws the blood into the active area of the cartridge, meters the exact amount 
required for the test, and mixes it with the reagents spotted in the cartridge. The analyzer then 
monitors the harmonic motion of a pendant drop of blood in response to external vibration. As the 
sample transitions from a liquid state to a gel -like state duri ng clotting, the modulus of elasticity and 
resonant frequency increase. The instrument measures these variations in resonant frequency during 
clotting and lysis. The results are displayed in a table and on a graphical tracing that reflects a 
hemostasis pro file of clot formation. The resulting hemostasis profile is a measure of the time it 
takes for the first measurable clot to be formed, the kinetics of clot formation, the strength of the 
clot, and the breakdown of the clot, or fibrinolysis. In particular, the PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_631566]. The 
PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_8264] a set of agonists, ADP and arachidonic acid ( AA) platelet 
agonists together with ActivatorF, w hich can measure the inhibition of platelet function. This assay 
specifically determines the MA (Maximum Amplitude, a measure of clot strength) and the 
reduction in MA due to antiplatelet therapy and reports it as a percentage of reduction in clot 
strength . The assay uses AA and ADP agonists to generate test results that reflect the inhibiting 
effects of antiplatelet agents such as TxA2 Inhibitors (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) and ADP P2Y 12 inhibitors (e.g., 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]). Since thrombin (present in blood samples) is the primary and most potent activator of 
[ADDRESS_842866] thrombin’ s role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa. 
Thus, with this cross -linked fibrin network as the foundation, additional clot strength due to 
platelet -fibrin bonding related to ADP and AA platelet receptor activation can be measured. The 
HKH reagent , a combination of kaolin and heparinase, generates test data for the uninhibited MA 
resulting from thrombin activation of the blood sample, while the heparinase neutralizes the effects 
of heparin. The HKH test provides measures  of R (Reaction time; the amount of time between the 
start of the test and the beginning of coagulation), K (the speed of formation of the clot from R time 
to a specific clot strength), Angle (the speed of clot strengthening), LY30 (Percent lysis 30 minute s 
after MA is finalized) and MA parameters; The activatorF test provides the contribution of fibrin to 
the overall strength of the clot.   This test value is used in the calculation of aggregation/inhibition 
for MA  ADP and MA  AA. The AA and ADP test provide  measures of MA, percent inhibition and 
percent aggregation.  
5) Serum thromboxane B 2: The concentration of serum thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) will be measured 
by [CONTACT_8296] 2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the 
instructions of the manufacturer, as previously described [ 27]. Briefly, samples will be diluted with 
EIA buffer to bring their concentrations within the range of the standard curve. No other 
purification will be performed on any of the samples. A standard curve will be estab lished by [CONTACT_458150] 2 between 1000 pg/mL and 7.8 pg/mL using EIA buffer as the matrix. The 
concentration of TXB [ADDRESS_842867] concentrations versus percentage bound/maximum bo und.

 Study endpoints and sample size calculation  
The primary end point of our study is the comparison of CAT -induced MPA measured by 
[CONTACT_631575][INVESTIGATOR_7745]. We hypothesize that vorapaxar 
in addition to single antiplatelet therapy with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_631567] -inferior to vorapaxar in 
addition to DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631568] 30± [ADDRESS_842868] deviation of 13% , a 
sample size of 28 patients per group allows for the 95% confidence interval (CI) to stay within ± 
10% with a 80% power and alpha =0.025. Considering the two groups (DM and non -DM), a total of 
56 patients with valid primary end point data will need to be included. Assuming up to 40% rate  of 
invalid results due to haemolysis or drop -out, up to 79 patients will need to be enrolled. Non-
inferiority will be assessed using a 95% CI of the difference in mean MPA between the 2 arms. As 
there are no preliminary data in this setting, the 10% non -inferiority margin was arbitrarily defined. 
Mean values of platelet aggregation and variability wer e estimated based on previous data of 
vorapaxar in addition to DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8258] [ 24]. This approach is in agreement 
with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [28]. 
Other objectives will include the comparisons between DM and non -DM pat ients  of all PD 
parameters measured by [CONTACT_87256], and the comparisons between levels of platelet inhibition 
achieved by [CONTACT_631576] (baseline therapy) versus levels achieved by [CONTACT_631577].  The effects of additive inhibition of the thrombin -mediated platelet activation  pathway, 
with or without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457], on serum thromboxane levels will also be evaluated.  
Statistical analysis plan  
15 
 Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be presented as mean ± SD  or median [IQR] . Continuous variables will be analyzed 
for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. Comparisons between categorical 
variables will be performed using two -tailed Fisher’s exact test or the Pearson' s chi-square test. 
Student´s t test, Mann -Whitney U -test and Wilcoxon test will be used to compare continuous 
variables when appropriate.  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method with a general linear 
model, using baseline variables significantly differen t between groups as covariates, will be used to 
evaluate the overall difference between groups and all between -groups comparisons, in line with 
other PD studies [25]. Student´s t test  or Wilcoxon test  will be used to evaluate intragroup 
comparisons.  Non-inferiority will be assessed using a 95% CI of the difference in mean MA 
between vorapaxar plus prasugrel/ticagrelor and vorapaxar plus DAPT.  
A p-value of <0.025 will be considered to be statistically significant for the non -inferiority 
analysis. A 2-tailed p value of < 0.05 is considered to indicate a statistically significant difference 
for all the other analyses performed. Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_87257] 
v22.0 sof tware (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).  
Publication Strategy/Additional  Information   
Study subjects will be identified first (months 1 -16): we expect to enroll 4 subjects monthly 
and complete enrollment in 16 months (total: 64 subjects enrolled). Months 17-[ADDRESS_842869] prospective study and is based on well -establis hed methods. However, since there is limited 
experience with vorapaxar to define platelet function, variability may be higher than expected and 
16 
 we cannot currently perform a detailed sample size calculation. We anticipate adding this to the 
protocol after inclusion of the study population has been completed. If the sample size after one 
year is estimated to be too small, additional patients will be included. This approach is in agreement 
with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [28]. 
Possible Discomfor ts and Risk  
In clinical trials, the most common clinical side effects of vorapaxar were anemia  (5%) , 
depression  (2.4%)  and rash  (2.2%)  [13,20]. The most important adverse effect associated with the 
use of vorapaxar is bleeding. The risk of TIMI clinically significant  bleeding with vorapaxar  is 
15.8% and 11.1 % with placebo (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36 -1.57, p<0.001) ; the risk of TIMI non -
CABG -related major bleeding with vorapaxar is 2.8% and 1.8 % with placebo (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 
1.22-1.75, p<0.001) ; the risk of intracranial bleeding (intracerebral, subdural or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]) with 
vorapaxar is 1% vs 0.5% with placebo (HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.39 -2.70; p <0.001)  [13]. However, such 
bleeding prevalence occurred in the setting of long -term ( 3 years ) trial, while our study is lim ited to 
only approximately [ADDRESS_842870] also excluded from the study patients at 
increased risk of bleeding complications  [11,12, 29]. Moreover, the use of vorap axar in this study is 
limited to the intended for use population at low  risk of bleeding.  All clinical events described 
above, if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and urgent 
revascularization procedure with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_458153]. Bleeding 
data will be colle cted using BARC  definitions [22]. Clinical events will be evaluated by a local 
committee, comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), not directly involved in the research. 
In the event of a report of a serious adverse event (major bleeding – defined  as life -threatening: 
fatal, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, leading to a drop in hemoglobin of at least 5 g/dL, 
significant hypotension requiring intravenous inotropes, requiring surgical intervention, or requiring 
17 
 transfusion of 4 or more units of b lood; non –life-threatening: substantially disabling, intraocular 
bleeding leading to vision loss, or requiring at least 2 units of blood; thrombocytopenia <50,000 ) 
the local committee will meet and antiplatelet treatment management will be managed accordi ng to 
physician recommendation.  
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any unintended or undesirable experience that occurs during the course 
of the clinical investigation whether or not it is considered to be therapy related.  This includes any 
newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the 
initiation of study treatment.  Adverse events will be followed until resolution while the patient 
remains on -study.  Once the patient is removed from study, events thought to be related to the study 
therapy will be followed until resolution or until the patient starts a new treatment regimen.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE): An adverse event occurring while on study and considered 
related (reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the adverse experience) to the study 
treatment that results in any of the following outcomes:  
- Death  
- A life -threatening adverse experience.  
- A persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or is  a congenital anomaly, or birth  
defect.  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
The definition of serious adverse event also includes ‘important medical event’.  Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercis ed in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
18 
 result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8266]/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.  
Possible benefits  
The present investigation is aimed to evaluate the PD effects of vorapaxar as an add -on 
therapy to standard antiplatelet trea tment  in patients with previous MI  or PAD . This study is not 
designed to evaluate differences in clinical benefit. However, differences in antiplatelet profiles 
may potentially prompt further investigation s of the clinical implication of this difference by  [CONTACT_101485] a larger scale clinical study.

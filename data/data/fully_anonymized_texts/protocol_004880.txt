Effective Date: 25July2018  1.0 BACKGROUND  
There are several types of surgical weight loss procedures. The Laparoscopic Sleeve 
Gastrectomy (LSG) is a restrictive weight loss procedure that is performed by [CONTACT_711132] 75% of stomach. It is estimated that  as many as 84 .1% of the subject s with pre -
existing Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) that undergo the LSG can continue to 
have chronic GERD  symptoms1 and as many as 8.4% of patient s that did not have pre -
existing GERD can develop new onset GERD symptoms. The traditional surgical method 
of using the patients ’ anatomy (fundus ) to perform a fundoplication is no longer an option 
for these patients and the  treatment alternatives for patients experiencing GERD symptoms 
after LSG are few. The Roux -en-Y Gastric by [CONTACT_6476] (RYGB) has been recommended as a 
conversion procedure for those who develop or continue to have reflux after LSG. 
However, the LINX  Reflux Management S ystem (LINX)  has been considered as an 
alternative and less invasive option that may potentially hav e fewer complications 
compared to RYGB .  
 
2.0 THE LINX REFLUX MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
2.1 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The LINX® Reflux Management System is a laparoscopic, fundic -sparing anti -
reflux procedure indicated for patients diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux 
Disease (GERD) as defined by [CONTACT_711129], and who are seeking an 
alternative to continuous acid suppression therapy (i.e. proton pump inhibitors or 
equivalent) in the management of their GERD.   The LINX device is a permanent 
implant placed at the area of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES ) and is designed 
to augment a weak LES and minimize or eliminate GERD -related symptoms.  
2.2 REGULATORY HISTORY  
The LINX System has been evaluated in two IDE studies under G060172.  A 
feasibility study enrolled 44 study subje cts at 4 study centers (2 US, 2 OUS) , with 
the first implant performed in February 2007.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_711118] 100 study 
subjec ts at 14 centers (13 US, 1 OUS) , with the first implant in January 2009.  A 
Post Approval -Study of the LINX System  is ongoi ng to supplement existing safety 
and efficacy data .  The LINX Reflux Management System received approval for 
U.S. marketing from the Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) on March 22, 2012.  
The LINX device consists of a series of titanium beads each with a m agnetic core 
connected together with independent titanium wires to form an annular shape, when 
implanted (Figure 1) .  The attractive force of the magnetic beads is designed to 
provide additional strength to keep a weak LES closed.  During swallowing, the 
 
1DuPree et al JAMA Surg. 2014;149(4):328 -334. doi:10.1001/jamasurg.2013.4323.  
 
Doc. No. 4600 Rev. 5  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 24 
Effective Date: 25July2018  magnetic beads slide away from each other on the independent titanium wire 
“links” to allow esophageal distention as the bolus passes by  (Figure 2) .  
 
  
Figure 1 – Illustration of Implant, Closed  Figure 2 – Illustration of Implant, Open  
 
The LINX System allows a surgeon, using existing laparoscopic techniques and 
instruments, to augment a weak sphincter and restore the barrier function of the 
LES.  The mechanism of action for the LINX device is to augment the sphincter’s 
capacity to resist gastric pressure by [CONTACT_711133].  For abnormal reflux to 
occur following implantation of the LINX device, gastric pressure must overcome 
both the nati ve sphincter resistance and the magnetic bond between the LINX 
beads.  Prior to implant, the esophagus is sized to select a device that fits the 
external diameter of the esophagus.  At rest, the LINX device encircles the LES 
with each bead resting against an adjacent bead, which avoids compression of the 
esophagus and allows the patient to belch or vomit as necessary.  Upon swallowing, 
the magnetic bond between the beads is overcome by [CONTACT_711134], and the device ex pands to accommodate a normal 
swallow (Figures 3 -5).

3.[ADDRESS_967363] had prior gastric surgery, specifically, LSG.  The objective 
of the study is to confirm safety and efficacy after LSG is similar to th e outcomes that 
formed the basis for Premarket Approval (PMA) in order to support modification of the 
current labeling with a statement that prior gastric surgery with LSG has been evaluated 
for safety and efficacy.  
 
4.0 STUDY RATIONALE  
The LSG procedure involves removal of the fundus.  As a result, fundoplication  is 
extremely difficult to perform with the limited amount of fundus tissue present in patients 
with prior  LSG .  Roux -en-Y Gastric by[CONTACT_6476] (RYGB) has been recommended as a 
convers ion procedure for those who develop or continue to have reflux after LSG. 
However, LINX  has been conside red as an alternative and less in vasive option t hat may 
potentially have fewer complications compared to RYGB .  Additionally, patients may not 
be intere sted in RYGB due its associated malabsorption.   The LINX device is implanted in 
the area of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), which is largely undisturbed with LSG.  
Patients with  prior gastric surgery, such as LSG, have not to date been enrolled in clinical 
studies for the LINX device.  This study is the first to prospective ly enroll and evaluate 
under protocol the LINX device for GERD in post-LSG  patients . 
  LINX device creates 
resistance with magnetic 
forces to prevent the LES 
from opening.  Higher pressures from 
swallowing overcome 
the magnetic forces, 
causing the device to 
expand.  LINX device does not 
compress the esophageal 
wall.

7.0 STUDY SCHEDULE  AND ASSSEMENTS  
Table 1  provides a schedule of data collection and follow -up windows.  It should be noted 
that certain data is collected while on and/or off GER D medications.   
Standard of care practices for antireflux surgery will be the basis of the assessments 
performed to determine if a subject  is a candidate for the LINX device.  Investigators 
should refer to the LINX Instructions for Use (IFU) for prescribi ng information ( see 
Appendix A).  Further, the  study center will obtain appropriate study informed consent 
prior to evaluating the subject study specific evaluations.  Data will then be collected at the 
screening/baseline visit, the implant procedure and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711124].  The subjec t will be followed at  2-weeks, [ADDRESS_967371] be

9.0 RISK ANALYSIS  
9.1 POTENTIAL RISKS  
The LINX Reflux Management System has been previously studied and known 
risks associated with the surgical procedure and device implant can be found in the 
Instruction s for Use (Appendix A).  The proposed study will monitor the subjects 
through 12-months  after implant for adverse events .

10.0 STATISTICAL PLAN  
No formal statistical hypotheses we re pre -defined for this study.  Summ ary statistics are 
used to display results of effectiveness out comes at each study time point.  For categorical 
parameters, this includes the number and frequency; and for continuous parameters, the 
mean, median, standard deviation, range and 95% co nfidenc e limits are presented.  For 
continuous efficacy parameters, the p -value for a one -sample, paired t -test to test if there 
is statistical evidence that the change from baseline is ≠ [ADDRESS_967376]’s total distal 
esophageal acid exposure time  will serve as the control and will be 
compared to results at the 12 -month visit.  Normalization for total distal  
ambulatory esop hageal pH testing is defined as pH< 4 for < 4.5% of the 
time.  If longer pH evaluations are received the total distal acid exposure 
time will be recorded as a 24 hour average (e.g. 48 hour Bravo testing) .  
Note:   The same testing equipment used at baseline should b e used at 
subsequent follow -ups if possible.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_967377] -HRQL ( Health Related Quality of Life ) scores will be 
assessed off all GERD medications. The subject’s baseline GERD -HRQL 
score will serve as the control and  be compared to the subject’s GERD -

Effective Date: 25July2018  placement  out to [ADDRESS_967380] X -rays and device erosion will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_711136] 12 month visit.   Incidence of device migration and 
erosion will be compared to current incidence rates (i.e. zero docum ented 
incidents of device migration and a low but established occurrence of esophageal 
erosions) to assess  concurrence of the safety profile of study subjects to that of 
patients without a prior LSG.

Effective Date: 25July2018  11.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
Prior to IRB submission, the Investigator  or designee will prepare an Informed 
Consent Form (ICF)  in accordance with this study protocol and all regulatory 
requirements (e.g. where applicable, 21 CFR Part 50 and in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki) using the  sample ICF provided (Appendix C ).  A copy  
of the final IRB approved ICF must be submitted to Torax Medical and a site 
must be activated by [CONTACT_711144].   All study patients (or their legal guardian) must document 
their consent by [CONTACT_10001] -approved ICF prior to completing any protocol -
specific assessments that are not considered standard of care.   
11.[ADDRESS_967383]  
This protocol , informed con sent form  (ICF) , and authorization for the use and 
disclosure of health information (as applicable) must be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_5243]’s IRB before any study patient is enrolled.  Changes to the 
protocol must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_711145] (as 
applicable) before the change is implemented.  
Prior to study patient enrollment, a signed copy of the IRB approval letter 
addressed to the Investigator and the final approved ICF must be submitted to 
Torax Medical.  The letter shoul d reference this protocol by [CONTACT_60733], date or 
number/revision number as well as the approved ICF and HIPAA Authorization 
(as applicable).  Investigators are responsible for submitting and obtaining initial 
approval and continuing approval from the IRB and fo rwarding copi[INVESTIGATOR_711125].  The original letters are to be kept in the study 
center’s regulatory file designated for this study.  
The Investigator will notify the S ponsor  within five (5) working days of withdrawal 
of IRB appro val. 
11.[ADDRESS_967384] s until the Sponsor provides 
notification that the site has provided all required study start -up documents and 
completed training .  At minimum, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_711126] r 
will be notified in writing of “Site Activation”  when start -up activities have been 
completed .  Upon receipt of this notification, the study center may begin enrolling 
subjects.   
11.[ADDRESS_967385] OF CARE  
As part of screening/baseline , all patients will undergo the standard of care anti-
reflux surgery work -up.  The anti -reflux surgery work -up used for the study 
enrollment should be completed within the 1 -year time period prior to signing of 
the study ICF.  For purposes of the study, the questionnaires (GERD -HRQL,  
 
Doc. No. 4600 Rev. 5  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 24 
Effective Date: 25July2018  Foregut Symptom Questionnaire , and RDQ) will be considered standard of care to 
facilitate pre -screening of patients.  However, only questionnaires completed by a 
subject who has provided informed consent for the study will be accessible to the 
Sponsor.   
11.7 SCREENING/ENROLLMENT  
Potential study subjects will be identified from the Investigator’s practice or by 
[CONTACT_6018].  During the screening/enrollment visit, informed consent will be obtained  
prior to any study specific assessments  and eligibility against the  inclusion and 
exclusion will be confirmed prior to implant .   
11.8 DEVICE TRACKING  
Devices used for the study will be tracked (by [CONTACT_711146] ) 
and captured on the cas e report forms.  
11.[ADDRESS_967386] 
three months (90 days) or longer if needed until resolution  before withdrawing the 
subject from the study.  
If a dec ision is made to explant the LINX device during the study, th e subject will 
be monitored for  explant -related adverse events  for a period of  at least  three 
months ( 90 days) or longer if needed until resolution  before withdrawing the 
subject from the study.  No other study testing and/or questionnaires would be 
required  after the device is explanted . 
For all other subjects s tarting at the time of implantation and proceeding throughout 
the duration of the follow -up period, the Investigator will closely monitor  each 
subject for the development of device and/or procedure related adverse events.   A 
subject presenting with new onset dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, 
may be assessed for d evice migration and/or erosion if symptoms persist and benign 
causes cannot be established, at the discretion of the Investigator .  This may include 
additional, non -study visit , x-rays or endoscopic evaluation.   Adverse events will 
continue to be monitored  at each of the study follow ups until resolution and/or 
study completion.  
For the purposes of this study, a reportable event  will be defined as a ny untoward 
medical occurrence which has a strong relationship to the LINX device and/ or 
implant procedure  and another etiology is unlikely .  The Investigator  must decide 
whether each event meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  All 
device and/or procedure related serious adverse events  (SAE) must be reported 
immediately (wi thin 5 days of discovery ) to Torax Medical.  SAE reporting to the 
IRB is per institutional policy.    
 
Doc. No. 4600 Rev. 5  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 24 
Effective Date: 25July2018  An AE is considered serious  if it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Is life -threatening or results in death  
Note:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “se rious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours  
• Requires prolongatio n of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  of 
body function or structure  
• Other serious important medical events that do not fit in the other 
outcomes and may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) include any serious adverse effects 
on the health or safety of a study subject  or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, the LINX device that are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_711127] p rocedure or the device.  All unanticipated adverse device effects must 
be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_967387].   
 
The following definitions for rat ing the severity of adverse events will be used:  
 
Mild  Awareness of signs of symptoms, but easily 
tolerated; are of minor irritant type; causing no 
loss of time from normal activities.  
Moderate  Discomfort intense enough to cause interference 
with usual activities.  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual 
activities.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_967388] of his/her request to withdraw consent.  If the site staff is u nable to 
obtain written documentation, all information regarding the subject’s withdrawal must be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record.

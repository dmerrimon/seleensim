propranolol’s toxicity to nasal cilia, timolol is the more favorable of the two drugs. Thus, we propose a 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled, 8 -week randomized clinical trial investigating the efficacy of timolol 
gel in the management of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616236].  The Specific Aims are to determine in adults with 
HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]:  
1. If topi[INVESTIGATOR_616237].  
2. If topi[INVESTIGATOR_328235] i s more effective than placebo in improving hemoglobin levels.  
3. The frequency of adverse events, side effects, and safety profile of topi[INVESTIGATOR_616238].  
The study population will consist of: adults with confirmed clinical (meeting at least 3 of the 4 Curaçao 
Criteria) or genetic diagnosis of HHT; Epi[INVESTIGATOR_145746]  (ESS) ≥ [ADDRESS_817040] 5 (or 10) minutes per week; stable nasal hygiene and 
medical regimen for preceding 1 month; stable epi[INVESTIGATOR_616239] 3 months.  We will 
recruit subjects from the Washington University Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) Ce nter of 
Excellence, Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Center of Excellence, and The CureHHT Participate

this effect size will be determ ined to assess the precision of the observed effect and whether a clinically 
meaningful difference is plausible given the observed results. A total sample size of [ADDRESS_817042] with 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0. 05 a difference of 62% or more in the 
percent of subjects who experience reduction of severity of bleeds between treatment groups.  Considering 
a 20% drop out rate, we plan to enroll 30 subjects in the study.   
 
V. STATEMENT OF RESEARCH PROBLEM  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder that leads to 
abnormal formation of blood vessels throughout the body. (McDon ald, Bayrak -Toydemir, and Pyeritz 2011)  
 
 Patient symptoms prim arily consist of bleeding from various mucosal surfaces from telangiectasias 
(dilated capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]) across the total body to more severe or life -threatening hemorrhage from arterio -
venous malfo rmations (AVMs) in the lung, brain, or liver. The telangiectasias tend to spontaneously 
rupture, most commonly resulting in nasal or gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis of HHT is currently with 
the use of the Curaçao Criteria, which involves a combination  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], telangiectasias, visceral lesions 
(AVMs), and a family history of a first degree relative with HHT. Symptoms are age -dependent and 
gradually emerge over time. (Faughnan et al. 2011)   By [CONTACT_654] 20, more than 75% of patients with HHT have 
developed recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. (Dheyauldeen, Abdelnoor, and Bachmann -Harildstad 2011)  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_616240] . 
 
TREATMENT  
 
A variety of medical and surgical treatments are available for epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. A recent evidence -based review was 
performed to provide treatment information .(Halderman et al. 2018)  The authors used the Oxford levels of 
evidence (Group 2011)  to grade the methodological quality of each article and the strength of the evidence.  
A total of 123 abstracts were reviewed covering systemic hormonal therapy, thalid omide, tranexamic acid, 
and propranolol.  Of the 123 abstracts, 1 8 articles were of su fficient methodological quality to be included.  
Systemic h ormonal therapy  delivered as selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene and tamoxifen) 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_616241] 5 articles. (Albinana et al. 2012; Minami and Haji 2016; Whitehead et 
al. 2016; Yaniv et al. 2009; Yaniv et al. 2011)   The level of evidence for systemic hormonal therapy  was 
rated as Grade C and the authors concluded that hormonal therapy has potential benefits of improvement 
in frequency, severity, and number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616242].  Thalidomide  has antiangiogenic properties and 
has been used to treat epi[INVESTIGATOR_616243]. The review identified [ADDRESS_817043] of low -dose thalidomide (50 -200 mg/d) on frequency and 
severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. (Fang et al. 2017; Invernizzi et al. 201 5; Lebrin et al. 2010; Peng et al. 2015)  The 
aggregate level of evidence of the four studies was Grade C and the authors concluded that improvements 
in patients’ bleeding without serious side effects were observed at the lower doses. Tranexamic acid (TXA) 
decreases the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and thus stabilizes blood clots.  The authors reviewed 
5 articles, 2 of which were double -blind ed randomized placebo clinical trials, that examined oral and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_374145]. (Fernandez et al. 2007; Gaillard et al. 2014; Geisthoff et al. 2014; Whitehead et al. 201 6; Zaffar 
et al. 2015)   The results of the two clinical trials  of oral TXA failed to sh ow a change in hemoglobin level but 
did show improvements in various epi[INVESTIGATOR_616244]. The authors concluded that oral TXA is likely 
associated with a reduction in epi[INVESTIGATOR_616245], but additional high -quality studies are 
needed.  The one clinical trial  to examine the impact of topi[INVESTIGATOR_616246].   
 
 The Use of β-Blockers in the Management of HHT -Associated Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]  
 
β-blockers have several possible biological mechanisms of action to reduce HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_616247] a clinically meaningful effect.  The β -blockers propranolol and timolol 
have been studied the most.  
Propranolol.   The non -selective beta -blocker propranolol is used both topi[INVESTIGATOR_616248], respectively. (Price et al. 2018)   While the precise 
mechanism is unclear, it is likely a combination of vasoconstrictive properties of the drug as well as anti -
angiogenic effects (Storch and Hoeger 2010)  and decreased migration of endothelial cells in vitro. (Albinana 
et al. 2012)  Infantile hemangiomas and HHT have similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, both showing 
dysregulated angiogenesis and high levels of tissue VEGF .(Przewratil, Sitkiewicz, and Andrzejewska 2010; 
Zheng et al. 2013)   For these reasons, oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_616249] a treatment for 
HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].  The systematic review identified two small studies (Contis  et al. 2017; Mei -
Zahav et al. 2017)  and the aggregate level of evidence was rated as Grade C.  The one study of oral 
propranolol (Contis et al. 2017)  included 1 0 patients in a retrospective case series and 11 patients in a 
 
 prospective design. In both the retrospective and prospective series, patients reported a significant 
reduction in epi[INVESTIGATOR_616250]. Only one patient had to discontinue therapy due t o 
hypotension.  In a retrospective case series  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_616251] (Mei -Zahav et al. 2017) , clinically significant reduction in frequency and severity of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_616252]  (ESS)(Hoag et al. 2010)  was reported. In addition, 
the investigators report  improvement in hemoglobin levels. Without a control group, however, it is difficult 
to conclude that the beneficial outcomes were due to the propranolol or to increased moisture from the gel.  
The authors of the systematic review (Halderman et al. 2018)  concluded about the use of propranolol 
“Efficacy, or lack thereof, needs to be determined in large, well -designed studies before further use can be 
promoted”.  
 Recent Study. At the 13th HHT International Scientific Conference (June 13 -16, 2019), t he same 
National HHT Center in Israel investigation team lead by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mei -Zahav reported on the results of a Phase 
II randomized cli nical trial followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_616253] . The study included 
20 subjects equally divided and randomized to propranolol 1.5% in a topi[INVESTIGATOR_616254]. topi[INVESTIGATOR_616255] 8  
weeks. Approximated data (raw data not yet available) from Mei -Zahav  showed that the average within 
subject decrease  in ESS in the propranolol group was 2.03 points (SD=1.7) and in the placebo group it was  
0.48 points (SD=0.8) for a mean difference of 1.55 points (95% CI: 0.30 to 2.80; Cohen’s d = 1.2) in favor 
of prop ranolo l group (Figure 1) .  
 
 
Figure 1. Change in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_145746]  (pre – post) as a Function of Intervention  Arm  
 
In Figure 2, the spaghetti plot shows individual subject change in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_616256]. Of the 10 patients in the propran olol group, 8 (80%) experienced 
a clinically meaningful difference while 4 of the 10 (40%) patients in the placebo group experienced a 
clinically meaningful difference (difference in proportion of 40%; 95% CI -2.3% to 67%).

Intervention Arm  
 
Quality of life, as measured by [CONTACT_20763]-12 improved in the propranolol group from 35 ±7 to 41 ±7. There were 
no cardiovascular adverse effects noted in the trial, and the most common side effect was a burning 

 
 sensation on application of the gel to the nasal mucosa. The severity  was usually mild and resolved within 
1-[ADDRESS_817044] igators feel the re is a need to 
modify the drug delivery system  and/or the drug preparation to minimize further the side  effects.  
 Intranasal Propranolol is Not Well Tolerated and is Associated with Adverse Effects on Ciliated 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].   Several studies demonstrated that intranasal propranolol is not well tolerated and is 
associated with arrested cilia movement. Van de Donk et al found that doses as low as 0.1% propranolol 
had a deleterious effect on the cilia of chicken and human tissue .(Merkus et al. 2006)   In Figure 3, the 
effect of propranolol on the ciliary beat frequency over time is shown. As can be seen, propranolol 0.1%, 
which is considerably lower than the 1.5% dosage  used in the Mei -Zahav study, arrested ciliary movement 
within [ADDRESS_817045] of 0.1% propranolol -HCL on the cilia  beat frequency of human 
adenoids . LR – Locke -Ringer solution (control). Reprinted from The Influence of Drugs on 
Nasal Ciliary Movement. (Hermens and Merkus 1987)   
 
 
Duchateau et al studied three different propranolol HCL formulations - oral, sublingual, and intranasal in 
8 heathy male volunteers. (Duchateau, Zuidema, and Merkus 1986)  The 5 -mg intranasal dose was 
administered as a solution of propranolol HCL in 0.2 ml 2% methylcellulose gel, pH 7.4. The authors found 
that propranolol was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_616258].   The authors conclude d that chronic use of 
propranolol should be discouraged due to local s ide effects of stinging sensation in the nose and 
ciliotoxicity.  
 Timolol. Timolol is a non -selective ß-blocker eliminated by [CONTACT_616303]2D6. Topic timolol has been used to treat superficial hemangiomas in infants. (Sorrell and Chamlin 
2013)   Timolol has been shown to have vasoconstriction properties, causes endotheli al cell apoptosis, and 
decreases  VEGF expression. (Storch and Hoeger 2010)    
 
In a case report, Olitsky reported on the intranasal use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_616259] -associated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. (Olitsky 2012)  The 48-year patient had had multiple procedures and treatments in the past, 
including nasal cauterization and use of intranasal bevacizumab, but was experiencing 3 to 4 nosebleeds a 
day.  The patient was started on one drop of timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution in each nostril three times 
per day. Significant reduction in the frequency and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616260] [ADDRESS_817046] of timolol ophthalmic solution (0.5%) delivered as a nasal drop into each 
nostril 3 times daily for 3 months was performed in 1 2 HHT patients who had previously undergone nasal 
dermoplasty. (Ichimura et al. 2016)   The mean score of bleeding intensity and frequency were markedly 
reduced after treatment.  Two patients who had required transfusions before treatment did not need them 
afterward, and patients were generally satisfied with the treatment.  One patient, a [ADDRESS_817047] study reported on the use of intranasal timolol 0.5% ophthalmological solution in a 59 -year -old 
man with a history of HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_616261]. (Ichimura et al. 2016)   He 
had a significant family history of cardiac disease  and developed lightheadedness and sinus bradycardia 
with right bundle branch block within 3 weeks of starting treatment.  The total daily dose of the patient in 
the case study was 6 mg/day, which is not excessive as the typi[INVESTIGATOR_616262] [ADDRESS_817048] on nasal mucosa. (Jagdale, Shewale, and Kuchekar 2016)  Patients 
with certain pre -existing heart conditions or metabolizing variants of the liver enzyme CYP2D6 are at 
increased risk for adverse effects of  timolol ophthalmological solution.   
 
Given our understanding of the pathophysiology of HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], mechanism of action, and 
pharmacokinetics of intranasal timolol, we believe it is now appropriate to conduct a Phase II double -
blinded, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial  to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal timolol gel.  The 
results of this Phase II study will provide additional information on the benefits and risks of intranasal 
timolol, which can be used to inform the design of a definitive Phase III study.

member to review the informed consent process and thoroughly discuss the research protocol, potential 
benefits, and risks of the study .  The informed consent discussion will take place  with the patient and any 
available family members in pers on. Any subsequent questions or concerns from the potential participant 
and any family members will also be addressed at that time. After discussion, the patient will be asked to 
re-summarize the steps involved in the study to ensure understanding. If inte rested, written consent will be 
obtained. Patients will be reminded that study participation is voluntary and will in no way affect their 
current or future care.  
 
Variables Under Study  
 
Assisted Epi[INVESTIGATOR_145746] ( aESS) . Assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616269], the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_145746]  (ESS).(Hoag et al. 2010)  (Appendix 1)  To complete the 
ESS, patients  are asked to consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_616270] [ADDRESS_817051] 1 
month. The ESS contains 6 items – frequency, duration, and intensity of nosebleeds, whether patient has 
 
 sought medication attention, whether patient is anemic, and whether patient has received a blood 
transfu sion.  The overall score ranges from 0 to 10, with severity of nosebleed based on score graded as 
None  composite  score of 0 -1, Mild  1-4, Moderate  4-7, and Severe  as 7-10.T he minimal important 
difference noticeable by [CONTACT_616304] a change of 
0.71. (Yin et al. 2016)  
 
HHT Endoscopy Score (HES) .  The HHT Endoscopy Score ( HES ) is an endoscopy staging score 
developed  as a way to quantify the sev erity of the patient’s nasal telangiectasias as seen on physical 
exam. (Reh et al. 2014)  The HES  was sho wn to correlate with the ESS. Its parameters are telangiectasia 
sites, patterns, crusting, location, perforation, density, and relative AVMs. Scoring of the HES is illustrated 
in Appendix 2.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] -Specific Quality -Of-Life Questionnaire (EQ QoL ).  The EQQo L measures [ADDRESS_817052] of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616271]’s physical, functional, and emotional status and quality of 
life.(Ingrand et al. 2011)   The EQQoL  was shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties and when 
combined with the SF -36 measures both disease -specific and gen eral quality of life.  See Appendix 3 for 
questionnaire.  
 
Short Form (SF -36).  The Medical Outcomes Short Form -36 (SF-36) was developed for use in clinical 
practice and research to measure general physical functional and quality of life. (Ware and Sherbourne 
1992)   The SF-36 includes one multi -item scale that assesses eight health concepts: 1) limitations in 
physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or 
emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities bec ause of physical health problems; 4) bodily 
pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well -being); 6) limitations in usual role activities 
because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. See 
Appendix 4 for questionnaire.  
 
Patient Satisfaction with Treatment.   The Treatment Satisfaction Questionn aire for Medication  
Version II  (TSQMII ) was  is an [ADDRESS_817053] information  (fewer questions and more consistent wording)  regarding four 
general topi[INVESTIGATOR_616272]: effectiveness, side effects, conveni ence, and overa ll 
satisfaction.  (See Appendix 5  questionnaire) (Atkinson et al. 2005; Atkinson et al. 200 4) 
 
Clinical Global Impression Scale  (CGI) .  The overall response to treatment will be measured with the 
Clinical Global  Impression  (CGI) scale. The CGI Scale measures response to treatment for a number of 
disorders and has good internal consistency and validity. (Dunlop, Gray, and Rapaport 2017)  Upon 
completion of the study, subjects will be asked to answer the  following question: " Overall, how would you 
rate your response to treatment ?" Response  options are: Very Much Improved , Much Improved , 
Minimally Improved , No Change , Minimally Worse , Much Worse , and Very Much Worse . 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], Transfusion, and Compliance (ETC) Logs .  Patients will be asked to use the Cure HHT 
app from the online app store if they have a mobile device capable of this feature. It will include a daily 
reminder to track epi[INVESTIGATOR_616273], energy levels, if they received a blood transf usion  
and/or iron transfusion , and if they took their medication.  If the patient answers yes to the transfusion, he 
or she will be prompted to describe the details of the transfusion, including quantity  of units received.  The 
app can directly share the information with the study team at the patient’s request.  
 
If patients are not able to use the app for any reason, a text message and/or email will be sent to the patient 
each evening via the REDCap™ (Research Electronic Dat abase) website that will ask questions about the 
frequency and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616274] . The REDCap™  
 
 survey will assess for compliance by [CONTACT_616305]. Once each week, the survey will ask the subject  if he or she received  a blood transfusion that week. 
REDCap™ is a password -protected site that will keep the information confidential.  
 
Methods  
 
Demographic information , including age, gender, and race,  will be collected from each enrolled patient . 
Data will be collected regarding the duration  of each patient’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_616275], previous treatments, and 
estimation of the average number of nosebleeds per day; HHT treatment history ; co-morbid conditi ons, 
such as hypertension, inhalant allergies, and other blood dyscrasias; risk factors, such as cigarette 
smoking, use of CPAP, and use of supplemental oxygen; and medications associated with increased 
bleeding.   
 
At the initial visit, researc h subjects  will complete  the infor med consent process, SF-36, ESS, baseline 
electrocardiogram (ECG), CYP2D6 enzyme allele, blood pre ssure (BP), and heart rate  (HR ). ECGs are to be 
read  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Murali Chakinala . Subjects will undergo a direct ed otolaryngology physical exam by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616276]. [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_616277].   Patients will be schedule d for phlebotomy to obtain a 
bloo d specimen to measure  hemoglobin levels prior to beginning therapy. Baseline daily iron 
supplementation will also be recorded and  it will be  recommended  to the patient not to alter their daily 
supplementation  of iron or other treatments , unless indicated by a change in epi[INVESTIGATOR_616278] .  
 
Upon demonstration that patient does not have the CYP2D6 allele associated with a low or intermediate 
metabolizer of timolol and successful completion of questionnaires, physical examination,  and laboratory 
tests, subjects will be randomized to receive either timolol  gel or placebo.  
 
Pharmaceutical Preparation . The intervention will be prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_616306], Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.  Timolol nasal gel 0.1% will be prepared with a poloxamer gel 
(combination of poloxamer 188 and 407; pH adjusted to 4.5 -6.5) and  0.[ADDRESS_817054] weekly at home with the use of the blood 
pressure monitor given to them at the beginning of the study and blood pressures will be reported via the 
use of REDCap™ . Subjects  will also be instructed to re port any local or systemic side effects throu ghout the 
duration of the study . Telephone c alls with the study team at the end of Week [ADDRESS_817055] blood pressure and heart rate measurements . 
Subjects  will complete the  SF-36, ESS, CGI , EQQoL , and the TSQMII  questionnaire s. To assess the quality 
of the blind, subjects will be asked which arm of the study they thought they were randomized .  Subjects  
 
 will also be asked whether they would recommend the treatment to a friend or family member if they

VIII. SAMPLE SIZE AND PLANNED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Sample Size  
 
Sample size estimate for the proposed study were derived from the single study (Ichimura et al. 2016)  of 
within subject change in severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_616279] (0.5%) as a nasal 
drop. In that study, 9 of the 11 subjects (82%) experienced a reduction in the severity of bleeds as measured 
on a 5 -point Likert scale . We hypothesize a similar response (82%) in our proposed study among subjects 
randomized to receive timolol gel and a 20% response rate among subjects randomized to placebo gel , 
corresponding to a difference of 62%. 
 
A power analys is was performed using Fisher’s exact test in G -Power 3.1.2.   We estimate that a total sample 
size of 24 patients (ie., 12 in each arm) is needed to allow us to detect with 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha 
level of 0.05 a difference of 62% or more in the percent  of subjects who  experience reduction of severity of   Eligible  
patients

(baseline – 8-week follow -up) in ESS scores between the two treatment groups  calculated as shown below . 
 
1) Within subject difference  with each treatment group  
 
ΔESS Timolol  = (ESS Timolol _base – ESS Timolol_8 -Week) 
ΔESS Control  = (ESS Timolol _base – ESS Timolol_8 -Week) 
  
2) Between treatment difference  
 
ΔESS Timolol  - ΔESS Control  
 
The 95%CI around this effect size will be determined to assess the precision of the observed effect and 
whether a clinically meaningful difference is plausible given the observed results .  
 
An independent sample t -test will be used to compare the change in  scores between the two study groups. 
If potential confounding factors are identified, a mixed model analysis will be employed to compare the 
change in the scores between the two study groups after controlling for potential confounding factors.  
 
Appropria te analyses will be performed for the secondary outcome measures.  
 
IX. EXEMPTION FROM IND REQUIREMENTs  
 
The use of  timolol  in topi[INVESTIGATOR_616280] a change in the approved route of  administration. An exemption 
from IND requirements will be requested as the proposed use of  timolol  in this study fulfills  all of  the 
criteria for exemption . 
 
1) Timolol  is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002] . 
2) This study is not intended to be reported to the FDA in support of a new indication or  significant 
change  in labeling.  
3) This study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the  drug.  
4) The study does not involve a route of administration,  dose, patient population, or other  factor that 
significantly increases the risk (or decreases th e acceptability of the risk)  associated with the use of  
timolol . 
5) The study will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717]  (21 CFR part 
56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).  
6) The study is not intended to promote or commercialize  timolol.  
 
X. ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT SAFETY  
 
Treatment Safety  
 
Treatment safety information comes from three different sources. First, a study was conducted to assess 
the properties of 1% (10 mg) topi[INVESTIGATOR_616281]. (Jagdale , Shewale, and Kuchekar 2016)   The authors studied timolol and Poloxamer 407 polymer 
interaction and were able to show that there was no chemical rea ction between timolol and the 
polymer. (Nieminen et al. 2007; Volotinen et al. 2011)   The authors also demonstrated no histological 
changes to nasal mucosa after the study.  The authors concluded that  the combination  of timolol with 
Poloxamer 407 was associated with  adequate  gelation temperature, mucoadhesive strength, and in situ  
controlled release of timolol.  They concluded that timolol gel is safe for nasal administration.  Second, 
Olitsky studied intranasal delivery of one drop of timolol 0.5% as ophthalmic solution  to each nostril three 
times daily for a total daily dose of 1.5 mg in one adult patient with HHT -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. (Olitsk y 
2012)  The drug was well tolerated with no change in blood pressure or heart rate; no other side effects 
were reported.  Third, timolol 0.5% ophthalmic drops administered intranasally has been associated with 
systemic  side effects, especially in patien ts with CYP2D6 enzyme variants .(Epperla, Brilliant, and Vidaillet 
2014)  Ocular administration of timolol has been associated w ith systemic adverse effects, including 
bradycardia. (Canpolat et al. 2013; Nieminen et al. 2007; Volotinen et al. 2011)  (See Appendix  6 – Adverse 
Reactions ). Among the various symptoms of systematically absorbed ophthalmic timolol, change in heart 
rate is the most frequent and is more l ikely with the 0.5% aqueous rather than the 0.1% hydrogel 
formulation. (Nieminen et al. 2007)  Since the pharmacokinetics of timolol are dependent on t he CYP2D6 
polymorphic enzyme, the individual  patient phenotype for this enzyme will dictate plasma concentrations 
and frequency of adverse events. Four major phenotypes of CYP2D6 metabolizers have been identified: 
Poor , Intermediate , Extensive , and Ultrarapid .(Ingelman -Sundberg and Rodriguez -Antona 2005; Sikka et 
al. 2005; Volotinen et al. 2011)  In one study, it was found that Poor  metabolizers had a 2.5 -fold higher 
plasma concentration than Extensive  metabolizers after application of timolol 0.5% aqueous eye 
drops. (Nieminen et al. 2007) . Timolol eye drops delivered intranasally was associated with greater β -
blockade in Poor  metabolizers as compared with Extensive  metabolizers. Thus, the metabolism of 
systematically absorbed timolol is clearly related to the phenotype of the individual for the CYP2D6 
enzyme.  
 
 
 
Frequency of Different CYP2D6 Alleles in the Population  
 
The frequency of different CYP2D6 alleles and t hus the ability to metabolize timolol was studied in 
population of 104,509 de -identified patient samples from across the [LOCATION_002] between February 2015 
and March 2016. (Del Tredici et al. 2018)  The frequency distribution of various phenotypes of CYP2D6 
alleles was observed to be:  ultra -rapid metabolizers (2.2%), normal metabolizers (81%), intermediate 
metabolizers (1 1%), and poor metabolizers ( 6%). Therefore, an estimated total of 1 7% or 5 subjects  
otherwise eligible for the study would be expected to be at increased risk of side effects due to timolol 
compared to the normal metabolizers  and therefore will be excluded.  
 
While ophthalmic solution is readily absorbed into the blood stream, CYP2D6 genetic testing is not 
commonly done for open -angle glaucoma patients prior to  initiati on of  timolol therapy. To prevent 
cardiovascular side effects, it is recommended that glaucoma patients be screened for coexisting conditions 
and consideration of genetic phenotypic CYP2D6 status testing if readily available .(Maenpaa and Pelkonen 
2016)  
 
In this study , all eligible patients will undergo CYP2D6 testing, ECG, BP, and HR readings at initial visit. 
Patients with a CYP2D6 allele that is associated with an intermediate or poor metabolizer or an ECG that 
demonstrates conduction abnormalities, such as second -degree and third -degree AV block and/or 
clinically significant bradycardia will be excluded from the study.  Enrolled patients will be given a blood 
pressure monitor by [CONTACT_616308]. They will be  instructed  
to take and  report weekly BP and HR to the study team in addition to local or systemic side effects. Patients 
 
 will be called at the end of Week [ADDRESS_817057] the study 
team or report to  the emergency department, depending on the severity.  
 
Any of the following will be considered an indication to stop the study:  
1) Asymptomatic systolic BP drop to less than 80 mmHg or a drop of 20% from baseline sys tolic BP  
2) Symptomatic blood pressure drop  
3) A drop of HR to less than 50/min  
4) Any clinical signs of heart bloc k  
5) Grade >2 local or systemic side effects , such as local irritation or an allergic reaction to the 
medication  
6) Patient’s request or physician’s determination of continuing the study to be no longer safe  
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_616282], the 
intervention assignment will be revealed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kallogjeri to the medical staff doctor caring for the patient. 
In the event [CONTACT_265684] is unable to be reached in a time needed, to assure the safety of the subject, the 
blind can be broken by  [CONTACT_265676], RN or [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_616283].  
 
XI.  Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The specific monitoring plan for this study is based on the potential risk of participation and size and 
complexity of the planned investigation.  Based on these considerations, this study will have a monitoring 
board comprised of [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_83566], [CONTACT_616315] nala, [CONTACT_376749], and [CONTACT_265684], the study biostatistician. 
The monitoring board will meet to review data at least every 6 months.  All reports of a Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE) or an Unexpected Adverse Event will be investigated by [CONTACT_616309] . 
 
 
 
 
XII.  Ethical considerations  
While patients will be randomly selected to receive timolol , an FDA -approved drug, the efficacy and safety, 
including local and/or systemic reactions, are largely unknown when applied in topi[INVESTIGATOR_616284]. Patients 
will be informed in the informed consent process that they may or may not personally benefit from the  
study and that the data obtained from the study will be used to inform  the future care of HHT patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. There will be phone assistance available 24/[ADDRESS_817058].

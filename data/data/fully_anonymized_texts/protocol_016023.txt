 2  INTRODUCTION:  STUDY CHANGES TIMELINE  
 
OVERVIEW  
On April 4th, 2019, The Policy & Research Group reviewed the registry page for the Evaluation of “Plan 
A” on clinicaltrials.gov and found several inaccuracies in language and content. Updates were made to 
the registry to reflect the study design documented in our Evaluation Abstract (see Appendix B),[ADDRESS_230385] Analysis Plan 
(included below), submitted to OAH on January 31, 2019.  
 In an effort to be transparent about changes that have been made to  the registry since its inception, we 
outline below substantive changes that have been made to the design of the study over the course of the implementation period. Changes are organized chronologically. Detail is provided on what the original 
content of the Clinical Trials registration included, what the revised content now indicates, and (when 
applicable) provides a rationale for the change.  
 
JULY 2017 
• Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) Teen Pregnancy Prevention 9TPP) Tier 2B grantees receive 
notice that t he funding period for the grant has been shortened by [CONTACT_193957], shifting the end date 
of the grant from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2018 
 
SEPTEMBER 2017 
• Change in the target sample size from 2,[ADDRESS_230386] hypothesized 
programmatic effects; the revised enrollment target reflects the minimum sample required to 
detect small program effects (MDES = .12).  
 
APRIL 2018 
• Federal judge rules in favor of the OAH TPP Tier 2B grantees and funding is reinstated. Funding 
period will now end on June 30, 2020. 
 
OCTOBER 2018

 3  1) Research Questions that Address Program Effec tiveness on Behavioral Outcomes  
 
a. Primary research question s 
 
1. What is the impact of the offer to watch Plan A (treatment) relative to the offer to watch  The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette (control ) on participants’ reported  use of long -acting 
reversible contraceptives (LARC ) three  months after receiving the  treatment?  
 
2. What is the impact of the offer to watch Plan A (treatment) relative to the offer to watch The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette (control) on participants’ reported times having sex with out a  
condom three months after receiving the treatment?  
 
3. What is the impact of the offer to watch Plan A (treatment) relative to the offer to watch The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette (control) on participants’ reported receipt of sexually transmitted infection  (STI) testing three months after receiving the treatment?  
 
b. Secondary research questions  
 
1. What is the impact of the offer to watch Plan A (treatment) relative to the offer to watch The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette (control) on participants’ reported use of dual methods of protection (condom and prescription birth control use) during vaginal sex three months after 
receiving the treatment?  
 
2. What is the impact of the offer to watch Plan A (treatment) relative to the offer to watch The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette (control) on participants’ use of other effective contraceptive 
methods three months after receiving the treatment?  
 c. Exploratory research questions  
 
Exploratory research questions will investigate mediating factors, subgroup effects, outcomes at 
nine months, and other exploratory outcomes.  
 
2) Description of the Intervention  and Counterfactual Condition  
 
The Video Health Study (VHS) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT)  in which eligible, consenting 
participants are randomly assigned to a treatment or control intervention at one of eight  study sites in 
[LOCATION_004] . Sites have been organized into four regions for administrative and staffing purposes. 
 The intervention is offered  to females, aged  [ADDRESS_230388] not participated in other Office of Adolescent Health -
funded Teen Pregnancy Prevention (OAH TPP) programs , consent to participate in the study, and are 
willing to complete three - and nine-month follow-up questionnaires.  
 
The treatment condition, Plan A , is 23-minute video intervention that promotes effective 
contraceptive use, use of  dual methods of protection (condom use and prescription birth control use), 
and HIV/ST I testing . The video aims to develop sexual health intentions, knowledge, and self-
efficacy for communicating with providers about different contraceptive options that have been 
proven effective, such as LARC . The ultimate goal of the video is to influence viewers’ uptake of 
LARC, reduce unprotected sexual activity, and increase receipt of STI testing.  
 
   
 
 4  The control (counterfactual) condition, The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette, is a [ADDRESS_230389] on the environment and on people who manufacture 
and use cigarettes. The informational video uses both narration and interviews to educate viewers on 
the dangers that cigarettes pose. The video includes no sexual or reproductive health content. 
The videos are delivered to study participants on laptops in a private room or area of participating 
reproductive health clinics.  
 
a. Intervention condition: The intervention or treatment condition is a 23-minute video called Plan 
A, which was  developed by [CONTACT_193958] -education model. 
Entertainment-education is a process of creating and implementing an entertainment program to 
increase knowledge, change attitudes, and change behaviors among a target audience regarding a social or health issue.
2 Plan A  was developed specifically for an 18 to 19- year-old African 
American or Latina  female audience, and delivers messages about the use of effective sexual 
protection and contraceptive options.  
 
i. Intended program components : Plan A  is an individual -level , clinic -based video 
intervention. Through a series of three, inter -related , soap opera- style vignettes, five primary 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_193949]: 1) risk perception for pregnancy, STIs, and HIV; 2) 
contraception options, with an emphasis on LARC; 3) condom use and partner negotiation 
skills; 4) the importance of regular STI and HIV testin g; and 5) comfort discussing sexual 
history, HIV/STI testing, and contraception methods with a health provider. Between each vignette, there is a short , animated sequence to deliver information about intrauterine 
devices (IUDs) and the implant. Prior to playing the video, study staff provide the 
participant with a pen and paper and let her know that if she has any questions while watching the video, she may write them down and ask her health care provider about them 
during her visit. After the vi deo concludes, participants are given a post- card sized handout 
of additional resources with comprehensive information on teen pregnancy, contraception, and STI s.  
 
 The video developers contend that Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), the Extended 
Elaboration Likelihood Model (E -ELM), and the Health Belief Model (HBM) provide 
theoretical grounding and justification for why the intervention could instigate behavior 
change. SCT can be practically applied to explain how people learn, can be motivated to 
change, and believe that they have the ability to change, by [CONTACT_193959]. Viewers of the 
Plan A video learn by [CONTACT_193960] (who are thus rewarded) or negative choices (which lead to negative healt h 
outcomes). In this way, viewer’s outcome expectations for making positive or negative behavior choices are influenced.  
 
 Another important theory applied to this intervention is the E -ELM, which is based on the 
idea that when viewers are engaged and entertained, they are less likely to counter -argue 
with the behavior -change messages presented. This in turn makes influencing their beliefs, 
attitudes, and behaviors more likely. The Plan A video was developed with an  appealing 
storyline, high production values, and persuasive messages that aim to feel unobtrusive to 
the viewer.  The E- ELM contends that when viewers are entertained, they are more receptive 
to the pro- health messages. According to E -ELM, it is also critical that viewers can identify 
with the  characters. Identification leads to increased message absorption and acceptance of 
the values and messages portrayed in the program.  The Plan A video responds to this by 
[CONTACT_193961].

 5   
 The HBM  provides another hypothet ical mechanism for  how messages and strategies can be 
used within the entertainment-education model to bring about behavior change. According the HBM, a health -related behavior change will occur if  a person believes the following: 1) 
that he or she is at risk of a negative condition, 2) that the condition can be avoided, 3) that 
the person has a positive expectation that the avoidance strategy (i.e. , new behavior) will 
prevent the negative condition, and 4) that the person believes that he or she can successfully 
complete the avoidance strategy. In addition, the perceived benefits of the behavior change 
must be understood as sufficiently desirable to overcome any perceived barriers to action. 
Plan A is intended to be delivered immediate ly prior to an individual’s visit with a sexual 
and reproductive health provider, so the messages it delivers about sexual protection and 
contraceptive options are well- timed with a moment when the individual is already 
considering her risk for sexually tr ansmitted infections and/or pregnancy.  
 
ii. Intended program dosage: The 23-minute Plan A  video is intended to be delivered to each 
participant in one screening, immediately prior to their app ointment with a sexual and 
reproductive health provider.  
 
iii. Intended program content: Plan A  is a theory-guided, video intervention designed to 
increase LARC use, increase condom use, and encourage HIV/ STI testing in 18-19 year -old 
African American and Latina  females. The intervention aims to motivate behavior change 
by [CONTACT_193962], demonstrating risk reduction strategies for unwanted pregnancy and 
HIV/ST Is, and modeling effective communication with sexual partners and health care 
providers.  
 
iv. Intended program delivery:  The Plan A video is intended to be delivered within a sexual 
and reproductive health clinic setting immediately prior to a visit with a health care provider. The video is to be viewed in a private or semi- private location  on a laptop or tablet. For this 
study, PRG has contracted with a reproductive health service delivery organization as an  
implementatio n partner. PRG and our implementation partner  have strategically selected 
eight clinics in the Central [LOCATION_004] region , which predominantly serve the target 
population, as the sites for this study . Study coordinator s have been hired, who are staff of 
the reproductive health service delivery organization , to facilitate delivery of the 
intervention to study participants who are randomized to the treatment group. All study coordinator s have been trained by [CONTACT_193963] . This training provides 
detailed information on how to conduct participant recruitment, eligibility screening, consent/assent, enrollment, and randomization procedures, as well as data collection, entry, and submission procedures. 
 
b. Counterfactual condition:  The control  condition is a 17-minute video called The Toxic Life of a 
Cigarette. It was also developed with the entertainment-education model in mind, with the 
purpose of delivering information about the negative effects of cigarettes on the environment and 
on the peop le who manufacture and use cigarettes a s well as with the purpose of motivating 
behavior change around tobacco use. The video does not include any sexual or reproductive 
health content. 
 
The researchers have opted to provide an alternative intervention for those participants who have 
been randomized into the control condition for methodological reasons. The offer of the video to 
the control group is an attempt to mitigate any awareness effects that could  arise if individuals 
assigned to the control condition were to become  aware that they did not receive any “treatment”.  
 
   
 
 6  The control condition is similar to the treatment in terms of  its brief dosage and video -based 
delivery format . This conformity with the treatment should reduce any confounds that might arise 
if the counterfactual experience was different enough in aspects aside from the intended 
informative and motivational treatment.  
 
i. Intended program components : The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette is a 17-minute, 
individual- level, video -based health intervention.   
 
ii. Intended program dosage : The control video is intended to be delivered to each 
participant in one screening, immediately prior to their appointment with a sexual and reproductive health provider.  
iii. Intended program content: The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette is an anti -smoking health 
informa tion video that uses both narration and interviews to educate viewers on the dangers 
that cigarettes pose and encourage them to not use tobacco products.   
iv. Intended program delivery : The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette is intended be delivered 
in health or science classes at the high school or junior high school level. However, for the purposes of maintaining equivalence in the type of experience treatment and control 
participants receive prior to their visit with a health care provider at participating clinics, we 
have chosen to use this video in a clinic -based setting.  
 
3) Study Design  
 
a. Sample formation : To become enrolled in the VHS  sample, adol escent females must appear at 
one of the eight clinics participating in the study and meet eligibility criteria .  
 
Potential study participants are identified in one of two ways . With the first method,  study 
coordinator s review administrative/clinic data for existing upcoming appointments at their 
assigned  study clinics to identify potential participants (female ; 18 or 19; and, if known, African 
American and/or Latina). The study coordinators then call patients with existing appointments, 1-
[ADDRESS_230390] a full eligibility screening  and obtain  
consent . If the individual provides consent to participate, she is randomized into the treatment or 
control condition and considered enrolled in the study . This set of participants , who are  
randomized into the study and offered the opportunity to receive one of the two video health 
interventions , constitutes the full in tent-to-treat (ITT) sample. The offer to receive the Plan A 
   
 
 7  video health intervention is the ITT treatment that we investigate in the primary  and secondary 
research questions. 
 
i. Eligibility criteria for ta rget population: a number of  criteria have been established for 
participation in the study.  
 
To be eligible, participants must:  
1. Consent to participate; 
2. Be female; 
3. Be 18 or 19 years old at the time of their enrollment, based on self -reported date of 
birth ;3 
4. Self-identify as African American and/or Latina;  
5. Be deemed appropriate for the study with regards to physical and mental health by a 
clinician , clinic staff , or the study coordinator; 
 
They must not:  
6. Knowingly be pregnant; 
7. Be trying to get pregnant ; 
8. Have enrolled in the SpeakOut study between November 2016 to October [ZIP_CODE];  
9. Be already enrolled in the study. 
 
ii. Purposeful Sampling:  Any individual who meets eligibility criteria is  asked if she would 
like to hear more about the study. If she says yes,  the study coordinator discusses the consent 
procedures dictated by [CONTACT_193964]. If she consents and is therefore randomized into a condition, she is 
enrolled in the study and considered part of the ITT study sample.  
b. Random assignment process  
 
i. Unit of randomization: Random assignment occurs at the individual participant level. 
 
ii. Random assignment procedures:  
 
Standard Approach: Electronic random assignment 
Electronic random assignment is conducted prior to the administration of the online 
baseline questionnaire. Random assignment blocks of varying sizes assign participants to the treatment or control condition at an equal (i.e., 1:1) assignment ratio. Prior to 
beginning study activities in a region, PRG produces an electronic randomization allocation list specific to each of the four regions with an existing algorithm available in 
Stata (random allocation command, ralloc). The allocation lists are produced by a senior 
analyst , password- protected,  and stored  on a secure PRG server. Study coordinators in 
each region  are given a sequential list o f unique  five-digit study IDs that they assign  in 
sequential order  to eligible individuals. Random assignment occurs when  the unique 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230391] met the eligibility criteria if her calculated age (defined as the difference 
between her screening date and date of birth) makes her 18 or 19 years old. However, there are several instances when participants 
misreported their ages (stating that they were [ADDRESS_230392] their calculated ages indicated that they 
were truly 17 or 20 years old), and the study coordinators enrolled them into the study based on the inaccurately  reported age. In such 
situations, if a participant’s date of birth is within one month of the screening date, (indicating that she reached 18 years of age within 
one month of the screening date, or that she turned 20 years old within one month of the screening date), she will still be included in 
our final analytic sample. Any participant whose calculated age falls outside this window will be excluded from our sample.  
4 The SpeakOut study is another OAH -funded TPP randomized controlled trial being implemented at reproductive health clinics in 
Central [LOCATION_004]. The purpose of this study is to determine whether delivery of SpeakOut, a behavioral intervention to increase social 
communication about long- acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods among adolescents, is associated with increased uptake 
of LARC methods among the social contacts of SpeakOut recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
   
 
 8  study ID number is  entered into  a field on the initial page of the online platform used to 
administer the baseline question naire. It is at this point that the ID number is associated 
with an assignment condition (treatment or control) in the random allocation sequence. 
At each baseline administration (after eligibility has been confirmed), the study 
coordinator will type in th e ID number that is next on the list (going in ascending 
numerical order) into the study ID field of the questionnaire; the questionnaire will then 
provide a message to the study coordinator that indicates the random assignment for that 
ID number. The study coordinator is trained to not allow the participant to see the screen 
that shows the random assignment message. While the participant is completing the 
baseline questionnaire, the study coordinator  will record the participant’s ID number and 
allocation into the Enrollment Form .  
 
Contingency Approach: Envelope- based assignment  
An alternative method that is employed only in instances when Wi- Fi or Internet service 
is down is envelope -based assignment. Prior to the start of the study at each site, and on 
an ongoing basis as resupply is needed, PRG prepares ‘assignment envelopes’ (50 are 
initially prepared for each region ). PRG uses the same algorithm as used for the 
electronic- based assignment to create separate  regional  allocation lists for the enve lope-
based assignments (study IDs are recognizably unique from the electronic- based regional 
ID numbers and do not overlap with IDs used for electronic- based assignment). Each 
sealed security envelope has the  region name [CONTACT_193991] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_193950] ( Plan A  or The 
Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette ) from the allocation list. The message on the paper within 
the envelope will be masked in such a way that if participants see the message they will 
not know to which condition they are assigned (same procedure as used for electronic 
random assignment). PRG then places the envelopes (in ascending numerical order) in a 
box to be given to and managed by [CONTACT_193965] .  
 At each baseline administration that requires envelope -based assignment, the study 
coordinator will pi[INVESTIGATOR_193951]; the number written on the outside 
of the envelope will be the assigned ID number for that participant. The study coordinator  
enters this number into the ‘study ID’ field on the questionnaire (administered on paper) so that this number is associated with the participant’s questionnaire data. Prior to the 
completion of the baseline questionnaire, the study coordinator  will open the envelope 
and read the paper inside that indicates the condition to which the participant is assigned.  
This is when random assignment occurs – when the envelope is opened associating that 
individual (and ID  number) with a treatment condition. As above, the blocking procedure 
(various sized blocks) will ensure an (almost) equal number of treatment and control assignments at each site. The study coordinator enters the study ID and assignment in the 
Enrollment Form while the participant completes the questionnaire.
5 
 
iii. Blocking procedures: Blocking occurs at the regional level. Each of the four region s has 
been assigned a range of pre-randomized ID numbers (for electronic randomization) and 
a package of pre-randomized assignment envelopes ( described in the subsection above ). 
Participants are enrolled and randomized at the individual level within each region.  
 
                                                 
5 Each ID number and its corresponding intervention assignment  is logged by [CONTACT_193966]’s 
Enrollment Form . ID numbers and assignments from the Enrollment Form dataset are then matched to PRG’s randomization 
allocation dataset  so that we can monitor the integrity of the randomization process. This should ensure, at a minimum, that the 
condition a particular participant is assigned is the one that is indicated in the  assignment records. This is to say that the ITT “point 
of offer” treatment should , at minimum , formally retain all the properties of random assignment even if a study coordinator wrongly 
administers the incorrect intervention.  
   
 
 9  iv. Probability of assignment to treatment group : The probability of assignment to the 
treatment group is intended to be equal to the probability of assignment to the control 
condition; that is p (assignment to treatment ) =.5. 
 
v. Potential for crossover/contamination: Given the brief nature of the intervention and 
counterfactual conditions – namely a 23 -minute video for the treatment group and a 17-
minute video for the control group – the potential for crossover or contamination is very 
limited.  Crossover or contamination could occur if a study coordinator mistakenly 
administers the incorrect condition to an individual. However, study coordinators have received extensive training on study procedures. Additionally, when randomization 
occurs using electronic random assignment, the video to which the individual has been assigned is set up to automatically play , and thus does not rely upon the study coordinator 
selecting the correct video. The only situation in which crossover or contamination could potentially occur is if electronic random assignment is not available because of loss of 
network connection, and the study coordinator inadvertently shows the wrong video to a 
participant, but these circumstances are unlikely.  
 
c. Consent process: There is no difference in the consent process for the treatment or control 
groups. E valuation consent is  a condition of eligibility for the study, so no individual is 
randomized to a condition until after informed consent is obtained. As incentive to participate, a 
$[ADDRESS_230393] is given to  individuals who enroll in the study each time they complete a 
questionnaire (baseline, 3-month, and 9-month), and a $[ADDRESS_230394] information.
6 
 
After the individual has been screened and found eligible to participate in the study, the study 
coordinator goes through the Participant Informed Consent Form with her. This provides the 
individual with  information about the study, outlines why she has been  invited to participate, and 
addresses any questions that may arise. This process involves a paragraph -by-paragraph 
exploration of the consent form by [CONTACT_193967] “checking  
in” with the individual  to be sure she fully understands the study requirements. At the end of this 
exercise, she  is asked to provide consent if she wishes to participate in the study.   
 
d. Data collection:  Data used for investigating both primary  and secondary research  questions are  
obtained from the Participant  Questionnaire administered at baseline , three months post- baseline, 
and nine months post- baseline.  The questionnaire is used to collect data on study participants’ 
self-reported contraceptive use and knowledge, sexual behavior and experiences, and intentions, 
thoughts, and feelings related to sexual behaviors. It is administered three  times at the follo wing 
time points:  
a. Baseline – at the enrollment session  just prior to the participant receiving their assigned 
intervention 
b. Three months post -baseline  – three months after the baseline questionnaire administration  
c. Nine months post- baseline – nine months after the baseline questionnaire administration  
 While we collect data at three  time s over nine  months, our analysis of primary and secondary 
research questions is  concerned only with data gathered at baseline and three  months post -
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230395] incentive offered to participants  living in one 
region for completion of the baseline questionnaire from $40 to $60. This was done due to the higher cost of living in the region relative 
to the other study regions, and because the $[ADDRESS_230396] incentive offered to participants who did not complete their follow -up 
questionnaires within two months of the follow -up window opening from $40 to $60. This was done to increase the likelihood of 
capturing data from harder -to-reach participants.  
 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_230397] been used in 
previous research on sexual behaviors and contraceptive use. The instrument was reviewed by 
[CONTACT_193968][INVESTIGATOR_2268]- tested by [CONTACT_193969]. The questionnaire includes the same items at each time point and will measure 
the same constructs with identical measures at each administration.  
 There are no differences in data collection p rocedures for treatment and control groups. Data 
collection is conducted identically for both groups.  
 
There are minor  variations in procedures at the different data collection points . For all data 
collection points, we administer the questionnaire using a web -based (online) survey 
administration tool that has Audio Computer Assisted Self- Interview (ACASI) capabilities. The 
baseline online questionnaire is administered  by [CONTACT_6903] -based study coordinator s, whereas, follow -
up online questionnaire s are adminis tered  by [CONTACT_193970] s.
[ADDRESS_230398] outcome data as soon as possible after each data collection window 
(three -month follow-up and nine-month follow -up) opens; however, the data collection window 
remain s open for four months to allow sufficient time for participants to complete their 
questionnaires. Any questionnaires completed after a data collection window closes will not be 
included in the final analytic sample .  
 
At each data collection point, the stu dy coordinator or research assistant  identifies a quiet and 
private space for  the participant to complete the questionnaire. During the enrollment session, the 
baseline questionnaire is completed  in the clinic. Follow -up questionnaires are completed in 
locations that ensure participant confidentiality as well as convenience, such as  the study 
coordinator or research assistant’s office space, coffee shops, or other public locations like university buildings. On the computer, the study coordinator or research assistant  select s the 
appropriate link to the type of questionnaire to be administered, enter s the participant’s unique 
participant ID number, and gives the study participant some brief instructions about taking the 
questionnaire. The script for the instructions was developed by [CONTACT_193971]’s honesty in answering questions and the confi dentiality of their 
responses. Study coordinator s or research assistants are instructed to read it prior to each 
questionnaire administration. The study coordinator or research assistant  also provides the 
participant with a calendar that they can reference when taking the questionnaire.  
 The study coordinator or research assistant  then tell s the participant to click “Next” on the 
computer screen when ready to begin and turns the study computer over to the participant to 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230399] hypothesis testing statistics (t -test). 
However, we propose to use regress ion-adjusted means as the primary estimate of Plan A program effects to improve the precision 
of our estimates. Refer to subsection 4f below for a more detailed description of our proposed analytic approach.  
[ADDRESS_230400] of their presence and to clearly explain  that the reason they are staying is to facilitate 
questionnaire administration.9 During the baseline questionnaire, the participant is instructed to 
let the study coordinator know when she has finished the survey, and the study coordinator click s 
the “Submit”  button . This is done so that the study coordinator can go through the video 
intervention script and provide a paper and pen to the participant prior to the video playing. Upon 
submitting the questionnaire, the participant is directed to the Wistia online video platform to 
view the assigned video. She is told to inform the research staff when the video is finished 
playing. During follow-up questionnaires, the participant is instructed to click the “Submit” button herself. In both instances, the regional research assistant receives an automatic email 
letting her know the questionnaire has been completed.  
 If, for some reason, the internet is not working when a questionnaire needs to be completed, or if 
the participant’s needs dictate that she takes the questionnaire on paper (e.g., because the participant needs the Spanish -language version of the questionnaire, or due to computer 
illiteracy ), the study coordinator or research assistant  follows the same procedures as above, but 
the study participant completes the questionnaire using a self-administered paper version. The 
study coordinator  or research assistant  enter s the study participant’s unique ID on the paper 
questionnaire and gives  her the questionnaire and a large envelope. At the end of the regular 
questionnaire instructions, the study coordinator or research assistant  instruct s the participant to 
put her  completed questionnaire into the envelope and seal it when finished. The participant  then 
hands it to the study coordinator or research assistant  who writes the study ID number on the 
outside of the envelope and  store s it in a locked file cabinet. Paper questionnaires are mailed via 
FedEx to PRG on a regular basis and entered by [CONTACT_193972] .  
 
Research  staff attempt to have all questionnaires administered in person; however, two weeks 
after the data collection window opens, if a participant is unwilling or unable to complete follow -
up questionnaires in person, administration option s offered to participants are for them  to either  
complete it online  using a survey link emailed to them and their own personal computer or tablet 
or complete it on paper using a questionnaire mailed to them. Three months after a follow-up 
window has opened, if research assistant s have not been successful in getting the participant to 
complete the questionnaire online or with a mailed copy, the final option offered is to complete a

We will run sensitivity analyses that exclude participants who were surveyed by [CONTACT_193973]. Study

e. Data  collection related to additional  analyses :  
 
Recruitment Log  
The Recruitment Log  is an electronic data base housed in the Zoho Creator  application. Data from 
the paper Eligibility Screening Form  are entered into the electronic Recruitment Log  by [CONTACT_20234] . Each patient who is screened for the study is entered as one record in the log.  The 
Eligibility Pre -Screening Script  is a paper form used by [CONTACT_2420] s to recruit and ‘pre -
screen’ over the phone potential study participants (females ages 18 -19) with upcoming 
appointments at the clinics. The form includes a study introduction script and several pre- screen 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230402] eligibility 
information in person from potential study participants who come into the clinic for a reproductive health visit. The form includes a study introduction script, eligibility screening 
questions to be asked of the patient, and collects eligibility determination data. Data from these 
forms are entered into the Recruitment Log  database by [CONTACT_2420] s on an ongoing basis.  
 
Participant Database  
The Participant Database  is an electronic database housed in a Zoho Creator  application. Data 
from the paper Enrollment Form  are entered into the electronic Participant Database  by [CONTACT_193974] s; data from the 3- and 9-Month Follow-up Data Collection Forms  are entered into the 
database by [CONTACT_60572] s. Each eligible patient enrolled in the study should have one record 
in this database for each of the three forms housed here (Enrollment Form, 3-Month Data 
Collection Form , and 9-Month Data Collection Form ). The paper Enrollment Form  collects 
administrative data, participant information on language and gift card preferences, data on adherence to the study procedures, questionnaire completion data, baseline incentive tracking 
numbers, and any notes on issues/changes to the study protocol. The paper 3- and 9-Month Data 
Collection Form  forms are completed by [CONTACT_193975] [ADDRESS_230403] administrative participant information, questionnaire completion data, incentive 
tracking data, and notes on issues/concerns with the 3 -month or 9-month questionnaire 
administration session.  
 
Wistia video platform  
The majority of study participants watch  their assigned video on the Wistia online video platform. 
Wistia collects dosage data on the percent of the video played for each participant. Research staff 
at PRG download these data regularly to monitor program dosage. Data from the Wistia platform 
will be used to measure whether participants received the condition to which they were assigned and dosage received.  
 
4)  Analysis 
 
a. Outcome measures:   
 
Primary outcome measures  
Our primary research questions ask to what extent the offer to watch Plan A  relative to the offer 
to watch The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarett e impacts participants’ reported: 1) use of LARC; 2) 
times having sex with out a condom; and 3) receipt of STI testing three months after receiving the 
treatment. We describe below the specific operationalization of each of these three primary 
outcome measures.  
 
i. LARC Use  
LARC use is  constructed as a dichotomous variable – participants are either coded as 
currently using a LARC or not currently using a LARC. Data used to assess the impact of 
the treatment ( Plan A ) on LARC use are obtained from the following item  on the 
Participant Questionnaire, which is administered to both the treatment and control groups 
at baseline  and three months post- baseline. 
 
• Which of the following methods of prescription birth control are you currently using?  
o None: I am not currently using any of these methods 
o Oral contraceptives (for example, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
   
 
 13  o The patch (for example, Ortho Evra) 
o The shot/injection (for example, Depo- Provera)  
o The ring (for example, NuvaRing) 
o The implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon) 
o IUD (for example, ParaGard, Skyla, or Mirena) 
 
Persons who indicate that  they are currently using either The implant or IUD are 
considered to be currently using LARC and are coded as 1. Persons who select None, Oral 
contraceptives, The patch, The shot/injection, or The ring are considered to not be 
currently using LARC and are coded as 0.   
 Plan A  will be consider ed to have a positive impact on LARC use if, as compared to 
participants who are assigned to the control group, a larger proportion of participants who 
are offered Plan A report using LARC at the three-month follow-up and the difference 
between groups is statically significant.  
 
ii. Times having sex without a condom We operationalize times having sex with out a  condom as a risk outcome; that is, we 
measure the frequency with which participants engage in the risk behavior of having sex 
without a condom, rather than the frequency with which they engage in the safe sex 
practice of using condoms. Constructing the va riable in this way allows us to examine the 
self-reported sexual behaviors of the full analytic sample of participants, regardless as to 
whether or not they are sexually active.  
 
Specifically, times having sex with out a condom is constructed as a continuous variable – 
the number of times in the past three months a participant does not use condoms while 
engaging in any type of sex.
[ADDRESS_230404] of the treatment ( Plan A ) on 
condom use are obtained from the following three items on the Participant Questionnaire, 
which is administered to both the treatment and control groups at baseline and three 
months post- baseline.  
 
• In the past three months, how many times have you had vaginal sex without using a condom?  
• In the past three months, how many times have you had oral sex without using a condom?  
• In the past three months, how many times have you had anal sex without using a condom?  
 
Persons who indicate that  they have not ever had a particular type of sex (vaginal, oral, or 
anal) or have not had that type of sex in the past three months are coded as having that type of sex without a condom zero times.
 11 The final outcome measure is calculated by 
[CONTACT_193976]’ responses to these three items (the number of times they report they 
did not use condoms during vaginal, oral, and anal sex).    
Plan A  will be considered to have a positive impact on times having sex without a condom 
if, as compared to participants who are assigned t o the control group, the number of times 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230405] (i.e., vaginal, anal, or oral), our measure of times having sex without condom use is 
not limited to sexual intercourse but includes all self -reported sexual activity.  
11 The Participant  Questionnaire contains sexual behavior questions that use a three- month recall period. As research has 
consistently f ound that memory of behaviors/events decreases over time and accuracy of recall is negatively associated with length 
of recall period (Clarke et al. 2008; Schwarz and Oyserman 2001), we use items with three- month recall periods to construct our 
measures of  sexual behaviors since these should elicit more accurate responses than a longer recall period (e.g., six -month).  
   
 
 14  having sex without condoms reported by [CONTACT_193977] A  at the three-
month follow-up is larger than the times reported by [CONTACT_193978]. 
 
iii. STI Testing  
STI testing is  constructed as a dichotomous variable – participants are either coded as having 
been tested for STIs in the past three months or not tested.[ADDRESS_230406] of 
the treatment ( Plan A ) on STI testing  are obtained from the following two items  on the 
Participant Questionnaire, which is administered to both the treatment and control groups at 
baseline and three months post -baseline.  
 
• The first question asks: To the best of your knowledge, have you ever been tested 
for other sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), such as chlamydia or gonorrhea?  
• If respondents select Yes to the first question, they are then asked this sec ond 
question: Have you been tested for STIs/STDs other than HIV in the past 3 months?  
 
Persons who select Yes to the second question are  coded as 1, indicating that they have been 
tested for STIs/STDs other than HIV in the past [ADDRESS_230407] 
and/or second questions are considered to not have been tested and coded as 0.   
 
Plan A  will be consider ed to have a positive impact on STI testing if, as compared to 
participants who are assigned to the control group, a larger proportion of participants who are 
offered Plan A report STI testing at the three-month follow-up and the difference between 
groups is statically significant.  
 
Secondary outcom e measures  
Our secondary research questions ask to what extent the offer to watch Plan A  relative to the offer 
to watch The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarett e impacts participants’ reported: 1) use of dual 
methods of protection (condom and prescription birth control use) during vaginal sex; and 2) use 
of other effective contraceptive methods (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch, ring, or Depo- Provera) three months after 
receiving the treatment. We describe below the specific operationalization of each of these two 
secondary  outcome measures.  
 
i. Use of dual methods of protection  
Use of dual methods of protection during vaginal sex is constructed as a proportionate continuous measure – the proportion of number of times in the past three months a 
participant has used both a condom and prescription birth control out of the total number 
of times reported having vaginal sex in the past three months.
13,[ADDRESS_230408] of the treatment ( Plan A ) on dual methods of protection are obtained from the 
following two items  on the Participant Questionnaire, which is administered to both the 
treatment and control groups at baseline and  three months post- baseline. 
• In the past three months, how many times have you had vaginal sex? 
• Please think about how many times you said you had vaginal sex in question 20. Of the times you had vaginal sex, how many times would you say you used 
                                                 
12 See footnote Error! Bookmark not defined. . 
[ADDRESS_230409] includes the following: birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]; the patch (for example, Ortho Evra); the shot (for example, Depo 
Provera); the ring (for example, NuvaRing); the implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon);  and IUD (for example, ParaGard, 
Skyla, or Mirena). 
14 See footnote Error! Bookmark not defined. . 
   
 
 15  dual methods of protections – that is, how many times did you use both a 
condom and one of the listed methods of prescription birth control at the same 
time?  
Only those participants who  report having vaginal sex in the past three months at both 
baseline and  three -month follow-up will be included in analysis.. If an individual responds 
No to the question “ Have  you ever had vaginal sex ?” or responds No to the question “ In 
the past [ADDRESS_230410] you had vaginal sex, even once?” , the individual will be excluded 
from analysis of this measure. Because of the fact that the mechanism defining the 
analytic sample for this research question is not random and there are theoretical reasons 
to believe that treatment assignment may affect inclusion ( i.e., individuals who are offered 
the treatment may be more likely to abstain from sexual activity at follow -up and therefore 
excluded from the analytic sample) this constitutes an endogenous subgroup. [ADDRESS_230411] on use of dual methods of protection 
if, as compared to participants who are assigned to the control group , participants who are 
offered Plan A report using dual methods of protection more consistently (i.e., a larger 
proportion of the times they have vaginal sex)  at the three -month follow-up and the 
difference between groups is statically significant.  
 
ii. Use of other effective contraceptive methods  
Use of other effective contraceptive methods is constructed as a dichotomous variable – participants are either coded as currently using other effective contracepti ve methods or 
not currently using any contraceptive methods. Data used to assess the impact of the 
treatment ( Plan A ) on use of other effective contracepti ve methods  are obtained from the 
following item  on the Participant Questionnaire, which is administered to both the 
treatment and control groups at baseline and  three months post- baseline. 
• Which of the following methods of prescription birth control are you currently 
using?  
o None: I am not currently using any of these methods 
o Oral contraceptives (for example, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
o The patch (for example, Ortho Evra) 
o The shot/injection (for example, Depo- Provera)  
o The ring (for example, NuvaRing) 
o The implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon) 
o IUD (for example, ParaGard, Skyla, or Mirena) 
Persons who indicate that  they are currently using either Oral contraceptives, The patch, 
The shot/injection, or The ring are considered to be currently using other effective 
contraceptive methods and are coded as 1. Persons who select None are considered to not 
be currently using other effective contracepti ve methods and are coded as 0.  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230412] to bias.  Tests of baseline balance will be conducted; if we have reason to 
believe there is imbalance between treatment and comparison groups for this outcome, we will reduce this to an exploratory research question.  
   
 
 [ADDRESS_230413] 
either None, Oral contraceptives, The patch, The shot/injection, or The ring  to the 
question “ Which of the following birth control methods are you currently using ?”. If an 
individual selects The implant or IUD to this question, the individual will be excluded 
from analysis of this measure. As such, the subgroup of participants in which we conduct this analysis will be consider ed an endogenous subgroup (i.e. not inclusive of our full 
analytic sample) because it is constructed based on a participant’s response to an outcome 
measure.
[ADDRESS_230414] on use of other effective contraceptive 
metho ds if, as compared to participants who are assigned to the control group, a larger 
proportion of participants who are offered Plan A report using other effective 
contraceptive methods at the three -month follow-up and the difference between groups is 
statically significant.  
 
b. Analytic sample: In Central [LOCATION_004], eight clinics have been recruited to participate in the 
study. As explained in the Study Design section, clinic -based study coordinators review 
administrative/clinic data for patients with appointments at the study clinics to identify  potentially 
eligible participants.   
 
Potential participants are eligible if they: 1) are female; 2) are between the ages of 18 and 19 years of age; 3) are Hispanic and/or Latina; 4) are not knowingly pregnant or trying to get 
pregnant; 5) consent/assent to participate; 6) did not enroll in th e SpeakOut study between 
November 2016 to October 2018
17; and 7) are deemed appropriate for the study with regards to 
physical and mental health by a clinician, clinic staff, or the study coordinator.   
After eligibility is determined , partici pants are rand omized  into the treatment ( Plan A ) or control 
(The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette) condition according to procedures detailed in subsection 3b. 
The act of randomization into either the treatment or control arm constitutes the offer to participate in the intervention and is the point at which the individual becomes a participant in the 
study. The analytic sample is defined as all participants who were randomized into either the 
treatment or control conditions and who have reported sufficient outcome and covariate data.
18 
Missing data procedures are outlined in subsection 4c v below.  
 
c. Data cleaning: P rior to analysis, PRG staff will systematically screen or review the analytic 
variables ( baseline and outcome ) to identify invalid , inconsistent , outlying, missing,  and 
unreliable data.19 New variables are created in which data that are deemed unusable (i.e., invalid 
                                                 
16 See footnote 15.  
17 See footnote 4. 
18 As outlined in subsection 4 cv, our benchmark approach is to impute baseline/covariate data. As such, sufficient baseline/covariate 
data means all cases where data are not unit missing.  We do not anticipate that we will have different analytic samples for our 
outcomes of interest; data are expected to be missing entirely for any given respondent at any observation point or not. If for whatever 
reason analytic samples are different for different outcomes, we will assess baseline equivalence separately for each analytic sample.  
[ADDRESS_230415] report. Along with our presentation of sensitivity analyses, we will present tables that present the prevalence of unit and item missing (which result from nonresponse) as well as inconsistent, unreliable, and invalid data for both treatment and control 
samples. Regarding inconsistencies specifically, for each sexual behavior variable included in our model specifications (which coul d 
therefore influence the constitution of the analytic sample) we will include the following: sample size (the number of observations prior to recoding of inconsistencies) and the number of observations that are inconsistent over -time. If paper questionnai res lead to 
internally inconsistent data , we will also report on this . 
 
   
 
 17  or unreliable) are coded as missing and flagged according to missing data type; all other data are 
retained, unchanged. 20 The steps taken in this data cleaning  process are outlined below. 
 
i. Identify and flag unreliable cases : The first step in the data screening process is to 
identify and flag  entire  cases (i.e., entire questionnaires) that are unreliable. By 
[CONTACT_78338], we mean that we have sufficient reason to believe that the respondent’s answers are not honest representations of their behaviors, knowledge, and beliefs. These 
cases are treated as missing and excluded from our benchmark analyses.  
 Cases are flagged as unreliable when responses follow a clear, deliberate pattern. This 
data cleaning procedure is informed by [CONTACT_193979] (NSDUDH) and for the Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS), which treat records that follow defined patterns of responses as missing .
21 PRG flags the following cases as unreliable: a) the same response option is 
chosen for all multiple choice questions; b) responses alternate between only two response options; or c) responses alternate systematically, starting with one response 
option, alternating through all options in order until exhausted then beginning again (in 
the same or in reverse order). If other response patterns are observed over the course of the evaluation, they will be added to PRG’s list of unreliable response patterns. 
 
Data for cases that are deemed unreliable are treated as unit missing  and excluded from 
benchmark analyses. However, sensitivity analyses that include the unreliable data will be conducted and results will be reported in an appendix of the report. 
 
ii. Identify and flag invalid responses : The second step in the data screening process is to 
inspect the data for instances in which responses are invalid because they are outside of a 
pre-determined range of plausible or acceptable values. Each questionnaire type (e.g. , 
baseline, three -month follow-up) has a codebook, which is prepared by a PRG staff, that 
contains variable names, valid variable values or ranges of values, and when applicable value labels.
[ADDRESS_230416] pe rforms 
diagnostics in STATA to ensure that responses to all analytic measures are valid (i.e., data are within ranges specified in the codebook).
 A data analyst inspects the data using 
two commands in STATA. First the analyst uses the command sum variable_ name, 
which provides summary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for all numeric variables. The analyst checks that the minimum and maximum values are 
valid. If this command reveals there are values out of range, the analyst then inspects the 
data using the command, tab variable_name, missing, which provides a frequency table 
of all values (including missing values) so the analyst can identify and flag all values that are out of range as invalid and recode these values to missing (code as “.i”).  
 Data that are recoded to missing are treated according to our missing data approach. 
Briefly, our benchmark approach is to adjust missing baseline  data and include in 
analysis; we exclude observations with missing outcome data from analysis.   
                                                 
20 A note on missing values : STATA provides a series of missing value codes that allow us to “flag” missing data according to why 
they are missing. Data that are missing due to unit nonresponse (a questionnaire was not completed) are coded using the “system 
missing” value (“.”). All other types of missing data are coded using “extended missing” values (e.g.,“.a”, “.b”).  
21 See Comparing and Evaluating Youth Substance Use Estimates from the NSDUH and Other Surveys  retrieved February 27, 2018 
from https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH -M9-Youth- 2012/NSDUH -M9-Youth- 2012.pdf.  
22Regardless as to whether data are nominal, ordinal, or continuous, all response options are coded in STATA as numeric values; 
values are labeled according to corresponding category names when data are nominal or ordinal. As an example, the variable gender is a nominal variable; however, it is treated as a dummy variable where females are coded as “1” and males are coded as 
“0”. The only acceptable values for this variable then are 0 and 1; any other values are out of range.  
   
 
 18  iii. Identify and flag outliers : The third step is to identify and flag severe outliers. Outliers  
(operationally defined below) are values that are extreme compared to other observations 
but a re not  plainly invalid. In the data cleaning process,  we inspect outliers so that we can 
try to ascertain whether they are in fact true (or plausible) values or potentially a result of 
measurement error. The only variables for which we inspect outliers are those used in the 
construction of our outcome variables ( times having vaginal sex, times having vaginal 
sex without a condom, times having oral sex, times having oral sex without a condom, 
times having anal sex, times having anal sex without a condom ) because they have no 
upper limit (all other variable s used in analysis are either categorical or have predicated 
upper and lower bounds). Our approach to identifying and flagging outliers  is as 
follows.23 
 
• First, in STATA we use the lv (letter -value display) command to identify severe 
outliers. We define values as severe outliers according their relation to the 
interquartile range (IQR). Severe outliers are defined as values outside of the outer 
fences of the population distribution. 
o IQR= Q3(3rd quartile or 75th percentile) – Q1 (1st quartile or 25th percentile)  
o Upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ 
o Lower outer fence: Q1 - 3*IQ 
• Second, we create an outlier indicator variable, where observations deemed severe 
outliers are coded as 1, all others are coded as 0.  
 Our benchmark analytic approach is to include data flagged as outliers in analysis, 
because we do not know for certain whether the values are true or invalid. However, we also run sensitivity analyses that exclude these data and report substantive differences in 
the results section of the report.  
 
iv. Identify and flag inconsistencies in reporting of sexual behaviors : The fourth  step in 
the data review process is to inspect the data and identify inconsistencies in sexual behavior outcome data. With repeated measures of sexual behaviors, two primary types of inconsistencies may occur – internal inconsistences and over -time inconsis tencies.
24 
Internal inconsistencies refer to discrepancies in responses (to related questions) in the 
same survey administration. For instance, a respondent might say that sh e has not had sex 
in the past three months, but then indicates that she used condom s three of the times she 
had sex in the past three months. Over- time inconsistencies refer to instances in which 
lifetime reported behaviors decline or are completely recanted over time. For example, at 
baseline a respondent might say that she has had vaginal sex in her life, but on a 
subsequent administration of the survey she says she has never had vaginal sex .  
 
In order to minimize internal inconsistencies in our primary and secondary outcomes, we 
built skip patterns into the online questionnaire – if participants indicate they have not 
had a particular type of sex in the past 3 months they are skipped out of more specific questions related to that type of sex. In addition, participants are precluded from 
indicating they had a particular type of sex without a condom more times than they said 
                                                 
23 Rules for identifying outliers are informed by [CONTACT_716]:  Hamilton, Lawrence C. 2006. Statistics with STATA: Updated for Version 
[ADDRESS_230417]/SEMATECH e -Handbook of Statistical Methods , http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/.  
24 Inconsistencies can occur for a number of reasons including social desirability bias and memory or recall issues on the part of the 
respondent and misunderstanding on the part of either the respondent or interviewer (Alexander et al 1993; Clarke, Fiebig, and 
Gerdtham 2008; Del Boca and Noll 2000; Harris et al 2008; Schroeder et al 2003; Schwarz and Oyserman 2001). These issues are 
especially common in self -reports of sexual behaviors where questions are of a sensitive nature and often respondents are asked to 
indicate the frequency and/or recency of behaviors over differing lengths of time (e.g., 30 days, 3 months, 6 months) .  
 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_230418] primary and secondary outcome measures, as well as any variables that 
may be used to logically impute values for primary and secondary outcome measures. If over-time i nconsistencies are identified, both the baseline and follow- up values are 
flagged as inconsistent over time and recoded to missing (coded as “.k.”). Data that are 
recoded to missing are treated according to our missing data approach. Briefly, our 
benchmark approach is to adjust missing baseline data and include in analysis ; we 
exclude observations with missing outcome data from analysis.  
 
v. Missing data approach:  Assuming that our study design and procedures are sound, 
missing data pose perhaps the greatest threat to the internal validity of our RCT study and 
the ITT framework (Puma et al. 2009; Moher et al., 2010).
[ADDRESS_230419] remain 
equal in expectation at the point of analysis . When the analy tic sample is diminished by 
[CONTACT_78341]-response, non-random differences (i.e., self -selecting)  between the 
treatment and comparison groups may be introduced into the sample and estimates of 
program impacts may become biased. Although there is no consensus on how to resolve this, practical guidance on how to address and mitigate the problems associated with missing data have been published in education (Puma et al., 2009). 
 
Our six -step decision processes for addressing this problem, as detailed below, are 
informed by [CONTACT_78342]. These steps articulate how we will deal with missing outcome or covariate data (that is variables outlined in the Model specification and covaria tes 
section and are necessary for the estimation of impacts). The benchmark approach that 
we have selected aims to mitigate the introduction of bias into our impact estimates, 
provide good estimates of uncertainty, and maximize the use of available data by  
[CONTACT_78343]/covariate data. To test the robustness of this approach, and to verify these findings, we will report comparative findings using sensitivity analyses that also employ an alternative method which includes no adjustment (as outlin ed in step 6).  
 
1. Using data cleaning procedures outlined in the Data cleaning section, identify  
inconsistent, outlying, unreliable , and invalid data in any analytic (i.e. , outcome, 
                                                 
25 In rare  instances, paper -based questionnaires are completed by [CONTACT_4317]. This may occur if the study coordinator or research 
assistant is unable to open the online questionnaire because of network connection issues, or if the participant cannot be reached for 
an online administration and is instead mailed a paper questionnaire. Paper -based questionnaires include the same skip patterns as 
online questionnaires; however, unlike the online questionnaire where participants are skipped out of subsequent questions based on 
their response to previous questions and cannot report inconsistent times having different types of sex, it is possible for participants 
to provide responses to questions that they should not have answered or that do not make sense given their responses to previ ous 
questions. If and when such inconsistencies are observed in data originating from paper -based questionnaires, the participant’s 
responses to the two or more items where inconsistencies are noted are recoded to system missing and will not be used in our primary 
and secondary outcome analysis.

and flag unreliable and outlier data for analysis.27  
 
2. Report prevalence of unit and item missing ness (which result from nonresponse) 
as well as inconsistent, unreliable , and invalid data for both treatment and cont rol 
samples .[ADDRESS_230420] missing values (due to nonresponse) and 
logically impute where this is the case. We will not logically impute where the 
missing values are previously inconsistent , unreliable, or invalid.  
 
4. Determine if any individuals who are in the randomized sample have no data at all 
(i.e., unit missing) at baseline and at the three-month follow-up time point. If this 
is the case, our proposed benchmark approach is to use case deletion, as we feel it 
is the most straightforward and prudent approach for missing follow-up data 
recommended in Puma et al. (2009). These cases will be deleted from the analytic

5. Determine if any individuals who are in the randomized sample (for each 
outcome) are missing baseline covariates or the baseline measure of the outcome 
variable. If this is the case, our proposed benchmark approach is to use dummy 
variable adjustment procedures, as we feel it is the most straightforward and prudent approach for missing baseline/covariate data recommended in Puma et al. 
(2009).  
6. Conduct sensitivity analys es by [CONTACT_78344] (i.e., use case- wise deletion for all cases with missing 
baseline and outcome data). In an appendix, we will report our benchmark results next to the sensitivity analysis results to verify findings.  
 
d. Assessment of baseline equivalence: Baseline equivalence will be reported for all baseline 
measures of each outcome variable as well as relevant  demographic and sexual behavioral  
measures. We first list and describe the measures we will use to examine the equivalence of our 
treatment and control group at baseline. After we identify the measures, we provide details on the 
diagnostic methods that we will use to assess any baseline difference that may exist between the 
treatment and control groups in the measures outlined below.  
 
Demographic and Sexual Behavior Measures  
Baseline equivalence will be assessed for four demographic variables and one baseline measure 
of sexual  behavior  (identified below). Each  of the variables are constructed from participant self-
responses to questions  in either the Eligibility Screening Form or VHS  baseline  Participant 
Questionnaire . For the race variables, categorical responses to a single question are used to create 
multiple dichotomous variables. The sexual behavioral vari able is constructed from participants’ 
responses to three questions in the baseline  Participant Questionnaire. We provide details on 
                                                 
27 We will code missing responses with a unique missing code that identifies or flags these missing values according to the reason 
they are missing (i.e., nonresponse, invalid, inconsistent). Unreliable data are not recoded to missing, rather cases deemed 
unreliable are coded as 1 in an indicator variable, treated as unit missing, and excluded from analysis. See the Data cleaning 
section or Table 3 in Appendix  A for details on how missing data are coded.  
28 For item missing values, we will only report prevalence of missing and inconsistent data for variables that are included in our 
model specific ations and could therefore influence the constitution of the analytic sample.

Demographic: 
• Age at screening  (continuous; range 1 8-19)29 
• Identify as Black/African American at screening  (0 = identify as an other race/do not identify 
race; 1 = identify as Black/African American )30 
• Identify as Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin at screening (0=do not identify as Hispanic, 
Latino , or of Spanish origin; 1= identify as Hispanic , Latin o, or of Spanish origin)31 
• Completed high school (0 = has not completed high school; 1=  has completed high school) 
 
Sexual Behavior:  
• Ever had sex  (0=never had  vaginal , anal, or oral sex; 1=has had vaginal , anal, and/or oral sex 
in lifetime);  
 
Baseline Outcome Measures 
In addition to the demographic and sexual behavior measures, we will assess baseline 
equivalency of the baseline observations of the outcome measures. We provide details on variable 
coding below; details on variable construction can be found in Table 2 in Appendix A. 
  
• Times having sex without condom in the past 3 months at baseline (continuous; values range 0 
to k, where 0= has had sex without condoms [ADDRESS_230421] 3 months and k= number of times 
having sex without condoms in past 3 months) 
• Current LARC use at baseline (0 -= not currently using a LARC; 1= currently using a LARC)  
• STI Testing in the past 3 months  at baseline (0=not tested for STIs/STDs in past 3 months; 1= 
tested for STIs/STDs in past 3 months) 
 
Balance Assessment Methods 
We propose to assess baseline equivalence of the treatment and control groups according to a 
multi- step procedure. Baseline equivalence statistics will be produced for each analytic sample.32 
Only participants who provide baseline data to an outcome measure will be included in the 
analytic sample for that same outcome measure; thus the analytic sample used for each research 
question may vary slightly because of the exclusion of non -responders. As required by [CONTACT_941] 
“Identifying Programs that Impact Teen Pregnancy, Sexually T ransmitted Infections, and 
Associated Sexual Risk Behaviors”  review protocol , we will r eport the adjusted means and p-
values of the differences in the baseline variable of interest for the treatment and control groups.[ADDRESS_230422] statistic is not required by [CONTACT_193980].34  
 
                                                 
29 Age at screening is determined using the participant ’s self -reported date of birth.  
30 At screening, participants are asked “What is your race and ethnicity?” and provided with a list of the following response options: 
White ; Black or African American; Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native ; Asian ; Native 
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander; Unknown;  or Some other race/ethnicity . Participants can select more than one category and they can 
also specify some other race/ethnicity. To be eligible for the study, participants must select either  Black/African American or Hispanic, 
Latino, or Spanish origin.  
[ADDRESS_230423] there may be slight differences in analytic samples for each research question.

Associated Sexual Risk Behaviors.  Mathematica Policy Research.  
34 The literature on balance statistics argues that significance testing is inappropriate for this diagnostic task (Austin, 2007; Imai et al., 
2008; Austin, 2009; Stuart, 2010). Hypothesis tests can be misleading diagnostic measures of baseline equivalence because they 
conflate balance with statistical power  
 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_230424], we generate a model -based estimate of the difference between treatment 
and comparison groups on the pre- intervention measures identified above. Separate 
models will be run for each of the variables. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193952] (using Stata). If the measure is dichotomous we propose to use a linear probability 
model to estimate the predicted probability of group membership. The m odel is a 
reduced- form variation of the model that we use to estimate program impact (as detailed  
in the Model specification and covariates section, below).36 
 
𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 =  𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇 +�(𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃)+𝜀𝜀 
where:  
𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏  – is the baseline measure of the variable that we use to establish baseline 
equivalency (identified in Appendix A – Table 2 ). This variable is included as a 
covariate in the analytic model (see Table 2 for details on variable coding). Separate 
models will be estimated for each baseline equivalency measure specified above.  
𝑇𝑇 – A dummy treatment indicator variable whose value equals 1 if the participant is 
randomized into the treatment group and zero otherwise. 
X – Region (blocking variable) – An n -1 vector of region  indicator dummy variables that 
are coded one if the intervention was delivered at region  n and coded zero otherwise.  
β0 – The intercept term, which represents the adjusted mean value of the baseline 
equivalenc y measure for participants in the control sample, with all other variables in 
the model held constant at zero. 𝛽𝛽
1 – This represents the adjusted (but not standardized) mean difference in the baseline 
equivalency variable between treatment and control participants.  
𝜀𝜀− The residual or random variation that remains for each observation after the 
structural components of the model are estimated. It is the difference between the 
observed and the predicted values at the individual level.  
 step 2. Report  the adjusted means and p -values of the differences in the baseline variable 
of interest for the treatment and control groups. 
 
step 3. If the pre-intervention measure is continuous,  we propose to use the following 
formula to calculate the pooled within -group standard deviation of the outcome 
measure:  
𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝=�(𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡−1)𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡2+(𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐−1)𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐2
(𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡+  𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐−2) 
 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230425] same samples of observations that we will  use 
in our primary , secondary, and exploratory analyses . In other words, we will apply the missing data approach outlined in subsection 
4cv prior to producing estimates of baseline equivalency on the pre- intervention measures. To validate this benchmark approach, we 
will also produce a sensitivity analysis that produces estimates of baseline equivalency without imputations (i.e. , with all missing data). 
Benchmark and sensitivity estimates of baseline equivalency will be presented beside each other in an appendix.  
36 It is a reduced- form because individual -level, demographic covariates are omitted. It is a variation because the dependent 
variable is the baseline equivalence variable, not the outcome measure.  
   
 
 23  where: n t and n c are the sample sizes, and S t and S c are the participant -level standard 
deviations for the pre -intervention measures for the analytic treatment and comparison 
groups, respectively. We will produce separate calculations of the pooled standardized 
deviation for each variable used to establish baseline equivalence (as noted above).  
 step 4 . Produce the standardized difference of means. If the pre- intervention measure is 
continuous, we will use Hedges’ g as the formula to compute the standardized difference 
of means for the treatment and comparison groups: 
 
𝑔𝑔=  𝛽𝛽1
𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 
 
Where:  𝛽𝛽1 is the adjusted mean difference in the variable selected to establish baseline 
equivalence for the treatment and comparison groups (calculated in Step 1), and S p is 
the pooled standard deviation (produced in Step 2). 
 
For dichotomous baseline variables we will use the Cox index, which yields effect size 
values similar to the values of Hedges’ g that one would obtain if group means, standard 
deviations, and sample sizes were available, assuming the dichotomous outcome 
measure is based on any underlying normal distribution.” Following this guidance, we 
propose to use the Cox index to estimate baseline equivalence for dichotomous baseline covariates. The formula is as follows:  
 
𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶=  �𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛�𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡
1−𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡�−𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛�𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐
1−𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐��
1.65� 
 
Where: 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 and 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 represent the probability of occurrence of the event (or characteristic) 
within the treatment and comparison groups, respectively.  
 
e. Condition crossover and contamination : Crossover will be defined as study participants 
assigned to the treatment condition who received any amount of the control video . 37 This will be 
determined from Wistia video platform data. We will calculate crossover using the following 
formula:

[ADDRESS_230426] Analysis Plan guidance for Cohort 2 Tier 2B grantees, crossover is described as occurring “ when individuals 
randomly assigned to the intervention or counterfactual conditions are later found to be receiving the services intended to be of fered 
to the other condition .” Given this, we calculate crossover in our sample as participants assigned to the treatment condition who 
received any amount of the control video, as this is the intended counterfactual condition.  
 
   
 
 24   
Contamination will be defined as study participants assigned to the control condition who 
received any amount of the Plan A video . 38 This will be determined from Wistia video platform 
data. We will calculate contamination using the following formula:

Levels of crossover and contamination will be reported in the findings section of our final impact 
report. 
 
f. Analytic approach for primary research questions:  As detailed in our primary research 
questions, this study  investigates whether offering Plan A  to participants impacts their reported 
LARC use, number of times having sex without condoms, and STI testing . We do this within the 
intent to treat (ITT) framework, which does not measure the effect of the participant’s exposure to the treatment itself but rather the effect of the offer of the treatment relative to the offer of 
receiving the control condition. This framework maintains the integrity of the experimental structure by [CONTACT_193981] (except those who attrite) in the 
analytic sample, thereby [CONTACT_193982]. Bias can be insinuated, however, through self- selection if any participant who is 
randomized fails to provide outcome data .  
 
i. Model specification  and covariates:  The primary research questions under investigation in 
this study are whether offering Plan A  to participants impacts their : (1) reported use of LARC, 
(2) times having sex without condoms, and (3) reported ST I testing  partners (see Table 1 in 
Appendix A for variable co nstructions) . We propose to estimate these impacts using a 
regression that will model intervention effects as a function of assignment to Plan A  (i.e., 
Treatment), relevant baseline covariates, a baseline measure of the outcome variable, and 
regional (blocking) indicators  (see Table 2 in Appendix A for variable constructions) .
[ADDRESS_230427] Analysis  Plan guidance for Cohort 2 Tier 2B grantees, contamination  is described as occurring “ when individuals 
assigned to the counterfactual condition end up receiving all or portions of the conditions intended only as part of the intervention.” 
Given this, we calculate contamination in our sample as participants assigned to the control condition who received any amount of the Plan A video, as this is the intended treatment condition.
 
[ADDRESS_230428] hypothesis t esting statistics (t- test). With that said, we propose a 
regression- based model that includes covariates, because randomization should ensure covariates are uncorrelated with the 
treatment variable (i.e., they should not affect the estimate of the treatment effect) , and in the instance they are significant predictors 
of the outcome, their inclusion in a regression model will decrease the standard error of the estimates, making them more pre cise.

iii. Adjustments for multiple comparisons: 
Following guidance provided under the grant for 
our impact analysis plan ,[ADDRESS_230434] for multiple comparison s in all of our primary 
outcome s analyses, regardless of outcome domains. We propose to use the Benjamini -
Hochberg method.43 This method controls for the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the 
expected value of the number of false positive tests divided by [CONTACT_193983] a family of tests. The following procedures will be used to implement this adjustment:  
 1. The p -values generated by [CONTACT_193984], indexed by i (where i 
= [ADDRESS_230435] p -value and i  = k for the largest p -value).  
2. Beginning with the largest p -value ( p
k1), we will assess if pk1 < ((i/m)a*), where m = the 
total number of tests conducted, and a* = the initial significance value at which we would 
reject the null hypothesis and the level of false discovery we are willing to accept (in this 
case, 0.05). The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be considered 
statistically significant if pk1 < ((i/m)a*). If pk1 < ((i/m)a*), all smaller p -values in the list 
will also be considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis will be rejected for 
each test. If pk1 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis will hold, the test will not be considered 
statistically significant, and the next largest p -value in the ranked list will be assessed .  
3. If the 1st p-value is not statistically signifi cant, the 2nd largest p -value in the list ( pk2) will 
be compared against ( i/m)a*. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be 
considered statistically significant if pk2 < ((i/m)a*). If pk2 < ((i/m)a*), all smaller p -values 
in the list will also be considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis will be rejected for each test. If p
k2 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis will hold, the test will not be 
considered statistically significant, and the next largest p -value in the ranked list will be 
assessed.  
4. If the 2nd p-value is not statistically significant, the 3rd largest p -value in the list ( pk3) will 
be compared against ( i/m)a*. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be 
considered statistically significant if pk3 < ((i/m)a*), If pk3 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis 
will hold and the test will not be considered statistically significant.  
 
iv. Sensitivity analyses: We will conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness and validity 
of our benchmark approaches outlined above. These include: (1) excluding covariates ; (2) not 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_230436] estimates of primary outcome measures.  
43 This method has been selected because it helps to control the Type 1 error rate without also increasing the Type 2 error rate, which 
in our view is a serious consideration in preliminary efforts to identify evidence of effectiveness of new approaches. Benjam ini, Y., & 
Hochberg, Y. (1995). Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing. Journal of the royal 
statistical society. Series B (Methodological), 289- 300. 
   
 
 28  imputing or adjusting for missing data ; (3) excluding unreliable data; (4) including  outli ers; 
and (5) condensing data collection windows to exclude late responders ; and (6) using an 
alternative model specification to estimate program effects .  
 
1. Without baseline covariates.  Our benchmark approach is to include baseline covariates 
in our model to improve the precision of our estimates. To test this, we will  conduct  
sensitivity analys es that involve running identical empi[INVESTIGATOR_193954]. Analytic findings for both approaches will be presented alongside 
each other in an appendix of the impact report.  
2. Without adjusted baseline  data. As outlined in the Missing data approach section , our 
benchmark approach is to adjust baseline data as  published guidance suggests that this 
may produce unbiased impact estimates and maximize the use of available data. We will 
test this by [CONTACT_193985][INVESTIGATOR_193955]. Analytic findings for both approaches will be presented 
alongside each other in an appendix of the impact report.   
As outlined in the Baseline equivalency  section, we will also produce diagnostic 
estimates of baseline equivalency on the pre-intervention outcome variables according to 
our benchmark approach and the sensitivity study alongside each other in an appendix of 
the report.  
 
3. With unreliable data. As discussed in the Data cleaning section, data for cases that are deemed unreliable are treated as unit missing  and excluded from benchmark analyses. To 
test this, we will conduct sensitivity analys es that involve running identical empi[INVESTIGATOR_193956]. Analytic findin gs for both approaches will be 
presented alongside each other in an appendix of the impact report.  
 
4. With out outliers . As discussed in the Data cleaning section, extreme data values are 
investigated and flagged as outliers. Our benchmark analytic approach is to include data flagged as outliers (i.e., extreme values that are not considered invalid) in analysis. We 
will also conduct sensitivity analyses that  exclude these data and report substantive 
differences in the results section of the report.  
 
5. Condensed data collection w indows . Our benchmark approach is to include follow -up 
data from all participants who completed a questionnaire during their open data collection window, regardless of the time point in that window when it was completed. Data 
collection windows are broad to minimize attrition from the analytic sample. To examine whether or not this influences our results – and, in particular , whether or not study 
participants who respond later report different outcomes from those who respond earlier – we will conduct an analysis that examines the difference , if any, in response time 
between treatment and control participants and  compares impact estimates for analytic 
samples without late responders. Late responders will be defined as those participants 
who complete their three -month questionnaire more than one month after the initiation of 
the three -month data collection window. 
 
6. Statistical Modeling.  We have proposed using OLS regression as the benchmark 
statistical model we intend to use to estimate the program’s effect on the primary outcomes. OLS is robust in larg e samples to misspecification. OLS is also a conventional 
approach to modeling dichotomous and count outcomes in evaluation because it produces 
estimates that are more immediately and readily interpretable, and because it tends to 
produce results that are substantively identical to the models that technically fit the data 
better. We will conduct tests that test the validity of this assumption and if there is a 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_230437] produced by [CONTACT_193986] (or variant 
of – e.g. Firth logit) or statistical count models (e.g. Poisson and negative binomial 
families), we will report results of the models that fit the distributional characteristics of 
the data better (based on diagnostics and log- likelihood statistics).  
 
g. Analytic approach for secondary research questions: We intend to use the same analytic 
approach as described above to address all secondary research questions, with the exception of our 
method related to multiple comparisons. Following guidance provided un der the grant for our 
impact analysis plan ,[ADDRESS_230438] for multiple comparisons in our secondary outcome 
analyses, regardless of outcome domains.

Table 1. Behavioral outcomes used for primary  and secondary  impact analyses research questions  
Outcome name  [CONTACT_193992], including how it is operationalized  Source of the measure  Timing of measure  
Current LARC 
use The protective outcome is operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating whether a person reports currently using LARC (implant or IUD) or not currently using LARC.  
 
The measure is calculated from the following item:  
• Which of the following methods of prescription birth control are you 
currently using? 
o None: I am not currently using any of these methods  
o Oral contraceptives (for example, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
o The patch (for example, Ortho Evra)  
o The shot/injection (for example, Depo- Provera)  
o The ring (for example, NuvaRing)  
o The implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon)  
o IUD (for example, ParaGard, Skyla, or Mirena)  
 
A person who selects either The implant or IUD is given a value of 1 for the 
measure. A person who selects None, Oral contraceptives, The pat ch, The 
shot/injection, or The ring is given a value of 0 for the measure. 
 
The resulting variable is dichotomous with values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a 
person who does not currently use a LARC and 1 indicates a person who does currently use a LARC.  
 
Note: The analytic sample will include all respondents who have three -
month follow -up data .  Participant 
Questionnaire Three- month follow -up 
(three months after 
enrollment ) 
Times having sex without  condom  
 
 The risk outcome is operationalized as the number of times in the past three 
months a person reports having any type of sex without  using a condom.  
 The measure is calculated from the following items:  
• In the past [ADDRESS_230440] you had vaginal sex 
without using a condom? Participant 
Questionnaire Three- month follow -up 
(three months after 
enrollment ) 
   
 
 33  • In the past [ADDRESS_230441] you had oral sex 
without using a condom? 
• In the past [ADDRESS_230442] you had anal sex 
without using a condom? 
 
The measure is calculated by [CONTACT_193987] a person 
reported not using a condom during vaginal, oral and anal sex.  
 
The resulting variable is continuous with values that range from [ADDRESS_230443] 
three months, and k indicates the number of times the person has engaged in 
sex without a condom (risk behavior)  in the past three months.  
Note: The analytic sample will include all respondents who have three -
month follow -up data. Persons who indicate they have not had sex will 
be considered to have participated in the risk behavior 0 time s (i.e., they 
did not engage in sex without a condom).   
STI testing  The protective outcome is operationalized as a dichotomous variable 
indicating whether a person reports having been tested for ST Is in the past 
three months or not having been tested.  
 
The measure is calculated from the following item:  
• Have you been tested for STIs/STDs other than HIV in the past 3 
months?  
 
A person who selects either Yes is given a value of 1 for the measure. A 
person who selects No is given a value of 0 for the measure.  
 
The resulting variable is dichotomous with values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a 
person who has not been tested for STIs/STDS in the past three months and 1 indicates a person who has been tested for STIs/STDs.  
 
Note: The analytic sample will include all respondents who have three -
month follow -up data .  Participant 
Questionnaire Three- month follow -up 
(three months after 
enrollment ) 
Use of dual methods of protection The protective outcome is operationalized as the proportion of times in the past three months a person reports using both a condom and prescription birth control during vaginal sex  out of total times reported having vaginal sex.  
 Participant Questionnaire Three- month follow -up 
(three months after 
enrollment ) 
   
 
 34  The measure is calculated from the following  two items: 
• In the past three months, how many times have you had vaginal 
sex?  
• Please think about how many times you said you had vaginal sex in question 20. Of the times you had vaginal sex, how many times would you say you used dual methods of protection – that is, how 
many times did you use both a condom and one of the listed methods of prescription birth control at the same time?  
 
The resulting variable is a continuous proportion with values that range from 0 
to 1, where 0 indicates that a person has used dual methods of protection 0% 
of the time during vaginal sex in the past three months, and 1 indicates the 
person has used dual methods of protection 100% of the time during vaginal 
sex in the past three months. 
Note: The analytic sample will only include respondents who have 
three -month follow -up data and who indicate in their three -month 
follow -up questionnaire that they have had vaginal sex in the past three 
months . Persons who indicate they have never had vaginal sex or have 
not had vaginal sex in the past three months will be excluded from the construction of this measure.  
Use of other effective contraceptive 
methods  The protective outcome is operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating whether a person reports currently using prescription birth control methods beyond LARC or not currently using any prescription birth control methods.  
 
The measure is calculated from the following item:  
• Which of the following methods of prescription birth control are you 
currently using? 
o None: I am not currently using any of these methods  
o Oral contraceptives (for example, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  
o The patch (for example, Ortho Evra)  
o The shot/injection (for example, Depo- Provera)  
o The ring (for example, NuvaRing)  
o The implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon)  
o IUD (for example, ParaGard, Skyla, or Mirena)  
 Participant Questionnaire Three- month follow -up 
(three months after 
enrollment ) 
   
 
 35  A person who selects either Oral contracepti ves, The patch, The 
shot/injection, or The ring is given a value of 1 for the measure. A person who 
selects None is given a value of 0 for the measure.  
 
The resulting variable is dichotomous with values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a 
person who does not currently use any prescription birth control methods and 1 indicates a person who uses non- LARC prescription birth control methods.  
 
Note: The analytic sample will only include respondents who have 
three -month follow -up data and who indicate in their three -month 
follow -up questionnaire that they are currently not using any birth 
control or using one of the non- LARC methods . Persons who indicate 
they use LARC methods will be excluded from the construction of this measure.

Individual level covariates   
   
 
 39  Covariate  Description of the covariate and how it will be used as a covariate in 
the analysis  Rationale for inclusion  
Age The variable is measured as the respondent’s age in years at s creening. 
 
The measure is constructed from the following item on the VHS Eligibility 
Screening Form : 
 
• What is your date of birth?  
 
The variable is calculated by [CONTACT_193988].  
 
The resulting variable is continuous with values ranging from 18 to 19.  Research has shown that likelihood of engaging in sex 
increases with age and use of condoms declines (Brewster 1999; Kirby 2007; Miller et al 1998; Scott -
Jones and White 1990)  
Black/African American The measure is operationalized  as a dummy variable, where 0 = identify 
as another race/do not identify race; 1 = identify as Black/African 
American.  
The measure is taken directly from the following item on the VHS 
Eligibility Screening Form : 
 
• What is your race and ethnicity? (Study coordinators can select more than one based on participant ’s response)  
o White 
o Black or African American 
o Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin  
o American Indian or Alaska Native 
o Asian  
o Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander  
o Unknown 
o Some other race/ethnicity  (specify)  
 
Variable will be coded as 1 if participant self-identified as Black or African 
American, regardless as to whether other races/ethnicities are specified; if Black or African American is not selected, the response will be coded 
as 0.   Research has shown that Black/African American and Hispanic adolescents  are more likely to engage in sex 
during adolescence, initiate sexual activity at a younger age, and less likely to use contraception of any kind (Blum 2000; Brewster 1999; Hogan et al 2000; Kirby 2007; Scott Jones  and White 1990)  
 
   
 
 40  Covariate  Description of the covariate and how it will be used as a covariate in

Variable will be coded as 1 if participant self-identified as Hispanic, 
Latino, or of Spanish origin, regardless as to whether other 
races/ethnicities are specified; if Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin is 
not selected, the response will be coded as 0.   
High school education  This measure is operationalized as a dummy variable , where individuals 
with a high school education are coded as 1 and all others are coded as 
0.

Participant Questionnaire:  
 
• What is the highest degree or level of school you have 
completed (if currently enrolled, select the previous grade completed or degree received)? 
o Grade 9- 12 (please specify grade)  
o GED or alternative credential  
o Some college credit, but less than 1 year of credit

Intervention Name  
“Plan A”  
Intervention Description  
“Plan A” is a 23 -minute video intervention designed for 18 - to 19 -year-old African American and 
Hispanic or Latina women that promotes effective contraceptive use, condom use for dual contraception 
and human immunodeficiency virus /sexually transmitted disease (HIV/STD) prevention, and HIV/STD 
testing. The video aims to develop sexual health intentions, knowledge, and self -efficacy for 
communicating with providers about different contraceptive options that have been proven effective , such 
as long -acting reversible contraception (LARC).  
The video is delivered on laptops or personal electronic devices in a private room or area of a 
reproductive health clinic. The intervention is designed to have maximum impact when viewed just before 
a reproductive health visit. The video developers believe that the waiting time before a clinic visit is a 
moment when the target group will be most receptive to the informational and motivational messages of 
the intervention. “Plan A” intends to improve s exual health outcomes by [CONTACT_193989] a reproductive health clinic.

“The Toxic Life Cycle of a Cigarette” is a [ADDRESS_230451] on the environment and on people who manufacture and use cigarettes. The 
informational video uses both narration and interviews to educate viewers on the dangers that cigarettes 
pose. The video is delivered on laptops or personal electronic devices in a private room or area of a  
Planned Parenthood clinic. The video includes no sexual or reproductive health content.  
Behavioral Outcomes  
Use of LARC (intrauterine device or implant), use of condoms, STD testing, use of dual methods of 
protection (condom and prescription birth control), use of other effective contraception methods 
(consistent and correct  use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch, ring, or Depo -Provera )  
Non-behavioral Outcomes  
Perception of risk and severity for pregnancy and HIV/STD infection, intention to use LARC, intention 
to use other effective contraception methods (including condoms), provider communica tion self -efficacy 
(or positive outcome expectation from provider interaction), condom negotiation self -efficacy, knowledge 
or awareness of contraception options and LARC  
  

   
 
 44   Sample and Setting  
The study is being conducted in ten Planned Parenthood clinics in five different regions of  
[LOCATION_004] —Fresno, Oakland, Merced , Bakersfield, and Sacramento . All of the clinics are part of the 
Planned Parenthood Mar Monte organization. A stud y coordinator will screen for eligibility all women with 
reproductive health appointments (including walk -in appointments) at study clinics. Study coordinators are 
nonclinical employees of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte. None of the study coordinators know t he 
specific reason youth are visiting the clinic, though they might know the type of appointment the 
participant has scheduled. The intent -to-treat sample will be comprised of eligible teens who are enrolled 
into the study during the two -year implementatio n period. To be eligible, participants must (1) be female; 
(2) be 18 or 19 years old; (3) self -identify as either Hispanic, Latina, or African American; (4) be visiting a 
reproductive health clinician or provider; (5) be deemed appropriate for the study by  [CONTACT_193990]; (6) consent to participate in the study; (7) not knowingly 
be pregnant; and (8) not be trying to get pregnant. The target sample size for the study is 1,770  women.  
 
Research Design and Data Collection  
The study is an individual randomized controlled trial in which eligible, consenting participants are 
randomly assigned to either the intervention (“Plan A”) or comparison (“The Toxic Life Cycle of a 
Cigarette”) groups.  Random assignment is conducted following consent and study enrollment and before 
the administration of the baseline questionnaire. The evaluators are responsible for coordinating and 
verifying random assignment. The standard approach is to carry out rando m assignment electronically 
through a web -based survey platform; however, the contingency plan is for study coordinators to use 
assignment envelopes if Internet access is not available or insufficient at an administration site for any 
reason.  
Participants  in both the intervention and comparison groups will receive a baseline survey (before 
the intervention), 3 -month follow -up (post -baseline), and 9 -month follow -up (post -baseline). Data 
collection procedures will be the same for both treatment and compariso n groups. In -person data 
collection will be the preferred mode for all data points. In these instances, participants will complete 
questionnaires (available in English and Spanish) electronically through a web -based survey form on a 
computer in a private room or space; however, paper questionnaires will be available when needed or 
preferred by [CONTACT_4317]. When participants cannot meet in person to complete follow -up data collection, 
participants will be offered alternative methods to complete the questio nnaires (for example, online using 
a personal electronic device or by [CONTACT_756]). Data collection windows for both follow -up questionnaires 
will be four months. The evaluators will track when participants respond and sensitivity analyses will 
examine wheth er outcomes differ for participants who responded on time (within the first month of the 
data collection window) and late (in the second, third, or fourth months of the window).  
For the implementation evaluation, the evaluators will collect data on fideli ty (participant -reported 
understanding and participation or engagement), attendance (percentage of video watched), and quality 
(participant -reported overall quality). The web -based video platform (Wistia) will automatically log 
attendance and the Plan A Fe edback Questionnaire will collect fidelity and quality data; a randomly 
selected 10 percent of study participants in the treatment group will complete that questionnaire 
electronically through a web -based survey form on a computer directly after viewing th e “Plan A” video.

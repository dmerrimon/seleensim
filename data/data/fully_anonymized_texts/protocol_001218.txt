Page 2 of 181.0 Purpose of the Study:
There is considerable evidence that most perinatal women at risk for postpartum depression  do not 
engage in mental health services, even when referred by [CONTACT_222754] (HV) programs, primary care 
physicians, obstetricians, or gynecologists (Zittel-Palamara et al., 2008). Thus, interventions that can 
be delivered via alternative
 settings—e.g., HV programs—are essential to prevent the onset of major 
depression and worsening of depressive symptoms among perinatal women. This PCORI funded 
project aims to evaluate whether the Mothers and Babies (MB) intervention, when led by 
[CONTACT_854833], is more efficacious than usual care (i.e., home visiting without the MB 
enhancement). It will also examine if MB, when led by [CONTACT_854834], is not inferior 
to MB delivered by [CONTACT_456714]. The results of this study will inform decision-making 
by [CONTACT_854835][INVESTIGATOR_242086].
Study Aims:
Aim #[ADDRESS_1190451] a superiority trial that compares the efficacy of MB delivered  by [CONTACT_854836] (i.e., home visiting without MB) on patient-reported outcomes, 
including depressive symptoms, quality of life, parenting practices, engagement in  pleasant activities, 
and relationship with one’s partner.
Aim #[ADDRESS_1190452] a non-inferiority trial that compares the effectiveness of MB  delivered by (a) 
mental health clinicians versus (b) paraprofessional home visitors.
Aim #3 is to evaluate whether effectiveness of the two versions of MB (clinician led vs. 
paraprofessional home visitor led) varies according to
 patient characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, first- 
time mother, and/or geographic type of home visiting (HV) program (i.e., urban vs. rural).
Aim #4 is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of MB  delivered by [CONTACT_854837].
2.0 Background / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:
Postpartum depression is a serious mental health disorder that poses  significant health and mental 
health risks for mothers and their infants (Gaynes et al., 2005; National Research Council & Institute 
of Medicine, 2009). Research suggests that prevalence rates of postpartum depression are higher 
among low-income women than among middle-or high-income women (O’Hara & Swain, 1996; Rich- 
Edwards et al., 2006). There is also consistent evidence that low-income women are less likely to 
receive mental health services in the perinatal (i.e., pregnancy until child’s first birthday) period than 
their more affluent counterparts due to a variety of factors including  stigma related to mental health 
service use and lack of access to community-based mental health providers (Abrams et al., 2009; Leis 
et al., 2011). Postpartum depression is a particularly serious problem for low-income women, as it  has
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 3 of 18the potential to create two generations of suffering, for both mother and  child. It is estimated that over 
10% of low-income infants have a mother who has major depression and more than 50% have a 
mother with some depressive symptoms (Vericker et al., 2010). Postpartum depression has negative 
consequences for maternal parenting practices. Compared with women not suffering from postpartum 
depression, depressed women tend to be less positive, less spontaneous, and less responsive with their 
infants (e.g., VanDoesum, et al, 2007). Postpartum depression has been linked to developmental  delays 
among infants of depressed mothers, including social interaction difficulties, attachment insecurity, 
and cognitive  impairments  (e.g., Grace,  Evindar,  & Stewart,  2003;  Sohr-Preston  & Scaramella,  2006).
Home visiting (HV) programs that provide services to perinatal women are one of the largest avenues 
through which perinatal women come to the
 attention of service providers, making HV a unique and 
viable setting for delivering mental health services. Although professional HV models exist (e.g., 
Nurse-Family Partnership), most HV programs in the [LOCATION_002] use paraprofessionals. Previously, 
study investigators have established the efficacy of a group-based intervention —the Mothers and 
Babies (MB) Course—in preventing the onset of postpartum depression and reducing depressive 
symptoms when led by [CONTACT_456714]. However, to date there are no interventions led by 
[CONTACT_105]-health or non-mental health professionals that have demonstrated efficacy in preventing the onset 
and worsening of postpartum depression among low-income women. This project attempts to fill this 
notable gap.
We will conduct a cluster randomized trial in which HV clients receive either a) MB delivered by 
[CONTACT_456714],
 b) MB delivered by [CONTACT_854833], or c) usual home 
visiting services. This study design will allow us to conduct a superiority trial that compares the 
efficacy of MB delivered by [CONTACT_854838]. A superiority trial will 
allow us to generate efficacy data on MB delivered by [CONTACT_854833]. Our study 
design will also allow us to conduct a non-inferiority trial that compares the effectiveness of MB 
delivered by [CONTACT_854839].  Should we find that 
paraprofessional home visitors are not inferior to mental health professionals in delivering the 
intervention,  HV programs  throughout the  [LOCATION_002]  will be able  to implement  the MB Course  with 
paraprofessional home visitors—an approach that is considerably more efficient and cost-effective 
than employing mental health  professionals.
This study was born out of community stakeholders’ need and desire for a low-cost intervention that 
could prevent the onset and worsening of depression among low-income women enrolled
 in HV 
programs. Maternal depression is an enormous challenge facing HV programs. However, there is 
consistent evidence that low-income women exhibiting depressive symptoms—including women 
enrolled in HV programs—do not access mental health treatment in the community (Abrams et al., 
2009). Lack of available mental health professionals, stigma in seeking mental health services, and 
logistical challenges (e.g., childcare, transportation) are a few of the barriers faced by [CONTACT_854840]. For those clients who do access services, most  perinatal women are 
likely to receive pharmacological treatments (Huybrechts et al., 2013), despi[INVESTIGATOR_854824]-pharmacologic interventions (Leis et al., 2011).
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 4 of 18HV programs are ideal settings for delivering mental health care to perinatal women because their 
mission is not stigmatizing and HV programs tend to 
be trusted entities in the communities they 
serve. However, there is not yet an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered by 
[CONTACT_87060] (such as home visitors), thereby [CONTACT_854841]’ capacity  to meet the needs 
of their clients needing mental health services.
3.0 Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
The study population consists of 1722 individuals. Of this total, 1680 will be HV clients, 24 will be 
home visitors, and 18 will be mental health
 professionals. The HV client study population consists of 
1680 individuals recruited from 42 home visiting (HV) programs across Illinois and adjacent states. 
We will enroll these women as part of a randomized controlled trial, where [ADDRESS_1190453] enroll clients via 
referrals from prenatal care clinics, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs and other settings 
working with perinatal women; home visiting programs implementing the MB Course will implement 
five MB cohorts per site, over the course of the project. These women will be recruited ≤ [ADDRESS_1190454] risk description for study procedures in 
which observations of concern arise.
Study participants: We will work with [ADDRESS_1190455]. The population to be studied is pregnant women enrolling in HV programs< 33 
weeks gestation upon referral, who are at-risk for major depression. Women > 16 years old enrolled 
in HV programs who are < 33 weeks gestation upon referral, will be eligible for enrollment; across 
the 42 HV programs ~80% of women receive a HV service < [ADDRESS_1190456] been conducted  (Beck 2001, 
O’Hara & Swain, 1996; Robertson et al., 2004).  The 
findings from these meta-analyses suggest that 
the following risk factors have the strongest association with developi[INVESTIGATOR_854825]: a) 
history of depression, b) elevated depressive symptoms during pregnancy, c) poor social support, d) 
stressful life events, e) poor marital relationship, and f) low socioeconomic status. Our previous 
research with HV programs suggest that nearly all HV clients exhibit one of these risk factors, with 
most clients exhibiting multiple risk factors. This is due to the fact that eligibility criteria for inclusion 
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 5 of 18in HV programs mirror these risk factors for postpartum depression —particularly, low SES, low 
social support, and stressful life events.
 As such, we will not limit our inclusion criteria for this study 
to onlyi ndividuals exhibiting elevated depressive symptoms, as this would potentially exclude women 
at risk for postpartum depression. Moreover, there is the potential for underreporting of depressive 
symptoms on screening instruments, which would lead to under enrollment of women at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_854826].
Women with high-risk medical and pregnancy conditions will be excluded  since this may 
preclude women from regularly attending intervention sessions. We will not exclude women 
based on race/ethnicity or based on demographic characteristics other than the ability to speak 
English or Spanish.
Clinicians : [ADDRESS_1190457] a minimum of a Master’s Degree and at least five years’ experience 
working with children < 5 and their
 families. The clinicians will live and work in the three different 
regions of Illinois where this study will be conducted: Chicago, downstate Illinois, and western Illinois 
as well as adjacent states who are participating in the study
Paraprofessionals: 18 HV programs will receive the MB intervention delivered  by [CONTACT_854842]. We will train ~72 home visitors from the 18 HV programs in this study arm, or ~4 
home visitors per program; HV programs participating in this study currently employ between 3-[ADDRESS_1190458] employing 4-5.All of the HVs will currently be a staff member of one of the 
participating study sites.
Home Visiting Supervisors/Managers/Directors:  We will also be consenting approximately 15 home 
visiting supervisors/managers/directors from HV programs outside of the  state of IL, to participate in a
 
5-10 minute survey about their experiences with the Mothers and Babies Program from their perspective 
as a home visiting program manager/director. The survey responses will help guide improvements and 
innovations as we continue to support the integration of Mothers and Babies into home visiting!
4.0Procedures  Involved:
Program Implementation: This project is a cluster randomized trial to
 be conducted in 42 HV 
programs across Illinois and adjacent states. Cluster allocation by [CONTACT_854843].
 Recruitment of women from throughout Illinois and adjacent states will allow us to 
increase study generalizability by [CONTACT_79323] a more geographically and demographically diverse sample 
than could be obtained by [CONTACT_854844]. We will randomize 18 HV programs 
to implement MB with mental health professionals, 18 HV programs to implement MB with 
paraprofessional home visitors, and 6 HV programs to implement usual home visiting services.
Each HV program delivering MB (both the clinician- and home visitor-led arms), will implement  five 
MB groups/cohorts. Each cohort will have approximately 8 women, which will allow us to reach our 
target of 40 study participants per
 program. This cohort size is consistent with previous MB trials. One

Page 6 of 18month prior to implementation, we will train home visitors and mental health professionals on MB.  
We will stagger implementation in two waves so that only half the sites are implementing at
 once. 
This will allow our Intervention Coordinator to focus her efforts on ensuring attendance at 
intervention groups and fidelity to intervention protocols. Study recruitment and implementation of all 
prenatal MB sessions  will be completed  by [CONTACT_941] 4th  quarter  of Year 2. This recruitment  schedule  will 
allow  us to complete all postnatal MB sessions and follow-up data collection by [CONTACT_418423] 3, 
allowing study investigators to analyze data and prepare to disseminate study findings to both 
academic and community stakeholders.
Participant Screening: Participants will initially be screened for eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_854845]. Upon permission from
 the potential study participant, program sites will fill 
out a referral form, which will include the potential study participants name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031], 
and send it to the research team. Once the program sites refer potential study participants, a member 
of the study team will call the participant using the “Phone Script for Referrals” to screen the potential 
study participant for eligibility criteria and move forward with the consent process either via 
telephone or REDCap survey link.
Participant Outcomes Surveys : Participant outcomes will be collected at four time points—
baseline, post-intervention, 12 weeks postpartum, and 24 weeks postpartum. Participants will receive 
$[ADDRESS_1190459]-intervention assessment consists of one depressive symptom measure, so  no remuneration 
will be provided. Baseline and follow-up
 data will be collected and managed using REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure web-based application designed to support data capture 
for research studies, hosted and supported by [CONTACT_140515]’s Clinical and Translational Science 
Institute. Once research staff enters participant contact [CONTACT_3031], REDCap will generate emails or 
texts containing web-based survey links at scheduled time points. Baseline data will be collected 
within 2-[ADDRESS_1190460]-intervention, 12-week

Page 9 of 18multiple trainings for home visitors and clinicians. Holding multiple trainings for home visitors allows 
for smaller numbers of home visitors per
 training; we anticipate no more than [ADDRESS_1190462] time they deliver MB. 
However, to promote the sustainability of MB at HV sites, the clinical supervisors and [CONTACT_854876] 
will assume the supervisory role—with support from the research team—after home visitors have 
delivered the MB curriculum for the first time.
During the first six months of the project, home visitors and mental health  professionals will also 
receive technical assistance from Co-Investigator Gollan and PI [INVESTIGATOR_854828]. Specifically, these technical assistance sessions will be 
designed to strengthen competency in the specific techniques using case illustrations and provide 
competency ratings to home visitors and mental health on how they are delivering core MB concepts 
professionals.
The plan for supervision was carefully developed to ensure a sufficient level of supervision while not 
placing undue
 time commitments on home visitors and clinicians implementing MB. Initially, 
supervision for home visitors and mental health professionals will be conducted via one hour weekly 
Skype sessions with [CONTACT_854877]. During these sessions, [CONTACT_854877] will first debrief the completed 
MB session and will then help the home visitors and mental health professionals plan for the 
subsequent group session. Accordingly, our Intervention Coordinator will schedule  Skype sessions that 
consist of 2-[ADDRESS_1190463]. Tandon’s supervision and the perspectives of colleagues 
implementing MB at the same time. Following the initial supervision, group facilitators will complete 
a brief survey after the completion of each cohort they facilitate, in order to reflect on the frequency 
and types of supervision utilized during a specific  cohort.
Program Intervention: Study participants will be randomly selected to participate in one of three 
study arms; Groups led by [CONTACT_854848]-visiting
 staff, groups led by [CONTACT_854849], or a control group. Women who participate in the group sessions will attend a two hour 
session, once a week, for six weeks at their home-visiting program site. The group facilitators will 
administer a short survey at the end of each group session, to obtain the study participant’s feedback on 
the group session. Each group facilitator will be trained on the Mothers and Babies curriculum prior to 
beginning group implementation.
The Mothers and Babies Group Curriculum has been used in home visiting (HV) programs and has 
demonstrated positive outcomes for women who receive MB. The curriculum is comprised of 6 
sessions. Mothers and Babies is divided into three overall sections, one on each of the following 
Cognitive Behavioral Theory components; Pleasant Activities, Thoughts, and Contact [CONTACT_854850]. I n
each of these sections, participants are first taught to understand how the component influences her 
mood. This teaching of the relationships between CBT components
 and mood is referred to as
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 10 of 
18psychoeducation. In addition to psychoeducation, participants also receive concrete  skills in each of 
the three sections (pleasant activities, thoughts, contact [CONTACT_68809]). These skills are intended to 
provide participants with a “toolkit” of approaches they can use to improve their mood.
We will randomly select 20% of the Mothers and Babies group sessions to be  audio-recorded using a 
portable audio-recording device for purposes of
 examining intervention fidelity. While audiotapes will 
be used primarily to review fidelity of intervention implementation, we anticipate conducting 
exploratory analyses examining whether implementation fidelity affects clinical outcomes (e.g., 
depressive symptoms). The audio-recordings will be transferred back to the NU Research team by [CONTACT_854851] (i.e. Mental Health Clinician or Home Visitor) within 24 hours following the completion 
of each individual session. The group leader will email the file to the NU Research Team’s secured NU 
email address. Upon receipt, audio-recordings will be uploaded onto our research project shared drive, 
which is password protected and accessible only by [CONTACT_854852]. Should space 
become an issue, recordings will be burned onto DVDs, which will be stored in a locked file cabinet in 
our locked office location. Once the research team receives the audio-files, group facilitators will be 
instructed to immediately delete the recordings from the audio-device.
Participant Outreach and Contact: [CONTACT_854853] 24-week assessment. We will 
obtain ample tracking information at baseline which would include the participants name, email, home 
and cell phone numbers, mailing address, home-visiting site, and secondary contact [CONTACT_854854]. We will update the contact [CONTACT_459336]-up, including contact [CONTACT_854855] a participant and each participant’s preferred mode 
of communication (e.g., phone, text, Facebook). We will allow participants to complete follow-up 
surveys by [CONTACT_854856] (i.e., no internet access via computer, tablet, or 
smartphone) or less comfortable completing surveys electronically. We will conduct intensive follow- 
up with participants throughout the study via weekly communication from the Research/Intervention 
Coordinator using the participant’s preferred modes of contact; the Intervention Coordinator and RA 
are both bilingual and, therefore, able to communicate with both English- and Spanish-speaking 
participants. We will follow all study participants through the 24-week postpartum assessment 
regardless of their attendance at intervention  sessions.

Completed intervention sessions: Will be collected by [CONTACT_854862]. Fidelity of intervention 
implementation will be assessed by [CONTACT_42574] a random sample of audiotaped sessions. [CONTACT_854878], 
research staff, and the Project Coordinator will perform independent ratings using fidelity checklists 
developed and used in previous trials by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_854829]. Retraining will be triggered 
for adherence <90%.
Acceptability : We will collect data on MB acceptability via three data collection activities. First, we 
will conduct brief semi-structured interviews with 90 intervention
 participants—45 who received MB 
led by [CONTACT_854863] 45 who received MB led by [CONTACT_854833]. To 
ensure  representativeness  of this sample,  the 45 participants  per group will  be stratified  across  the three 
regions of Illinois—Chicago, downstate Illinois, and adjacent states. Second, we will conduct  brief 
semi-structured interviews with 24 home visitors who delivered MB. Again, we will divide 
respondents equally across the three regions (n=8 home visitors from Chicago, downstate Illinois, 
adjacent states, respectively). We will also conduct semi-structured interviews with all ~[ADDRESS_1190466] these checklists. We will ask each intervention participant  to rate each session using three 
questions used in previous MB studies: “how much did you enjoy today’s group session?”, “how well 
did you understand what we talked about during today’s group session?”, and  “how often do you think 
you will  use the skills  and information  that you were  given  during  today’s  group session?”

IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 12 of 18Home Visitors: We will recruit 72 home visitors from 42 participating HV programs  throughout the 
state of Illinois and adjacent states. All HV programs recruit women at high
 risk for poor pregnancy 
and/or parenting outcomes via referrals from prenatal care clinics, community outreach, and current 
program participation. We will be training all of the 72 home-visitors who are being recruited through 
the participating home-visiting sites. Out of those 72 home-visitors, we anticipate 24 of them to 
implement the intervention groups and in turn be our study participants being asked to complete a 
semi-structured interview after the completion of their cohorts.
Study Participants: We will recruit 40 study participants from each of the 42 participating HV 
programs. These 40 participants per program
 will be recruited in five cohorts. Each cohort will be 
recruited for approximately one month at a participating HV program; as such, each month we recruit 
at a participating HV program we will only need to enroll 8 study participants (40 participants/5 
cohorts).
Clinicians: We will also recruit and train ~18 clinicians to deliver MB; each clinician will deliver MB 
at one or
 more HV programs across the duration of the project. All of the clinicians who are 
implementing the intervention will be invited to participate in the semi-structured interviews after the 
completion of their cohorts. The 18 clinicians will live and work in the three different regions of Illinois 
where this study will be conducted: Chicago, downstate Illinois, and western Illinois , as well as adjacent 
states. A description of the study as well as the clinician role was sent out to the Illinois Association for 
Infant Mental Health (ILAIMH) listserv and the consultant email list at Illinois Children’s Mental 
Health Partnership (ICMHP). Linda Delimata, MS, the Consultation Coordinator at the Illinois 
Children’s Mental Health Partnership (ICMHP) and coordinator of the Infant Mental Health Consultant 
network in Illinois, has identified clinicians from the three regions of the Illinois where this study will 
be conducted. We have also sent a description of the study to the Home Visiting Research Network 
(HVRN) to recruit adjacent states participation for wave 2 of recruitment.
Home Visiting Supervisors/Managers/Directors:  We will also be consenting approximately 15 
home visiting supervisors/managers/directors from HV programs outside of the state of IL, currently 
participating in
 the parent study, to participate in a 5-10 minute survey about their experiences with the 
Mothers and Babies Program from their perspective as a home visiting program manager/director. 
Recruitment Procedures/Attrition: Recruitment procedures will be identical to those used in a 
previous RCT of MB in HV programs conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tandon. A postcard and/or flyer will be 
provided to
 the participating HV sites and the potential eligible study participants prior to  NU research 
staff calling the study participants. The postcard/flyer will explain the purpose and overview of the 
study. The postcard/flyer will include a link on NU REDCap database to be able to consent to 
participate in the program and complete a baseline assessment. The surveys will be available in both 
English and Spanish. The NU research team will also email the survey link to the study participants 
using email addresses provided by [CONTACT_854864].
Prior to beginning program implementation, potential study participants contact [CONTACT_854865]. The Research Coordinator, Intervention Coordinator, 
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 13 of 18and Research Assistant, will share responsibility for calling each woman receiving HV services  ≤ 32 
weeks gestation to tell them more about the recruitment and consenting process. A recruitment  letter 
will be sent to the participants by [CONTACT_854866].
We will obtain names, phone numbers, and addresses of women ≤  [ADDRESS_1190467] that fewer than 5% of eligible participants will opt out of research  activities.
The Research Coordinator, Intervention Coordinator, and RA will introduce women meeting eligibility 
criteria to the 
study, answer questions they have about participation, and ascertain their interest in 
participating in the research study. For women in HV programs that will implement MB, they will tell 
women expressing interest in MB the anticipated date and time for the first MB group session. The 
Research/Intervention Coordinator and/or RA will call to remind women of the date and time of their 
first MB group. We expect there will be no longer than four weeks’ time between the 
Research/Intervention Coordinators’ initial recruitment call and the first MB group, during which  time 
the Research/Intervention Coordinator and/or RA will call participants at least once a week as well as 
daily in the two days prior to the first session.
We anticipate that 80% of eligible women will agree to participate (n = 1976; 80% of 2470 meeting 
eligibility criteria); in our previous RCTs in Baltimore and Hawaii, only 2%
 of eligible women 
declined. Thus, this is a very conservative estimate of the number of women who will decline study 
participation. We also conservatively estimate that 15% of women who agree to participate in the study 
will be lost to follow-up prior to the first MB session, resulting in 1680 study participants (85% of 
1976). The 15% lost to follow-up estimate is due to the transient  nature of many HV participants.

If the enrollee meets eligibility criteria and is interested in participating in the study, the Research or 
Intervention Coordinator will indicate that a web-link with instruction on completing the baseline

Page [ADDRESS_1190469] web-based survey. A preamble to 
the consent
 form will appear in REDCap on the screen prior to the participant reviewing the consent. 
This preamble will be an introduction to the consent form clearly explaining the participant’s role as 
a research participant in the study. The preamble will read: “The purpose of this study is to learn 
how well the Mothers and Babies program* works to help pregnant women and new mothers 
manage stress and reduce depression, when delivered by [CONTACT_854867]. We are 
asking you to take part in this research study because you are receiving services from a home 
visiting program or an early childhood program and you are in your 2nd or 3rd trimester of 
pregnancy. Your participation in this study will last approximately 6-[ADDRESS_1190470] approximately 30-60 minutes.”  
*The Mothers and Babies program intervention is described fully to the participant during the 
screening process prior to consenting into the research study. The preamble will be
 available in both 
English and Spanish. 
 A brief questionnaire will follow the consent form in order  to ensure the participant understands that 
(1) their participation is voluntary, and (2) they may withdraw or refuse participation at any time 
without consequence to their home visiting services. Both the online consent form and the study 
surveys for home visiting clients will be available in English and Spanish. Each time a study 
participant fills out a survey, the survey will include a prompt to the participant asking if they wish to 
continue their participation by [CONTACT_854868].
We are requesting a waiver of parent permission in order to wave the signature [CONTACT_854875] (Pregnant women >16years old; < 18 years old). This research involves minimal 
risk to the participants by [CONTACT_854869]/or telephone 
interviews in order to collect data. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
Office of Research Protections (OHRP) indicates that individuals < [ADDRESS_1190471] the rights and welfare of the minor subjects. This is a  low-risk study. We will 
assess the Minor’s ability to consent to participate by [CONTACT_851157] a series of questions at the end of 
the informed consent process to ensure they understand 1) the main points of the study, including the 
research requirements, 2) the main risks of the study (in our case, feeling uncomfortable about some  of 
the mental health questions, and 3) understanding that they can refuse to answer any questions on 
assessments  and/or  opt out of the  study  at any time w/o adversely affecting their  relationship  with their 
HV program.
This research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of parent permission. Home- 
Visiting Program protocol
 is that parent/guardian consent is not required for a client under [ADDRESS_1190472] 
fractured relationships with their parents given the predominately low-income populations we are 
working with. This will result in difficulties tracking down the parent/guardian for informed consent.
The Intervention Coordinator and RA are bilingual and, therefore, able to communicate with  both 
IRB #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page [ADDRESS_1190473] comfortable speaking.
The Research/Intervention Coordinators and the RA will conduct the semi-structured interviews. All  
home visitors and mental health professionals will be asked to provide informed consent prior
 to 
participating in their semi-structured interview. Consent forms will clearly indicate that some study 
participants will be asked to participate in this additional data collection activity.
For the home visiting supervisors/managers/directors who are interested in participating in the survey, 
the Research Coordinator will email
 the web-link with instruction on completing the survey via 
REDCap within one week of interest in completing the survey. Consent will be conducted using 
online administration at the time of the survey.
9.0 Process to Document Consent:
We request a waiver of written documentation of consent in order to administer this study online, or 
over the telephone. 
Online consenting will take place in Northwestern University’s secure REDCap 
Database. There will be a continuous prompt to participants when filling out surveys regarding their 
current willingness to continue participation.
Instructions to the REDCap assessments will provide rationale  for the use of certain survey questions. 
Research team members administering assessments via phone or in person will be instructed to make 
sure this rationale is provided to study participants who do not see this rationale on the web-based 
REDCap system. Participants will be informed via informed consent and during all assessments that 
they may choose to not answer any question at any time for any reason and that not answering 
questions will not affect their relationship with their HV programs or ability to keep receiving the MB 
intervention (for those enrolled in the two intervention arms). Research assistants will consult with the 
Research Coordinator and PI, [CONTACT_854877], if necessary, to resolve any questions they are unsure how 
to handle.
10.0 Risks to Participants:
There are no major risks to study participation. A participant in the study may experience some 
psychological discomfort while answering questions that
 may be considered of a sensitive nature about 
herself, her child, or her family. Study participants randomized to the MB intervention group may also 
experience some discomfort discussing stressful life events. Facilitators leading MB intervention 
groups will be specifically trained on protocols to handle such situations. Should a participant wish to 
withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time, her access to home visiting program services will 
not be affected. It is within reason to expect there may be participants who experience and endorse 
some level of suicidality during the study. Any study participant who expresses suicidal thoughts  on 
assessment instruments (including baseline screening) or during intervention activities will be referred 
to the supervisor at the home visiting program. The supervisor, who is trained in responding to and 
addressing suicidal ideation, will use their agency’s protocol to make a determination regarding 
whether the study participant is in danger of harming herself or others and will determine  necessary 
steps to ensure the safety of the study participant. Other psychosocial concerns that may be raised 
among study participants during study intervention activities (i.e. substance abuse and domestic 
violence, will be closely monitored) per usual home visiting program protocols. Should home visitors 
become aware of these psychosocial risks, referrals will be made to an appropriate social service 
agency using protocols used by [CONTACT_854870].

data.
11.0 Potential Benefits to Participants:
There may be no direct and immediate benefits for individuals participating in the research component 
of this study. We believe that women randomized to the MB Course will exhibit greater reductions in
 
depression symptoms, perceived stress and improved parenting.
12.0 Financial Compensation:
Participant outcomes will be collected at four time points—baseline, post-intervention, 12 weeks 
postpartum, and 24 weeks postpartum. Participants will receive $20 remuneration at the baseline, 12- 
week and 24-week assessments. They will also receive $[ADDRESS_1190475] the Privacy
 Interests of Participants:
We will use several procedures to secure data to maintain its confidentiality. Only authorized persons 
will be granted access to study data. Currently, this includes the PI ([CONTACT_854877]), Project Manager 
(Jessica Jensen) and Study Coordinators (Melissa Segovia and Alicia Diebold). Only authorized  
persons will be
 allowed to enter and view study data. Passwords and system ID’s for the  REDCAP 
system will not be shared with other team members. Additionally, the physical security of the 
workstations and files where REDCAP data are stored will be maintained by [CONTACT_3462]. All data 
collected will be de-identified using a study ID. The only document with identifying information is the 
consent form.
14.0 Confidentiality and Data Management:
Only  the research team  will have  access to individually  identifiable  private  information  about  human 
subjects, 
for the purpose of tracking recruitment and retention, as well as participation payments. All 
data will be de-identified in study  databases.
To safeguard confidentiality and anonymity, all data collection instruments will identify participants 
only by [CONTACT_32221]. Logs linking information to study numbers will be kept locked in a file 
cabinet in the Project Manager’s office. Data
 analysis staff will not have access to identifying 
information. We will inform participants of the areas to be covered in the surveys prior to their 
administration. Study participants will be told that if they experience any  discomfort while 
participating in the data collection procedures they can ask to be removed from the study. Also,

data from all study participants and will not require the need for additional procedures to monitor data 
quality.
Power Analysis: For our superiority analyses (Aim 1) comparing MB led  by [CONTACT_854871]. usual 
care, we have assumed a standard deviation of ~6.0 points on the QIDS-16—our measure of 
depressive symptoms. We anticipate over 95% power to detect a five-point difference between study 
arms (HV- led MB vs. usual care) with ICC’s up to .01; thus, the planned sample size and anticipated 
dropout rate provide adequate power to detect meaningful differences across arms for our superiority 
analysis. We have also conducted power and sample size calculations that take into consideration the 
possible loss of clusters (i.e., HV programs) within each study arm. Even with a loss of two clusters 
implementing MB and one cluster providing usual care, we will have over 90% power to detect a five-
point difference between study arms on the QIDS-16. Previous published prevalence data and previous  
MB data illustrate a 15% reduction in incidence of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and again, we anticipate 
minimal ICC. We expect power >95% to detect an absolute risk reduction of 15% in the intervention 
arm for ICCs no larger than 0.01.
For our non-inferiority (NI) analyses (Aim 2) comparing MB led by [CONTACT_854871]. MB led by 
[CONTACT_854872], we used similar assumptions of a 6.[ADDRESS_1190477]  
>85% power to detect
 a difference in mean QIDS-16 scores of two points between the two arms with 
1224 analyzable participants’ data (i.e., 612 in each arm, or 18 clusters in each group with 34 
participants on average) with an ICC no larger than .01. We have taken into consideration the potential 
loss of up to two clusters in each study arm for our NI analyses. Even with a loss of two clusters, 
which would leave us with 1064 analyzable participants’ data (i.e., 532 in each arm), we will have 
>80% power to detect a difference in mean QIDS-[ADDRESS_1190478] hoc. We do not anticipate adequate power to claim NI regarding the incidence of 
new cases of major depression. If we assume 15% incidence in the professional arm versus 20% in the 
paraprofessional arm (i.e., a margin of NI of 5%), a sample size of [ADDRESS_1190479] 64% 
power and a sample size of [ADDRESS_1190480] >50% power at the 5% level of significance without 
accounting for any ICC. Thus, we will statistically compare the two arms with respect to MDD 
incidence, but do not anticipate the ability to claim  NI.
15.0 Data Monitoring Plan to Ensure the Safety of  Participants:
Any study participant who endorses thoughts of self-harm will be referred to the supervisor at the 
home visiting program, by [CONTACT_9137].
 The supervisor, who is trained in responding to and 
addressing suicidal ideation, will use their agency’s protocol to make a determination regarding 
whether the study participant is in danger of harming herself or others and will determine  necessary 
steps to ensure the safety of the study participant. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_854830] #: STU00203761 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/2/2018 through 8/1/2019.
Page 18 of 18immediately of any such referrals made by [CONTACT_464]. In addition, should administration of 
depression scale indicate the participant is experiencing severe depressive symptoms, the
supervisor at the home visiting program will be notified in order to provide appropriate 
referrals for their client’s mental health treatment linkage.
We will administer the Maternal Mood Screener (MMS)
 (Le & Muñoz, 1998) to assess for history of 
MDD and current MDD. The MMS is a self-report checklist that assesses MDD
 using DSM-V criteria. 
Previous research supports the MMS as a valid instrument for MDD screening (Vasquez et al., 2008). 
Women meeting MDD criteria who are not currently in treatment will be referred to the supervisor at 
their HV agency.
During any of the research assessments, if the participant endorses current thoughts of harming herself 
or others, the 
following protocol should be followed, and documented on an Incident Report.
Maternal Mood Screener (MMS), Question 9d
→ In the past [ADDRESS_1190481]  two weeks
The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), Question 12
→ In the past
 week,  subject  selects answer #3 (I thought of suicide or death  several times a day  in 
some detail, or I made specific plans for suicide or actually tried to take my life)
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Question 10
→ In the past  week, subject endorses  thoughts  of harming herself quite often
When assessments are completed over the phone or online during regular business hours the following 
protocol will be completed within 24 hours.
Within 24 hours of the  study participant’s completion of their assessments a member of the Research team 
will call the study participant and will let the participant know that he/she will be contact[CONTACT_854873]/suicide/hurting yourself/others, so they can reach out and offer support. The research team member 
will ask the study participant the following questions:
“Are you thinking about killing yourself?”
“Have you ever tried to hurt yourself before?”
“Have you thought of ways that you might hurt  yourself?”
“Do you have pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/weapons in the house?”
“Do you think you might try to hurt yourself today?”

All individuals that complete the above surveys will receive the following resources immediately upon 
answering the above answer choices on the noted assessments

Page 19 of 18All of these resources (except the home visiting program office number) will also be shared with all study 
participants, regardless of 
answers to assessment questions, at the end of each assessment.
The research team member will stay on the phone with those individuals who endorse the possibility of 
imminent self-harm. After the research team member ends the call with the study participant, they will call 
the Program Manager with relevant details, reporting what the client said and endorsed, as well as the 
information they gathered during the assessment and call with the participant. The research team member 
will then follow up with an email to the home visitor, supervisor, Project Manager, as well as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_854831].
If the survey is completed outside of regular business hours (i.e. weekends/holidays) the research team will 
follow-up with the 
participant no later than the following business day. As noted above, the risk would be 
acknowledged in real time as the participant would still receive resources immediately following their 
answer selection to the above survey questions.
We believe this to be a reasonable expectation in regards to protecting human subjects and the role of the 
research team. Previous Mothers and Babies studies conducted by [CONTACT_978], as well as other nationally 
representative studies of perinatal women have shown that less than 1% of study participants will endorse the 
most “severe” response choice on survey items related to suicidality.  As such, we anticipate that the number of 
study participants who endorse the most severe response related to suicidality outside of regular business hours 
over the course of this study will likely be < 10 individuals. As such, we believe our approach to handling this 
potential risk to study participants—i.e., immediate provision of 24/7 resources and follow-up by [CONTACT_854874]—is reasonable given its likelihood of occurrence. Moreover, women receiving 
the Mothers and Babies intervention (~86% of the sample) will be receiving information on modifying harmful 
thought patterns that may contribute to decreased thoughts about self-harm.
16.0 Data and if applicable, Specimen Banking:
The study surveys 
will be conducted using web-based surveys, created using REDCap, which is 
supported by [CONTACT_854847]. We do not plan to share individual study results with 
subjects. However, aggregate data findings will be shared with home visiting programs.

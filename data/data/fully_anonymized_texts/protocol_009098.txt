Synopsis 
 
Study Aims  
To define the role of limited duration peginterferon-alfa 2a in the presence of tenofovir in 
treating patients with chronic hepatitis B by: 
 
• Comparing the long-term efficacy of initial treatment with combination therapy 
consisting of peginterferon alfa-2a plus tenofovir DF versus tenofovir DF monotherapy  
• Evaluating “off treatment” sustained responses following combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a plus tenofovir DF versus tenofovir DF monotherapy  
 
Type of Study  
• Randomized treatment trial 
 
Clinical Trial 
This is a randomized (1:1) parallel group design trial comparing (i) t enofovir DF 300 mg 
daily for 192 weeks (4 years) and (ii) peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg weekly for 24 weeks 
plus t enofovir DF 300 mg daily for 192 weeks (4 years).  Enrolled participants will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_96477] (positive/negative), known genotype (A  vs. all others) and 
cirrhosis (present vs. absent).  After 192 weeks of treatment, participants meeting criteria for treatment discontinuation will stop treatment and be followed for up to 48 weeks (total duration of treatment and follow up is  up to 240 weeks). Emtricitabine/tenofovir 
coformulated as Truvada, approved for treating HIV but not for treating HBV infection, 
will be offered to participants  with primary nonresponse, partial virological response or 
confirmed virologic breakthrough.  
 
1. Background  
Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is prevalent world-wide (estimated to 
affect 360 million individuals) and in the [LOCATION_002] (estimated to affect 2 million 
individuals) (1).  Chronic hepatitis B may result in progressive liver disease that leads to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  Chronic hepatitis B can also be benign and non-progressive, evolving into an inactive carrier state that rarely leads to significant liver injury or HCC.  Over the last few years, several highly effective antiviral agents have been developed and approved for use in the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis B (2).  Nevertheless, uncertainty remains about which 
patients warrant therapy with which agent or agents, for how long, and with what ultimate endpoint as a measure of clinical benefit.  
 
 
Indications and approaches to therapy of hepatitis B are based upon knowledge of the features of its natural history.  The natural history of chronic hepatitis B, particularly if 
acquired in early childhood, runs through several stages or phases that have different 
clinical manifestations and implications for long-term hepatic injury (3, 4).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
there is an early inactive “immune tolerant
” phase marked by [CONTACT_96478], HBeAg and HBV DNA, but minimal or no elevations in serum alanine and 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  2 of 42 
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 aspartate aminotransferase levels (ALT, AST) and minimal activity or injury on liver 
biopsy (5).  The immune tolerant phase is variable in duration, but is typi[INVESTIGATOR_96448] i n 
adolescence or early adulthood by [CONTACT_96479] “ immune clearance ” phase, marked by [CONTACT_96480], inflammation and hepatocellular necrosis on liver biopsy and somewhat lower levels of serum HBV DNA with persistence of HBsAg and HBeAg.  This phase is what is commonly referred to as “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, and is also variable in duration and severity.  If severe and prolonged, HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B can lead to progressive hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.  If milder in 
course or shorter in duration, this phase can eventually resolve, leading to an inactive 
HBsAg carrier phase with minimal liver fibrosis or injury.  This transition from immune active to inactive chronic hepatitis B is usually marked by a sudden fall  in HBV DNA 
levels and loss of HBeAg despi[INVESTIGATOR_96449] (often referred to as HBeAg seroconversion because of development of anti -HBe).  The resulting inactive HBsAg 
carrier state is marked by [CONTACT_96481] (inflammation and necrosis) on liver biopsy, absence of HBeAg and presence of HBsAg. Once HBeAg has been cleared and HBV DNA falls to low levels, the disease becomes inactive or mild and does not progress further (6).  However, in some patients, the loss of HBeAg is not associated with complete resolution of disease and HBV DNA 
levels remain moderately elevated.  These patients have developed HBeAg-negative 
chronic hepatitis B, which can be progressive and is marked by [CONTACT_96482]. Changes in the hepatitis B virus sequence as well as 
changes in immune reactivity appear to govern the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis B and whether the disease goes into long-term remission and an inactive carrier state or evolves into an HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B or continues in the 
HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B.  Furthermore, some patients with chronic HBV 
infection who become HBeAg negative, later also lose HBsAg and appear to be cured of the chronic viral  infection.  In actuality, these patients usually harbor low levels of HBV 
DNA in an inactive state in the liver, but they usually are spared further hepatic injury or long-term consequences of the disease.   
 
 
These features of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B underlie the criteria for therapy of this disease and the endpoints of treatment (2, 7, 8).  Thus, therapy of typi[INVESTIGATOR_96450]-positive chronic hepatitis B is generally aimed at clearance of HBeAg and attainment of the subsequent inactive carrier state with normal serum ALT levels and inactive liver histology.  Treatment of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is generally aimed at long-term suppression of HBV DNA levels and improvements in serum ALT 
levels and liver histology.  Of course, clearance of HBsAg is a much more desired 
endpoint of therapy.  Unfortunately, loss of HBsAg is rarely achieved, at least with therapy for a limited period of time and with current treatment options.  Nevertheless, endpoints short of loss of HBsAg have to be considered surrogate endpoints of therapy and of uncertain long-term benefit (9).  Thus, while many patients who clear HBeAg 
during antiviral therapy of hepatitis B seem to attain a long-term remission in disease, a 
proportion do not improve or later relapse either re-developi[INVESTIGATOR_96451]-negative chronic hepatitis B with fluctuating moderate levels of HBV DNA, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, and inflammation, necrosis and potentially progressive fibrosis on liver biopsy.  
 
 
Thus, the aim of antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B is to achieve control of HBV replication and improve disease activity.  Suppression of HBV DNA to a low level is usually followed by [CONTACT_96483]  [ADDRESS_106494] reliably occurs with loss of HBsAg.  
 
There are two forms of licensed treatment for chronic hepatitis B: parenterally 
administered peginterferon and orally administered nucleos(t)ide analogues (lamivudine adefovir dipvoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [tenofovir DF]). The mechanisms of action of these two forms of therapy are quite different, as are the route of administration and frequency and severity of side effects (10, 11).  Mainly 
because of their ease of administration and lack of side effects, the nucleos(t)ide 
analogues have become the preferred means of treatment.  Nevertheless, several 
prospective tr ials have shown that the rate of response, defined by [CONTACT_96484], to a 48 
week course of peginterferon is significantly higher than that to a 48 week course of nucleos(t)ide analogues; with rates of HBeAg loss at one year ranging from 12-24% for nucleos(t)ide analogues compared to rates of 30 -35% with peginterferon (12-16).  
However, the nucleos(t)ide analogues are typi[INVESTIGATOR_96452]-term rather than for one year only; and rates of clearance of HBeAg during nucleos(t)ide therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_96453].  In contrast, the expense and side effects of 
peginterferon makes long-term therapy impractical.  Thus, it appears that rates of clearance of HBeAg achieved with peginterferon can be achieved with the better 
tolerated nucleos(t)ide analogues with longer courses of treatment.  Nevertheless, the 
rates of clearance of HBeAg after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96454]-term follow up of 48 weeks of therapy with peginterferon may be associated with a gradual rise in rates of loss of HBeAg.  These factors make it difficult to discern whether peginterferon has any benefit above and beyond what can be achieved with the oral nucleos(t)ide analogues.  Furthermore, long-term therapy with 
nucleos(t)ide analogues is  often associated with a high rate of improvement in liver 
histology, HBV DNA suppression and normalization of ALT even without change in 
HBeAg status.  The long-term improvement in these features is particularly evident in therapy of patients with HBeAg-n egative chronic hepatitis B (17, 18), in which 
peginterferon therapy is associated with only a modest long-term effect on HBV DNA 
and ALT levels (19).
 
 
A feature of peginterferon treatment that is distinctly greater than with nucleos(t)ide 
analogue therapy is the loss of HBsAg. Thus, in studies of HBeAg-positive chronic 
hepatitis B with a one-year course of peginterferon, rates of loss of HBsAg have ranged from 3% to 7%, whereas loss of HBsAg with a 48 week course of nucleos(t)ide analogues is <1% to 3% (12-16).  Furthermore, long-term follow up of patients who have 
become HBeAg-negative after interferon therapy has shown that the majority of these 
patients eventually become HBsAg negative as well (20).  This gradual loss of HBsAg is greater than occurs spontaneously and appears to be a special characteristic of responses to peginterferon therapy.  Emerging data suggests that ultimately prolonged suppression of viral replication with a nucleos(t)ide analogue leads to HBsAg loss. In 
one study loss of HBsAg after 1 year of tenofovir DF was observed in 3% of those 
treated for HBeAg-positive CHB and this figure increased to 6% after 2 years of therapy (only in genotypes A and D).  In another study with adefovir for 4-[ADDRESS_106495] of the patients followed for up to 5 
years after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374].  It is unknown whether even longer duration of therapy with 
nucleoside(t)ide analogues will result in ever increasing HBsAg loss or whether the rate 
of loss will level off.

Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 Thus, the advantages of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy are the ease of administration, 
the lack of significant side effects and the consistent suppression of HBV DNA that can 
be achieved, particularly with the newer agents such as tenofovir DF and entecavir. 
While emergence of drug resistance can limit the efficacy of oral agents, a low rate of antiviral resistance (1% or less even with prolonged therapy for 4 to 5 years), is seen with entecavir and tenofovir DF, reflective of their greater potency and higher genetic barrier to resistance.  As a consequence 80-90% of patients treated long-term with these agents achieve rates of marked suppression of HBV DNA levels and normal ALT levels. 
The advantage of peginterferon therapy is that it is administered for a limited period (6 to 
12 months) and results in loss of HBsAg in a significant proportion of patients.  Previous studies have shown that a one-year course of combination therapy of peginterferon and nucleos(t)ide analogue does not yield a higher response rate than a one -year course of 
either agent alone (21).  However, these studies have been limited by [CONTACT_2224] a 
nucleos(t)ide analogue with high risk of resistance (e.g. lamivudine)  and a relatively 
short course of treatment. Thus, an obvious question is whether the combination of a limited course of peginterferon (6 or 12 months) with long-term therapy with a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue (tenofovir DF or entecavir for at least 4 years) will provide a higher rate of loss of HBsAg and ability to stop therapy without relapse.  This clinical trial 
compares the efficacy of peginterferon plus a potent nucleotide analogue, tenofovir DF, 
for 24 weeks followed by [CONTACT_96485] a further 3.5 years to the efficacy of that same potent nucleotide analogue, tenofovir DF, given for a full 4 years. The primary measure of outcome will be HBsAg loss in serum 240 weeks after starting antiviral therapy .

Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments during

• Treatment A: Tenofovir DF 300 mg by [CONTACT_96488] 192 weeks.  
• Treatment B: Peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg by [CONTACT_96489] 300 mg by [CONTACT_96488] 24 weeks followed by [CONTACT_96490] 300 mg once daily for 168 weeks (192 weeks total therapy). 
 All participants will be instructed to take one tablet of tenofovir DF once daily  without 
regards to meals.  Participants in treatment arm B will also be instructed to take [ADDRESS_106512] the peginterferon alfa-2a on the same day each week.   
5.2. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
5.2.1 General information 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) is a prodrug of tenofovir.  It is an acyclic 
nucleotide phosphonate analogue of adenosine [ADDRESS_106513] and after being taken up 
intracellularly is hydrolyzed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_96455], tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate competes with 
the natural intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate for uptake into the nascent viral 
DNA molecule and once incorporated causes DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate may also interfere with the HBV DNA polymerase by [CONTACT_96491].  The intracellular half- life of tenofovir is prolonged and is in excess of 60 
hrs.  The half-life of tenofovir in serum is about 17 hours following a single dose.  
Multiple dose pharmacokinetics suggests that the median steady state tenofovir C
max 
values are 355 mg/L [0.33 µg/mL] after [ADDRESS_106514] tenofovir pharmaco-kinetics across either healthy participants or participants infected with HIV or HBV.  Tenofovir is excreted unchanged in the urine and dose adjustments are needed in 
participants with renal insufficiency.     
 
Dose adjustments are required for creatinine clearance (CrCl) of <50 mL /min.  
 
 Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)  Hemodialysis  
>50 30-50 10-29 
Recommended 
300 mg dosing 
interval  Every 24 hours  Every 48 h ours Every 72 to 96 
hours  Every 7 days or 
after a total of approximately 12 
hours of dialysis  
  
Only when there is moderate CrCl (30 -50 mL/min) or severe reduction in CrCl 
(<30mL/min) is there the chance for drug toxicity after a single 300 mg dose. 
 In vitro, tenofovir DF at expected concentrations with once a day dosing does not inhibit the metabolizing ability of major human cytochrome P -450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) responsible for phase I metabolism of most drugs.  Drug interactions potentially could occur with other drugs which are eliminated by [CONTACT_96492] e.g. cidofovir, acyclovir and other members of this group of agents.  Such a drug interaction may result in increased blood levels of tenofovir DF or the competing agent.  Similarly there may be some interactions with drugs used in the 
treatment of HIV e.g. didanosine, atazanavir and lopenavir/ritonavir. 
 There is no substantial effect of TDF on methadone, estrogens or birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_96456].  
 5.2.[ADDRESS_106515]. This tubular toxicity manifests as renal tubular acidosis, a Fanconi -like syn drome or nephrogenic diabetes insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562] (22). Probably as a 
consequence of the nephrotoxic effects of tenofovir DF, osteomalacia has been reported in young macaques given [ADDRESS_106516] been reported but with no significant difference in the frequency of these 
complications in participants with HIV who are and who are not taking tenofovir.  
 
Reproductive Toxicity : Tenofovir  DF is a Pregnancy Category B drug. No adverse effects 
on embryo-fetal development in rats were observed with long -term, high-dose therapy; 
nor were there adverse effects on growth, development, and behavior. In this study, females of childbearing potential will be enrolled only if they agree to use effective 
contraception during therapy and pregnancy testing will occur at every visit during the peginterferon treatment phase.  
 
5.3 Peginterferon-alfa- 2a 
5.3.1 General description 
Peginterferon alfa-2a is a covalent conjugate of recombinant alfa-2a interferon with a 
single branched molecule of polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 daltons. Peginterferon alfa-2a is produced using recombinant DNA technology and contains 180 µg/1.[ADDRESS_106517] be kept refrigerated at +4C until use.  
 Interferon inhibits viral replication by [CONTACT_96493].  Interferon does not enter the hepatocyte, but rather  binds to specific receptors on the cell surface, which 
initiates intracellular signaling that leads to rapid activation of multiple “interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); the encoded proteins of these genes inhibit viral replication in 
infected hepatocytes by [CONTACT_16000] (including inhibition of viral protein 
synthesis and breakdown of viral RNA).  Peginterferon alfa-2a also has immunomodulatory activity that is thought to be important in obtaining a virological response. Steady -state serum concentrations of peginterferon alfa-2a are reached within 
[ADDRESS_106518] alpha interferon. 
 
5.3.2 Pharmacokinetic considerations  
In participants with end- stage-renal -disease undergoing hemodialysis, there is a 25% to 
45% reduction in clearance of peginterferon alfa -2a. The effect of milder renal 
impairment has not been studied but it is advised that in participants with impaired renal functi on, signs and symptoms of interferon toxicity should be closely monitored.  It is 
also recommended that peginterferon alfa-2a be used with caution in participants with 
creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.  
 There is no known effect of peginterferon alfa-2a on the pharmacokinetics of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P -450 system. There are no known clinically significant 
interactions with nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy, but a phase IV registration trial of 
peginterferon alfa-2a and telbivudine was prematurely  discontinued due to a higher than 
anticipated incidence of peripheral neuropathy.  
 5.3.3. Safety 
As with standard alpha interferon, treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with 
many troublesome and occasionally serious, or even life-threatening, side effects.  Dose discontinuation has been reported in 6% to 9% and dose modification in 31% to 47% of participants treated in the peginterferon alfa-2a registration trials for hepatitis B.  The most frequent causes of dose adjustment were laboratory abnormalities such as 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  11 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 thrombocytopenia or leukopenia.  These side effects are particularly common in patients 
with advanced liver disease and hypersplenism.  Peginterferon alfa-2a is contraindicated 
in participants with decompensated cirrhosis due to the possibility of serious infections, 
flares of disease, and worsening decompensation.  In this study, patients with any clinical 
or laboratory features suggestive of hepatic decompensation will not be enrolled.  
 The majority of clinical experience in the use of peginterferon alfa-2a has been in chronic hepatitis C in which peginterferon is combined with ribavirin.  In the few studies of 
peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic hepatitis B it has appeared that side effects are less 
frequent than in chronic hepatitis C.  The overall incidence of serious adverse events 
was less in studies in hepatitis B (4% -5%) than in those with hepatitis C (7% to 16%), 
and fewer drug withdrawals were reported (6% to 8% versus 17% to 33%, respectively) despi[INVESTIGATOR_96457].  Depression was also less frequently 
reported in studies done in hepatitis B (4%) than hepatitis C (22%, p < 0.001). 
 Peginterferon should be avoided in participants with other serious co-morbid illnesses, including, but not limited to, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, serious autoimmune conditions and severe depression.  
 
Pregnancy:   Peginterferon alfa-2a is a Pregnancy Category C drug that has not been adequately evaluated in humans for its teratogenic effect. Standard interferon has been shown to increase the rate of abortion in Rhesus monkeys when given approximately [ADDRESS_106519] been no adequate and well -controlled studies of peginterferon alfa-2a in 
pregnant females. Therefore, in this study, females of childbearing potential will be 
enrolled only if they agree to use effective contraception during therapy and pregnancy testing will occur at every visit during the p eginterferon treatment phase.  
 5.4. Administration and drug accountability  
Study drugs (peginterferon alfa-2a, tenofovir DF, and emtricitabine/tenofovir) will be shipped to study sites from the drug distribution center. Staff at each site will be responsible for drug accountability.  This will include documenting drugs received, study drug dispensed to participants, used and unused study drug returned, and accounting of 
any drug destroyed by [CONTACT_779]. An accurate and up-to-date accountability log will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_25733].     
5.5. Concomitant medications   
All concomitant medications (prescription and non-prescription) being taken by [CONTACT_96494].   
 
5.6. Prohibited medications  
Use of the following medications is prohibited while participants are on study drugs: 
1. Antivirals with activity against HBV, including famciclovir or valacyclovir.  The 
need for ongoing use of these antivirals would be exclusionary at study entry, but 
allowed if medically indicated and prescribed during the course of the study.   
2. Nephrotoxic agents including aminoglycoside antibiotics, amphotericin, cidofovir, 
and foscarnet. 
3. Competitors of renal excretion such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone. 
4. Systemic chemotherapeutic agents (i.e., cancer treatment medications).  
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  12 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 5. Sy stemic corticosteroids. The need for ongoing use of systemic corticosteroids 
would be exclusionary at study entry, but would be recorded as a concomitant 
medication if medically indicated and prescribed during the course of the study.   
6. Any investigational  agents. 
7. Use of growth factors such as GCSF, erythropoietin, and eltrombopag. 
 
6. Study procedures 
6.1. Study enrollment  
Participants thought to be eligible for participation will be asked to give their consent to participate by [CONTACT_96495] a current consent form approved by [CONTACT_1201]/REB at that institution.  Participants will be required to sign the consent form before any study procedures are performed.  
They will then undergo the screening (8 weeks prior to randomization) procedures, 
including medical history, physical examination and blood tests as summarized in the Time and Event chart (Appendix 3 ).  Once eligibility is confirmed, they will complete pre-
randomization tests and then be randomly assigned (at baseline visit, day 0) to one of 
the two treatment groups using a system established by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC). Patients who are not currently enrolled in the HBRN Cohort study may be 
enrolled concurrently  with the screening visit for this  trial, or if they choose not to enroll 
into the Cohort Study, the necessary components on the Cohort baseline evaluation will be completed prior to enrolling in this study at the clinical trial screening or baseline visit.

6.4. On-Treatment assessments 
After randomization, participants will be seen in follow up at 4-week intervals for the first 
12 weeks and then at 12 week intervals until therapy is completed, as shown in the Time and Event Chart (Appendix 3 ).  For participants having side effects related to treatment 
or adherence issues, more frequent visits can be undertaken at the discretion of the 
study physician.  These visits will be conducted as an “Unscheduled Visit”  and 
tests/procedures performed will be at the discretion of the study physician (with the 
exception of adverse events to be managed per guidelines specified in the protocol or manual of operations, i.e. hepatitis  flare or hypophosphatemia) .

6.7 Assessment of adherence 
At each study visit, study personnel will review the study drug dosing schedule with participants and counseling on adherence will be provided. At each study visit while on 
therapy, participants will be asked to return all bottles of tenofovir and used vials of 
peginterferon alfa-2a to document how much study medications were used. Serum drug levels may be measured on stored serum samples.   
6.8. Management of non-response 
Definition: Primary non -response is defined as a failure to achieve a > 1-log
10 IU/mL 
decline in HBV DNA after the first 24 weeks of treatment.  HBV DNA will be measured 
by [CONTACT_96496]-testing 4 weeks later (week 28) . Compliance with study medications will be assessed and documented.  
Primary non -response is considered to be treatment failure.  
 
Management of non-response 6.9.1. Reinforce compliance when non-response is initially suspected.  
6.9.2. Testing of Tenofovir DF levels may be performed (samples will be archived for 
analysis and not available in real -time).   
6.9.3. If serum HBV DNA report confirms that participant meets criteria for virological 
non-response, change to combination emtricitabine/tenofovir within 2 weeks of obtaining 
the week 28 result.  
6.9.4. Participants will be assessed at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and then every 12 weeks after 
initiation of rescue therapy to document the response. Thereafter, participants will be followed per protocol.  
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  17 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 6.9.5. If serum HBV DNA is ≥1000 IU/mL by [CONTACT_96497] 24 
week s of rescue therapy, subsequent treatment will be altered at the discretion of the 
study physician. 
 
6.10 Management of a partial virological response 
Definition: A partial virological response is defined as a decrease of serum HBV DNA 
>1 log 10 IU/mL by [CONTACT_5875] 24 but a level ≥100,000 IU/mL confirmed on two consecutive 
visits (weeks 36 and 48).  A partial virological response is considered to be treatment 
failure.  
6.10.1. Reinforce compliance when partial response is initially suspected.  
6.10.2. Testing of Tenofovir DF levels may be performed (samples will be archived for 
analysis).   
6.10.3. If serum HBV DNA report confirms participant meets criteria for partial virologic 
response, change to combination emtricitabine/tenofovir within 2 weeks of obtaining the 
week 48 result  6.10.4. Participants will be assessed at weeks 4, 8 and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks after initiation of rescue therapy to document the response. Thereafter, participants will be followed per protocol.  
6.10.5. If serum HBV  DNA is ≥1000 IU/mL by [CONTACT_96498] 24 
of rescue therapy, subsequent treatment will be altered at the discretion of the study physician.  
 6.11. Management of virological breakthrough  
Definition:  Virological breakthrough is defined as  a >1-log
10 IU/mL increase in HBV 
DNA level from nadir or redetection of serum HBV DNA after disappearance that is 
confirmed on re-testing [ADDRESS_106526] confirms virological breakthrough, a blood sample will be tested for 
genotypic resistance.  
 
6.11.1. Reinforce compliance when virological breakthrough is initially suspected.  The 
importance of compliance with study medication will be reinforced with study participants 
at each visit.  
6.11. 2. Testing of Tenofovir DF levels may be performed (samples will be archived for 
analysis).   
6.11.3. Resistance mutations will be evaluated by [CONTACT_96499] . 
 
6.11.4. Selection of rescue therapy will be based upon the cross -resistance profile of the 
mutation(s) present when available. If unavailable, emtricitabine/tenofovir  will be used. 
Rescue therapy should be started within 4 weeks of confirming the virological breakthrough. The time to start of rescue therapy may be adjusted depending upon the time required for resistance testing to be completed.  
6.11.5. Participants will be assessed at weeks 4, 8 and 12 weeks and then every 12 
weeks after initiation of rescue therapy to document the response.  Thereafter, 
participants will be followed per protocol.  
6.11.6. If serum HBV DNA is ≥1000 IU/mL by [CONTACT_5875] 24 of rescue therapy, treatment will 
be changed at the discretion of a study physician. 
 
6.12 Definition and management of on-treatment hepatitis flares On-treatment hepatitis flare is defined as increase in ALT to ≥300 U/L for men and ≥200 
U/L for women AND >3 times baseline (day 0) value. Participants who meet criteria of a 
flare will be seen every 4 weeks until ALT decreases to <300 U/L for men and <200 U/L for women. Severe on-treatment hepatitis flare is defined as ALT ≥1000 U/L regardless 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  18 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 of gender. Participants who meet criteria of a severe flare will be seen every week until 
ALT decreases to <1000 U/L, at which point they will be evaluated every 4 weeks until 
ALT <300 U/L for men and <200 U/L for women and thereafter at scheduled visits per study protocol. Participants who experience hepatitis flares may continue treatment if total bilirubin is <2.0 mg/dL and direct bilirubin <1.0 mg/dL. Participants who experience severe hepatitis flares may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator if total bilirubin is <2.0 mg/dL and direct bilirubin <1.0 mg/dL.  
 
6.13. End-of-treatment (prior to week 192) assessment  
6.13.1. Eligibility criteria for discontinuation of treatment prior to week 192   
Participants who meet either of the criteria below will be discontinued from treatment: 
 
• Grade IV toxicity (laboratory or clinical)  
• Hepatic decompensation while on peginterferon  defined by: 
o Total bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dL and direct bilirubin ≥1.0 mg/dL 
o Any clinical decompensation 
• Participant refuses to continue treatment/participation in study  
 
6.13.2. End of treatment assessment   
Participants who stop treatment early will complete assessments specified for the week 
192 visit (see section 6.5 and Appendix 3).  Participants who discontinue treatment due to Grade IV toxicity or hepatic decompensation will continue to be followed until  these events are resolved or stabilized, 
according to the post-treatment follow-up schedule. 
 
6.13.3. Follow -up visit schedule after week 192 
All participants who are eligible to stop treatment at week 192 will be seen at weeks 196, 
200, 204, 208, 212, 216, 228, and 240 (corresponding to weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 
and [ADDRESS_106527]- treatment for those whose treatment is discontinued). This is the minimal 
follow up required. Laboratory testing (liver panel) plus telephone assessment can replace an outpatient visit at weeks 208 and 212 if ALT at the preceding assessment (week 204 and week 208, respectively) is  <300 U/L for men or <200 U/L for women and 
bilirubin is normal  (total bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL or direct bilirubin <0.5 mg/dL) . Additional 
visits for safety monitoring should be included as needed. Participants who are not 
eligible to stop treatment at week 192 and who remain on treatment will be seen at weeks 204, 216, 228 and 240 (i.e., 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks after week 192).  Laboratory testing will be performed as outlined in Appendix 4 . Blood samples for 
serum/plasma will be collected at each outpatient visit. 
 
6.14. Assessment and management of relapse after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374] 
6.14.1. Definition of relapse 
Virological relapse: Persistent HBV DNA ≥1000 IU/mL during the follow- up period (on 
at least two samples at least 12 weeks apart, with one of them being more than 24 
weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374]) in HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative participants.  
Biochemical relapse will be defined as an elevated ALT ( >30 U/L for females and >45 
U/L for males if normal at end of treatment or an increase of 1.5 X end of treatment level if abnormal at end of treatment) on at least two samples at least [ADDRESS_106528] 24 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374] . 
 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  19 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 An ALT flare will be defined as an ALT level ≥300 U/L for males or ≥ 200 U/L for 
females. 
 
These definitions will be used for data analyses, see section 6.14.2 for criteria to 
reinitiate treatment. 
 
Monitoring of participants 
• Participants with an increase in total bilirubin to ≥3 mg/dL or direct bilirubin to ≥1 mg/dL or INR ≥1.3 (regardless of ALT and HBV DNA levels) must be reassessed 
as soon as possible and within 1 week for liver panel, PT/INR, CBC, and 
creatinine. The laboratory testing should continue every week until INR<1.3 and either total bilirubin <3 mg/dL or direct bilirubin <1 mg/dL. 
• Participants with an ALT >1000 U/L for both males and females (regardless of HBV DNA levels) must be reassessed as soon as possible and within 1 week. 
Thereafter, weekly monitoring of liver panel, bilirubin (total or direct), PT/INR, HBV DNA should continue until ALT ≤ 1000 U/L. 
• Participants with an ALT ≥300 U/L for males or ≥200 U/L for females (regardless of HBV DNA levels) must be reassessed within 1 week and thereafter, every 2 
weeks  for liver panel, HBV DNA, bilirubin (total or direct), and PT/INR . The 
laboratory testing should continue until ALT <300 U/L for males or <200 U/L for 
females . 
• Participants with an ALT ≥150 U/L for males or ≥100 U/L for females (regardless of HBV DNA levels) must be reassessed within 4 weeks and thereafter every 4 (±1) weeks for liver panel, HBV DNA, bilirubin (total or direct), and PT/INR . The 
laboratory testing should continue until ALT <150 U/L for males or <100 U/L for 
females. 
 6.14.2. C riteria for treatment reinitiation in the Post -Treatment Follow up Period 
Tenofovir DF will be restarted for  any one of the following:  
• Any one of the three criteria: INR ≥1.3, t otal bilirubin ≥3.0 mg/dL or direct bilirubin 
≥1.0 mg/dL, regardless of HBV DNA or ALT level. 
• Any clinical decompensation, regardless of HBV DNA or ALT level. 
• HBV DNA ≥10,000 IU/mL and ALT >1000 U/L (male or female) (i.e. only one ALT 
value >1000 U/L is needed to qualify ). 
• HBV DNA ≥10,000 IU/mL and ALT ≥ 300 U/L for males, ≥200 U/L for females. A 
total of one HBV DNA ≥10,000 IU/mL and any three ALT values ≥ 300 U/L (male) 
or ≥200 U/L (female) over the 4-week (or longer) time frame are needed to 
qualify . Treatment will be resumed if the third ALT remains ≥ 300 U/L (male) or 
≥200 U/L (female).  
• HBV DNA ≥10,000 IU/mL and ALT ≥ 150 U/L for males  or ≥100 U/L for females .  
A total of one  HBV DNA  ≥10,000 IU/mL and any three ALT values ≥ 150 U/L 
(male) or ≥100 U/L (female) over the 12 week (or longer) time period are needed 
to qualify . Treatment will be resumed if the third ALT remains ≥ 150 U/L (male)  or 
≥100 U/L (female).  
• HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive at week 192. 
• HBsAg-positive, HBeAg- negative, and anti -HBe -negative at week [ADDRESS_106529], ALT and HBV DNA levels will be done at 4, 8 and 12 
weeks after Tenofovir DF is restarted and then every 12 weeks. If bilirubin or INR is 
abnormal at the time of treatment reinitiation, it (they) should be monitored at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after Tenofovir DF is restarted and then every 12 weeks until it (they) return(s) to normal. If, after treatment reinitiation, the participant meets criteria for non-response 
(section 6.9) or partial response (section 6.10), the drug therapy will be changed as 
outlined in those sections.  
 
7. Adverse events and toxicity management  
7.1. Criteria for permanent and premature discontinuation of treatment 
• Death 
• Grade IV toxicity (laboratory or clinical)  
• Hepatic decompensation defined by: 
o Total bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dL and direct bilirubin ≥1.0 mg/dL 
o Any clinical decompensation 
 7.2.a. Adverse effects of peginterferon alfa-2a 
Common side effects of peginterferon alfa-2a include influenza-like symptoms, 
particularly with the first few injections, fatigue, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as 
depression and reduction in white blood cell counts and platelet counts.  Hyper - or 
hypothyroidism has been noted to occur in up to 5% of participants receiving peginterferon alfa-2a.  
 Some rare but potentially serious side effects include: 
• neuropsychiatric complications, which may include suicide, suicidal ideation, acute psychosis and severe depression 
• serious and severe bacterial infections; fatal infections have been reported during treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a  
• pancreatitis  
• interstitial pneumonitis, fatal cases have been reported with peginterferon alfa 2a use  
 
Other possible but uncommon adverse events associated with peginterferon alfa-2a include:  
• development or exacerbation of existing autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, etc.  
• pulmonary disorders including dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, and sarcoidosis  
• exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease  
• eye disorders, including decrease or loss of vision, retinal hemorrhages  
• hearing disorders, including loss of hearing and tinnitus  
• hypersensitivity reactions including severe skin reactions, in the spectrum of Stevens Johnson syndr ome 
 
7.2.b. Peginterferon alfa-2a dose reductions 
Factors that will lead to a reduction in the dose of peginterferon alfa-2a include: 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  21 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 1. Disabling symptoms, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_9764], are related to 
peginterferon alfa-2a treatment and prevent the participant from performing 
his/her occupation or daily tasks.  
2. A rash consistent with allergic reaction or vasculitis. 
3. Reductions in the neutrophil count according to the guidelines in Appendix [ADDRESS_106530].  
The dose of study medications may be decreased due to adverse events or laboratory abnormalities.  The weekly dose of peginterferon alfa-2a will be reduced in graduated steps as follows: 
• Level 1 decrease from 180 µ g to 135 µg  
• Level 2 decrease from 135 µ g to 90 µg 
• Level [ADDRESS_106531] dose adjustment for neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia, laboratory values should be repeated, if practical, prior to the next dose of peginterferon alfa-2a to confirm the result and dictate the course of action.  
Participants who remain with a neutrophil count below 500/mm
3 (but above 250/ mm3) or 
a platelet count below 50,000/ mm3 (but above 25,000/ mm3) should receive stepwise 
dose reductions until levels of neutrophils and platelets are ≥  500/mm3 or 50,000/mm3, 
respectively, or until a dose of [ADDRESS_106532] a neutrophil count below 250/mm3 or a platelet count below 25,000/mm3 
should have their peginterferon alfa-2a dose held.  Peginterferon alfa-2a  may be 
resumed at the previous reduced dose when the neutrophil count has been above 500/mm
3 or platelet count above 50,000/mm3 on [ADDRESS_106533] 1 week apart.  
 
7.2.c. Guidelines for subsequent peginterferon alfa-2a dose adjustments 
Once a participant’s dose has been decreased for laboratory abnormalities or adverse 
events, the study physician may attempt to increase the dose back to or toward the 
previous stable level only if the following conditions are satisfied:  
1. The event or circumstance responsible for the dosage adjustment has resolved or improved;  
2. The participant has been at the lower dose for ≤ 4 consecutive doses; 
3. The participant had ≤ 6 total doses administered at the lower level during the entirety of the treatment period.  
 
If four or more consecutive doses of peginterferon alfa-2a are held
 or otherwise not 
administered (i.e., the participant has not received test medication for more than 28 days), the participant will be considered intolerant of the test medication or non-
compliant, whichever is more appropriate to the clinical situation.  In such cases, the 
study physician will discontinue peginterferon alfa-2a but tenofovir DF treatment will continue.  
 Every attempt will be made to keep those participants randomized to treatment with 
peginterferon alfa-2a on therapy by [CONTACT_29874].  The use of hematological growth 
factors during the study will not be allowed. 
 
7.2.d. Screening and management for depression 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  22 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 The CES -D will be used, along with the study physician’s judgment, to screen 
participants for depression at the screening visit (8 weeks prior to randomization) and to 
monitor for onset or worsening of symptoms during the treatment. 
 Screening Visit (8 weeks prior to randomization): If the participant has a CES -D score 
>15 at the screening visit (8 weeks prior to randomization), clearance from a mental health provider may be considered at the discretion of the study physician.  In addition to clarifying possible psychiatric disorders, the mental health provider may advise on the 
need for adjuvant medical or counseling therapy and suitability for enrollment. 
 During treatment: Potential mood disturbance/medication intolerance will be assessed at each visit by [CONTACT_3462].  The CES-D will be administered every 12 weeks for 48 weeks .  If the participant has a score >15, the study physician will determine whether 
referral to a mental health provider is indicated. If the participant has a score of at least 27, the study physician will refer to a mental health provider for evaluation and management. Any participant who develops 
recurrent suicidal ideation, a suicide plan 
and/ or makes a suicide attempt should have peginterferon alfa-2a immediately 
discontinued and be referred to a mental health provider for further management. 
 Suggested guidelines for peginterferon alfa-2a dose reduction: 
• Unpleasant and/or disabling side effects might prompt dose reduction, but this is not required. 
• A CES- D score of 16-26 might prompt further consideration of dose reduction, 
but is not a requirement for dose reduction.  
• A score of at least [ADDRESS_106534] been associated with this complication, such as didanosine, stavudine and zidovudine.  It is not clear whether 
tenofovir DF when used by [CONTACT_96500]-2a, is 
associated with mitochondrial toxicity either to the liver (lactic acidosis, acute fatty liver and hepatic failure), muscle (myositis), nerves (neuropathy) or pancreas (acute pancreatitis).   In addition, all agents with activity against HBV replication carry a warning label about 
the risk of exacerbation of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment. This issue is 
addressed by [CONTACT_96501] -up of participants after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96460] (see section 6.6, 6.14.1, and Appendix 4). 
 7.3.b. Tenofovir DF and renal function 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  23 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 Tenofovir  DF is principally eliminated by [CONTACT_10521]. Renal impairment, including cases 
of acute renal failure and a Fanconi -like syndrome (proximal renal tubular dysfunction 
with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported.  
 
Adverse Event Monitoring and Management Related to Elevated Serum Creatinine (Cr)  
Nephrotoxicity will be based upon serum creatinine results:  
• If Cr ≥0.5 mg/dL above baseline, repeat testing within 72 hrs will be performed and drug continued unless the study physician considers drug discontinuation necessary.  
• If Cr increases to ≥1.2 mg/dL and by ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline, additional testing 
at the next scheduled visit should be considered (see Manual of Operations ). 
If Cr ≥1.2 mg/dL and >0.5 mg/dl above baseline on two consecutive occasions, the study drugs will be discontinued and not restarted unless another, reversible cause of creatinine elevations is identified. If the study physician identifies an alternative cause for the increase in Cr, study drugs may be resumed at discretion of study physician if calculated Cr clearance is >30 ml/min with tenofovir DF dose adjustment. 
• Any study participant discontinued from the study will be recommended to commence anti -HBV therapy with an alternative HBV drug immediately (this drug 
will not be provided by [CONTACT_1758]). 
 Tenofovir DF Dosing is Based Upon Creatinine Clearance (
CrCL ) 
Creatinine clearance will be calculated in all participants prior to initiating therapy and at each study visit to determine tenofovir DF dose.  
• Participants whose calculated creatinine clearance decreases to <50 ml/min should have this value confirmed within 72 hrs. If confirmed to be 30-50 ml/min, 
the dosing frequency for tenofovir DF should be adjusted from every 24 hours to 
every 48 hours until the calculated creatinine clearance returns to >50 ml/min.  
• Participants whose calculated creatinine clearance decreases to <30 ml/min, will be permanently discontinued from treatment and enter the follow -up phase.  
 
Adverse Event Monitoring and Management of Hypophosphatemia:  
If serum phosphate falls below 2.5 mg/dL and by [CONTACT_2669] 0.5 mg/dL from baseline, 
consider phosphate supplementation. Additional testing at the next scheduled visit 
should be considered (see Manual of Operations). 
• If the serum phosphate is <1.4 mg/dL, repeat testing within one week will  be 
performed and supplementation provided as per manual of operations.  If serum phosphate is <1.4 mg/dL on repeat testing, urine and serum phosphate and creatinine will be determined to assess maximal phosphate tubular reabsorption and blood test should be performed to check potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, BUN and Cr .   
• Tenofovir DF dosing may be interrupted and a ggressive supplementation with 
intravenous (if symptomatic) or oral (if no symptoms) phosphorus should be 
used. Repeat phosphate testing weekly until corrected to lower limit of normal 
range. If this intervention does not correct phosphate level in 2 weeks, Tenofovir 
DF should be permanently discontinued. 
• If serum phosphate is <1.0 mg/dL, participant will be asked to return immediately for further evaluation and treatment and Tenofovir DF dosing will be discontinued. 
 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  24 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 Any study participant discontinued from the study will be recommended to commence 
anti-HBV therapy with an alternative HBV drug immediately (this drug will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1758]).  
 
7.3.c. Tenofovir DF and bone mineral density  
Decreases in bone mineral density have been observed in participants taking tenofovir DF for prolonged periods in the context of treatment for HIV infection.  These changes have been associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone 
metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover.  Although the pathogenesis of these 
changes are not certain, they may be related to proximal renal tubulopathy, phosphate loss and a form of secondary hyperparathyroidism.    Serum calcium, phosphate and creatinine levels will be monitored.   Serum vitamin D 
levels will be measured at baseline and supplements prescribed for the participants as clinically indicated.  Participants will have bone densitometry done prior to initiating therapy if clinically indicated (as standard of care).  If either osteopenia or osteoporosis is present on the bone densitometry done prior to initiation of treatment, the participant can be enrolled as long as he/she is concurrently treated for osteopenia or osteoporosis. 
Repeat bone densitometry may be performed if clinically indicated (as standard of care). 
 
7.3.d. Discontinuation of tenofovir DF for selected biochemical abnormalities 
Tenofovir DF will be permanently discontinued and the participant considered a 
treatment failure for Grade 3 hypophosphatemia (1.0-1.4 mg/dL) that does not correct within 2 weeks with phosphate supplements or Grade 4 hypophosphatemia (<1.0 mg/dL)  
or other wise unexplained serum creatinine elevations by ≥1.2 mg/dL and > 0.5 mg/dl 
above baseline on two consecutive occasions or calculated creatinine clearance <30 
ml/min that develop on therapy.  For lesser degrees of renal insufficiency not requiring discontinu ation, the dose of tenofovir DF will be adjusted according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendation.  
 7.4. Adverse events of emtricitabine and emtricitabine/tenofovir  
Emtricitabine alone or in combination with tenofovir coformulated as Truvada (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) has not been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Emtricitabine belongs to a class of anti -HIV drugs (nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors). The most common side effects seen in ≥10% patients 
treated with emtricitabine in combination with other anti -HIV drugs are: headache, 
diarrhea, nausea, and elevation in creatine kinase. These side effects were generally 
mild to moderate in severity.   Lactic acidosis (increase in lactic acid) is a very serious reaction, which is characterized 
by [CONTACT_96502], vomiting, abdominal pain, general discomfort and tiredness that 
do not get better and also by [CONTACT_96503] (enlargement of the liver) with 
steatosis (fatty deposits). Lactic acidosis, including fatal cases , has been reported with 
the use of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.  
 For people who are infected with HIV as well as hepatitis B, other possible risks of 
treatment with Truvada include making their hepatitis B worse. The potential risk relates 
to HBV flares induced by [CONTACT_96504]. There is no evidence of drug-drug interactions when emtricitabine and tenofovir are used in combination.   
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  [ADDRESS_106535] method in all participants prior to 
initiating therapy and at each study visit to determine Truvada dose.  
• Participants whose calculated creatinine clearance decreases to <50 ml/min 
should have this value confirmed within 72 hrs. If confirmed to be 30-50 ml/min, 
the dosing frequency for Truvada should be adjusted from every 24 hours to every 48 hours until the calculated creatinine clearance returns to >50 ml/min. 
• Participants whose calculated creatinine clearance decreases to <30 ml/min, will 
discontinue Truvada. Subsequent management will be at the discretion of the investigator, alternative antiviral therapy should be considered and the participant monitored until creatinine clearance returns to baseline or stabilizes.  
 7.5. Pregnancy  
Female participants will be asked to practice effective birth control while they are taking antiviral agents in this study.  However, given the very long duration of therapy and the fact that many of the participants are expected to be females of child bearing potential, the following precautions will be taken:  
All female participants of child bearing potential will undergo a urine or serum pregnancy 
test prior to starting therapy and every visit during the peginterferon treatment phase.  If 
a participant is found to be pregnant, therapy will be adjusted as follows:  
• Peginterferon alfa-2a  will be permanently discontinued 
• Tenofovir DF can be continued throughout the pregnancy at the discretion of the study physician. 
• Emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada) can be continued throughout the pregnancy at the discretion of the study physician. 
 The study will collect data on the outcomes of any pregnancies that occur in females who conceived while taking study medication.  
 
7.6. Adverse events – definition and management 
7.6.1. Definitions An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change from the participant’s baseline (pre-
treatment) condition, including intercurrent illness which occurs during the course of the trial, after the consent form has been signed, whether the event is considered related to 
treatment or not. 
 The Common Terminology Criteria from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health will be used for grading severity of AEs.  For AEs not 
outlined in the Common Terminology Criteria, study specific definitions will be identified 
in the Manual of Operation (MOP).   
Serious Adverse Event: 
A serious adverse event is an untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the following:  
1. Death 
2. Is life threatening (risk of death at the time of the event) 
3. Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  26 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 Important medical events that do not result in one of the events  listed above may be 
considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  A serious adverse event which is unexpected and is related will require expedited reporting to the DCC and the NIDDK and appropriate oversight committees or entities.  
 
Disease related outcomes, such as t he following events , will not be considered to be 
serious adverse events: 
1. Development of HCC  
2. Hepatic decompensation 
 Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer (excluding HCC), and potential drug induced liver 
injury (DILI) are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs.  
 
Unexpected: 
An adverse event that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (or package insert) or is not listed at the severity that has been observed.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event (i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event). 
 
SAE Reporting: 
This trial will be conducted under U.S. IND.  Therefore, the safety data required to meet IND regulatory requirements will be collected through adverse event reporting by [CONTACT_96505].  
 A serious adverse event which is unexpected and is drug related (even remotely) will require expedited reporting to the drug manufacturer, the DCC and to local IRB/REBs (per local IRB/REB policy).  
 Only serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions with evidence of a causal relationship to the study and/or study drug will be  reported to the FDA as an IND safety 
report according to [ADDRESS_106536] be reported to 
FDA no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  All other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions must be reported to FDA no 
later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  
A summary of adverse events will be reported to the FDA as part of the IND annual 
report.  
7.6.2. Data collection procedures for adverse events 
Participants will be interviewed regarding medical conditions, medication changes, and 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  [ADDRESS_106537] occurred at each study visit. An Adverse Event form will be 
completed if any adverse event is reported. If the Study Coordinator or Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_96461], 
an Adverse Event form will be completed. All adverse events and Serious Adverse Events from time of study entry (consent) up to the end of follow -up (week 240 or end of 
the study ) will be reported to the DCC. 
 A Serious Adverse Event form will be completed for all adverse events rated as serious. 
 
Participants will be followed for all ongoing unresolved adverse events until they are either resolved, or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237], the participant is medically stable.  
 
The investigator will assess the relationship of each adverse event to the use of study 
drug, based on available information, using guidelines outlined in the MOP.  
 
7.6.3. Reporting procedures 
All serious adverse events that are unexpected and related to study drug(s) will be reported to the DCC within [ADDRESS_106538] also be reported in accordance with local law and regulations.  
 The HBRN will comply with Genentech/[COMPANY_002] SAE reporting requirements (see Manual of Operations). 
 
8. Statistical considerations 
8.1. Statistical analysis 
Summary statistics will be generated to describe the study sample at baseline.  
Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency (e.g. means, medians) and estimates of spread (e.g., standard deviations, quartiles) will be used for continuous variables such as age and baseline HBV DNA and HBsAg levels.  Frequency distributions will be used for categorical variables such as HBV genotype and HBeAg 
status.  Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be calculated for all point estimates 
of continuous data.  Graphical displays (e.g. histograms, box plots) will also be used to 
describe the data. The baseline demographic information and viral characteristics will be compared between the two treatment arms using the chi -square test for association or 
exact tests for differences in proportions for categorical variables or using a test of trend 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  28 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 in ordinal data. Continuous variables may be transformed, where appropriate, to meet 
the assumptions of parametric tests.  The Student’s t-test or a non-parametric 
alternative, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test, will be used to determine differences in the 
distribution of continuous data between the two treatment arms.  
 Primary analyses will be performed using all enrolled participants (intention-to-treat analysis). Participants will be considered enrolled in the study upon being randomized to one of the two treatment arms.   
For all analyses, a p-value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_106539]-limit 
(Kaplan-Meier) estimate. HBsAg loss between two treatment groups will be compared using a Wald-type two-s ided two-sample proportion test (chi -square test).   
 
8.1.2. Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Analysis of secondary endpoint listed in 2.2.1a: To compare the cumulative proportion 
HBsAg loss over time during and after treatment  
Cumulative proportion of HBsAg loss over time will be calculated using the product limit 
(Kaplan-Meier) method. HBsAg loss between two treatment groups will be compared using a two- sided two-sample stratified log-rank test.  We will also describe the 
treatment effects in terms of hazard rates of HBsAg-loss and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals. To take into account the stratification at randomization, we will use 
stratified Cox proportional hazard models. Comparison of hazard rates of HBsAg loss across two treatment groups adjusting for other baseline demographic, virological and clinical characteristics such as age, race, genotype, HBeAg status, initial HBV DNA level, and baseline histology will be performed using Cox proportional hazard regression. 
The results will be presented as incidence rate ratios of HBsAg loss and 95% confidence intervals.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses of other secondary endpoints  
Secondary endpoints for this clinical trial are listed in sections 2.2.1 – 2.2.9. These 
endpoints could be grouped into several different classes. The first group of endpoints we will deal with are binary endpoints characterized by [CONTACT_96506] 
a fixed time point. These events include HBeAg loss, HBeAg seroconversion, HBsAg seroconversion, normalization of ALT, ALT ≤1.[ADDRESS_106540], HBV DNA <1000 IU/mL, HBV 
DNA <20 IU/mL, absence of detectable antiviral drug-resistance HBV mutations, treatment discontinuation, and treatment failure. Analysis will be conducted separately 
for these events at the designated time points listed in sections 2.2.1-2.2.9 
 Proportion of such an event (e.g. proportion of HBeAg loss) between two treatment groups will be summarized using 95% confidence intervals and will be presented graphically by [CONTACT_96507]. The rate of occurrence of an event between two 
treatment groups will be compared using a two-sided two-sample proportion test (chi -
square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate).  We will also describe the treatment effects using relative risk of the event and corresponding 95% confidence interval. In order to take into account the stratification at randomization, we will use Mantel -
Haenszel chi -square test. Comparison of rates of an event across two treatment groups 
adjusting for other baseline demographic, virological and clinical characteris tics such as 
Adult Immune Active  Trial                     Page  29 of 42  
Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 age, race, genotype, HBeAg status, initial HBV DNA level, and baseline histology will be 
performed using multivariable log-linear (Poisson) regression, with HBsAg loss (Yes/N o) 
as the outcome. The results will be presented as relative risks of the event and their 95% 
confidence intervals.  
 Time to such events may also be of interest (e.g. cumulative HBeAg loss, time to treatment failure). For time-to event analysis, Kaplan-Mei er curves will be used to plot 
the cumulative proportion of events over time by [CONTACT_6660]. The cumulative 
proportions will then be compared using two-sided stratified log-rank test. The treatment 
effect will be described using hazard rate of the event and corresponding 95% confidence interval. In order to take into account the stratification at randomization, we will use stratified Cox proportional hazard models. Comparison of hazard rates of an event across two treatment groups adjusting for other baseline demographic, virological 
and clinical characteristics such as age, race, genotype, HBeAg status, initial HBV DNA 
level, and baseline histology  will be performed using Cox proportional hazard regression. 
The results will be presented using hazard rates and 95% confidence intervals.  The second group of endpoints is continuous variables such as changes in ALT, HBV 
DNA levels from baseline at designated treatment or follow -up time points. Descriptive 
statistics, including measures of central tendency (e.g. means, medians) and estimates 
of spread (e.g., standard deviations, quartiles) will be used to characterize such changes. Student’s t-test or a non-parametric alternative, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test, 
will be used to determine differences in the distribution of these changes between the two treatment arms. Multiple regression analyses will be conducted to assess the 
association between baseline characteristics and these changes. Spearman or Pearson 
correlation coefficients will be used to measure the strength and direction of the association between such changes and other participant characteristics. Scatter plots will be used to display the association between continuous variables.  
The third group of variables consists of variables that are measured over time 
(longitudinal data) such as quantitative HBV DNA levels.  For graphical representation over time, we will use spaghetti plots of original data (e.g. HBV DNA levels) and summarize the pattern of data across subgroups (e.g. genotype, treatment groups ) over 
time by [CONTACT_96508] (for continuous outcome) or proportions (for binary outcomes). To determine the significance of change in continuous outcome over time across treatment 
group adjusting for other baseline and longitudinal participant characteristics, we will use 
mixed models if the data are normally distributed or generalized estimating equations (GEE) if deviation from normality is evidenced. These approaches simultaneously model the regression of the response variable on the independent variables  and account for the 
correlated nature of the responses.  Analyses using conventional regression methods 
could provide erroneous variance estimates and loss of statistical efficiency because of 
the conventional assumption that each response is statistically independent.  As a result, invalid inferences could be made if the conventional approach were applied to these longitudinal data.  A similar approach of analysis will be adopted (generalized linear mixed model or GEE) for longitudinal binary or count outcomes over time.  
The results will be summarized using rate of change/odds ratio/relative risk over time 
and the corresponding confidence intervals. Interaction between treatment and participant characteristics will be investigated to assess the differenti al effect of 
treatments across subgroups of participants (e.g. genotypes).

Version 7.0 October 23, 2018  
 Secondary endpoints that are defined within a specific subgroup will be analyzed only for 
participants in that subgroup.  For example, sustained off treatment (36 and 48 weeks 
after end of treatment) responses will be assessed only among those whose treatment 
was discontinued at week 192.  
  8.2. Missing data 
Primary analyses will be performed using all enrolled participants (intention-to-treat analysis). For the primary analysis, the proportion of patients with HBsAg loss at the end 
of follow -up (week 240) will be estimated using the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method 
which includes drop outs for as long as they are followed. Since our sample size estimation accounts for participants lost to follow up for various reasons, and due to randomization, the rate of missing is expected to be similar in the two treatment groups, 
we will also conduct the analysis of primary endpoint on the available cases. For this 
analysis, we will describe the treatment effects in terms of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. In order to take into account the stratification at the randomization, we will use Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test.  Comparison of rates of HBsAg loss across 
two treatment groups adjusting for other baseline demographic, virological and clinical 
characteristics such as age, race, genotype, HBeAg status, initial HBV DNA level, and 
baseline histology will be performed using multivariable log-linear (Poisson) regression, with HBsAg loss (Yes/No) as the outcome.  The results will be presented as relative risks of HBsAg loss and their 95% confidence intervals.  In general, the procedure of missing outcome data will be handled as follows in 
statistical analyses. First, we will explore the pattern of missing data by [CONTACT_96509]. For data 
missing completely at random (does not depend on observed outcome; MCAR) standard analytical techniques described earlier would produce unbiased results when the analysis is performed on the complete data. For the time-to-event data analyses, the 
analytical methods such as Kaplan- Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional 
hazard model automatically accounts for MCAR drop-outs. However, in other cases , we 
will assume that the dropout depends on observed outcome and/or covariates (missing 
at random, MAR). For such scenarios, likelihood-based methods such as mixed models, 
generalized linear mixed models and logistic regression will provide unbiased inference. 
For GEE, we will draw inference using inverse-probability-weighting approach, with 
models fitted using the reciprocal of the estimated probability of missing as weights. The 
probability of missing will be estimated using logistic regression.    
 It is unlikely that the probability of missing will depend on unobserved outcome and/or covariates (missing not at random, MNAR). However  selection models such as MNAR 
Dale model and Diggle-Kenward model (23)  can be used in such cases . These models 
often require strong assumptions on the dropout mechanism, which are primarily unverifiable based on the observed data. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the sensitivity of our conclusion to possible violation of such assumptions by [CONTACT_96510], MAR and MNAR assumptions and compare the model fits using log-likelihoods.  
 8.3. Safety analysis  
8.3.1. Adverse events  
Summaries of adverse events (number adverse events, number and percentage of 
participants with adverse events, rates per person-years) will be provided by [CONTACT_96511]  [ADDRESS_106541] dose of study medication will be summarized separately. Summaries of the following are planned:  
• all adverse events recorded between screening and first dose of study medication,  
• all treatment emergent adverse events,  
• all emergent and related adverse events,  
• all treatment emergent renal adverse events, 
• all treatment emergent and related renal adverse events  
• combined Grade 2, 3 and 4 treatment emergent adverse events,  
• combined Grade 2, 3 and 4 related treatment and emergent adverse events,  
• combined Grade 3 and 4 treatment emergent adverse events,  
• combined Grade 3 and 4 related treatment and emergent adverse events,  
• all adverse events that caused permanent discontinuation of study drug,  
• all adverse events that caused temporary interruption of study drug,  
• all serious adverse events, and  
• all serious and related adverse events.  
 In addition quarterly safety analysis will be reported to DSMB.  8.3.2. Laboratory abnormalities 
Laboratory results will be presented as both actual value as well as a function of normal 
range. Selected laboratory data (using conventional units) will be summarized by [CONTACT_96512]. If baseline data are missing, then any graded abnormality is considered treatment emergent.   8.3. Sample size and power  
The sample size for this study was determined based on the primary endpoint of HB sAg-
loss at [ADDRESS_106542]-treatment 5% of the participants in the t enofovir DF alone group will 
achieve HBsAg loss compared to 15% participants in the t enofovir DF and peginterferon 
combination therapy group. The clinical trial would require 141 participants per arm (282 
participants in total) to detect this expected difference with 80% power at 5% level of significance using a two- sided test of equality between two proportions (chi -square test). 
However, for this long-term treatment trial, it is expected that approximately 25% of the participants will be lost to follow-up and hence the study will recruit a total of 376 participants (randomized 1:1 to two treatment arms, 188 per arm) to account for the missing participants.  
 
9. Data and safety monitoring board Data and safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_96513] -appointed 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  This board serves in a consultative capacity 
to inform the NIDDK decisions regarding conduct of the study.  The description of DSMB activities is included in the DSMB Charter.

 9.1 Data and safety monitoring plan 
This phase III randomized trial aims to compare the long-term efficacy of initial treatment with combination therapy with peginterferon plus tenofovir DF versus tenofovir DF 
monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The individual drugs (peginterferon and tenofovir DF) are FDA-approved and have been well -studied.  The risks to 
participants are outlined in sections 5.2.3 and 5.3.3 in the accompanied protocol.  Section 7 of the protocol defines the toxicities associated with these drugs and outlines dose adjustment and discontinuation guidelines due to toxicity.  
 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF coformulated as a single tablet Truvada is approved for HIV but not for HBV treatment. Emtricitabine/tenofovir DF will be offered to patients who have primary nonresponse, partial virologic response or confirmed virologic breakthrough. Adverse events and dose adjustment guidelines are described in section 
7.4.  
 The data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) for this study focuses on close monitoring by [CONTACT_54852] (PI) and prompt reporting of excessive adverse events and all serious adverse events to the DCC and the appropriate oversight committees or 
entities such as the NIDDK, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and to the 
participating centers’ IRB/REBs.  
 The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will monitor clinical center performance (e.g., recruitment, retention, data completeness, timeliness of data collection and submission) and protocol compliance. These reports, with summaries of adverse event data, will be 
provided to the DSMB for their quarterly reports and biannual calls or meetings, and to 
the Steering Committee at its annual meeting. DSMB reports will include both open and closed session reports, with only the latter including information by [CONTACT_2939].  The DCC will work with the Safety Officer and the Steering Committee to maintain a 
cumulative summary of adverse events (overall and stratified by [CONTACT_96514]/non-serious 
status) that will be forwarded to the DSMB every three months. Sa fety reports will also 
be sent to the Principal Investigators and the NIDDK Project Officers. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for distributing these reports and assuring that all parties obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_96462].  
 
The frequency of data review for this study differs according to the type of data and can 
be summarized in the following table:  
Data type  Frequency of review

The definition of adverse and serious adverse events is provided in section 7.6.1 of this 
protocol along with the reporting procedures in the MOP.   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96463] (up to Week 192)  
No interim analysis for efficacy is planned for this clinical trial, since the primary endpoint 
is expected to occur very rarely during the treatment period.  As mentioned above, 
adverse event reporting will be quarterly throughout the study. Additional analyses will be performed at the recommendation of the DSMB if there are any concerns raised by [CONTACT_96515].  The following study -wide stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96464]. The 
study will be stopped if at least one of the following occurs:  
1. If the incidence of renal toxicity (defined as a persistent increase in serum 
creatinine >1.0 mg/dL above baseline on two successive visits 4 weeks apart or persistent grade 3 or grade 4 hypophosphatemia (requiring TDF discontinuation) exceeds 10% in either of the two study arms.  
2. If the incidence of peripheral neuropathy (documented by [CONTACT_96516]) exceeds 10%.  
3. If the incidence of grade IV toxicity exceeds 10% in either of the two study arms.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96465] (Weeks 192 to 240)  
The following has been agreed upon by [CONTACT_96517]  
1. If more than 1 participant develops clinical decompensation, no further 
participants will undergo treatment withdrawal until the formal review by [CONTACT_96518]  
2. Resumption of treatment withdrawal may occur if the DSMB and investigators determine the safety measures are adequate AND that the benefits of continued study of treatment withdrawal outweighs the risks  
 9.2 Participant Confidentiality  
The central database of the study is on a server at the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_96466] (EDC) at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_96467].  Backups are performed daily to guard against data loss due to an equipment or  power failure.  Scheduled backups and 
archives at the EDC protect central and local information from hard disk failures.  Tape backup volumes and CD -ROM copi[INVESTIGATOR_96468] a secured off-
site storage area to prevent data loss due to catastrophic events.  Routine virus detection is also enforced for all EDC computers involved in the study.  All critical information regarding database transactions is logged and stored in journal files.  In the 
event of accidental corruption of the project database, a previous database state may be 
restored from backup volumes or journal files.  All servers used for this project are 
connected to uninterrupted power supplies to protect equipment against electrical surges and outages.  A secured, rais ed-floor computer room in an area with a burglar alarm 
houses all project server equipment.   
Subject confidentiality is preserved by [CONTACT_96519].  Data sent to the DCC are identified by [CONTACT_96520]. No 
reports of this study will use names or other identifying information such as social security numbers or addresses.  Data, with alphanumeric ID only, will be stored at the DCC indefinitely.  In addition, following the completion of the study, data and information

Dose delayed 1 or 2 days: administer on usual dosing day of the week (e.g., if Monday is 
the usual dosing day and the dose is delayed until Wednesday, the next dose may be 
administered as usual on Monday).  
Dose delayed 3-5 days:  administer subsequent doses every 5th or 6th day until the 
participant is back to his or her original schedule (e.g., if Monday is the usual dosing day and the dose is delayed until Saturday, the next dose should be administered on 
Thursday, the following dose on Tuesday, then the dose after that as usual on Monday). 
Dose delayed 6 days:  hold the dose for that week then continue on the usual schedule 
the following week (e.g., if Monday is the usual dosing day but the participant is not 
ready to be dosed until the following Sunday, the dose is considered to have been held 
and the next injection should be for the following weeks; dose on Monday). 
Dose delayed 7 or more days: the investigator may reintroduce study drug at any time 
and, if necessary, dose the participant every 5th or 6th day until the participant resumes 
weekly dosing on their usual scheduled day.

 Appendix  2:  Peginterferon alfa-2a dose adjustment guidelines 
Specific dose adjustment guidelines for peginterferon alfa-2a are provided in the tables 
below for neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. For other adverse effects considered to 
be possibly related to peginterferon, including laboratory abnormalities, adverse events, and vital signs changes, study physicians should utilize the table below labeled “General Dose Reduction Guidelines.” When practicable, abnormal laboratory results should be confirmed as soon as  possible following notification of the study physician. If 
appropriate, downward adjustments in one level reductions should be considered. The 
lowest dose of peginterferon alfa 2a that should be administered is 45 µg weekly. It 
should be kept in mind that whereas these guidelines should be generally followed to 
promote consistency across centers, other responses by a study physicians may be more appropriate in some circumstances.

** Renal panel should be obtained at each study visit for participants who are on treatment. All participants should have creatinine tested at week 240 
116mL of serum and 8mL of plasma at week 12, 24 and 48, 8mL of serum and 8mL of plasma at other time points 
2Anti-HBe/Anti-HBs to be done at next visit if HBeAg/HBsAg becomes negative. 
3In participants who are HBeAg positive in qualitative assay 
4If clinically indicated, per AASLD guidelines, done as standard of care 
5A hepatic panel and telephone follow-up (minimal assessment) may replace an outpatient visit if ALT at the preceding visit is <300 U/L for males or <200 U/L females and 
bilirubin is normal (total bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL or direct bilirubin <0.5 mg/dL) 
6Fibroscan (if available) to be performed at week 240 if obtained at week 180 or 192 visits.

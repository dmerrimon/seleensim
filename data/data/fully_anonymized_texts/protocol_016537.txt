3.0 OBJECTIVE(S) & HYPOTHESIS(ES)  
3.1 Primary Objective(s) & Hypothesis(es) 
(1) Efficacy Objective:  To assess the change in tumor immune infiltrates after 
administration of  pembrolizumab.  
Hypothesis :  Tumor immune infiltrates will increase after administration of  
pembrolizumab. 
Safety Objective:  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab 
when given to patients with newly diagnosed gynecologic cancers of müllerian  origin 
prior t o standard therapy  and as maintenance therapy after completion of 
chemotherapy.  
Hypothesis:   Pembrolizumab will be  well tolerated when given prior to standard 
chemotherapy +/ - surgery  and as maintenance after completion of chemotherapy  in 
patients with gynecologic cancers of müllerian  origin .  
3.2 Exploratory Objective  
(1) Objective:   To characterize changes in the tumoral and circulating blood 
immunoprofile after administration of  pembrolizumab.  Levels of immune and 
inflammatory mediators, profile of tumor immune infiltrates, and the expression of 
PD-L1 in pre -administration  samples will be compared to post -administration 
surgical resection ( including ascites) or biopsy samples.  
(2) Objective:  For patients who enroll on the second course phase: To evaluate 
changes in the tumoral and circulating blood immunoprofile at time of recurrence.  Levels of immune and inflammatory mediators, profile of tumor immune infiltrates, and the expression of PD -L1 in samples at time of recurrence will be compared t o 
pre-administration and surgical or biopsy samples.

between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malign ancies .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_332974] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  P D-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of 
murine PD -1 has been resolved .  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding 
and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The 
cytoplasmic tail of P D-1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif 
(ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_332975] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_272446] t of signaling 
proteins .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets 
of macr ophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_332976] notably on vascular endothelium, 
whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably e xpressed on antigen- presenting cells found in 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune 
T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell 
function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety 
of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma (MEL) .  
This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4 /kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2.  Keytruda

diagnoses and >22,000 deaths per year in the [LOCATION_002] alone1. Treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_272448] a thorough cytor eductive and staging surgery in combination with platinum/taxane

However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_272450], the majority of women with advanced stage at diagnosis will experience relapse.  Unfortunately, relapsed disease is incurable and women ultimately die of their disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_272451]. 
There has been significant interest in incorporating immune checkpoint therapi[INVESTIGATOR_272452], especially given the durable remissions associated with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_272453]
2,3.  At this time, little is known about whether or how to combine 
chemotherapy, anti -angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and immunologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_272454]. 
Understanding the tumor microenvironment, particularly immune and angiogenic fact ors that 
contribute to tumor survival, as well as the changes that occur in response to immuno therapy 
is critical to identify favorable biomarker profiles which  could lead to improved prognostic 
outcomes and inform the development and sequencing of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_272455]. 
In this study, we propose to use immunohistochemical and molecular approaches to expand 
our current understanding of the effects of tumor immune checkpoint inhibition on cancers of 
müllerian  origin.  The ultimate goal of the study is to identify potential biomarkers, immune 
gene expression signatures, and co -stimulatory pathways that may be used to develop future 
clinical trials.  Followin g the pathologic diagnosis of a cancer of müllerian  origin, baseline 
blood and tumor samples would be obtained.  Women would receive  a single dose of 
Pembrolizumab then treated conventionally with surgical therapy including total abdominal hysterectomy, bi lateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oopho rectomy, and lymph node sampling as indicated.  This 
design affords the opportunity to obtain a significant post -administration  tumor sample 
(including ascites) for analysis. In cases where surgery is not performed, a post -treatment 
biopsy specimen should be obtained. While the short -term administration of Pembrolizumab 
may have a therapeutic benefit, all women will go on to receive standard therapy which may 
include chemotherapy +/ - surgery , if indicated.

Amendment 5: E ncompasse d two major changes to the protocol: the addition of maintenance 
therapy and the allowance of a Second Course Phase of therapy with pembrolizumab for 
subjects who experience radiographic disease progression after completion of initial treatment. The rationale fo r the inclusion of maintenance therapy after completion of chemotherapy in 
this study is predicated on scientific,  practical , and ethical considerations. Several current 
studies are evaluating the combination of chemotherapy with pembrolizumab followed by [CONTACT_272472]. However, while the combination is feasible, it is unclear that giving concurrent chemotherapy and pembrolizumab is necessary; m aintenance therapy 
following initial chemotherapy may be sufficient. Thus , in this amendment in additi on to the 
primary objectives of evaluating the safety and immune profile after a pre- surgical dose of 
pembrolizumab, we propose to evaluate whether there are any safety concerns with 
administering pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy after receiving an initial dose prior to surgery and after completion of chemotherapy. As part of this, we will evaluate the circulating immune profile after completion of chemotherapy and during pembrolizumab maintenance therapy  to determine the immune effect of therapy .  
This change should also obviate a practical/ethical concern we have encountered with this 
study thus far. As there are currently other studies combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy for this patient population, physicians and patients have been reluctant to consider this protocol as the patient would only receive one dose of pembrolizumab. This study was not originally designed with a therapeutic intent, however exposure to the single dose of pembrolizumab in this study would make patients ineligible for any other anti -PD-1 study. I t 
stands to reason that one dose is unlikely to provide substantial therapeutic benefit , thus t he 
allowance of maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab in this amendment would provide reasonable exposure to pembrolizumab to maintain a nti-tumor response a nd is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_272456] -approved approach to maintenance adjuvant therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_272457].  
The second major change of  amendment 5 is the allowance of a Second Course Phase of 
therapy with pembrolizumab for subjects who experience radiographic disease progression after completion of initial treatment. This approach is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_272458] a Second Course Phase if radiographic progression is observed after disconti nuation for complete response. Biopsy samples will be obtained from patients who opt 
for the Second Course Phase to evaluate the immunoprofile in recurrent disease.  
Amendment 6: Allows for patients to participate if they have disease that is amenable to po st-
treatment biopsy  
Amendment 8: Allows for collection of additional tumor specimen and blood collection at the

4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection /Regimen/Modification   
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475): 200mg once at least  [ADDRESS_332978] -study drug administration.  
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) has been conducted to evaluate the safety an d 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475 in locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma, 
melanoma, or non- small cell lung carcinoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  The dose escalation portion 
of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 
2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK -
3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in P001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent d ata from other clinical studies within the 
MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule 
may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W on P001 showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).   
 Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_332979] 
a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen ar e 
anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 
in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
(i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was 
no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar 
between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there ar e no anticipated changes 
in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at e ither

2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships 
of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switc h to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3  weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well t olerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and  reduce wastage.  
For the maintenance portion of the study, subjects will receive 200mg IV every 3 weeks. This is the dose used in ongoing studies evaluating maintenance therapy . 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints  
In this biomarker study  the main focus is to identify potential biomarkers, immune gene 
expression signatures, and co- stimulatory pathways that may be used to develop future 
clinical trials. W e have established the following efficacy and safety endpoints.  
Because of the small s ample size in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], statistical analyses will be 
descriptive.  
(1) Efficacy Endpoint: Fold change in tumor immune infiltrates after administration of  
pembrolizumab. 
(2) Safety  Endpoint : Frequency and severity of adverse events associated with 
pembrolizumab when given to patients with newly diagnosed gynecologic cancers of 
müllerian  origin prior to standard surgical therapy , and as maintenance therapy after 
completion of chemotherapy, as assessed by [CONTACT_3989].  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors  have not been given to patients with gynecologic cancer 
prior to standard surgical therapy. While immune checkpoint inhibitors  have been 
safely given in patients with recurrent gynecologic cancers and in a neoadjuvant setting in other cancers , establishing the safety profile  of pembrolizumab for patients newly 
diagnosed with gynecologic malignancies is  essential .

[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research  
(1) Changes in the tumoral and circulating blood immunoprofile after administration of  
pembrolizumab.  Levels of immune and inflammatory mediators, p rofile of tumor 
immune infiltrates, and the expression of PD -L1 in pre -administration samples will be 
compared to post -administration surgical resection (and ascites) and biopsy samples.   
Further biomarker analysis will be performed in a subset of patients  who undergo 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_38183] -of-care interval debulking. In this 
subset, tumor and blood specimens will be collected from the day of surgery +/ - [ADDRESS_332980] not been assessed. It is our 
hypothesis that characteristics of the immunomodulatory cells in the blood or tumor 
may be associated with clinical response of gynecologic malignancies to pembrolizum ab. The identification of the markers expressed in gynecologic 
malignancies, and the change in immunophenotype in response to pembrolizumab, will inform the development of future clinical trials.  
The specific phenotypic markers comprising the Immune Profil ing Panels ( Table 1) 
were selected based upon key cellular subsets proven important in the assessment of immune checkpoint blockade therapeutic strategies for various human cancers, including melanoma, NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma. These panels are currently in use to evalu ate effects of immune checkpoint blockade in several clinical trials. Within 
the Tumor Reactive Panel, maturational subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (defined by [CONTACT_398]197 and/or CD45RA expression) will be monitored for co- expression of 
‘regulation’ and ‘exhaus tion’ markers such as CTLA -4, TIM3, PD -1, and LAG3. The 
coexpression of the latter [ADDRESS_332981] and ICOS previously 
shown to be upregulated in patients responding to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224], identify ing them 
as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers5,6. Lastly, we will track proliferating T cell 
subsets expressing the intracellular marker Ki67.

Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the [COMPANY_006] C linical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination 
rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_333009]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescript ion, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within  28 days before and 30 days after  study drug 
administration should be recorded.  Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after  study drug administration should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.

• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after cons ultation with the Sponsor. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_272460] -up Phase.  
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects s hould receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Table 4 in section [IP_ADDRESS] and in 
greater detail in the ECI guidance document. Where appropriate, t hese guidelines include the 
use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of cort icosteroids.   Note 
that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral in fection, which might require additional 
supportive care. The  treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator  
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be relate d, the investigator  is 
instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in the ECI guidance document).  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, can be found in the ECI guidance document.

surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a w oman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had 
menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier met hod plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should 
start using birth control from study Visit 1 throughout the study period up to planned 
hysterectomy/oopherectomy .  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom 
(by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen a nd/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the stud y.  In order to participate in 
the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration 
of the study and during the  follow -up period defined in section 7.2.2- Reporting of Pregnancy 
and Lactation to the Sponsor  and to M erck.  If there is any question that a subject will not

Subjects may with draw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent. 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents administration of treatment.  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject . 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy te st. 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements . 
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Administrative reasons . 
The Safety Follow -up visit  and Post-Administration  monitoring procedures are listed in 
Section 6 (Protocol Flow Chart) and Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After study drug administration , each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious 
adverse events will be collected for at least 90 days after study drug administration  as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -administration  follow -up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a 
non-study cancer treatment, withdr awing consent or becoming lost to follow -up.  After 
documented disease progression each subject will be followed by [CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening  
Screening will only be performed after an initial pre -eligibility determination is made using 
those requirements that a re part of the medical history (disease and treatment history, recent 
labs or scans, etc.), do not require specific testing, where it appears the patient may be eligible 
for study, and after an informed consent is made.  
Screening studies and labs are perfo rmed in accordance with the sections listed above.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-Surgery /Biopsy  Administration Period  
The treatment period will consist of the time from  study drug  administration until the time of 
surgery  or biopsy . A single dose of pembrolizumab will be administere d on this study. The 
subject will be contact[CONTACT_272479] ≥ 3 days after dose administration and prior to 
surgery or biopsy to assess for adverse effects and/or any changes in medications. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Maintenance Phase  
Subjects who complete chemotherapy per local guidelines without unacceptable adverse 
experience (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) attributable to Pre -Surgery /Biopsy  Administration of 
pembroliz umab or progression of disease may be eligible for up to one year of maintenance  
pembrolizumab therapy. Maintenance therapy may be initiated if  the subject meets the 
following conditions:  
• No radiographic evidence of disease progression after chemotherapy  
AND 
• Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale  
• Demonstrates adequate organ function as detailed in Section 5.1.2 
• Does not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might interfere with the subject’s participation for the full duration of the trial or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021].  
Subjects who receive treatment during the maintenance phase will receive therapy according to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  Maintenance t reatment will be administered  for up to one year. Patients who 
experience dose delays of maintenance pembrolizumab will receive up to 12 months of therapy which may be less than 18 cycles of pembrolizumab maintenance therapy.  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 – Trial Flow  Chart.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Follow -up Visits  
Safety Follow -Up Visits will occur after completion of each phase of treatment (i.e. Pre-
surgery /biopsy  Administration, Maintenance Phase, and Second Course Phase, if applicable). 
The Safety Follow -Up Visits  should be conducted approximately 30 ± [ADDRESS_333036] study 
drug administration for each phase, as outlined in Section 6.0 -  Trial Flow Chart.  All AEs that 
occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade 
> 1 will be followe d until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0- 1 or until the beginning of a new 
anti-neoplastic therapy (other than planned adjuvant chemotherapy), whichever occurs first. 
SAEs that occur within 90 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new a nti-cancer 
treatment should also be followed and recorded.  Subjects who are eligible for retreatment with 
pembrolizumab (as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may have t hree safety follow -up visits, one 
after the Pre -Surgery /biopsy  Administration  Period , one a fter the Maintenance Phase,  and one 
after the Second Course Phase.

is described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting  of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropri ate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s ) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006]  product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006] ’s product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is t aken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor ’s designated safety reporting system, the Duke Safety Desk  by [CONTACT_6791] (919- 681-9357)

Table 7 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:   
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77991]; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade [ADDRESS_333046] that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357] , regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a n elective procedure] for a preexisting 
condition which has not worsened does not const itute a serious adverse event.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study)  or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An  overdose that is not 
associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported  within [ADDRESS_333047] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_333048] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done.  This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event 
based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the m ore likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance  assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologi c effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors

months  from the time of approval of Amendment 5 (22 Dec 2017) .  Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_84937] a limited sample size, statistical analyses will be descriptive.  The information gained 
from this study will help inform the development of future studies.  
8.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Analysis of toxicity data: The number of participants with adverse events will be determined and each observed toxicity will be tabulated by [CONTACT_24975], grade, and frequency.   
Biomarker statistics: Descriptive statistics  will be used to summarize baseline, post -
administration , and change from pre -to post -administration for each biomarker. Ninety -five 
percent confidence intervals will be constructed to describe the change in the levels of each marker between pre-  and post -administration . Correlation coefficients will be calculated and 
graphical displays of biomarker data will be generated to determine correlation between biomarkers.  Waterfall plots will be used to illustrate changes from baseline. Coefficients of variation  will be used to assess the dispersion of each analyte. PFS and OS will be estimated 
for analyte levels and changes  (both will be dichotomized) .

Additional monitoring may be prompted by f indings from monitoring visits, unexpected 
frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon 
request of DUHS and DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, the Safety Oversight Committee (SOC), the spons or, the Principal Investigator, or the IRB.  All study 
documents must be made available upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized regulatory authorities, including but not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Inst itute, and the FDA.  Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain 
confidentiality during study monitoring.  
The Duke School of Medicine Clinical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA) office may conduct audits to evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33573](s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study team to the CTQA auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
CTQA audits are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. 
CTQA audits may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited oversig ht 
or monitoring, Investigator initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded 
studies, high degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. D irected audits 
occur at the directive of the IRB or an authorized Institutional Official. 
CTQA audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to 
assess whether the research is conducted according to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_78050]. The primary purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human 
subjects in clinical trials and the quality of data produced by [CONTACT_12639]. The audit/review will serve as a quality assu rance measure, internal to the institution. 
Additional goals of such audits are to detect both random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to emphasize “best practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.

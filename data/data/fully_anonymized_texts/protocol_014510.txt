Behavioral Self-Management of Urinary Incontinence in Women 
 
Objectives  
To develop and test procedures for a future full-scale efficacy trial of a group-based 
yoga therapy intervention in m iddle-aged and older women with u rinary incontinence.  
Design   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], randomized, parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy program versus 
physical conditioning control program for treatment of urinary incontinence in 
ambulatory middle-aged and older women. 
Sample Size and Population  
Up to ninety women aged 50 years and older who document stress- , urgency-, or 
mixed-type incontinence occurring an average of once per day on  a voiding diary, 
are not participating in other organized yoga activities, are n ot using other clinical 
treatments for incontinence, and meet minimum mobility and othe r eligibility criteria 
will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area.   
Interventions and Duration 
Eligible women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in either a 12-week 
yoga therapy program (N~45) or a time-equivalent physical condi tioning exercise 
control program (N~45).  Women randomized in the yoga therapy p rogram will take 
part in twice weekly group yoga classes focusing on selected Iyengar-based yoga 
techniques as well as practice study-specific yoga techniques a t home for at least 
one hour per week for a total of [ADDRESS_769407] Guidelines and Considerations 7 of 52 Version 2.3  
  1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
Aim 1:  To examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining ambulatory women aged 
50 years and older into a randomized trial of a yoga therapy ve rsus physical 
conditioning program for treatment of incontinence, and explore potential differences 
in retention and adherence by [CONTACT_585175]- up.   
Expected outcome 1: We expect to recruit and randomize [ADDRESS_769408] in a future full-scale trial. 
Expected outcome 2:  We expect drop-out rates in both treatment  groups to increase over 
time, but remain <20% after 12 weeks of treatment and <30% at [ADDRESS_769409]-treatment 
follow-up. 
Expected outcome 3: We expect adherence to decrease over time, but remain >75% at 12 
weeks of treatment (for group classes and home practice) and >5 0% at [ADDRESS_769410]-
treatment (for home practice only). 
Aim 2:  Explore whether a clinically meaningful reduction in in continence frequency 
could be detected in a full-scale trial of yoga versus physical conditioning, and 
examine potential differences in treatment efficacy by [CONTACT_585176]-up.   
Expected outcome 1: We will collect data on the standard deviat ion, intra-class correlation, 
and between-group difference in change in incontinence frequenc y to guide sample size 
projections for a future full-scale trial powered to detect a 25% greater reduction in 
incontinence frequency associated with yoga therapy. 
Expected outcome 2: We will examine time-related trends in treatment effects on 
incontinence frequency to guide expectations of treatment effic acy over [ADDRESS_769411]-treatment 
follow-up in a future full-scale trial. 
Aim 3:  Explore potential effects of yoga versus physical conditioning on other 
symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinen ce and examine 
potential differences in treatment efficacy by [CONTACT_585175]-up.   
Expected outcome 1: We will collect data on standard deviations , intra-class correlations, 
and between-group differences for changes in anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life 
questionnaire scores to guide estimates of minimum detectable e ffects for these secondary 
outcomes in a future full-scale trial. 
Expected outcome 2: We will examine time-related trends in treatment effects on these 
secondary outcomes to guide expectations of treatment efficacy over [ADDRESS_769412] costs of incontinence amo ng U.S. women 
exceed $[ADDRESS_769413]-line treatment for both stress- and urgency-type incontinence includes 
behavioral management strategies such as bladder re-training and pelvic floor 
exercises to increase bladder capacity, strengthen the muscles supporting the bladder 
neck, and suppress involuntary bladder contractions. Unfortunat ely, many patients 
who attempt to practice these techniques after routine teaching  by [CONTACT_585177].10-13  Although the efficacy of these 
techniques can be improved by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-depth, one-on-one training and  biofeedback with 
pelvic physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585139], this type of 
intensive pelvic floor rehabilitation therapy is costly, and access to trained pelvic 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585140].14,15   
Second-line treatment for urgency-type incontinence (i.e., leak age caused by a sudden 
urge to void) consists primarily of anticholinergic drugs that are modestly effective in 
reducing incontinence, but have multiple side effects such as d ry mouth, stomach 
upset, constipation, and cognitive impairment.  As a result, over half of patients who initiate anticholinergic therapy discontinue it within a year.
16-18  For stress-type 
incontinence (i.e., leakage with activities that increase abdom inal pressure), surgery 
and other invasive procedures can be effective, but are inappro priate or poorly 
tolerated by [CONTACT_336260], es pecially older women who are at g reatest risk of 
incontinence.[ADDRESS_769414] that is appropriate for patients’ clinica l and safety needs.   
Yoga can also alleviate anxiety, stress, and associated autonom ic imbalance, as 
factors that contribute to incontinence and magnify its impact on quality of life. Clinical 
studies indicate that women with high self-reported levels anxi ety or stress are at 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_585141], and that women with chronic incontinence 
experience worsening of their incontinence after exposure to st ress-inciting events.

  randomized to this therapeutic yoga program experienced a 70% d ecrease in 
incontinence frequency over 6 weeks, versus 16% for the waitlist control (P=.05), 
without any increase in adverse events.[ADDRESS_769416] 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_500067]-, urgency-, or mixed-typ e incontinence on a 
screening 3-day voiding diary, are not using other clinical tre atments for incontinence, and 
meet minimum physical mobility requirements and other eligibility criteria will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area by [CONTACT_585178]. Eligible women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in 
either a 12-week yoga therapy program (N~45) focusing on select ed Iyengar-based yoga 
techniques, or a time-equivalent physical conditioning exercise  control program (N~45).  
Women randomized in the yoga t herapy program will take part in twice weekly group yoga 
classes involving [ADDRESS_769417] an hour per 
week.

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Recruitment:  Participants will be recruited from the greater S an Francisco Bay area 
using a multi-component approach that has been employed successfully in past 
clinical trials led by [CONTACT_473]. This includes community-based media efforts 
(newspaper and radio advertisements, notices posted in communit y and senior 
centers, mass community mailings), recruitment from a database of women who 
have given permission to be contact[CONTACT_183522]’s health resear ch studies based at 
the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco, and posting of recruitment fliers in clinician offices (such as general internal medicine, geriatric s, gynecology, or 
alternative medicine).   
Recruitment will be organized in waves to assemble successive c ohorts of women 
who are confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria and who are available to attend 
upcoming group yoga or physical conditioning classes. Based on past experience, 
the investigators assume that three waves will be needed to recruit and randomize at [ADDRESS_769422]. This will allow for a minimum 
of ~8 women taking part in each class series in each interventi on group. 
Screening: Preliminary eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_585179] 
a Screening Telephone Interview followed by [CONTACT_28920]-person Screen ing Clinic Visit.  
During the Screening Telephone Interview, coordinators will fol low a standardized 
screening interview script to assess preliminary eligibility re lated to age, gender, 
incontinence history, and exclusionary conditions and medications and document reasons for ineligibility on the screening interview form (see section 6.2.3, Screening 
Procedures, for more detail). Candidates who appear preliminari ly eligible at the end 
of the screening telephone interview will be scheduled to atten d an in-person 
Screening Clinic Visit. After providing written informed consen t at this visit, women 
will undergo more detailed assessment of incontinence symptoms,  use of clinical 
incontinence therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], exclusionary medical conditions, exclus ionary medications, 
urine dipstick and pregnancy testing (for women of childbearing  potential), and brief 
physical function assessment (s ee description of study procedur es below), with 
reasons for eligibility or ineligibility documented on the scre ening clinic intake form.   
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations [ADDRESS_769423] 3 times over the 3-day diary period and meet  all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Baseline Clinic Visit will be considered eligible for 
randomization to one of the two intervention groups. 
Randomization: During each recruitment/randomization wave, elig ible women will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two intervention groups. Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_183524] (i.e., stress, u rgency, or mixed), to 
ensure adequacy of randomization within these three types. Randomization will be implemented by [CONTACT_585180] s of sizes [ADDRESS_769424] allocation concealment procedures will be followed (see section 6.2.4. on Randomization for more detail).   
To avoid excessive lag time between randomization and the start  of the yoga therapy 
or physical conditioning programs, randomization will take place within two weeks of 
the yoga or physical conditioning program orientation session. For candidates whose 
Baseline Clinic Visit falls within this two-week window, random ization will take place 
directly at the Baseline Clinic Visit. For candidates who complete their Baseline Clinic Visit more than two weeks before the start of the yoga or physi cal conditioning 
intervention programs, a Randomization Telephone Call will be s cheduled to 
complete randomization within the two-week window. 
5.  STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Yoga Therapy Program  
Overview and rationale: The 12-week yoga therapy program will provide instruction 
and practice in a variety of yoga postures and techniques that have been selected by [CONTACT_585181] e bladder control and 
safety and feasibility for the target population. The study wil l feature a therapeutic 
program based primarily on Iy engar yoga, a form of Hatha yoga that is known for its 
potential therapeutic applications, has been employed successfully in other studies of yoga for different indications,
32,34,38-44 and differs from other Hatha yoga styles 
(power yoga, bikram yoga) in multiple ways that are likely to m aximize both efficacy 
and safety for this study. These include: 1) emphasis on precis e anatomical and 
postural alignment during practice of yoga postures; 2) incorpo ration of props to 
minimize risk of injury and accommodate those with lower streng th or flexibility; 3) 
emphasis on mindful awareness during practice of postures rathe r than rapid cycling 
through postures. The resulting yoga program, which was pre-tested and refined in the investigators’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_585146],
37 is designed to maximize women’s awareness of 
and control over the pelvic floor and improve underlying stress  and anxiety, while still 
being feasible for ambulatory women across a wide range of ages , as well as 
grounded in techniques common to Iyengar yoga at large.  
Content and postures: The study yoga program will focus on a core set of [ADDRESS_769425] been pre-t ested in the 
investigators’ earlier pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and can be safely adapted f or ambulatory women of 
all ages, including those with moderately decreased flexibility  or mobility. These 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 13 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  include both active postures engaging the pelvic floor and more  passive postures 
promoting relaxation: Baddha Konasana (bounded angle pose), Bharadvajasana 
(seated twist pose), Malasana (squat pose), Parsvokonasana (sid e angle pose), 
Parsvottasana (intense side stretch pose), Salabhasana (locust pose), Savasana 
(corpse pose), Salamba Set Bandhasana (supported bridge pose), Supta Baddha 
Konasana (reclined cobbler’s pose), Utkatasana (chair pose), Su pta 
Padagushthasana (reclined big toe pose), Tadasana (mountain pos e), Trikonasana 
(triangle pose), Viparita Karani Variation (legs up the wall po se), and Virabhadrasana 
2 (warrior 2 pose). 
Staff qualifications and training: Each yoga therapy class seri es will be led by a 
primary instructor who will: 1) have at least 2 years of experi ence teaching yoga in 
the community; 2) review a detailed, study-specific written ins tructor manual 
describing all of the postures and yoga techniques to be used i n the study program; 
3) complete at least 2 hours of in-person training in study-specific techniques with 
one of the study yoga expert consultants (Leslie Howard or Judith Lasater); 4) complete study-specific training in documentation of participan t attendance, review of 
home practice logs, and recording of yoga postures practiced du ring group classes 
on appropriate study forms; 5) carry and submit proof of person al liability insurance 
(minimum of $2 million coverage); and 6) confirm his or her wil lingness to adhere to 
the study intervention procedures. To maximize the generalizability of the study results and minimize observed effects due to specific providers , different primary 
instructors will be sought for each yoga class series. For each  class series, a back-
up instructor will also be identified who can teach a class in the event that the 
primary instructor is ill or is unable to teach due to an emergency. 
Orientation and classes:  Prior to group instruction, participa nts in each class series 
will attend a 90-minute group orientation led by [CONTACT_585182] c lass instructor. This 
will include an overview of the general principles of Iyengar yoga, an orientation to 
the structures of the pelvis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and lower extremity, and a n introduction to the 
yoga postures and the props to be used in the study. After the orientation, women 
will attend 90-minute group classes twice weekly for 12 weeks, led by [CONTACT_585183]. During group classes with an expected size of 8 to 15 participa nts, the instructor will 
guide women in practicing yoga postures, calling attention to w ays in which postures 
can improve pelvic floor function and adapt postures to accommo date physical 
limitations. Women will also be taught to avoid habits that may  worsen incontinence 
during practice, such as squeezing of abdominal rather than pel vic muscles. 
Following a study-specific guide, instructors will gradually introduce postures as classes progress, with the goal of making participants comforta ble with all core 
postures by [CONTACT_5638] 8 weeks and fully confident in performing postures by 12 weeks. 
Home practice: In addition to attending group classes, particip ants will be asked to 
practice yoga at home at least one additional time per week and  will be given a diary 
to keep track of the dates and times of practice.  Women will a lso be given a written 
manual, pre-tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_585147],37 that includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_585148]. Each particip ant will be given a 
limited set of yoga props (a mat, belt, and 2 blocks) for home practice.  Women will 
be encouraged to practice with other members of their classes, but will be 
discouraged from practicing with individuals who are not in the ir class and from 
taking part in non-study yoga activities that might dilute study techniques. After the 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations [ADDRESS_769426] one hour per week at home, although they  will not continue to 
attend study-specific group classes. 
Quality and safety: The study program will incorporate multiple  modifications to help 
women across the age range to perform postures in ways that min imize risk of 
muscle strain or injury. Participant manuals will include speci fic instructions on 
adapting each posture and/or using props to accommodate problem s with mobility, 
flexibility, or balance. To promote quality and safety, the ins tructors leading classes 
will be required to have at least [ADDRESS_769427] 
completed dedicated, study-specific training with the study’s e xpert consultants. 
Following procedures established in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], a consulta nt will visit at least one 
class in each series to ensure that postures are being taught a ccording to protocol, 
evaluate students’ success in learning yoga, and ensure fidelit y across instructors.  
Monthly conference calls will be conducted to help instructors trouble-shoot issues 
that arise in instruction. 
5.2 Physical Conditioning Control Program  
Overview and rationale: This tr ial will include a 12-week physi cal conditioning 
program that will provide a rigorous time-and-attention control for the yoga program, 
but has been designed to avoid engaging the pelvic floor or pro moting mindful 
relaxation. To minimize differential expectations of treatment success, women will be told that they are enrolling in a study of two different types of low-impact physical activity-based interventions (y oga versus physical conditioning ) to enhance 
management of incontinence. Physica l conditioning exercises hav e been adapted 
from exercises used in prior studies conducted by [CONTACT_506473], such as the 
PRYSMS trial of restorative yoga vs. stretching for metabolic s yndrome (designed by 
[CONTACT_183529], DPT, consultant on this proposal), in which pa rticipants 
maintained good adherence to the stretching program despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a l ong study period.  
Similar to postures in the yoga  therapy program, the exercises in the physical 
conditioning program have been selected for their potential to be performed safely by 
[CONTACT_183530] a range of ages and flexibility levels. 
Content and exercises:  After a brief education about sitting a nd standing posture, 
the physical conditioning program will focus on a core set of stretching/strengthening 
exercises that will be performed sitting in a chair: levator sc apulae, upper trapezius, 
scalenes, shoulder horizontal adduction, triceps, pectoral stretch with hands behind head, wrist flexors and extensors, trunk flexion, trunk extensi on, trunk side-bend, 
trunk rotation, and hamstring stretches.  Additional chair exercises will incorporate a stretching strap: pectoral stretch with strap, gastrocnemius st retch with strap, and 
hand behind back with strap.  A few stretches will be performed  on an exercise mat 
on the floor: supi[INVESTIGATOR_183472], supi[INVESTIGATOR_585149], 
quadriceps stretch with strap, supi[INVESTIGATOR_585150], and seated 
adductor stretch. Three exercises will be performed in the standing position: gastrocnemius, soleus, shoulder flexion, and shoulder abduction stretches. 
Staff qualifications and training: Each physical conditioning class series will be led by 
a primary instructor who: 1) is either certified as a personal trainer through the 
National Academy of Sports Medicine or the American College of Sports Medicine, 
or licensed as a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585151]; 2) 
has at least [ADDRESS_769428] or physical trainer in either individual or group settings; 3) will have reviewed a  detailed, study-specific 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 15 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  training manual describing all of the stretching/strengthening exercises to be used in 
the study program; 4) will have completed at least 2 hours of i n-person training in 
study-specific techniques with study expert consultant Sarah Pawlowsky, DPT; 5) will have completed study-specific training in documentation of participant attendance, review of home practice logs (for adherence), and recording of exercises performed 
during group classes on appropriate study forms; 6) carries and  submits proof of 
personal liability insurance (minimum of $2 million coverage); 7) confirms his or her 
willingness to adhere to the study intervention procedures. To maximize the 
generalizability of the study results and minimize observed eff ects due to specific 
providers, different primary instructors will be sought for eac h class series. For each 
class series, a back-up instructor will also be identified who can teach a class in the 
event that the primary instructor is ill or is unable to teach due to an emergency. 
Group orientation and classes: S imilar to the yoga therapy prog ram, the physical 
conditioning program will begin with a group orientation led by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585152], who will provide an overview of the s tretching/strengthening 
exercises to be covered in the program. This will be followed b y 90-minute twice 
weekly group classes, each with [ADDRESS_769429] received in-person study-specific training from consultant 
Sarah Pawlowsky, DPT. Classes will be designed to make women co mfortable with 
all stretching/strengthening exercises by 8 weeks and fully confident in performing 
exercises by 12 weeks. 
Home practice: In addition to attending group classes, women wi ll be asked to 
perform stretching/strengthening exercises at home at least one additional time per 
week and record the dates and times of practice in a log. Women will receive a 
detailed manual with pi[INVESTIGATOR_585153]/strengthening 
exercise to guide them in home practice, as well as a stretch s trap and exercise mat 
to use at home. After the end of the main 12-week study period,  participants will be 
encouraged to continue practice stretching/strengthening exercises at least one hour 
per week at home, although they will not continue to attend study-specific group classes. 
Quality and safety:  Instructors leading physical conditioning classes will be physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_183478] [ADDRESS_769430]. Pawlowsky  will provide quality monitoring and assess 
women’s success in learning stretching/strengthening exercises by [CONTACT_183531]-
person visit to at least one class in each series. She will als o lead monthly 
conference calls with instructors, similar to quality monitoring for the yoga program.  
5.[ADDRESS_769431] incontinence symptoms (anticholinergic bladder medica tions, 
selective norepi[INVESTIGATOR_585154], tricyclic antidepr essants, 
mirabegron), invasive or surgical bladder treatments, medical d evices used to 
improve bladder symptoms (e.g., pessary), and behavioral treatm ent 
programs administered by [CONTACT_183532] (e.g., pelvic floor 
rehabilitation therapy, biofeedback programs). Additionally, participants will be asked to refrain from starting or changing the dosage of medications that could affect anxiety and perceived stress symptoms (e.g., antid epressants, 
sedatives/hypnotics, or antipsychotic agents), although mainten ance of stable 
dosages of these medications will be acceptable. 
Participants will be queried about use of these prohibited inte rventions at 
baseline, at the 8-week and 12-week clinic visits, and as part of the 24-week 
assessment. If participants are found to be using prohibited interventions, 
they will not be required to terminate the study early, but study staff will also 
re-urge participants to avoid using prohibited interventions if at all possible 
(although this may not be possible for some types of interventi ons), and 
information about use of prohibited interventions can be taken into account in 
data analyses. 
5.[ADDRESS_769432] any participant who misses a scheduled class to ask abo ut reasons for 
missing the class, reinforce the importance of class attendance, and troubleshoot any barriers to attendance. 
Adherence to home practice of yoga or stretching/strengthening exercises will be 
tracked using home practice logs. Participants will be instructed to record the date, 
time, and duration of each home practice session in their logs,  as well as the specific 
yoga poses or stretching/strengthening exercises practiced during each session.  
Home practice logs will be collected by [CONTACT_585184] a weekly basis during the 12-week treatment pro gram. Clinical 
coordinators will contact [CONTACT_585185] a t least one hour a week at home. Additionally, home 
practice logs will be returned by [CONTACT_2319] [ADDRESS_769433] Guidelines and Consi derations 17 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  Every effort will be made to encourage participants to complete all intervention 
classes and practice sessions. Prior to randomization, study co ordinators will stress 
the importance of adherence to group classes and home practice,  and only those 
women who indicate that they are available on scheduled class d ates and willing to 
practice yoga or stretching exercises at home as recommended wi ll be eligible for 
randomization. The importance of adherence will again be stressed at the orientation session for each yoga or physical conditioning series, as well as during follow-up 
telephone calls 2 weeks and follow-up visits at 8 weeks. Additionally, attendance 
sheets from yoga and stretching classes will be carefully monitored, and home 
practice logs will be reviewed weekly, so that study staff can immediately call any 
women who miss classes or fail to document home practice in order to reinforce the importance of attendance/practice and troubleshoot barriers to adherence. 
6.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Study Measures 
6.1.1  Urinary Incontinence 
The primary efficacy outcome, frequency of any urinary incontinence, will be assessed using a 3-day voiding diary that has been shown to be a valid and 
reliable method for documenting change in incontinence symptoms  and is 
widely used in clinical trials of incontinence treatments.
46,47  At 
screening/baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 weeks after the e nd of the 
yoga and physical conditioning programs (24 weeks), each partic ipant will 
receive written instructions and a blank diary to take home, and will use the diary to record all voiding and incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_17767] a 3- day period and 
classify incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] b y clinical type (urgency, stres s, other). Upon 
return of the diary, an analyst will abstract data to determine  the number of 
total as well as urgency and stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] d ay. For diaries 
that are completed after randomization, data will be abstracted  by [CONTACT_585186]. 
6.1.2  Condition-Specific Quality of Life  
To address incontinence-related quality of life, participants will complete the following validated questionnaire measures at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 after the end of the yoga and physical conditioning 
programs (24 weeks): 
A. Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)-- a validated, 28-item measure of 
the impact of incontinence on 4 domains of functioning and qual ity of life 
(physical activity, emotional health, relationships, and travel ).
48,49 Scores 
range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse impact.  
B.  Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6)-- a validated, 6-it em measure that 
assesses subjective distress from frequent urination, urgency incontinence, stress incontinence, small-volume leakage, diffic ulty 
emptying the bladder, and genital pain.
49 Scores are scaled from 0 to 100. 
C. Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)-- a validated  single-item 
measure assessing the degree to which respondents consider thei r 
condition to be a problem on a 6-point scale.50,[ADDRESS_769434] Guidelines and Consi derations 18 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  6.1.3  Anxiety and Perceived Stress  
To evaluate anxiety and perceived stress symptoms that may be associated 
with incontinence, participants will complete the following val idated 
questionnaire measures at screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 w eeks, as 
well as 12 weeks after the end of the yoga and physical conditioning programs (24 weeks): A. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_183481] (STAI): Somatic an xiety (i.e., the 
affective component of anxiety believed to be related to autonomic physiological arousal response) will be measured using the trai t 
component of the STAI, a 20-item self-administered measure vali dated in 
clinical populations, including patients with bladder symptoms,  with scores 
ranging form 20 to 80.
52,53 
B. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS): Cognitive anxi ety (i.e., the 
mental component of anxiety associated with fear of failure) wi ll be 
measured by [CONTACT_183535], a validated self-administered questionnaire that includes a 7-item Anxiety Subscale
54 shown to be sensitive to change in 
incontinence trials.55 Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores 
indicating greater anxiety. 
C. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): Perceived stress will be asses sed by [CONTACT_183536], a 10-item measure of thoughts and feelings related to perc eived 
stress in the past month, validated in a probability sample of the [LOCATION_002].
56 Scores range from 0 to 40; higher scores indicated greater 
stress. 
D. Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES-D): D epressive 
symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_150216]-D, a 20-item measure that has 
been widely used in clinical trials, including bladder interven tions, and is 
sensitive to change.57 Total scores range from 0 to 60. 
6.1.4  Yoga/Physical Conditioning Self-efficacy and Competency  
A. Yoga Posture Self-Efficacy: At 8 weeks and 12 weeks, as well  12 weeks 
after the end of the yoga therapy program (24 weeks), women in the yoga 
group will complete a structured questionnaire (modeled after an existing 
self-efficacy measure 58 and pre-tested in the investigators’ previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]) to indicate how confident they are that they can perform  each of the 
postures featured in the program (from ‘not at all’ to ‘extreme ly confident’). 
Total scores will range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indica ting greater 
confidence. A corresponding questionnaire will be administered to the 
physical conditioning group participants. 
B. Independent Yoga Competency Assessment: To provide a more ob jective 
assessment of women’s success i n learning yoga, a yoga expert 
consultant will attend one class at the end of each series and observe 
women as they practice yoga. The consultant will rate each woma n’s 
success in performing each yoga posture on a 5-point scale, ranging from “not at all” to “extremely” successful. Total scores will range from 0 to 56.  
In the physical conditioning control group, Sarah Pawlowsky, DP T, will 
provide similar assessments. 
C. Yoga Practice Adherence Self-Efficacy: At 8 weeks and 12 wee ks, as well 
12 weeks after the end of treatment (24 weeks), women will comp lete a 
measure of confidence in adhering to yoga or stretching practic e, modeled 
after existing physical activity adherence self-efficacy scales  
[ADDRESS_769435] Guidelines and Consi derations 19 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Women will indicate on a 5-point scale how confident 
they are that they can practice yoga or stretching when they: 1) are tired, 
2) are in a bad mood, 3) have limited time, 4) are away from home, and 5) 
are not regularly attending yoga classes. Scores will range fro m 0 to 20. 
D. Credibility and Expectations of Treatment: To assess whether  women 
perceive the yoga and physical conditioning interventions as eq ually 
credible and have similar expecta tions for improvement in incon tinence, 
we will administer a modified version of an expectancy/credibil ity measure 
used in other women’s health studies at baseline.60 
6.1.5  Additional Screening and Covariate Measures  
The following data will be collected to assess eligibility, ass ess whether 
treatment groups are comparable at baseline, and guide statisti cal adjustments 
in the event groups are not balanced: A. Demographic history including date of birth, gender/sex, rac e/ethnicity, 
education history, employment his tory, marital status (screenin g/baseline) 
B. Urologic/urogynecologic history including age of onset of in continence, past 
and current treatment of incontinence, history of pelvic surger y, history of 
pregnancy and delivery, menstrual/menopausal status (screening/ baseline) 
C. General medical history including general health assessed by  [CONTACT_183539],
61 selected medical conditions associated with 
incontinence such as diabetes, and current medication use (screening/baseline and 12 weeks) 
D. Health-related habits such as tobacco/alcohol use, prior yoga experience, 
prior group-based physical activity instruction, physical activ ity level by [CONTACT_585187]
62,63 (screening/baseline) 
E. Sleep quality assessed using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_585155] (PSQI),39,40 a 
validated questionnaire evaluating sleep quality, latency, effi ciency, and 
problems (screening/baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks) 
F. Physical exam measures inc luding measured height, weight, heart rate, and 
blood pressure (screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks) 
G. Physical function including self-reported function using the  PROMIS Adult 
Physical Function Profile short-form.[ADDRESS_769436] 
physical mobility evaluation using the Short Physical Performan ce Battery65 
(screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks). 
6.[ADDRESS_769437] provide 
written informed consent before enrolling in the study. Following the UCSF 
IRB-approved template (see Appendix A), the consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures involved in recruiting, randomized, and 
monitoring participants, and the potential risks and benefits a ssociated with 
participation. A study coordinator will first explain the study  procedures to the 
potential participant, referring as necessary to the detailed I RB-approved 
consent form. The coordinator will then give a paper copy of the consent form 
to the potential participant to read. After the potential participant has read the 
consent form, she will be asked if she has any questions or concerns about 
the study. Once these questions/concerns have been addressed, t he 
participant will be asked to sign the consent form, and will be  given a copy of 
the consent form to take home for future reference. Coordinators will also have each participant read and sign a HIPAA authorization form granting 
study staff permission to access protected health information if needed. Pursuant to [LOCATION_004] Health & Safety Code [ZIP_CODE], each participant will also receive a copy of the Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights. A copy of the 
signed consent form and HIPAA authorization form will be stored  in the 
participants’ chart in locked research offices.  
6.2.3   Screening Procedures 
Telephone Screening Interview 
 Women who call in response to recruitment advertisements or wh o have 
previously given permission to be contact[CONTACT_585188]’s health research at UCSF will be provided  with a 
brief overview of the study goals and procedures by a clinical coordinator 
over the telephone. 
 If interested, candidates will complete a brief telephone survey to assess 
preliminary eligibility (including age, gender, duration/freque ncy/type of 
incontinence, current and past incontinence treatment, prior yo ga practice, 
physical mobility, exclusionary conditions and medications, availability for 
upcoming yoga therapy or physical conditioning classes). 
 
Screening Clinic Visit 
 At this visit, a clinical coordinator will explain the require ments of the study 
while referring to the detailed informed consent form, and candidates will 
provide written informed consent if they are still interested i n proceeding 
with the study. 
 Candidates will complete questionnaires about their demographi c, 
urologic/urogynecologic, and medical history to determine if th ey meet 
criteria related to age, gender, duration/frequency/type of inc ontinence, 
current and past incontinence treatment, prior yoga practice, e xclusionary 
conditions and medications 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 21 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   Over-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed to 
determine if candidates are taking any exclusionary medications . 
 Height, weight, and resting blood pressure and pulse measureme nts will 
be obtained. 
 Physical function will be assessed by [CONTACT_63496]. 
 A clean-catch urine sample will be collected to assess for pos sible urinary 
tract infection and rule out pregnancy (for the minority of can didates who 
are still of child-bearing potential).   
 Potentially eligible women will be instructed on completing a 3-day voiding 
diary to document all incontinence and voiding epi[INVESTIGATOR_83252] . 
 A Baseline Clinic Visit will be scheduled at least 3 days late r for review of 
the completed voiding diary and determination of final eligibil ity. 
 
Baseline Clinic Visit 
 Candidates will return with the completed 3-day voiding diary,  and results 
will be reviewed by a clinical coordinator. Candidates whose di aries 
indicate predominantly urgency, stress, or mixed-type incontine nce, 
document at least 3 incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 3-day diary, and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible to continue.   
 Women will complete structured questionnaires about anxiety an d 
perceived stress, incontinence-specific quality of life, and sl eep quality.   
 Physical function will be assesse d by [CONTACT_585189]. 
 Participants will be given a brief written pamphlet about usua l first-line 
behavioral management of incontinence (see description in inter ventions 
section above).  
 If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place within 2 weeks of the start of the 
yoga or physical conditioning program orientation session, elig ible 
participants will be randomized to one of the two interventions  at this visit. 
 If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place more than 2 weeks bef ore the start 
of the yoga or physical conditi oning program, eligible particip ants will be 
scheduled for a Randomization Telephone Call within two weeks o f the 
start of the program to determine their intervention assignment. 
6.2.4 Randomization and Blinding 
Randomization 
Women who are confirmed to be eligible and available to take pa rt in 
upcoming yoga or physical conditioning group class series will be randomized 
in a 1:[ADDRESS_769438] Guidelines and Consi derations 22 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  (whichever is appropriate), randomization will be performed according to a 
pre-established computer-algorithm using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 
2 and 4 (limited block size to ensure that the number of random ized 
participants within each strata always exceeds the block size).   
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_183524] (i.e., stress, 
urgency, or mixed) to ensure adequacy of randomization among wo men with 
each major incontinence type. Randomization will be implemented . Prior to 
randomization, the research coordinator will complete a randomi zation 
checklist confirming that the participant meets all eligibility criteria. Additionally, participants’ availability and willingness to att end upcoming yoga 
or physical conditioning group classes will be re-confirmed before randomization assignment is obtained. 
Standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed to avoid 
manipulation of randomization.
[ADDRESS_769439] the next numbered envelope corresponding to the participants’ type of in continence 
(stress-, urgency-, or mixed-type) to determine group assignmen t. Once a 
participant has been randomized, she cannot be re-assigned to a  different 
intervention group. All randomization envelopes will be retaine d for review; 
randomization dates and times should follow the order of the se quence 
numbers, providing a check on validity.   
Blinding 
Although participants cannot be blinded to treatment assignment  (due to the 
behavioral nature of the intervention), study procedures have b een carefully 
designed to avoid bias associated with knowledge of group assig nment.  
First, to minimize differential expectations of treatment succe ss, participants 
will be told that they are participating in a study of two diff erent types of low-
impact group activity-based interventions to enhance self-manag ement of 
incontinence, and that we do not know which is more effective (which is true). 
The primary outcome will be assessed by [CONTACT_183514], a meas ure that is 
resistant to reporting bias, and data from returned diaries will be abstracted by [CONTACT_183544]. Similarly, data from participant follow-up  questionnaires 
assessing other symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinence will be abstracted by [CONTACT_183544].   
Only study personnel who are involved in delivering the therape utic 
interventions, assessing and promoting adherence to these inter ventions, 
and/or monitoring adverse events related to these interventions  will be aware 
of group assignment. All investigators, study analysts involved  in abstracting 
efficacy outcomes data, and statistical programmers involved in  ongoing data 
cleaning will be blinded to treatment allocation. Unless stipulated by [CONTACT_585190] a 
participant experiencing a serious adverse event, these investi gators and 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations [ADDRESS_769440] com pleted their final 
visit, trial data are edited and cleaned, and the trial dataset  is locked.  A 
statistical programmer who is not involved in data collection or cleaning will 
be appointed to create the unblinded group-specific data tables  for closed 
session Data and Safety Monitor reviews.   
6.2.5 Follow-up/Final Evaluations 
Follow-up evaluations will consist of a 2-week telephone call, 8-week clinic 
visit, 12-week clinic visit, and 24-week mail-in assessment: 
2-Week Telephone Call  
 Two weeks after the start of the yoga therapy or physical cond itioning 
program, coordinators will call women to assess adverse events, address 
any concerns, and reinforce adherence to group classes and home  
practice of yoga therapy or stretching/strengthening exercises.   
 Adherence to and challenges in performing usual behavioral sel f-
management strategies for incontinence will also be assessed.   
 Women will be reminded to continue recording home yoga or phys ical 
conditioning practice in their practice logs and return their l ogs each week 
to the yoga class instructors. They will also be reminded to st art filling out 
a second voiding diary 3 days before the 8-Week Clinic Visit. 
 
8-Week Clinic Visit 
 Eight weeks after the start of the yoga or physical conditioni ng program, 
women will return for a follow-up visit, bringing their second completed 
voiding diary.  
 Voiding diaries will be retrieved by [CONTACT_585191] a blinded analyst for data abstraction.  
 Adverse events will be recorded using standardized forms (see safety 
monitoring section).  Adherence to yoga or stretching practice and 
incontinence self-management strategies will be re-assessed.   
 Yoga/physical conditioning posture and practice self-efficacy 
questionnaire measures will be administered.     
 Women will re-self-administer questionnaires about anxiety/str ess 
symptoms, incontinence-specific quality of life, and sleep qual ity.

reviewed. 
 Physical function will be re-assessed by [CONTACT_585192]. 
 Women will be given a third voiding diary to complete before the 12-week 
visit, and the 12-week visit will be scheduled. 
 
12-Week Clinic Visit 
 Twelve weeks after the start of the yoga or physical condition ing program, 
women will return for another clinic visit, bringing their thir d completed 
voiding diary.  
 Voiding diaries will be retrieved by [CONTACT_585191] a blinded analyst for data abstraction. 
 Adverse events will be recorded using standardized forms (see safety 
monitoring section). 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 24 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   Yoga/physical conditioning posture and practice self-efficacy 
questionnaire measures will be re-administered.     
 Women will re-self-administer questionnaires about anxiety/str ess 
symptoms, incontinence-specific quality of life, and sleep qual ity.   
 Current use of prescription and over-the-counter medications w ill be re-
reviewed. 
 Physical function will be re-assessed by [CONTACT_585192]. 
 A satisfaction questionnaire will be administered to assess overall 
satisfaction with study procedures and change in incontinence s ymptoms. 
 Women will be encouraged continue practicing yoga or 
stretching/strengthening exercises for at least an hour per wee k for the 
next [ADDRESS_769441] this practice in their home practice l ogs. 
 
24-Week Assessment 
 Approximately twelve weeks after completion of the yoga or phy sical 
conditioning program, coordinators will call participants to th em to 
complete their fourth and final voiding diary at home (the blan k diary will 
be mailed in advance to participants at home). 
 Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_585193] g 
standardized forms (see safety monitoring section). 
 Women will also be asked to complete questionnaires addressing  
symptom, quality-of life, and sleep outcomes as well as yoga/ph ysical 
conditioning practice adherence and self-efficacy at home (ques tionnaires 
will be mailed in advance to participants at home). 
 Women will also be asked to complete a close-out satisfaction 
questionnaire addressing their overall satisfaction with study procedures 
and change in incontinence symptoms. 
 Women will return with their final completed voiding diary and  
questionnaires using a pre-stamped and addressed envelope. 
 
Recommended time windows for completion each of the post-random ization 
follow-up evaluations will be as follows: 
Follow-Up Assessment Time Window 
2-week telephone call 11 to 17 days after the start of the yoga  therapy 
or physical conditioning program

risk of harm, study procedures may be associated with the follo wing risks: 
 Yoga Therapy Intervention:  Possible risks associated with group yoga instruction 
and home yoga practice include muscle soreness and muscle/ligam ent strain, or 
other musculoskeletal injury if participants fall or lose their balance while trying to 
practice the yoga poses. 
 Physical Conditioning Control Intervention:  Similar to the yo ga therapy

intervention include muscle soreness and muscle/ligament strain , or 
musculoskeletal injury if participants fall or lose their balan ce while trying to learn 
or practice the exercises. 
 Questionnaires and Diaries: Although the information participa nts provide on 
data collection forms and diaries is confidential, some partici pants may feel 
embarrassed at having to answer questions, especially those related to incontinence symptoms or anxiety/stress symptoms.  However, los s of 
confidentiality is unlikely to pose any significant legal or fi nancial risk to 
participants. 
 Physical Examination/Performance Measurements:  There are no d irect risks 
associated with undergoing measurement of height, weight, blood  pressure, or 
heart rate, or evaluation of physical mobility, although partic ipants may 
experience this as inconvenient or unpleasant. 
 Behavioral Incontinence Self-Management Pamphlet:  Provision of standard 
written information on usual first-line behavioral self-managem ent strategies for 
incontinence such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and timed ur ination should 
pose no risks to participants, although participants may find it inconvenient or unpleasant to read the pamphlet. 
 Urine Dipstick and Pregnancy Testing: There are no direct risk s associated with 
collection of the screening urine sample, although some partici pants may 
experience this as inconvenient or unpleasant. 
To minimize potential risks to participants associated with stu dy interventions and 
procedures, the following steps will be taken: 
 Yoga Therapy Intervention.  The instructors leading the group yoga classes will 
be trained yoga teachers who will have experience in guiding adults from a wide 
range of ages to learn and practice yoga safely and will underg o specific, in-
person training by [CONTACT_1758]’s y oga expert consultants.  The st udy protocol 
incorporates props such as blocks and straps to help participan ts perform yoga 
postures in such a way that will minimize the chance of muscle strain or other injury.  The yoga instruction manuals have been designed to include explicit tips on modifying or adapting postures to accommodate problems with mobility, 
flexibility, or balance. 
 Physical Conditioning Control Intervention:  Instruction for t he physical 
conditioning control classes will be provided trained physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_585157] [ADDRESS_769445] completed in-
person training with co-investigator Sarah Pawlowsky, PT.  
Stretching/strengthening exercises have been selected to be app ropriate for 
middle-aged and older women who may have flexibility or mobility limitations in addition to incontinence. 
 Questionnaires and Diaries. All study questionnaires and diari es will be stored in 
a locked file cabinet in a locked room in our research clinic, or on password-secured servers. All study staff are fully trained in good clin ical practice, HIPAA 
procedures, and the importance of participant confidentiality is emphasized. 
 Physical Examination/Perform ance Measures.  Study personnel re sponsibility for 
performing physical exam measures  and evaluating physical mobil ity will have 
prior clinical experience with performing physical exam measure ments in middle-
aged and older women and will receiving study-specific training to ensure that they perform measurements in a manner that is sensitive and min imizes 
discomfort to participants. 
 Urine Dipstick and Pregnancy Testing.  Study coordinators will  receive training 
on obtaining screening urine samples in a manner that is sensit ive and minimizes 
discomfort to participants. 
 Behavioral Incontinence Self-Management Pamphlet:  Study coord inators will be 
available to answer participants’ questions about the pamphlet if they arise. 
7.[ADDRESS_769446] following randomization, starting with the 2-Week Telephone Call. Negative changes in health will be recorded as adverse events or serious adverse event s on standardized forms as appropriate (see 
sections 7.3 and 7.4 below for definitions and documentation). Additionally, if 
participants contact [CONTACT_585194], these will also be recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events. 
Coordinators will not prompt participants to provide informatio n about specific types 
of adverse events at follow-up visits, but instead encourage participants to volunteer 
information by [CONTACT_183553], open-ended question, “H ave there been any 
changes in your health since your  last visit?”  Any negative ch anges in health 
reported by [CONTACT_183554], as 
appropriate (see section 7.3 below).   
7.3     Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events     
7.3.1  AE/SAE Definitions   
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that 
occurs during the study or with use of the study interventions.  An adverse 
finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment, or an y 
combination of these. Medical conditions or diseases present be fore starting 
study interventions will only be considered adverse events if t hey worsen 
after starting the intervention. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in death, a life-
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 29 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  threatening event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant disability/incapac ity, a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect, or any other important medical event that jeopardizes the safety of participants based upon appropriate medical judgment. 
7.3.2  AE/SAE Documentation 
All negative changes in health reported by [CONTACT_585195], as appropriate. Each adverse event will be assigned an AE number and will be recorded on a separate AE for m to avoid 
duplication in reporting. For each AE, clinical coordinators wi ll record the date 
of onset and resolution of the AE and record the nature or type  of AE.  Based 
on information provided by [CONTACT_2299], coordinators will a lso classify the 
severity of the AE as “mild” if it does not have a noticeable impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some inconvenience , or “severe” if 
it results in substantial disruption to the patient’s functioni ng or well-being. In 
consultation with the principal investigator, coordinators will also indicate whether any indicate whether any specific action such as discontinuation of the study intervention was taken in response to the AE.   
Each serious adverse event will be assigned an SAE number and r ecorded 
on an SAE form.  Similar to regular AEs, clinical coordinators will record the 
date of onset and resolution of each SAE and record the nature or type of 
SAE. Coordinators will also document any treatment provided for  the SAE, 
indicate any laboratory or other clinical data obtained about t he SAE, indicate 
the participant’s condition at the time of reporting of the SAE , and indicate 
whether any specific action such as study discontinuation was taken in 
response to the SAE. Each SAE form will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_28824], who will use a standard attribution scale to indicate the 
potential relationship between any SAEs and study interventions  (not, 
unlikely, possible, probably, or definitely related to study intervention). 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
  7.4.1   SAE Reporting 
 Clinical coordinators will notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_585158] 
a SAE is discovered, in addition to filling out a standardized SAE form 
that will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_458] (see section 
7.3.3 above regarding SAE documentation). 
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_585159] i nstitutional 
review board at the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco, the  
independent Data and Safety Monitor (DSM), and the NCCIH progra m 
officer within 24 hours of awareness of the event.   
 Other unexpected serious adverse events that are potentially 
intervention-related will be reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_183489], the DSM, and the NCCIH Program Officer within 48 hour s of 
learning of the event.  
 Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but 
will also be reported to the UCSF IRB and the DSM within [ADDRESS_769447] Guidelines and Consi derations 30 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   
7.4.2   Non-Serious AE Reporting 
 
 If a clinical coordinator discovers an AE that does not meet th e definition 
of a SAE but may still pose a substantial risk of harm to a par ticipant and 
is potentially associated with study interventions or procedure s, he/she 
will report the AE to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 1 worki ng day, in 
addition to filling out a standardized AE form. 
 Cumulative trends in all non-serious adverse events will be rev iewed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_585160] s (see 
below for DSM meeting schedule). More frequent review of non-se rious 
adverse events may be performed if recommended by [CONTACT_585196].  
 Although the UCSF IRB does not require reporting of non-serious  AEs to 
the UCSF IRB, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_585161]-serious AEs if they may still pose a s ubstantial 
risk of harm to a participant or are potentially associated wit h study 
interventions or procedures.   
7.5 Follow-up for AEs/SAEs 
From the time that they are first reported by [CONTACT_585197] l the end of the study, 
AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolved or considered stab le. At each 
scheduled follow-up contact [CONTACT_585198], a clinical 
coordinator will assess whether the AE or SAE is continuing or has resolved, and will 
update information about event status on the AE or SAE form, as  appropriate. For 
SAEs, the clinical coordinator or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183492] (with 
their permission) in order to monitor resolution of SAEs.   
7.[ADDRESS_769448] of the study and safety of participants will be evaluated by [CONTACT_585199] (DSM), [CONTACT_80857], MD , MPH, Senior 
Research Scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern [LOCATION_004], wh o is a clinical 
researcher experienced with designing, implementing, and monito ring safety in 
therapeutic interventions studies as well as a practicing clinician. The DSM is independent of the investigators and staff participating in the study, and has no financial ties to the outcome of the study. The DSM will period ically review the 
conduct and outcomes of the study and provide feedback to the investigators, with particular attention to protecting the safety of the participan ts. 
Prior to initiation of the trial, the DSM will review and approve the study design and plans for recruitment, adherence, interventions, data quality, and safety monitoring.  At periodic intervals during the course of the trial, the DSM w ill evaluate the 
adequacy and timeliness of participant recruitment, adherence t o the protocol, and 
the potential of the study to meet the stated goals; evaluate t he quality and integrity 
of the data, including adequacy of data management and data security procedures; evaluate participant safety including trends in adverse events and relationship to the 
study procedures; consider factors external to the study when r elevant information, 
such as scientific developments, may have an impact on the safe ty of the 
participants or the ethical conduct of the study; and make reco mmendations, if 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 31 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  necessary, to the investigators, the UCSF IRB, and the NCCIH on  continuation, 
termination, or other modifications of the study protocol. 
The DSM will periodically review aggregate and unblinded trial data according to the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  An emergency meeting m ay also be 
called by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_585162].  Each review will include an assessment of the adequacy and timeliness of 
participant recruitment, adherence to the visit and interventio n protocols, data quality 
and timeliness, adverse effects, and participant safety.  Interim reports for the DSM 
will be prepared by [CONTACT_80835]’s Health Clinical 
Research Center, and sent to the DSM at least 5 days prior to a  pre-scheduled 
meeting or conference call.  
After each interim review, the DSM will provide a signed statement that indicates 
whether the study should continue, terminate, or be altered bas ed on ability to meet 
study recruitment and data quality goals and participant safety. He will include any recommendations for changes to the protocol if necessary to enh ance participant 
safety or potentiate the ability of the trial to answer the research hypotheses.  This statement will be provided to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_585163].  All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSM process will be completely confidential.    
8.   INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Participation in the yoga therapy and/or physical conditioning interventions may be 
discontinued if determined to be necessary to protect the safety of a participant.  The decision to discontinue the therapeutic intervention will be made on a case-by-case by [CONTACT_458], with input from the DSM if needed. Poss ible reasons for 
discontinuation of the therapeutic intervention may include: 1)  development of a clinically 
significant adverse event limiting a participant’s ability to safety take part in yoga or physical conditioning practice; 2) disruptive behavior exhibited by a participant during group yoga or physical conditioning classes or study visits that endangers th e safety or comfort of other 
study participants, class instructors, or study staff; or 3) de cision to terminate the study by 
[CONTACT_1201], NCCIH, or other regulatory bodies. 
In the event that the yoga therapy or physical conditioning con trol intervention is 
discontinued, participants will continue to be followed through  the 24-week mail-in 
assessment (or early termination visit) to collect outcomes data, provided that the participant 
is willing and the principal investigator (with input from the DSM, if appropriate) judges that it is safe and feasible to do so. If follow-up assessments are con tinued, no modifications to the 
schedule of follow-up assessments will be made unless necessary  to protect the safety of 
participants or to accommodate limitations in function resultin g from an adverse event. 
Follow-up assessments in participants who have discontinued the therapeutic interventions will not include continue evaluation of adherence to group clas ses or home practice, 
assessment of yoga posture or practice adherence self-efficacy, or independent evaluation of participants’ success in performing yoga postures. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.[ADDRESS_769449] Guidelines and Consi derations 32 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  not be powered to prove or disprove any scientific hypotheses, it will provide a 
means of testing and refining procedures for a future full-scale parallel-group 
superiority trial to determine the efficacy of the therapeutic yoga intervention for 
improving urinary incontinence in middle-aged and older women.   
To control for the time and attention that participants will spend on group classes and 
home practice, a physical conditi oning exercise program has bee n selected as an 
active behavioral control intervention for this trial. Although  this control program may 
offer non-specific benefits for participants’ overall health, t he investigators believe 
that it is unlikely to substantially improve women’s incontinen ce. Inclusion of the 
physical conditioning program will also minimize differential expectations of treatment benefit between the two groups, in an effort to promote equal adherence to study interventions and visits in both groups.

yoga therapy. 
 
9.3       Intervention Assignment Procedures 
Randomization to the yoga therapy  or physical conditioning cont rol group will be 
performed by [CONTACT_183560], with proof of eligibility required before assignment.  
Randomization will be implemented using randomly permuted block s of sizes 2 and 
4, and will also be stratified by [CONTACT_183524] (i.e., stress, urgency, or 
mixed), to ensure adequacy of randomization within types. To av oid manipulation, 
standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed.
[ADDRESS_769451] the next 
numbered envelope to determine group assignment. All envelopes will be retained 
for review; randomization dates and times should follow the ord er of the sequence 
numbers, providing a check on validity.  Although participants cannot be blinded to 
treatment assignment (due to the behavioral nature of the inter vention), diary and 
questionnaire data used to evaluate the primary and secondary e fficacy outcomes 
will be abstracted by [CONTACT_183544].  
9.[ADDRESS_769452].  The 
study team will also track the success rate of various recruitment approaches (fliers, 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 33 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  print notices, newspaper ads, etc.) and monitor the costs of re cruitment per 
participant in order to guide future recruitment efforts.  The investigators plan to 
recruit and randomize [ADDRESS_769453]-treatment follow-up perio d of the trial.  Drop-
out rates in both treatment groups are expected to increase ove r time (i.e., to be 
greater at 12 weeks than at 8 weeks or 4 weeks), but remain wit hin acceptable 
parameters at [ADDRESS_769454] explorator y pooled logistic 
regression analyses to identify participant characteristics associated with drop-out.   
The following parameters will be used to measure the adequacy of retention: 
 During the 12-week intervention [ADDRESS_769455]-intervention

Expected < 15% < 25% 
Acceptable < 20% < 30%

the recommended group classes as well as 75%, 80%, and 90% of the 
recommended home practice hours during the 12-week treatment pe riod.  During the 
12-week post-treatment follow-up period, the study team will al so track the number 
and percentage of participants who complete 25%, 50%, and 75% o f recommended 
home practice hours; however, it should be noted that the study intervention is 
designed to be a self-contained 12-week intervention, in which sustained practice of 
yoga therapy or stretching/ strengthening exercises after the e nd of classes is 
encouraged but not considered mandatory.  If appropriate, explo ratory regression 
analyses will be used to identify participant characteristics a ssociated with 
adherence to group classes and home practice. 
The following parameters will be used to measure the adequacy o f adherence: 
 Attendance at group 
sessions during the 
12-week intervention Completion of home practice hours during the 12-week intervention Completion of home practice hours post-intervention*

  9.6 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183497]/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183498] : As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_585164], no formal 
interim analyses to evaluate efficacy will be performed. Given the short duration of 
treatment and small size of the study, the investigators believ e that there is no 
scientific or ethical reason to stop the trial early or alter the trial design if treatment appears to be more effective than expected. Thus, as long as no  safety issues arise, 
the trial will not be stopped or altered if the therapeutic intervention appears unexpectedly effective.  
Interim analyses and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183499] : Although this study involves a low-impact 
behavioral intervention that is not expected to pose a signific ant risk to participant 
safety, consideration may be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585165] t group that may 
endanger the safety of participants. These may take the form of  SAEs or non-serious 
AEs posing a substantial safety risk and warranting early termination of the trial. If 
evidence of adverse effects emerges, the investigators in consu ltation with the DSM 
may determine that these side effects are minor and the study c an continue as 
planned, or may decide to alter or stop the study to prevent th ese side effects. 
Because the sample is small, and preservation of the nominal type-I error rate is less 
important for safety than for efficacy, no formal interim analy sis procedures are 
proposed. 
Interim analyses and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589] : Consideration may be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183501]. For examp le, consideration 
will be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585166] 30% below planned rates and/or timely follow-up (i.e., completion of study visits within recommended windows) falls below 70%.
 
9.[ADDRESS_769458]-treatment follow-u p period.  
Drop-out rates in both treatment groups are expected to increas e over time 
(i.e., to be greater at 12 weeks than at 8 weeks), but remain  less than 20% 
after 12 weeks of treatment and less than 30% at [ADDRESS_769459] Guidelines and Consi derations 35 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  hypotheses regarding efficacy, preliminary data will be gathered to guide 
planning on a future full-scale trial in which the primary efficacy outcome will 
be change in the average frequency of urinary incontinence based on a 
validated 3-day symptom diary.  To that end, frequency of incon tinence will 
be assessed based on voiding diaries completed at screening/bas eline, 8 
weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 weeks after the completion o f the yoga 
therapy or physical conditioning programs.  The total number of  any, stress-
type, and urgency-type incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_585167]. 
9.7.3 Secondary Efficacy Outcomes   
Preliminary data will also be gathered to guide planning for a future full-scale 
trial evaluating secondary efficacy outcomes such as change in other symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinence.  To that 
end, changes in anxiety and perceived stress symptoms and incon tinence-
related quality of life will be assessed using validated questi onnaires 
completed at screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 
weeks after the completion of yoga therapy or physical conditio ning 
programs.  
9.8 Data Analyses  
To address aim 1 (feasibility), descriptive statistical techniques will be used to describe rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, and ad herence for each 
recruitment wave.  If drop-out is substantial, we will conduct exploratory pooled 
logistic regression analyses to try to identify participant cha racteristics associated 
with drop-out. Similarly, if adherence is less than expected, we will use linear, 
logistic, and/or proportional odds models, depending on the distribution of the 
outcome, to explore associations of participant characteristics  with levels of 
adherence both to classes and home practice.  To address aim 2 (preliminary efficacy for change in incontinen ce frequency), we will 
use linear mixed models with unstructured residual covariance matrix to conduct a preliminary analysis of the 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_769460] deviation, intra-class correlation, and fitted between-group differences at each follow-up time point. To assess trends and 
persistence, we will compare estimated between-group differences across weeks.  
All estimates will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. 
 The methods specified for aim 2 will also be used for aim 3 (preliminary efficacy for secondary symptom and quality-of-life outcomes).  Outcomes will  be normalized as 
necessary before analysis, and checked for equal variance acros s group and 
visit.  In previous studies, changes in incontinence frequency and in other symptom 
and quality-of-life scores have been approximately normally dis tributed. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 36 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Study data will be obtained from participant-completed symptom diaries and logs, 
participant- or interviewer-administered questionnaires, physical examination and 
performance measures, and urine sampling/testing. Forms for rec ording or 
abstracting data will be developed specifically for this study, including: 
- Voiding diary abstraction form: After participants complete t heir 3-day voiding 
diary at home, they will return the completed diary to the stud y clinic, and diary 
data will be abstracted using a Voiding Diary Abstraction Form. At the Baseline 
Visit, a clinical coordinator will abstract diary data for eligibility assessment purposes; at all post-randomization follow-up assessments, an analyst who is blinded to intervention assignment will abstract diary data. 
- Questionnaires assessing anxiety and perceived stress, condit ion-specific quality 
of life, and participant satisfaction:  These questionnaire for ms will be completed 
by [CONTACT_183569] a clinical 
coordinator, or completed by [CONTACT_183570] (in the case of the [ADDRESS_769461]-treatment assessm ent). 
Questionnaire data collected after randomization will be entere d into the 
electronic database by [CONTACT_585200] n assignment. 
- Questionnaires assessing demographic history, general medical and 
urologic/urogynecologic history, medication use, tobacco and al cohol use, and 
physical activity and function: These questionnaires will be ad ministered by a 
clinical coordinator during in-person study visits, and data fr om questionnaires 
will subsequently be entered by [CONTACT_585201]. 
Because these data will not be used to assess efficacy outcomes, the coordinators who administer and entering data from these forms will not necessarily be blinded to intervention assignment. 
- Physical examination, physical performance testing, and urine  testing data forms: 
Clinical coordinators will record the results of height and wei ght measurements, 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements, physical performanc e testing, and 
urine dipstick and pregnancy testing on study-specific forms, and data from these forms will then be entered by [CONTACT_585202]. Because 
these data will not be used to assess any efficacy outcomes, th e coordinators 
who are responsible for collecting, recording, and entering the se data will not 
necessarily be blinded to intervention assignment. 
10.2 Data Management  
Data will be entered, managed, and edited using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, web-based application developed by a multi-institutional consortium initiated at Vanderbilt University to support data c apture for research 
studies. Data can be entered from any location with secure web authentication, data 
logging, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.  REDCap offers advanced 
features including auto-validation, branching logic, stop actio ns, data import 
functions, and data comparison functions. The REDCap system com plies with 
HIPAA regulations, data will be stored on HIPAA compliant serve s, protected by 
[CONTACT_112331]. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations [ADDRESS_769462] directors, and clinical coordinators  involved in the 
study will complete training in Human Subjects Research offered  by [CONTACT_585203] (CITI), which includes specific 
training modules on assessing risk to subjects, avoiding group harms, 
conflicts of interest, cultural competence, FDA-regulated resea rch, HIPAA-
regulated research, informed consent, IRB member responsibiliti es, IRB chair 
responsibilities, records-based research, research with vulnera ble subjects, 
and unanticipated problems and reporting.  All investigators, project directors, and coordinators will maintain active CITI certification for the duration of the study. 
Coordinators and analysts involved in data collection will also  attend a study-
specific training meeting led by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_585168].  At a minimum, the 
training meeting will include: (1) an introduction to the goals, design, and 
procedures of the LILA study; (2) an overview of goals, structu re, and 
procedures for administering and abstracting data from the voiding diary and other study-specific data collection measures; (3) a review of definitions and procedures for assessing, documenting, and reporting adverse ev ents.   
Coordinators and analysts will also receive training and undergo supervised practice in reviewing and abstracting data from the voiding dia ry as the 
primary efficacy measure in the trial. They will also receive training and undergo supervised practice performing measurements of blood pr essure 
and heart rate and assessing physical function/performance meas ures.  
Following the training, clinical staff will be certified for pe rforming these 
functions.
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_769463] data on primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (i.e., voiding diary 
abstraction forms, questionnaires addressing anxiety and percei ved stress 
and condition-specific quality of life) will be verified against paper-based source forms by a staff member who was not involved in entering the data.  Quality of data entry will be periodically assessed using measu res such as 
number of missing forms, number of missing queries, and proport ion of all 
study variables queried. The results of assessment of data quality will be incorporated into study progress reports for scheduled DSM meet ings.  
10.3.3 Protocol Deviations 
Exceptions to the protocol are expected to occur rarely or not at all and, 
where possible, will be approved in advance by [CONTACT_585204]. 
Protocol exceptions may occur for the following reasons: 
• exceptions necessary to protect the safety or well-being of a  participant 
(in this case, the protocol exception should apply to that part icipant only) 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 38 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  • exceptions due to oversight or error on the part of study sta ff, which are 
subsequently detected by [CONTACT_473], project managers, c linical 
coordinators, or data analysts. 
 
For each protocol exception, study staff will document the exce ption on a 
Protocol Exceptions Log (located in the Regulatory Binder). Entries in the 
Protocol Exceptions Log should include the participant ID, date of the exception, date exception is being recorded, description of exc eption, and 
action taken in response to the exception, if any. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_585169] , or 
acknowledgement for each exception detected after the fact.   For this study, missed yoga therapy or physical conditioning cl asses will not 
be considered a protocol deviation, and neither will failure to  complete 
recommended home practice sessions, although study staff will m ake every 
effort to promote adherence to classes and home practice (see section 5.4). 
10.3.4 Monitoring 
If desired by [CONTACT_36164], the study t eam will undergo on-site monitoring by [CONTACT_585205] (e.g., Westat). Site monitoring visits may include review of participant 
records, informed consent forms, source data collection forms, and the 
electronic study database. The schedule of site monitoring will  be agreed 
upon in advance by [CONTACT_36164], the principal investigator, and the i ndependent 
monitoring organization. The principal investigator, project manager, and study coordinators will be available to meet in person with the  independent 
monitor and provide access to all study-specific forms, materials, and databases. 
11. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.[ADDRESS_769464] (IRB) Review  
The study protocol, informed consent document, data and safety monitoring plan, 
and data collection forms will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_585206]. Any subsequent modification s to these 
documents will also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_585207]. 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms 
A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant at  the Screening Visit 
before in-person data collection procedures are initiated (see section 6.2.2. for description of informed consent procedures). A copy of the consent form will be given to each participant, and documentation of signed consent will be filed in the 
participant’s study file.  The template for the form is attache d as Appendix A. 
11.[ADDRESS_769465] Guidelines and Consi derations 39 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  The document linking study ID to participant identifiers (name, address, contact 
[CONTACT_137385]) will be maintained in a password-protected file stored on a 
secure server protected by [CONTACT_112331]. Only the clinical coordinators or study

  Page [ADDRESS_545698] a greater incidence of dry eye pathology – specifically, 
greater tear instability and corneal staining as well as decreased tear volumes.v  
There is emerging evidence demonstrating  that the predominance of dry eye is 
evaporative in naturevi—the major cause being meibomian gland dysfunction 
(MGD).vii Eye rubbing, family history of keratoconus, allergy, asthma, and 
eczema have been demonstrated to be important risk factors according to the 
most recent systematic review and meta -analysis.v 
Ocul ar allergy can alter the dry eye disease cycle including tear film 
instability, ocular surface inflammation and neurosensory abnormalities. The 
TFOS DEWS II Report has included allergic conjunctivitis among one of the 
likely risk factors for dry eye diseas e. Both allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye are 
associated with inflammation. Inflammation may be present before the clinical 
signs of dry eye, contributing to increased corneal desquamation and corneal 
surface irregularity.   
Steroids play an important rol e in in the treatment of both allergic 
conjunctivitis and dry eye diseas e. The anti -inflammatory properties of 
dexamethasone and other synthetic glucocorticoids can benefit the status of dry 
eye and allergic conjunctivitis  via modification of a wide variet y of immune 
functions.viii The immune -modifying properties of dexamethasone can improve 
dry eye  and allergy  status not only by [CONTACT_431369] a result of the initiated immunological priming, but also by 
[CONTACT_431370] .

question: Does the use of a physician administered intracanalicular

 CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.1  Rationale for Study Design  
This prospective study will use a fellow -eye design for 20 particip ants (40 
eyes) with bilateral keratoconus, wearing RGP  contact [CONTACT_66225] , who 
have been diagnosed with bilateral allergic conjunctivitis and underlying dry eye 
disease . Per participant, one eye will be randomized to receive the intracanalicular 
dexamethasone insert  at the baseline visit (study eye), while the other eye will be 
assigned to receive the standard of care topi[INVESTIGATOR_431353] 
0.38%  (control eye). Thus, for every eye in the study  group, there will be a paired 
eye with similar baseline characteristics in the control group sourced from the 
same participant. The fellow -eye design allows for greater control of pote ntial 
confounders tied to participants ’ systemic and ocular health.

5.2.2  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients  on the study schedule.  Unscheduled 
visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laborato ry results, 
for follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted.  
 
5.2.3  Adverse Event Information Collection  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur during the study  
The definition of an AE and SAE, and information on the determination of severity 
and relationship to treatment are provided in Section 6.  
5.3 Rescue Criteria  
Patients can be resc ued at any time at the discretion of the investigator  with 
loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38% . Rescue criteria includes:  
• A score greater than or equal to 2+ in one or more of the following 
categories:  
o Itching  
o Papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]  
o Injection  
o Staining  
6. SAFETY DEFINITIONS , REPORTING , AND MONITORING  
6.[ADDRESS_545709] a causal relationship with the study drug.  
Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and un intended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally associated with the 
use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.   
 
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significa nt change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally 
associated with the use of the study drug.

 CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be 
completely unrelated to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a patient  is a 
passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE 
that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_108180].  In -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431361] a

a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_31598].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an  important medical event – Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may 
jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other 
serious outcomes listed above (e.g., int ensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse).  Any malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancers) would be 
considered a medically important event.  
 
6.2 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded only if they are medically relevant.  
 
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study insert will be 
reported to Ocular Therapeutix.  
To report an SAE, Ocular Therapeutix will be contact[CONTACT_308846]:  
[EMAIL_8231]  
SAE hotline: 844 -668-3948  
 
The investigator will promptly report to the IRB all  unanticipated problems 
involving risks to patient s.  This includes death from any cause and all SAEs 
related to the use of the study insert.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, 
regardless of assessed causality.

If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit 
assessment, the ICF will be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study 
patient s will be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original signe d revised ICF 
will be maintained in the patient ’s study record and a copy will be given to the 
patient . 
 
7.3 Patient  Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator will take all appropriate measures to ensure that the 
anonymity of each study patient  will be maintained.   
 
The patient ’s and investigator’s personal data will be treated in compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations.

An appropriately constituted IRB, as described in ICH Guidelines for GCP, will 
review and approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patient s 
(e.g. advertising) before any patient  may be enrolled in the s tudy  
The HARTHAN Study (V1)  
  Page 17 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before 
implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to the patient s, in which case the IRB will be informed as soon as 
possible  
 
Ongoing studies will be re viewed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC on an annual basis or at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of risk.  
 
In addition, the IRB will be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of 
patient s or the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
 
A copy of the IRB appro val letter will be sent to Ocular Therapeutix prior to 
shipment of drug insert supplies to the investigator.  The approval letter will 
include the study title, the documents reviewed, and the date of the review.  
 
Records of the IRB review and approval of a ll study documents (including 
approval of ongoing studies) will be kept on file by [CONTACT_093].

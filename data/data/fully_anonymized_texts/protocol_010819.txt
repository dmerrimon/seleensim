Protocol #:  15-[ADDRESS_732459] Title:  Insular inhibitory neuromodulation to reduce cigarette craving 
and alter brain function in smokers     
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_68020] F. Regner, MD  
Version Date:  Version 3 ( August 22, 2018)       
 
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims 
 
The central hypothesis is that inhibitory insular TMS can be used to provide a non- invasive 
intervention to decr ease nicotine craving, alter resting state brain connectivity, and reduce craving -
associated insular activity in smokers. All experiments will be conducted in treatment -seeking 
smokers. These experiments are designed to evaluate the efficacy of insular neu romodulation 
using rTMS. Outcome measures include (1) cigarette craving measures, (2) resting- state fMRI 
connectivity measures, and (3) tasked- based fMRI insular activity  measures. In a double- blinded 
two-arm (sham rTMS and inhibitory insular rTMS) randomized control trial with [ADDRESS_732460] craving measurements, resting state fMRI, and task -based 
fMRI before and after a single session of rTMS treatment to investigate the following aims:  
 
AIM 1. Determine if insular rTMS r educes cigarette craving.  
H1 Compared to sham, insular rTMS will reduce craving in response to cigarette cues.  
 AIM 2. Determine if insular rTMS alters insular connectivity.  
H2 Compared to sham, insular rTMS will reduce fMRI connectivity between the insula and 
brain regions associated with executive control, reward, and habit formation.  
 AIM 3. Determine if insular rTMS alters insular activity.  
H3 Compared to sham, insular rTMS will reduce fMRI insular activity  associated with 
cigarette cues.  
 
 
II. Background and Significance 
 Nicotine dependence is a major health problem:  Smoking is the single greatest preventable 
cause of mortality, morbidity, and unnecessary health care costs in the US .
1 It is estimated to 
cause 443,595 deaths annually and $193 billion per year in smoking- related health care costs and 
productivity losses.1 Globally, tobacco results in over 6 million annual deaths and over half a trillion 
dollars in economic damage.2 
 
Current treatments of nicotine dependence are inadequate: Nicotine dependence is notoriously 
difficult to treat, with relapse rates approximately 85% for counseling therapy and 78% for 
combined counseling and pharmacologic therapy.3 Long -term abstinence from smoking is 
uncommon, with 6 month abstinence rates ranging between 19% and 33%.[ADDRESS_732461] been repeatedly shown to be associated with high relapse rates.5–7 Development of novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_557813], decrease healthcare costs, 
and prolong lives.

 The insula plays a key role in nicotine dependence: The insula is involved in interoception and 
salience.  It integrates external information about stimuli and internal sensations including cognitive, 
homeostatic, and emotional states, to guide behavior.[ADDRESS_732462] on food behaviors.19 Results of bilateral 
insular  deep brain stimulation lesions in animal models are also consistent with this hypothesis.20 
Given this evidence, inhibiting the anterior insula may be a useful strategy to reduce cigarette 
craving, as will be studied in Aim #1 . 
Sutherland et al.21 recently proposed an elegant explanatory “toggle” hypothesis, applying the 
work by [CONTACT_557821].22 to nicotine dependence. Briefly, the hypothesis centers upon the salience 
network, comprised of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex.  The insula is believed to “toggle” 
this network, directing brain function towards endogenous (i.e., default mode network) or exogenous (i.e., executive control network) stimuli. This insular function becomes usurped in nicotine addiction. The concept that  the insula directs consciousness towards the most 
homeostatically relevant stimuli – internal or external – provides a neurobiological model to explain 
the cognitive deficits and functional connectivity findings of acute nicotine ingestion, nicotine satiety 
in dependence, and nicotine withdrawal.
21 It also provides a mechanism for the findings of 
spontaneous smoking cessation in patients with insular lesions. Importantly, the model affords the 
opportunity to investigate non- invasive perturbation of specific nodes (e.g., insular cortex) to reduce 
craving and hopefully improve abstinence rates. We plan to study this functional perturbation in Aim #2  and Aim #3 . 
 
Neuromodulation in nicotine dependence shows promising results:  Repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non- invasive neuromodulatory technique in which a pulsatile 
magnetic field is created using an external solenoid to induce targeted depolarization of cortical 
neurons via electromagnetic induction. High frequency rTMS (> 3 Hz) transiently increases cortical excitability, while low frequency rTMS (1 Hz) reduces it.
23–25 TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (DLPFC) has demonstrated good test -retest r eliability in  fMRI connectivity.[ADDRESS_732463] reported that excitatory rTMS targeting the DLPFC reduces cigarette 
craving and cigarette consumption.27–[ADDRESS_732464] demonstrated that a single session 
of excitatory  DLPFC  rTMS causes short -term reduction of cigarette craving,30,31 cigarette 
consumption,32 cocaine craving,33 and craving induced by [CONTACT_557822].34,35 These findings are 
consistent with the salience “toggling” hypothesis. Prefrontal cortex exerts top- down control to bias 
information in lower -level somatosensory cortices towards relevant input36,[ADDRESS_732465] from endogeno us stimuli such as craving.  
While previous work has reported that TMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
modulates craving responses;28,29 human stroke and animal model literature suggests that the 
Protocol Template Page 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 insula may be more important in “toggling” away from DMN and toward ECN . To date only one 
paper describes rTMS specifically targeting the insula:  a study of seven patients, reporting 
subjective changes in cold perception and tolerance of the intervention.[ADDRESS_732466] experts in this field 
acknowledge the critical role of the insula in nicotine dependence, there has been surprisingly little 
research exploring neuromodulation of the insula as a potential therapy.   
This proposal seeks to answer several questions: (1) Can inhibitory TMS be used to reduce 
cigarette craving in smokers? (2) Can inhibitory insular TMS alter insular connectivity and a ctivity? 
And, (3) does inhibitory insular TMS alter brain- behavior relationships? T he literature implicating 
the insula in maintenance of craving in smokers suggest  rTMS targeting the insula may provide a 
more robust modulation of nicotine craving.  
 
 
III. Preli minary Studies/Progress Report   
 Preliminary study of TMS targeting the 
insula:  We measured resting- state fMRI 
connectivity in a healthy subject before 
and after inhibitory (1 Hz) targeting the 
anterior left insula (MNI coordinates: [ -32, 
18, 4])
9 at 80% motor threshold using a 
custom manufactured  MagStim H -coil for 
deeper targeting and Brainsight frameless 
stereotactic TMS localization ( Figure 1). 
This approach is identical to the proposed 
neuromodulation. The subject underwent 
a 6 minute resting state fMRI (RS -fMRI) 
exam with eyes closed  prior to 
stimulation . The subject exited the 
magnet and was treated with a [ADDRESS_732467] preprocessing, a 5mm radius 
spherical ROI was centered at the TMS 
target coordinates, and connectivity measures with all other voxels in the 
brain were calculated. Results were 
thresholded at family -wise p<0.05 using with a voxel -level p<0.005 and a voxel cluster correction 
q>23. Results showed post -treatment increased insular connectivity to DMN regions (cingulate 
cortex and bilateral parietal lobes), middle temporal cortex, and inferior frontal cortex. Decreased insular connectivity was observed in amygdala, hippocampus, and dorsal attention areas. These 
results are consistent with our hypotheses and demonstrate (1) we are able to successfully 
administer TMS and measure fMRI connectivity changes, and (2) proof -of-feasibility that TMS 
targeting the insula can modulate neural functional connectivity in the resting state.

connectivity after inhibitory rTMS applied to a single

Figure 3. Neuronal response (n=25) to visual 
stimuli of foods of high hedonic value as 
compared to non -food stimuli, demonstrating 
robus t cue- induced activation in the insulae.  Preliminary study of functional connectivity changes in substance dependence:  As part of 
[CONTACT_557840]’s ( faculty  sponsor) research on long term abstinent substance dependent individuals 
(SDI), I investigated RS -fMRI network connectivity between substance dependent individuals (SDI) 
and healthy controls (Figure 2). These SDI are unique in that they had prolonged remission of >[ADDRESS_732468] resting- state networks were analyzed using Granger causality. Compared to controls, SDI 
showed greater Granger causal connectivity from right executive control network (RECN)  to dorsal 
default mode network (dDMN)  and from dDMN to basal ganglia network (BGN). Interestingly, the 
insula was incorporated in the BGN networks. We concluded that directed effective connectivity 
from the RECN to dDMN and dDMN to BGN in long term abstinent SDI may reflect higher top-
down control from structures involved in executive function and behavioral monitoring over those 
involved in self -referential thought and reward. I presented these data at the International 
Neuropsychological Society [ADDRESS_732469] RS -
fMRI network connectivity analyses which we plan to implement in secondary analyses, in addition 
to the primary seed -based methods shown above (Figure 2 ). 
 
Preliminary study of neuronal response to 
appetitive food cues compared to neutral cues 
(Tregellas et al. 2013):  [CONTACT_557841] (co- sponsor) 
has extensive experience measuring the neuronal 
response to visual stimuli of foods of high hedonic 
value as compared to non- food stimuli,[ADDRESS_732470] cue- induced activation in the 
insulae ( Figure 3 ). I p lan to use an identical visual 
cue paradigm, but will replace the food -cue images 
with images from the international smoking image series.

 IV. Research Methods 
 
A.  Outcome Measure(s): Outcome measures  will include (1) cigarette craving measures, (2) 
resting -state fMRI connectivity measures, and (3) tasked -based fMRI insular activity measures.  
 
A.1 Neuropsychological Testing: Our primary cognitive outcome will be the change after treatment 
compared to before treatment  in the Questionnai re of Smoking Urges – Brief Version (QSU -brief) , 
a measures craving. An additional important question is whether craving, smoking history, smoking 
characteristics, or personality traits are associated with specific changes in connectivity after 
treatment.  Thus, w e will perform the following assessments prior to treatment: (1) smoking history 
questionnaire, (2) Fagerstrom nicotine dependence scale (FNDS) , (3) Wisconsin inventory of 
smoking dependence motives (WISDM -68), (4) behavioral inhibitory scale and b ehavioral 
activation scale (BIS/BAS), (5) Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS- 11). The QSU- brief will be 
administered before and after treatment.   A visual analog scale will be used to quickly assess 
subjects’ craving during the craving visual -cue task : 
 
 
 The craving data before and after treatment will be used to investigate Aim #1 . 
 
A.2.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging. All MRI scans will be acquired using a 3.0 T Seimens Skyra 
MR system using a 20- channel head -neck coil.  High-resolution 3D T1- weighted scans will be 
acquired before treatment for image registration and normalization.  T2* weighted echo- planar 
imaging blood oxygen level dependent fMRI will be acquired with 3.4 x 3.4 x 3.4 mm voxels, TR 2100 ms, TE 30  ms, and flip angle 70°. Two fMRI sequences  will be acquired before and after 
treatment: (1) a 10 minute RS -fMRI, in which subjects will be asked to lie quietly in the scanner and 
not think of anything in particular; and, (2) a 15 minute task -based fMRI exam during a cigarette 
craving cue task.  fMRI dat a will be processed and analyzed as described in the methods section 
(see C.4 through C.8).  Briefly, outcome measures will include insular functional connectivity (see 
Aim #2 ) and insular activity (see Aim #3 ) changes at the whole brain level after treatm ent 
compared to before treatment .

Total:  [ADDRESS_732474] a breath CO<10pp. Clinical assessment including a brief medical and psychiatric 
interview will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Regner to determine eligibility. Subjects will undergo a brief (10 minute) neurological examination. Subjects will be educated on TMS and MR safety and will demonst rate their understanding.  
 
C.2 Demographic, Psychological, Smoking, and Craving Assessments: Subjects will complete a 
basic demographic survey to document the date of birth, sex, ethnicity, education, handedness, and use of glasses.  Age and sex must be determined because gray matter characteristics and 
brain function vary by [CONTACT_654]. Education and handedness must  be documented because brain 
function is affected by [CONTACT_163669].  The use of glasses must be documented because if 
subjects are unable to see the images during the craving cue task, it can introduce a bias in the data.  
Medical history, current medications, and surgical/procedural history will be documented.  [CONTACT_557844] will review this information to ensure that the subject meets no exclusion criteria, and to ensure that the subject is taking no medications that lower the seizure threshold.  
Subjects will complete a brief smoking history questionnaire.  This will characterize the severity 
and nature of the subject’s cigarette dependence, which may affect their responses to craving cues.  
Subjects will complete the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Scale (FNDS).  This is a valid and 
reliable standardized survey to quantify the degree of cigarette dependence.
46,47 
Subjects will complete the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM -68).  
This is a valid and reliable 68- item standardized survey designed to characterize the psychological 
constructs that motive an individual subject’s smoking behaviors.48 
Subjects will complete the Questionnaire on Smoking Urges – Brief (QSU -Brief).  This is a v alid 
and reliable standardized survey to quantify a subject’s current intensity of craving.49  This is the 
only standardized survey that in addition to being administered prior to rTMS treatment  will also be 
administered after rTMS treatment.  
Subjects will complete the Behavioral Inhibition Scale and Behavioral Activation Scale 
(BIS/BAS).  The Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Scale is a 20 -item self -reported questionnaire 
Protocol Template Page 8 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_732475] component is the 
Behavioral Inhibition Scale, which is used to quantify avoidance behaviors and reactions to the 
anticipation of punishment.  The second component is the Behavioral Activation Scale, which is used to quantify positive affective and approach response tendencies to appetitive stimuli.  
Lastly, subjects will complete the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, version 11 (BIS -11).  This is a 
30-item self -reported questionnaire used to measure impulsivity; subjects rated whether phrases 
and words describing aspects of impulsivity are self -descriptive.
52 
 
C.2 MRI scan acquisitio n parameters:  Prior to the MRI scan, subjects will be asked to complete the 
standard UC Denver Brain Imaging Center MRI Research Subject Screening Form  to ensure they 
are safe to be scanned. Before and after rTMS, RS -fMRI and task -based fMRI examinations will be 
performed. This is a required component of any MRI examination. All scans will be performed on a 
research -dedicated 3.0 T Seimens Skyra MR system using a 20- channel head- neck coil. A VacFix 
head -confirming vacuum cushion will mitigate effects of head motion. High -resolution 3D T1-
weighted scans will be acquired before treatment for image registration and normalization. Linear 
and second order shimming will be performed to reduce static field inhomogeneities at the skull 
base prior to fMRI scans. T2* weighted echo- planar imaging blood oxygen level dependent fMRI 
will be acquired with 3.4 x 3.4 x 3.4 mm voxels, TR 2100ms, TE 30ms, and flip angle 70°. Two 
fMRI exams will be acquired before and after treatment: (1) a 10 minute RS -fMRI, in which subjects 
will be asked to lay quietly in the scanner and not think of anything in particular; and, (2) a 15 
minute task -based fMRI exam during a cigarette craving cue task.  
 
C.3 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS):  Before and after rTMS, 1H- MRS examinations 
will be performed to quantify GABA, Glutamate, and Glutamine levels in the insula. 1H-MRS 
sequences will be used, as previously reported and used by [CONTACT_557824].53 This MR sequence will be used for exploratory analysis.  
 
C.3 rTMS Treatment:  Subjects in 
the insular rTMS treatment arm will undergo a single 25 minute train of 
1Hz rTMS targeting the right  
anterior insula
16,17,54 (MNI 
coordinates: [32, 18, 4])9 at 90% 
motor threshold using the commercially available MagStim 
Rapid2 coil  and Brainsight 
frameless stereotactic TMS 
localization syst em. Subjects in the 
sham rTMS treatment arm will have a sham coil placed in the same position. The sham coil 
creates sound, vibrations, and electrical stimulation similar to the active coil.
55  Subjects will 
undergo a brief (10 minute) neurological examination by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Regner before and after rTMS 
treatment , which will include examination of the motor, sensory, language, abstract -thinking, 
memory, and spatial reasoning systems .

C.4 Comparison of craving responses to treatment:  QSU  and visual -analogue craving measures  
will be compared using a multivariate analysis of covariance (see C.4.1.1). These comparisons will 
provide results for Aim #1 . 
 
C.5 Image preprocessing:  Raw BOLD data will be pre- processed using SPM8 (website: 
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. uk). After discarding the first four volumes for saturation effects, motion 
correction will be applied with a 3D rigid body transformation. Subjects with head movement >2mm 
will be excluded. fMRI images will be spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 
space by [CONTACT_557826]’s fMRI images to their high resolution T1W scan, which will be 
registered to MNI space using the DARTEL method.56 Registered fMRI images will be spatially 
smoothed using a 4mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. Band -pass filtering (0.01Hz –0.08Hz) will 
be applied to reduce effects of low frequency drift and high-frequency physiologic noise. fMRI data will be corrected for movement parameters (3 rotational and 3 translational variables) as well as 
global, CSF, and white matter signal fluctuations.

C.6 Seed Based Insular Functional Connectivity:  Using customized MATLAB scripts, whole brain 
voxel -wise connectivity maps will be calculated according to Margulies et al.[ADDRESS_732477]’s resultant whole- brain insular connectivity maps to investigate individual 
brain connectivity differences associated with treatment. Treatment and group comparisons will be 
performed using ANCOVA. These comparisons will provide results for Aim #2 . 
 
C.7 Craving cue task -based insular activity:  After resting state fMRI examinations, all subjects will 
perform smoking cue/neutral cue craving tasks during a [ADDRESS_732478] of pseudorandom presentations of different smoki ng-
related and food- related images. Between images, participants will be asked to fixate on a cross 
image for variable duration of time to introduce jitter into the design and improve fit of the 
generalized linear model (GLM).  
Task -based fMRI exams will be p reprocessed as above. Data will be modeled in SPM8 using a 
GLM with customized square waveforms representing the condition (i.e., cigarette versus neutral 
stimulus) and duration of stimulus convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. 
Protocol Template Page 10 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_732479] maps of smoking>neutral cues will be analyzed using second -level random -effects to 
compare these contrasts within and between treatment groups using ANCOVA. Two separate task -
based analyses will be performed: (1) insular ROI analyses by [CONTACT_557827] a 5mm radius sphere centered at the insular TMS target, and (2) whole brain analysis. 
Both analyses will control for multiple comparisons using cluster- based correction for family -wise 
error p<0.05. These comparisons will pro vide results for Aim #3 . 
 
C.8 Resting state network analysis (secondary):  One inherent limitation of the seed- based 
connectivity approach is that the resultant connectivity maps are highly dependent upon ROI 
selection. To circumvent the potential interference caused by [CONTACT_557828], secondary 
investigation of the functional connectome will be performed using group independent component 
analysis59 to make inferences using the GIFT toolbox ( http://icatb.sourceforge.net ) and using the 
same method and analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_557815]. Resultant resting state network 
connectivity maps will be compared by [CONTACT_557829], default mode, and executive control networks.  
 
C.9 Brain -behavior relationships (s econdary):  Secondary analysis of brain -behavior relationships 
will be conducted using a GLM in SPM8 by [CONTACT_557830] (see C.3.6) 
against craving and dependence measures. This will characterize the relationship between 
behavio r (Aim #1 ) and brain function (insular connectivity [ Aim #2 ] and activity [ Aim #3 ]). 
 
C.10 Relative concentrations of GABA, glutamate, and glutamine after rTMS (exploratory):   
Exploratory analysis of the changes in GABA, glutamate, and glutamine concentrat ions induced by 
[CONTACT_557831].  
  
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools:  
 
Risks Associated with TMS  
1. Headaches (common).   The risk of headaches or scalp discomfort is approximately 10%.  
This discomfort is self- limited and responds to over the counter analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or acetaminophen).  
2. Seizures (rare) . When used within parameters set by [CONTACT_557832], the 
risk of seizu res is less than [ADDRESS_732480] been self -limited.  The 
lifetime incidence of seizures in the US population is 10%.  Isolated self -limited seizures do 
not cause brain injury or other adverse effects to the subject, are painless, and do not have 
known adverse effects on health.  There have been no reported cases of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (uncontrollable seizure which can be disabling or life-threatening) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (recurrent, unprovoked seizures) following TMS.  When evaluating subject risk per the standardized 
COMIRB review procedure for TMS studies, studies with a low (<1%) risk of a single self -
limited seizure should not be considered a serious risk to the health of a subject.  In 
addition, according to the COMIRB Guidelines for TMS Protocol Evaluation, studies with 
stimulation parameters within the Wasserman criteria
60 and low frequency (≤1 Hz)45 are 
likely safe without need for IDE or further FDA evaluation.  Because this study will use a 
low frequency single train  rTMS (1 Hz) within Wasserman criteria, ensure adequate 
hearing protection, administer neurological examinations before and after rTMS treatment, 
and monitor subjects by a medical doctor ([CONTACT_557843]) during and for at least 60 minutes after rTMS treatment, we do not feel  that an FDA IDE is required.  This opi[INVESTIGATOR_557816] (our 
decision pathway is highlighted in blue):

CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_732481]’s participation and for 60 minutes after 
the completion of the TMS treatment  (during MRI scans). He will monitor for signs of 
seizure or muscle twitching.  [CONTACT_557843]  is a physician  trained in seizure management and 
will have ready access to life- support equipment (oxygen, suction, blood pressure 
monitoring, CPR equipment) and antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] . 
3. Hearing loss (rare) . The risk of hearing loss is well below 1 in 10,000 and appears to be 
completely avoidable with appropriate hearing protection (ear plugs).  All subjects are 
required to wear  the standard -of-care hearing protection. Subjects are asked to report to 
study staff immediately if their hearing protection becomes loose or is otherwise 
inadequate. In addition, study staff will monitor all subjects to ensure compliance with 
hearing protection.  
4. Movement or heating of metallic objects (rare).  TMS may cause heating or movement 
of intracranial metal, such as in subjects with implantable electrodes, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_557817], skull plates, or other intracranial metal.  These subjects will be excluded.  
5. Damage to electronic medical devices (rare).  TMS may interfere with electronic medical 
devices such as pacemakers, implantable stimulators, or implantable pumps. These subjects will be excluded.  
6. Pregnancy (rare).  There is not sufficient data to assess the safety of TMS in pregnancy, 
although TMS has been performed in limited numbers of pregnant subjects without adverse effects.  Pregnant subjects will be excluded.  
 
Risks Associated with MRI  
7. Movement or heating of metallic objects  (rare, serious) . The only known hazard 
associated with exposure to a static high magnetic field is that the magnet exerts a strong 
force on ferromagnetic objects. For this reason, ferromagnetic objects are excluded from 
the vicinity of the magnet so that they will not be come projectiles. At the Brain Imaging 
Center , the research MRI for human use has a field strength of 3.[ADDRESS_732482] undergoes an extensive safety screening to determine whether 
Protocol Template Page 12 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 he/she has any implanted materials, objects, device,  or dental retainers that may pose a 
risk. If there is any doubt about the nature of any implanted material, or any other 
contraindication to MR scanning, the subject will not be scanned.  
8. Damage to electronic medical devices (rare, serious).   See #7.  
9. Pregnancy  (rare, serious).  Any woman who reports being pregnant or reports that they 
may be pregnant will be excluded from this study. Any woman of childbearing age who reports that she is not pregnant will undergo a urine pregnancy screen. Those who test 
positive will be excluded from participating in this study.  
10. Claustrophobia (common).  If patients are anxious they can be trained in the mock 
scanner located adjacent to the MR scanner to mitigate anxiety and help the subject adjust to the scanning environment. Subjects who want to quit immediately or who are otherwise 
not interested in participating in this study can do so at any time, and this option will be 
discussed with the subject during informed consent and at regular intervals thereafter.  
11. Nausea (rare).  Rarely, subjects may become nauseated as a result of the alternative 
magnetic fields or acoustic noise. Subjects are able to terminate participation in the study at any time.  
12. Irritation from loud sounds  (common). Loud sounds occur during functional MRI 
scanning. They are unpleasant, but not loud enough to be harmful.  All subjects will  wear 
standard -of-care ear protection while undergoing the MRI scans.  Subjects are able to 
terminate participation in the study at any time.  
 
General Risks Associated with Research Participation 
13. Potential risk of loss of confidentiality (rare).  This study includes drug screening, 
alcohol screening, and pregnancy test assessment. There is the potential that this information may not be kept confidential, such as in theft of study material.  
14. Fatigue (common). Tiredness or boredom may occur during behavioral tasks and the MRI 
scan.  Subjects are able to terminate participation in the study at any time.  
15. Frustration (common).  Subjects may become frustrated while performing the craving- cue 
task in the MRI scanner.  Subjects are able to terminate participation in the study at any 
time. 
    
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
 
I have experience conducting both structural and function neuroimaging experiments.
61,62 
Nonetheless, this study has potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]. One limitation is that insular rTMS may also stimulate 
the lateral inferior frontal gyrus; by [CONTACT_8345], any rTMS treatment can also affect structures  superficial 
to the target along the 
  trajectory. This potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_557818] (1) exploratory seed -based connectivity and (2) ROI based activity of all 
structures included in the rTMS  field. Such exploration would determine if other structures showed 
altered connectivity/activity after insular rTMS, as well as determine if brain- behavior relationships 
in other structures were altered by [CONTACT_557833]. Another potential limitation is that the effect of insular rTMS may manif est only as changes in insular connectivity but not insular activity – we 
address this predicament by [CONTACT_557834].  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
 
F.1  Aim 1: Determine if insular TMS reduces cigarette craving:  
F.1.1 S tatistical Design:  For a multivariate analysis of covariance model, we will fit a general 
linear multivariate model, with measures of craving before and after treatment as the outcomes.  As 
predictors, we will fit indicator variables for treatment assignment, and FTND.  We will use the Hotelling -Lawley test to assess treatment by [CONTACT_6491], and the main effects of time and 
treatment.  
F.1.2 Sample Size and Power Analysis:  Li et al.30 conducted an experiment similar to ours, 
measuring cravin g responses to DLPFC rTMS (Cohen’s d = 3.0) or sham TMS (Cohen’s d = 1.9). 
Protocol Template Page 13 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 Based on these estimates, we will need to recruit 15 subjects to each arm (total n=30) to detect 
similar differences with 80% power and 0.05 significance level. Our study should achieve similar 
power, even with up to 25% loss to follow- up in each arm. If our loss -to-follow up is only 10% per 
arm, we can detect an effect size as small as 0.962 with 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_732483] udies using similar methods.27,29,30,32,63 
 
F.2  Aim 2: Determine if insular TMS alters insular connectivity:  
F.2.1 Statistical Design:  A second -level random effects model will  be used to compare insular 
connectivity by [CONTACT_557835]. Age will be controlled for as nuisance 
variables . A Monte Carlo cluster correction threshold will be applied to correct for multiple 
comparisons, using a voxel -wise p<0.005 and family -wise p < 0.05.   
F.2.2 Sample Size and Power Analysis:   Hanlon et al.26 measured fMRI connectivity changes 
after rTMS to two separate prefrontal targets, resulting in Cohen’s d values greater than 1.9. Based 
on these estimates, our target recruitment goal must be greater than 6 in each arm (total n=12) to detect significant differences with 80% power and 0.05 significance level. Our sample size n=32 
(after 10% attrition of fMRI data, 10% attrition of TMS administration) is similar or larger compared 
to other studies using similar methods.
26,30,33,64,[ADDRESS_732484] size as small as 0.30 (
 ) with 80% power and 0.05 significance level.  
 
F.3  Aim 3: Determine if insular TMS alters insular activity:  
F.3.1 Statistical Design : Contrast maps of smoking>neutral cues will be analyzed using second -
level random -effects to compare these contrasts within and between treatment groups using 
ANCOVA. Two separate task -based analyses will be performed: (1) insular ROI analyses by 
[CONTACT_557836] a 5mm radius sphere centered at the  insular TMS 
target , and (2) whole brain analysis. Both analyses will control for multiple comparisons and 
nuisance variables as  we will in Aim #2 . 
F.3.2  Sample S ize and Power Analysis : Hanlon et al.26 measured fMRI activity changes after 
rTMS to two separate prefrontal targets, resulting in Cohen’s d values greater than 2.3. Based on 
these estimates, our target recruitment goal must be greater than 5 in each arm (total n=10) to detect significant differences with 80% power and 0.05 significance level. Our sample size  n=32 
(after 10% attrition of fMRI data, 10% attrition of TMS administration) is similar or larger compared 
to other studies using similar methods.
26,30,33,64,[ADDRESS_732485] size as small as 0.30 (
 ) with 80% power and 0.05 significance level.  
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
 
Regardless of the results of our  aims, this proposal will lead to significant future research 
directions. In the unexpected case that no differences in craving or fMRI are observed after insular rTMS, our interpretation will be that the insula is not as critical a neural node as the literature to 
date reports. This null result would direct our future efforts toward prefrontal targets, which has been previously demonstrated to be effective in craving mitigation. If we find that the insula is 
indeed an important neural node in craving behavior, these preliminary studies would pave the way 
for future, more sophisticated studies that compare and combine insular r TMS with prefrontal 
rTMS, characterize the laterality of the insula, and investigate the durability of craving mitigation 
with repeated rTMS as a potential long- term a djuvant treatment for nicotine dependence. Literature 
to date strongly support the latter conclusion, and we expect to find significant results . Regardless 
of outcome, this proposal will answer a critically important question for the millions of patients 
unable to stop smoking: how important is the insula in cigarette craving, and can insular rTMS 
reduce cigarette craving?

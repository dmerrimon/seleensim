The EMPRESS  study is a post market prospective,  non-randomized,  single-arm, multicenter  study, 
designed  to demonstrate  dose response  of the Emprint™  Ablation System using a percutaneous  approach  
in patients with metastatic  or primary lung tumors. 
This document  provides a detailed description of the statistical methods  and procedures to be 
implemented  during the analysis of the study. 
The proposed  methods  and approaches  to the data analysis should be viewed as flexible if the data 
suggest and warrant deviations from this plan. However, any deviations from this analysis plan must be 
substantiated by a sound statistical rationale and documented  in the final clinical study report. This 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on version [ADDRESS_592428] market prospective,  non-randomized,  single-arm, multicenter  study. 
Ablations  will be carried out using a percutaneous  approach  at a dose (power and time setting) selected 
during procedure  planning.  The procedure  planning  application will be used as an adjunct planning tool. 
While the physician prescribes the dose, the Emprint™  Procedure  Planning  Application overlays the 3- 
dimensional predicted  ablation zone on the patient CT images, facilitating visualization of the predicted  
ablation zone relative to the target tumor. Once the ablation procedure  is complete,  the scheduled  
surgical tumor resection will be performed.  
 
 
 
No formal sample size estimates were conducted  for this post-market, prospective,  non-randomized,  6. Determination of  Sample Size 5. Investigation Plan  4. Study Objectives  3. Introduction

 single-arm, multicenter  study. Up to 30 subjects who are scheduled for resection of metastatic  or 
primary lung tumor(s)  will be enrolled.  Ablations will be carried out using a percutaneous  approach  at a 
dose (power and time setting) selected during procedure  planning.  Up to [ADDRESS_592429] disposition (e.g., number completing the study, number lost-to-follow-up) will be summarized  
with frequency  tables. The following information will be provided  by [CONTACT_3885]: 
• Number and percentage  of screen failures

study Visit

7.1.2. Clinical Investigation  Plan (CIP) Deviations  
A CIP deviation  is defined as an event where the Investigator or study personnel  did not conduct 
the study according  to the CIP. Deviations  shall be reported regardless of whether medically justifiable or 
taken to protect the Subject in an emergency.  
 
Except a change that is intended  to eliminate an immediate hazard to a Subject, the protocol will be 
followed as described.  Subject specific deviations and non-Subject specific deviations  will be reported.  
Investigators will also adhere to procedures  for reporting study deviations to their IRB in accordance  with 
their specific IRB reporting policies and procedures.  
 
7.1.3. Analysis Sets  
In general, data analysis will be conducted  on all subjects who are enrolled in the trial and undergo the 
ablation procedure  using the Emprint™  system. 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT): subjects enrolled into the study. 
 
Modified ITT (MITT): ITT subjects who completed  the ablation procedure.  If all ITT subjects completed  
the ablation procedure,  then the ITT population is the same as the MITT population.  
Additional  analysis sub-populations  may be defined per scientific research  need. 7. Statistical  Methods

dinucleotide  (NADH) assay) and structural staining (hematoxylin  and eosin; H&E) techniques  will be used 
to evaluate cellular integrity within the ablation zone. 
The histology data for the NADH assay is from the NADH Sample Analysis – Part 1 of the PATHOLOGY  
CRF: 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked Yes, it is complete  tumor ablation 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked No and the “If No, Was Delayed Necrosis 
Achieved”  is checked Yes, it is delayed necrosis 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked No and the “If No, Was Delayed Necrosis 
Achieved”  is checked No, it is incomplete tumor ablation 
 
The histology data for the H&E assay is from the H&E Sample Analysis – Part 2 of the PATHOLOGY  CRF: 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked Yes, it is complete  tumor ablation 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked No, it is incomplete tumor ablation

incomplete tumor ablation for all target tumors combined  and for each target tumor type (primary,  
recurrent,  and metastatic)  will be provided.  The summary  will be provided  by [CONTACT_462679], H&E assay, 
and NADH and H&E combined.

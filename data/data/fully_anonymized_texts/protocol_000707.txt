PROTOCOL # CT LUCIA 611P ONT -301-17, VERSION E 
 
STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 1. Study Objective  
 
To establish the safety and effectiveness of the CT LUCIA  611P posterior chamber intraocular lens ( IOL) 
for the correction of  aphakia following extracapsular cataract extraction via phacoemulsification  in adult 
patients.   
 2. Study Device  
 
The CT LUCIA  611P is a posterior chamber  hydrophobic acrylic  IOL, which is  designed for implantation 
in the capsular bag following cataract extraction , contained in a BLUEJECT injector .  The IOL is a single -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_733934] 6.[ADDRESS_1002954] LUCIA  611P 
is monofocal biconvex aspheric in design, with edges designed to minimize mass; the lens haptics are 
modified C-loop with 0 ° angulation. 
 3. Study Endpoints   
 
• Effectiveness:  The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of subject  
 
 
• Safety: The primary safety endpoints are the incidence of adverse events (AE).   
 
4. Study Design    
   
This is a prospective, multi -center single -arm clinical study .  Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  [ADDRESS_1002955] extraction via phacoemulsification followed by  
[CONTACT_733935] a posterior chamber IOL.    6. Number of Eyes 
 390 eye s enrolled , with ≥  300 eyes followed through 12 months postoperatively.

ophthalmic examinations at regularly scheduled intervals. 
 
8. Examination Schedule  
 Scheduled examinations will be performed at the intervals shown below:      
 
• Pre-operative Visit ( -90 - 0 days)  
• Operative Visit (Day 0)     
• 1 Day Postoperative Visit ([ADDRESS_1002957]- surgery)   
• 1 Week Postoperative Visit ([ADDRESS_1002958] -surgery)                   
• 1 Month Postoperative Visit ([ADDRESS_1002959]-surgery)  
• 6 Months Postoperative Visit ([ADDRESS_1002960]-surgery) 
• 12 Months Postoperative Visit ([ADDRESS_1002961]- surgery)   
 
Note:  Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study participation period.  
     
9. Clinical Assessments/Procedures   
  
The following c linical assessments will be performed at scheduled examination visits as shown in  
APPENDIX 1:  SCHEDULE OF CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS/PROCEDURES : 
 
• Medical and ophthalmic history 
• Concomitant medication use 
• Study eye axial length (AL),  anterior chamber depth (ACD) and keratometry (K) measurement  
• Study eye cataract removal and I OL implantation information  
• Uncorrected and best- corrected distance VA  
• Manifest refraction  (MR) 
• Slit lamp examination  (SLE)  
• Dilated fundus examination  (DFE)  
• Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement  
• Adverse event  (AE)  determination  
 
Note:  Clinical assessments/procedures performed at unscheduled examination visits will be determined at the study investigator’s discretion.

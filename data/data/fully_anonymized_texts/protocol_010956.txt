Study Description : Specific Aims: 1) Explore strategies for using peer educators and 
novel mobile health technologies as part of a group lifestyle change 
program for diabetes prevention among at -risk ethnic minority 
youth in a [LOCATION_001] City community with high disease burden. 2) 
Refine, implement, an d evaluate outcomes for the intervention. 
Using preliminary data, we will use CBPR to refine our 
developmentally and culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention for 
pre-diabetic ethnic minority adolescents. We will then screen at -
risk adolescents for pre -diabetes and related lifestyle and 
biological measures and compare outcomes in adolescents in 
intervention and wait list control groups to test intervention 
effectiveness. 3) Further refine the intervention for a larger RCT 
based on an examination of inte rvention feasibility, acceptability, 
and sustainability.

 6 2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
The number of youth with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. is projected to increase by 49 
percent by 2050 , with higher rates  among minority youth. The Diabetes Prevention Program 
(DPP) is recognized as a sentinel study demonstrating the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions 
for diabetes prevention among pre -diabetic adults but has not yet been replicated in youth. In 
addition , such intensive interventions are often not sustainable in high risk communities with 
limited resources. One strategy that has been successfully employed in adults from such 
communities is peer based health education. Research suggests that like adults, y oung people 
are more likely to hear and personalize messages, and thus to change their attitudes and 
behaviors, if they believe the messenger is similar to them and faces the same concerns and 
pressures. However, there have been no peer led interventions i n ethnic minority teens and no 
interventions focused specifically on weight loss for diabetes prevention. Finally, another 
challenge identified in existing youth health intervention programs is keepi[INVESTIGATOR_697830]. One potential strategy is the use of mobile 
technologies (text messaging, mobile applications, social media) to support weight management 
programs, but to date use of such technologies has not been studied in youth. This study’s 
overall objective is to use community -based participatory research (CBPR) to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_481702] a youth peer -led diabetes prevention intervention incorporating novel mobile health 
technologies for at -risk adolescents in a vulnerable [LOCATION_001] City community. The central 
hypo thesis is that such an intervention will lead to maintenance or decrease in BMI, improved 
dietary, physical activity and weight control behaviors, and decrease in diabetes risk.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Our Previous Study: People who develop diabetes go through a peri od when they have “pre -
diabetes,” defined by [CONTACT_697844] 100 -125 
mg/dl, and/or [ADDRESS_947178] -prandial blood glucose of 140 -199 mg/dl, and/or hemoglobin A1c of 
5.7-6.4%.  Diabetes and pre -diabetes are being di agnosed more in children, likely related to 
increasing rates of obesity. National estimates are that about 16% of all adolescents have pre -
diabetes with higher rates in obese adolescents or those with a family history of diabetes.  
Weight loss is the single  therapy proven to prevent diabetes. In clinical settings, overweight adults 
with pre -diabetes who reduce their weight by 5 -10% can reduce their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_697831] 55 -60%.  While there have been no large diabetes prevention trials in children a nd adolescents, 
school based, clinic -based and community -based trials have led to reduction in diabetes risk 
(improvements in body measurements and glucose or insulin levels) with intensive lifestyle 
interventions.  
An effective low -resource diabetes preve ntion strategy devised for adults in high -risk communities 
is the use of peer leaders to promote lifestyle change.  Investigators from the adult HEED study 
(GCO#05 -0463) conducted a randomized -controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of peer -
led commun ity-based workshops, versus usual care (delayed intervention) in achieving weight

 7 loss and prevention of diabetes among overweight (BMI > 25) adults with pre -diabetes in East 
Harlem.  Over [ADDRESS_947179] (OGTT) (a fingerstick test with an instant read 
glucose analyzer).  The OGTT is performed by [CONTACT_697845], both at fasting and after 
administration of a [ADDRESS_947180] pi[INVESTIGATOR_697832] (GCO # 11 -1711), we adapted the HEED intervention for East Harlem 
adolesc ents. We conducted community based screening for pre -diabetes among 56 at -risk 
obese adolescents. We measured glucoses using oral glucose tolerance tests. Adolescents 
completed a survey to assess diet and physical activity knowledge, attitudes and behavior s and 
diabetes risk.  They also underwent detailed body measurements (i.e. height, weight, body fat, 
waist circumference) and blood pressure testing.  
Nineteen adolescents diagnosed with pre -diabetes had more detailed assessment of their 
dietary intake and physical activity levels. Pre -diabetic adolescents were then invited to take 
part in an initial version of the TEEN HEED intervention.  Trained adolescent peer educators 
partnered with experienced adult HEED workshop leaders to run the workshops. At follow  up, 
participants again completed the oral glucose tolerance test, verbally administered 
questionnaire, body measurements (i.e. height, weight, body fat, waist circumference) and blood 
pressure testing.  Out of [ADDRESS_947181]  learned through the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we completed additional 
qualitative studies to further develop our intervention. We conducted focus groups to explore 1) 
peer influences on eating behaviors, physical activity, and other individual factors related to 
weigh t management, 2) strategies for further adapting our peer education diabetes prevention 
intervention for urban minority adolescents, and 3) use of mobile technologies (such as text 
messaging, mobile applications and social media) as an adjunct to the peer -led intervention.  
We then recruited participants ages 13 -19 who are at risk for diabetes through community youth 
organizations, health centers and schools, determined eligibility (overweight/obese by [CONTACT_697846]), 
and invited them to return fasting for f urther evaluation. Those ages 13 -17 required assent/parental 
consent, while those >[ADDRESS_947182] (OGTT ),59 obtained body meas urements, blood pressure and metabolic tests, and 
administered a health and lifestyle survey. We screened 148 teens, of whom 90 were diagnosed with pre -
diabetes (61%) and were randomized to intervention (n=41) and wait list control (n=49) groups . Each 
work shop group (10 -15 teens) met for 90 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. All activities were delivered under 
the supervision of experienced adult health educators by [CONTACT_697847], group facilitation, and review of the workshop curriculum. We collected 5 and 12

 8 month follow up data (73% retention at both time points). Information from this previous cohort will be 
used to refine our study.  
 In order to maximize the reach of this intervention, and with increasing n eed due to the 
pandemic, we are proposing a virtual component to the TEEN HEED program.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
We are now testing and evaluat ing outcomes of our refined intervention to reduce diabetes risk 
among ethnic minority pre -diabetic adolescents.  We will further adapt the program for virtual 
delivery via a video conferencing platform to enhance access and attendance, and refine the 
text mes saging platform to better support and engage teens.  
We will identify at risk for diabetes adolescents  and recruit adolescents (BMI in the 
overweight/obese range and HbA1c 5.7 -6.4%) through electronic medical record data queries 
and referrals from clinical and community sites.  Participation will be  contingent on adolescent 
assent/parental consent (ages 13 -17) or participant consent (ages 18 years or older).  We will 
randomize  pre-diabetic adolescents into intervention and wait list control (delayed i ntervention) 
groups to test intervention effectiveness.  We will also e valuate the virtual and mHealth 
components of the intervention through usability testing and data analytics.  
The intervention is [ADDRESS_947184] (CAB). The 
technology -based tool is a secure mobile health platform we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_697833] 
a company called mPulse Mobile. The platform will allow us to securely send and track text 
messages, help participants set goals and monitor their behaviors, and provide participants with 
individualized feedback and positive reinforcemen t. Messages will be sent via an SMS text 
messaging mobile health platform to provide motivational messages regarding healthy eating, 
physical activity and healthy weight maintenance and to follow up on weekly goals made by [CONTACT_32346]. The platform su pports interactive dialogues including automated interactions using 
rule-based branching logic that allows participants to navigate through the program based on 
their message responses. In addition, natural language understanding allows real -time 
interpret ation of text responses for more sophisticated dialogues. Beyond processing responses 
through automated dialogues, natural language understanding allows for responses that fall 
outside the scope of the dialogue’s rules. mPulse Mobile’s Engagement Console a llows project 
staff to manage individual interactions with participants. The Console identifies any responses 
that cannot be handled by [CONTACT_697848]’s rules and flags these messages for staff to 
resolve. Additionally, staff can use the Console to manually initiate messages, and high -priority 
messages that must be reviewed can be escalated in real -time.   
All information within the mPulse Mobile platform and cloud server is protected and secure. The 
platform ensures privacy and confidentiality of in formation shared and messages sent.  The 
HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) is the most widely -accepted information 
technology security control audit framework developed explicitly for the protection of healthcare 
information. The framework integrates  requirements from sources such as ISO, NIST, PCI, 
HIPAA, and others. To successfully complete the HITRUST CSF audit, mPulse Mobile had to

 [ADDRESS_947185], Mobile Marketing Associati on’s Consumer Best Practices, and CTIA 
Mobile Compliance Assurance Handbook.  [CONTACT_697864] will be the application 
manager.  
All participants will also be advised about privacy issues surrounding responses to text 
messages. It will be recommended th at they use a password to protect their cell phones. 
(Please see the previously submitted IT Security Risk Assessment Report).  
We will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_697834] s tudy. We will obtain parental permission to allow mPulse 
Mobile to receive  their cell phone numbers and send SMS text messages to participants. This 
information will be included in the study consent form with a separate place within the consent 
form for pa rents to initial to give this permission. Participants aged [ADDRESS_947186] data and 
messaging rates from participant’s provider may apply and that they can request that messages 
stop being sent at any time.   
We will also conduct audio -recorded debriefing sessions with participants and peer leaders in 
which we will ask about their experiences with the intervention, reactions to the intervention, and 
ideas for intervention refinement. To monitor the community -academic partnership, we are 
tracking activities such as the communication between community -academic partners, number of 
participants at CAB meetings, number of manuscripts and presentations by [CONTACT_697849] -community 
partners, and policy -related outcomes. Additionally, we are investigatin g youth involvement in 
CBPR, through audio -recorded one -on-one interviews and qualitative analysis. This will help us 
understand how young people have helped shape the project. We are interviewing study 
participants, peer leaders, community action board me mbers, interns, and study coordinators. 
They are being consented and asked questions about their personal experience with the study 
and their views on how young people have contributed to the project and how they may continue 
to do so in the future.

7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
When a subject discontinues from  the study intervention  (12-week workshop)  but not  from the study, 
remaining study proce dures will be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].   If a clinically sig nificant 
finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator 
or quali fied designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed.   
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
<Protocol Title>   Version <X.X>

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 16 • The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for 
determining the need to discontinue  
• If the participant is due to complete assessments within 2 weeks of being discontinued from the 
study intervention, those assessments will be administered at the time of discontinuation; if the next 
scheduled assessments are more than 2 weeks from the discontinuation date, the discontinued 
participant will wait for the next scheduled assessment. Thereafter, the participant will be included in all 
future scheduled assessments, even though not participating in the intervention.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  a participa nt from  the study for the follow ing reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance , unless varying compliance is an aspect of the study 
objectives   
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up  
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that preclu des further study participation  
 
Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the 
study, will not be replaced.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_947196] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visi t within 1 month , 
counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain 
if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls , emails and text 
messages  and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s la st known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods) . These contact [CONTACT_9145]’s 
medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up]

<Protocol Title>   Version <X.X>  
Protocol <#>   DD Month YYYY  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 17 8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Evaluation of the intervention’s impact on the primary study outcome, participants’ 
weights: We hypothesize that the TEEN HEED intervention will result in maintenance or 
decrease in BMI percentile.  We chose this outcome because weight loss is consistently shown 
as the most powerful and effective  diabetes prevention strategy.  
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the TEEN HEED interv ention on behaviors and 
mediators related to weight loss and diabetes prevention: We hypothesize that the 
intervention will lead to observable changes to diet, physical activity and weight control 
behaviors and that these and other mediators explain weight  loss. We will assess whether the 
intervention leads to improvements in diet and physical activity behaviors and related mediators 
such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, self -efficacy, and social influences, and improvements in 
other measures of diabetes risk (s uch as HbA1c). Hypotheses will be tested by [CONTACT_697859] -intervention follow -up. We will also conduct 
exploratory analyses to begin to understand whether  any of these factors appear closely linked 
to pre -diabetes diag nosis or weight loss.  
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
We will adhere to the minimum DSMP standards of the PPHS as this study does not involve 
more than minimal risk to subjects.  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a) : any untoward medical 
occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -
related . 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interf ere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
<Protocol Title>   Version <X.X>  
Protocol <#>   DD Month YYYY  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 18 • Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. ] 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO ST UDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_9152] -trained clinician  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical 
judgment. T he degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
procedures  and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study procedures  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures  and event onset , or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
A clinician with appropriate expertise in pre-diabetes  will be responsible for determining whether an 
adverse event ( AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, 
or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
procedures . 
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  
(CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severit y, relationship to study procedures  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequ ate resolution.  
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the s tudy, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] .

<Insert role or name> will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events 
will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ).  OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participant s or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents , such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly relate d” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physica l, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
 
<Protocol Title>   Version <X.X>

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 20 The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the Data Coordinating C enter ( DCC )/lead principal investigator ( PI). The UP report will include 
the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, i ncid ent, experience, or outcome   
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in resp onse to the UP 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor /funding agency  within <insert timeline in accordance with policy>  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC /study sponsor /funding agency  within 
<insert timeline in accordance with policy>  of the investigato r becoming aware of the problem   
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within <insert timeline in accordance with policy>  of the  
IRB’s receipt of the report of th e problem from the investigator

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Evaluation of the intervention’s impact on the primary study outcome, participants’ 
weights: We hypothesize that the TEEN HEED intervention will result in maintenance or 
decrease in BMI percentile.  We chose this outcome because weight loss is consistently shown 
as the most powerful and effective diabetes prevention strategy.  
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the TEEN HEED intervention on behaviors and 
mediators related to weight loss and diabetes prevention: We hypothesize that the 
intervention will lead t o observable changes to diet, physical activity and weight control 
behaviors and that these and other mediators explain weight loss.  We will assess whether the 
intervention leads to improvements in diet and physical activity behaviors and related mediators  
such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, self -efficacy, and social influences, and improvements in 
other measures of diabetes risk (such as HbA1c). Hypotheses will be tested by [CONTACT_697860] -intervention follow -up. We will also conduct

 [ADDRESS_947198] maintenance/reduction of BMI. Secondary analyses will assess 
whether the intervention leads to improve ments in diet and physical activity behaviors a nd related 
mediators  such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, self-efficacy , and social influences. Hypotheses will be 
tested by [CONTACT_697861] . Initial bivariate comparisons 
will use t test s to compare continuous endpoints and the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed -rank test to 
compare ordinal endpoints . We will then conduct multivariable analyses (using logistic regression, 
general linear models, and  mixed models) to adjust for potential confounders (such as age, race/ethnicity, 
gender, SES, and baseline BMI) and to account for the repeated observations per participant. Analyses 
will include the baseline level of each endpoint as a covariate  and a con tinuous variable for time.  
Confidence intervals will be constructed around each parameter estimate of the intervention. We will 
estimate effect sizes for each measure using correction for small sample bias.  
To monitor the community -academic partnership, we will track activities such as the communication 
between community -academic partners, number of participants at CAB meetings, number of manuscripts 
and presentations by [CONTACT_697849] -community partners, and policy -related outcomes. We will also ask CAB 
member s to complete annual surveys to gauge how closely the research project aligns with principles of 
CBPR, including factors they may feel less comfortable discussing in a group, such as level of inclusion 
and trust.

collection, docu mentation and completion. All sites will follow a common  quality management plan.  
 
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemente d as follows:  
 
Informed consent  --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as 
a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, 
accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team to ensure proper consenting  
procedures are followed .  
 
Source documents  and the electronic data --- Data will be initially captured on source documents (see 
Section  10.1.[ADDRESS_947205] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) and will ultimately be entered into the study 
database .  To ensure accuracy site staff will compare a representative sample of source data against the 
database, targeting key data points in that review.  
 
Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are descr ibed in

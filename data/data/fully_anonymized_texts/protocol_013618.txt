Protocol Body  
1.0 Background  
 
1.0 Primary:  
1. To define  the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of infusional  gemcitabine  
combined  with fixed doses of clofarabine and busulfan in patients with 
lymphoma receiving an allogeneic stem -cell transplant  (alloSCT).  
2. To estimate  the day +[ADDRESS_1070702]-
disease  (GVHD).  
 
1.1 Secondary:  
1. To estimate  the day +100  success  rate [defined  as percentage  of patients  
who are alive, engrafted and without grade [ADDRESS_1070703]-disease  
(GVHD)]  
2. To estimate the rate of event -free (EFS)  
3. To estimate the rate of overall survival  (OS) 
4. To estimate  the response  rate (RR)  [defined  as # of responses  / # of patients  
with measurable  tumors]  
5. To estimate  the complete  reponse  (CR)  rate [defined  as # of complete  
responses  / # of patients with measurable  tumors]  
6. To estimate the incidence of grade [ADDRESS_1070704] treatment for patients with relapsed Hodgkin’s or  
non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma .[1,2]  However, results of autologous stem -cell 
transplantation are  poor for patients who fail to respond to salvage  
chemotherapy.[3,4]  Such patients are usually considered  for an allogeneic  stem -cell 
trans plant (alloSCT)  if they have  an available  matched  sibling donor (MSD) or 
matched unrelated donor (MUD). An allogeneic SCT offers the  advantages of graft -
vs.-lymphoma (GVL) effect as well as infusion of a tumor -free apheresis product. In 
addition, reduced intensity combinations have substantially increased the safety 
and tolerability of alloSCT. Unfortunately, aggressive lymphomas often progress 
shortly after  an alloSCT due to rapid tumor cell growth  outpacing  GVL .[5-7]  Thus, 
development of novel  regimens that are both safe and effective against aggressive 
lymphomas is a major unmet  need.  
 
2.1 Nucleoside analogue/busulfan studies for  transplantation.  
Nucleoside a nalogues (NA) and alkylators are synergistic based on inhibition of DNA 
damage repair.[9]  Exploiting their synergy w e have conducted successful studies of 
busulfan combined with fludarabine for acute  myeloblastic  leukemia[9,10] or with 
clofarabine[11] for acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia as conditioning regimens for alloSCT.  
In the autologous transplant setting we have developed  a regimen  of 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 4 of 25 
 gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan  (GemBuMel)  with high activity  against poor -
prognosis relapsed lymphomas .[12]  The side effect profile of this regimen,  including  
mucositis and rash, was safe and manageable in the autologous transplant setting, 
but was  found to be excessively toxic for use in alloSCT.    
Preclinical studies of our collaborators Valdez and Andersson  have shown increased 
synergy resulting from combinations of double nucleoside analogues (gemcitabine and 
clofarabine) added to busulfan in several chemotherapy -refractory lymphoma cell lines 
(Daudi, J45.01 and  U937) .[13]  The experiments  indicate  increase d DNA  damage  
response  through  the ATM -CHK2 and ATM -CHK1 pathways, leading to cell cycle 
checkpoint activation and  apoptosis.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Cytotoxicity of Busulfan and nucleoside analogs (gemcitabine and clofarabine) toward Daudi 
B-cell lymphoma cells. Cells were continuously exposed to drugs alone, or in combination, for 96 
hours and analyzed by [CONTACT_137432]. Bu or B, busulfan; Clo or C, clofarabine; Gem or G, gemcitabine  
 
Based on the results of these experiments we decided to study clinically 
gemcitabine /clofarabine/busulfan in patients with relapsed aggressive lymphomas 
receiving an alloSCT. We hypothesize that this regimen will be safe in this setting for 
the following reasons:    
1) Omission  of melphalan  should  result  in less mucositis  than GemBuMel,  which  is 
desirable  in the alloSCT setting, 2) CloBu is immunosuppressive enough to ensure 
engraftment[11-14], and 3) CloBu results in less graft -vs.-host disease (GVHD) than  
BuMel.[11]

trials (2010 -0142 and 2010 -0506), this drug will be administered as  a 75 loading 
mg/m2/dose IV targeting the desired steady state concentration of 20 µmolar. This will be 
immediately followed  by [CONTACT_21200] a fixed rate of 10 mg/m2 /min over varying len gths 
of time per study cohort. Each gemcitabine dose will be immediately followed by 
[CONTACT_54894], which will be in turn immediately followed by [CONTACT_254913]. Gemcitabine dose will 
be based on adjusted body weight for patients > 20% above ideal body weight.

Gemcitabine given as a one min bolus dose.  
 
 
D-6 to D -3 Clofarabine administration . 
Clofarabine  will be administered  at a dose  of 40 mg/m2 diluted  in NS to produce  a final 
concentration of 0.4mg/mL, and infused over one hour on each of four consecutive days 
(days  -6 through -3). On days -6 and -4 clofarabine will immediately follow the infusion of 
gemcitabine. Clofarabine will be dosed per actual body weight/actual body surf ace area.  
D-6 to D -3 Busulfan administration . Pharmacokinetic -guided (PK -guided) treatment:  
The PK -guided daily high -dose busulfan doses will be started immediately upon completion 
of 
the daily clofarabine doses. The busulfan doses will be diluted in norma l saline and 
administered over 3 hours daily by [CONTACT_778936].  
 
Busulfan will be administered at the dose calculated to achieve a systemic exposure dose 
of 4000 µMol -min in normal saline over three hours IV every twenty -four hours for four 
consecutive days (days -6 to -3), starting immediately after the completion of clofarabine , 
between 5 and 6:30  AM. 
 
Fixed dose busulfan : If it is not feasible to perform pharmacokinetic monitoring, patients will 
receive a fixed busulfan dose of 100 mg /m /day for 4 days, which is expected to yield a median 
daily AUC  of 4,000  µMol.min -1. Busulfan  dose  will be based  on adjusted  body  weight  
for 
patients > 20% above ideal body weight.  
 
Acetaminophen must not be used between days -[ADDRESS_1070708] one week prior to start of busulfan as feasible .

Patients receiving a graft from a matched unrelated donor will receive Thymoglobulin; 0.5 
mg/kg on day –3, 1.5 mg/kg on day –2 and 2.0 mg/kg on day –1. The Thymoglobulin will be 
administered as per regular departmental routines, and will be infused in the afternoon of 
respective days so not to interfere with the chemotherapy administration.  
D-14 and D -7 and then on D+1 and D+8 Rituximab only for patients with CD20+ tumors.  
Patients with CD20+ disease will receive rituximab IV at 375 mg/m (based on actual body 
weight) on D -14 and D -7 and then on Day +1 and D+8. Rituximab infusion will follow 
SCT&CT department standard pr actice.  
D0 Stem Cell infusion : 
Fresh or cryopreserved bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells will be infused on 
day 0. Premedication for the infusions will be per standard SCTCT department procedures.

transplant and SCTCT Guidelines.  
 
Filgrastim -sndz (G -CSF, Zarxio) administered at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day (rounded up the 
nearest vial size) subcutaneously.  
 
GVHD prophylaxis will include Tacrolimus and mycophen olate mofetil (MMF) with dose 
adjustment as clinically indicated. Tacrolimus will be administered at starting dose of 
0.015 mg/kg (ideal body weight) as a 24 hour continuous infusion daily adjusted to 
achieve a therapeutic level of 5 -15 ng/ml. Tacrolimus i s changed to oral dosing when 
tolerated and can be tapered off per departmental standards. MMF will start at 1,000 mg 
IV TID on day 0 after cell infusion and will be changed to oral dosing (1:1 conversion) 
when tolerated. MMF will be discontinued without t apering on day +60.  
 
Antiseizure prophylaxis and other supportive care (allopurinol, menstrual suppression, 
prophylactic antibiotics, empi[INVESTIGATOR_126342], IVIG, transfusions of blood products, 
hyperalimentation, etc.) as indicated.  
 
* A biosimilar of rituximab  may be used. 6.0 Evaluation During 
Study  
6.1. Assessment of DNA damage  analysis : 
This correlative study will be optional for patients participating in this trial. DNA damage 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_778937] 2 AX 
(gamma -H2AX) using flow cytometry. Samples (20 mL of blood) will be drawn in [ADDRESS_1070709] sample (baseline) will be collected prior to the busulfan test 
dose. Samples [ADDRESS_1070710] and second dose of 
gemcitabine, respectively. The gamma -H2AX assay will be conducted in the laboratory 
of Drs. Valdez and Andersson.[15] Briefly, mononuclear cells will be isolated and 
immunostained with a monoclonal antibody specific to gamma -H2AX and an  
anti-mouse IgG antibod y conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Fluorescence of at 
least 10,000 cells will be determined by [CONTACT_4133].

Causality  Assessment.  
 
For the purpose of this study the treatment plan (preparative regimen followed by 
[CONTACT_662213]) is defined as the “transplant package”; therefore 
adverse events known to be caused by [CONTACT_778939] . Adverse events known to be 
related to drugs used for the treatment of GVHD and Infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_778932] . When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be ruled out with 
certainty the AE may be considered possible related . Adverse events known to be related 
to drugs used for supportive treatment will be scored as unrelated . 
 
The principal in vestigator will be the final arbiter in determining the casualty assessment.  
List of most common expected adverse events . 
 
1. Infections  in the presence  or absence  of neutropenia:  fungal,  bacterial  and or viral 
infections.  
2. Fever: Non -neutropenic or neutropenic without  infection  
3. Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD): most commonly manifested by [CONTACT_362656], 
diarrhea  and abnormal  liver function  tests  could  also present  with some  degree  of fever,  
upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting) muc ositis and eye  dryness.  
4. Gastrointestinal (GI tract): the GI tract manifestations could be not only due to direct 
damage from the preparative regiment but also be a manifestation of GVHD or infections. 
Therefore,  the time course  and its presentation  are crucial  when  assessing  these  as 
adverse events. Nausea/vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea when presented within first [ADDRESS_1070719] likely will be related to the preparative  regimen.  
5. Skin rash:  not related  to GVHD  could  be caused  by [CONTACT_778940] a supportive  treatment.  
6. Transaminitis: liver function test  elevation.  
7. Pulmonary events: not related to CHF most likely caused by [CONTACT_778941]. 
These could present with a pneumonitis pattern manifested  with shortness of breath, 
pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_778942][INVESTIGATOR_778933] a diffuse bilateral alveolar  pattern.  
8. Cytokine Storm/ engraftment syndrome: most likely cause d by [CONTACT_615464].  
9. Hemorrhagic  cystitis:  not related  to chemotherapy  agents  used  in the 
proposed  preparative regimen is most likely caused by [CONTACT_615465].  
10. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  (TTP).  
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 13 of 25 
 11. Veno -occlusive  Disease  of the Liver  (VOD):  could  be caused  by [CONTACT_254913].  Some 
antimicrobial agents have been also incriminated in its  development.  
12. Fluid  overload  due to hydration  required  for conditioning  regimen,  blood  product 
transfusions and or IV  alimentation . 
13. Graft  failure.  
14. Chronic  GVHD.  
15. For the purpose  of this study  the following  events  would  not be 
considered  adverse  events and would not be recorded in the  database:  
1. Flu-like symptoms not associated with  infection  
2. Abnormal laboratory findings considered associated to the original  disease  
3. Isolated  changes  in laboratory  parameters  such  as 
electrolyte,  magnesium  and metabolic imbalances, uric acid 
changes, elevations of ALT, AST, LDH and alkaline phosphatase.  
Adverse events considered serious.  
 
Adverse events data collection . 
 
From the start of preparative regimen up to D+[ADDRESS_1070720] the onset and resolution date and maximum grade; 
beyond this point some events considered related to chronic GVHD or late 
complications post transplant might be recorded only wit h the first date of 
their awareness with no grade or resolution date.  
 
Intermittent events should be labeled as such and followed until resolution.  
If a patient is taken off study while an event is still ongoing, this will be 
followed until resolution unle ss another therapy is initiated. Pre -existing 
medical conditions will be recorded only if an exacerbation occurs during the 
active treatment period. Co -morbid events will not be scored separately.  
 
As stated in the treatment plan, patients treated on this protocol will required 
supportive care treatment (concurrent medication). These medications are 
considered standard of care and have no scientific contributions to the 
protocol, therefore no data will be captured on the various medications 
needed or their side effects.  
 
AE and Protocol Deviations Reporting Requirements.  
 
Adverse events will be reported accordingly to MDACC (HSRM chapter 
15.001) policy and procedures.   This study will be conducted in compliance 
however in the event of any protocol deviations  or violations these will be 
reported accordingly to MDACC (HSRM chapter 25).

10.0 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
For both stage 1 and stage 2 of the trial, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is 
defined as any of the following events occurring within 30 days from 
transplant:  
 
1. Grade 3 -4 mucositis lasting for more than 3 days at peak  severity.  
2. Grade 3 -4 skin toxicity lasting for more than 3 days at peak  severity.  
3. Grade 4 nonhematological noninfectious  toxicity.  
 
Enrollment will continue to proceed following the adaptive design as 
determined by [CONTACT_591779] (CRM). CRM will assign 
a dose level (e.g., dose X) to up to 2 new patients (e.g., patient A and B). If, 
based on medical considerations, subsequent patients (e.g., patients C, D...) 
have to initiate treatment before the toxicities of patients A or B have been 
assessed, these subsequent patients will be treated at the next lower dose 
level, dose X -1. 
 
DLT will be assessed for each patient on day 30. A maximum of six 
subsequent patients can be enrolled at level X -1 before toxicities of patients 
A and B are assessed.  
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
Regimen and dose levels.  
 
This is a phase I/II trial of intravenous busulfan and clofarabine given over days -6 
to -3, and gemcitabine given on days -6 and -4, as a preparative regimen for 
patients with aggressive lymphoma undergoing allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation. The doses of busulfan and clofarabine (each given in days -6, -5, -
4, -3) will be fixed, and the primary sc ientific goal in Phase I is to determine the 
best dose of gemcitabine among the six levels 475, 675, 975, 1275, 1575, 1875 
mg/m2/day, Hereafter, these will be referred to as dose levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  
 
Phase I.  
The primary scientific goal in Phase I is to determine an optimal gemcitabine dose 
(d*). The Bayesian Time to Event Continual Reassessment Method (TiTE -CRM,[16, 
17]) will be applied to determine d* in phase I. DLT will be defined as grade 3 -4 
mucositis lasting for more than 3 days at peak severity , grade 3 -4 skin toxicity lasting 
for more than 3 days at peak severity, occurring within 30 days from transplant, or 
grade 4 nonhematological noninfectious toxicity.  
 
Patient outcome will be the time of occurrence of DLT or, if DLT has not yet occurred 
by [CONTACT_4475] 30, the outcome will be the patient’s follow -up time without DLT. Denoting the 
time of follow up or DLT by T, and the right -censoring indicator C=1 if T is a follow 
up time without DLT and C=0 if T is the time of observed DLT, each patient’s data 
will consist of the pair (T,C), with T no longer than 30 days. A patient’s outcome 
(T,C) will be considered “fully evaluated” if either C= 0 (DLT has occurred at some 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 15 of 25 
 time up to day 30) or (T,C) = (30,1), which says that no DLT has occurred by [CONTACT_4475] 30. 
The TiTE -CRM will be applied with target DLT probability .20, cohort size 2, and 
maximum sample size 30 patients, and an estimated accrual rate of 1 patient per 
month.   Operating characteristics of the TiTE -CRM design are summarized in the 
following Table 1. Value s are based on 2,000 simulations of the trial under each 
scenario. The computations were carried out using the subroutine “titecrm” of the R 
program, “dfcrm,” provided by Y -K Cheung., which is freely available from the 
website http://www.columbia.edu/~yc632/ under An R package for phase I clinical 
trials .

Safety Monitoring Rule for Both Phase I and Phase II Based on TRM100 Rate  
 
The event TRM100 is defined to be either (1) transplant -related mortality or (2) grade 4 
regimen -related extramedullary non -infectious toxicity occurring within 100 days 
posttransplant. No te that DLT and TRM100 are not disjoint events, in that any TRM100 
event occurring prior to day 30 is also dose limiting.  
 
The following safety rule to control TRM100 rate will be applied. This rule will be applied 
both (i) in phase I to control the risk of TRM [ADDRESS_1070721] been explored by 
[CONTACT_778943] -CRM based on 30 -day toxicity, and (ii) in phase II to control the risk of TRM100 
at the MTD chosen in phase I, for the subset of patients treated at any given dose level, 
“d,” and in phase II, for  all patients treated at the MTD chosen in phase I.  
 
1. For application in phase I, “dose d” below in the rule means any given 
Gemcitabine dose that has been used by [CONTACT_778943] -CRM. If a dose d is found to 
have unacceptably high TRM100 rate in phase I, then neither dose d nor any 
higher doses may be used to treat any future patients in phase I or phase II, and 
furthermore this rule overrides the  TiTE -CRM.  
2. For application in phase II, the rule will be applied to the dose, d*, previously 
chosen in as “optimal” phase I and used to treat patients in phase II. If a dose d* is 
found to have unacceptably  high TRM100  rate in phase  II, then neither  dose  d* nor 
any higher  doses  may be used to treat any future patients. If this occurs, then d* 
will be replaced by [CONTACT_778944] e one level lower (d* -1), and phase II will be re -started 
at d*-1. In that case, all patients treated at d* -[ADDRESS_1070722] 
the maximum of 50 patients treated at d* -1. The same TRM100 safety rule will 
then be applied, with d* -[ADDRESS_1070723]  of d*. If d* -[ADDRESS_1070724] an unacceptably high TRM100, and will 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 17 of 25 
 be stopped if the probability of TRM100 being higher than 20% is greater than 95%. 
Formally, denoting  the probability  of TRM100  at dose  d by q(d), assuming  that q(d) follows  a 
beta(.20,  .80) prior, the dose d and all higher doses will be discontinued due to excessively 
high TRM100 if Pr{ q(d) > .20 } data} > .95. To compute the properties of this rule using the 
program “multc99,” a beta(200,800) prio r was assumed for a “standard” probability, qS. 
Based on application of this rule to up to 50 patients at d, this implies that d has 
unacceptable TRM100 if [# TRM100 observed  at dose  d] / [# evaluated  by [CONTACT_4475] 100 at dose  
d] is greater  than or equal  to 2/2, 4/6, 5/9, 6/12,  7/16,  8/19,  9/23,  10/26,  11/30,  12/34,  13/38,  
14/42,  or 15/49.  The operating  characteristics of this TRM100 monitoring rule are 
summarized in Table 2a, assuming a maximum of 25 patients, and in Table 2b, assuming a 
maximum of 50  patients.

Phase II.  
The primary scientific goal in Phase II is to estimate the day +100 success rate [defined as 
percentage of patients who are alive, engrafted and without grade [ADDRESS_1070725]-
disease (GVHD)],  rate of event -free (EFS),  overall  survival  (OS),  response  rate (RR),  
complete  response (CR) rate, incidence of grade 2 -4 and grade 3 -4 acute GVHD, and 
incidence of limited and extensive chronic GVHD. A maximum of 50 patients will be treated 
in phase II. Phase II will be conducted using the optimal dose (d*), chosen in  phase I. All 
patients treated at d* in phase I will be counted as part of the initial phase II  sample.  
 
Response rate (RR) = # of responses / # of patients with measurable tumors  
 
Complete response (CR) rate = # of complete responses / # of patients with measurable 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 18 of 25 
 tumors  
 
Phase II Rule for Monitoring DLT . Since ptox(d*) cannot be determined with perfect 
reliability in phase I, to guard against the possibility of excessive DLT, DLT will also be 
monitored in phase II. The probability of DLT at the selected dose d* from phase I will be 
considered too high if Pr{ptox(d*) > .20 | phase II data} > .80, with this rule applied after 
each cohort of 10 patients in the phase II sample. This ru le implies that d* is too toxic if [# 
DLTs]/[# patients evaluated] is greater than or equal to 5/10, 8/20, 11/30, or 13/40. If this 
occurs, then d* will be replaced by [CONTACT_778945] (d* -1), and phase II will be re -
started at d* -1. In that case, all patients  treated  at d*-[ADDRESS_1070726]  the 
maximum  of 50 patients  treated at d* -1. The same safety rule will then be applied, with d* -[ADDRESS_1070727] of d*. If d* -1 is found to  be too toxic, the trial will be terminated.

Data Analysis.  
The counts and percentages of each type of toxicity, GVHD by [CONTACT_479], and

12.0  Background Drug  Information  
12.1 Busulfan (IV  Busulfex®)  
Therapeutic Classification: Antineoplastic Alkylating agent  
Pharmaceutical data: Busulfan injection is a sterile, pyrogen -free solution provided in a 
mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG400). It is supplied 
in 10 ml single use ampoules at  a concentration of six (6) mg busulfan per ml. Each 
ampoule contains 60 mg of busulfan in 3.3 ml of DMA and 6.7 ml of PEG400. When 
diluted in normal saline or D5W to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, the resulting solution 
must be administered within eight ho urs of preparation.  
 
Stability and storage: Ampoules should be stored refrigerated at 2 -8°C (35 -46°F). Stable 
at 4°C for at least twelve months. DO NOT use if the solution is cloudy or if particulates 
are present.  
Solution Preparation: Prepare the busulfan  solution as follows: mix into normal saline to a 
final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.  
In each bag 6.0 mg busulfan (1.0 ml at 6 mg/ml and 11 ml saline) should be added to 
compensate for drug lost in the tubing with each infusion (approximately 12 ml at 0.5 
mg/ml is lost in the tubing when using the controlled rate infusion pump).  
Route of Administration: It is to be noted, that a sufficient amount of diluted busulfan 
should be added to compensate for the amount needed to prime the IV tubing; when 
hanging the i nfusate, the tubing should be primed with the busulfan solution and 
connected as close to the patient as possible, i.e. by a [ADDRESS_1070728] connector at the level of the 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 19 of 25 
 central venous catheter. After completed infusion, the tubing with remaining busulfan 
(approxim ately 12 mL) should be disconnected and discarded. All busulfan infusions 
should be performed by [CONTACT_306673].  
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
An infusion pump will be used with the busulfan solutions as prepared above. A n ew 
infusion set must be used for administration of each dose. Prior to and following each 
infusion, flush the catheter line with normal saline or (approximately 5 ml). Start the 
infusion at the calculated flow rate. DO NOT infuse concomitantly with another  
intravenous solution of unknown compatibility. If a delay in administration occurs after the 
infusion solution is prepared, the properly identified container should be kept at room 
temperature (20 -25°C), but administration must be completed within eight h ours of 
preparation including the three hour drug infusion.  
Side effects: Dose limiting toxicity is expected to be hematological when used without 
stem cell support. Other toxicities seen frequently following high -dose busulfan in 
preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation include: veno -occlusive disease 
(VOD), nausea, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis, seizures, rash, and an Addison’s -like 
syndrome.  
Mechanism of action: Interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA through 
DNA alkylation, a nd ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid function.  
Animal  Tumor  Data:  Busulfan  has been  shown  to be active  against  a variety  of animal  
neoplasm in vivo, including mouse sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich’s mouse ascites tumor. 
Human Pharmacology: Limit ed pharmacology data are available for the parenteral 
formulation to be used in this study and is detailed in the evaluation of IV Bu in a Phase 
II Trial using IV Bu at 0.8 mg/kg BW given over 2 hr every 6 hr for a total of 16 doses 
and when administered o nce daily for 4 days at a dose of 130 mg/m2 in combination 
with Fludarabine. The pharmacokinetic data suggests that the plasma decay of the 
formulation fits an open one -compartment model with linear pharmacokinetics in the 
dose range of 12 mg -130 mg/m2. Ba sed on studies of oral Bu, the drug is reported to be 
extensively metabolized; twelve metabolites have been isolated, but most have not been 
identified. The drug is slowly excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid. Ten 
to fifty percent (10 -50%) of a dose is excreted as metabolites within twenty -four (24)  
hours.  
 
12.2 Clofarabine  (Clolar®)  
Clofarabine is formulated as a concentration of 1mg/mL in [LOCATION_002] 
Pharamacopeia (USP) sodium chloride (9mg/mL), and USP water for injection (qs to 
1mL).  Clofarabine is supplied in 2 vial sizes: a 10mL flint vial and 20mL flint vial. The 10 
mL flint vials contain 5mL (5mg) of solution and the 20mL flint vials contain 20mL 
(20mg). For both vial types, the pH range of the solution is 4.0 to 7.0. The solution  is 
clear with color ranging from colorless to yellow and is free from visible particulate 
matter.  
Expected toxicities: myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, skin rash 
(particularly hand -foot syndrome), fatigue, mental status changes/coma , allergic 
reactions (including fever, muscle aches, edema, dyspnea), congestive heart failure, 
conjunctivitis, anorexia, febrile neutropenia, pruritus, headache, flushing and pyrexia, 
liver failure.  
Clofarabine Formulation and Stability: Clofarabine vials  containing undiluted clofarabine 
for injection should be stored at 25°C or 77°F with temperature excursion permitted to 
15 to 30°C or 59 to 86°F. Ongoing self -life stability indicate that clofarabine is stable for 
36 months at 25°C (±2°C) and 60% (±5%) re lative humidity and for 6 months at 40°C 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 20 of 25 
 (±2°C) and 75% (±5%) relative humidity.  
 
12.3 Rituximab (Rituxan® ) 
Description: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against CD20 primarily found 
on B lymphocytes. Rituximab causes cell lysis through complement mediated 
cytotoxicity and antibody -dependent cytotoxicity.   A biosimilar of rituximab may be used.  
 
Preparation and stability: Dilute with NS or D5W to a final concentration of 1 -4mg/mL. 
Solution is stable at 2 -8 degrees C for 24 hours and additional 24 hours  at room 
temperature. Rituximab is supplied as 100mg and 500mg vials.  
 
Administration: Administer according to institutional standards.  
 
Adverse reactions: infusion reactions (fever, chills, hypotension), rarely anaphylaxis, 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_138711], arrhythmias, lymphopenia, infection, hepatitis B 
reactivation, rarely progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, skin rash, tumor lysis 
syndrome, nausea/vomiting, arthralgias, myalgias, and severe mucocutaneous reactions 
(including  Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]).  
 
Storage: Diluted solutions of Rituximab should be stored refrigerated at [ADDRESS_1070729] 
sunlight. Do not freeze or shake.  
 
See package i nsert for additional information.  
 
12.4.  Thymoglobulin (Thymoglobulin®)  
Thymoglobulin® (Rabbit antithymocyte globulin, Genzyme Corporation) will be used as 
an in vivo immunosuppression.  
Therapeutic classification : Polyclonal anti -lymphocyte preparation.  
Stability and storage requirements : The lyophilized powder should be stored in a 
refrigerator at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F). Thymoglobulin should be used within [ADDRESS_1070730] is stable for 36 months at 5 -3°C and 12 months at 37°C. 
Reconstituted product is stable for 72 hours at room temperature 20 to  25°C.  
Preparation : Immediately  before  intravenous  administration,  dilute  reconstituted  
Thymoglobul in in isotonic saline or dextrose solution to a total infusion volume of 50 to 
500 mL (usually 50 mL of IV admixture solution per 25 mg  vial).  
Usual dosage range : 4.5-7.5 mg/kg over 3 days.  
Administration:  The recommended route of administration is intrave nous infusion 
through an  
in-line 0.[ADDRESS_1070731] 4 hours on subsequent days 
of therapy.  
Known side effects and toxicities : The most  common adverse reactions are fever, chills, 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, rashes, systemic infections, abnormal renal function 
tests, and serum sickness -like symptoms. Other reported side effects are arthralgia, 
chest and/or back pain, diarrhea, dyspnea/a pnea, nausea and vomiting.  
Mechanism of action : Possible mechanisms by [CONTACT_778947]: T -cell clearance from the circulation and modulation 
of T-cell activation, homing, and cytotoxic activities. Thymoglobu lin is thought to induce 
T-cell depletion and modulation by a variety of methods, including Fc receptor -mediated 
  
2012 -0506  Version 35, 09 April 2021  Page 21 of 25 
 complement -dependent lysis, opsonization and phagocytosis by [CONTACT_179968], and 
immunomodulation leading to long term depletion via antibody depe ndent cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity and activation induced cell death, commonly referred to as apoptosis.  
 
12.5.  Gemcitabine  (Gemzar®)  
SYNONYM(S): Gemcitabine hydrochloride, difluorodeoxycytidine, 2',2' -
difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC, LY 188011.  
CLASSIFICATION: Antimetabolite, cytotoxic  
MECHANISM OF ACTION:  
Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analog, is structurally similar to cytarabine, but has a wider 
spectrum of antitumour activity due to its different cellular pharmacology and 
mechanism of action.  
Gemcitabine is metab olized intracellularly to two active metabolites, Gemcitabine 
diphosphate (dFdCDP) and Gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). The cytotoxic effects 
of Gemcitabine are exerted through incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA with the 
assistance of dFdCDP, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of 
apoptosis. Gemcitabine is a radiation -sensitizing agent.5 It is cell -cycle phase specific 
(S and G1/S -phases).  
PHARMACOKINETICS: 3- to 4-fold interpatient and intrapatient variability. widely 
distributed into tissues; also present in ascitic fluid. plasma protein binding< 10%.

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:  
Carcinogenicity: No information found.  
Mutagenicity: Not mutagenic in A mes test but mutagenic in mammalian in vitro mutation 
test. Gemcitabine is clastogenic in mammalian in vitro and in vivo chromosome tests.  
Fertility: Decreased spermatogenesis and fertility in male mice.  
Pregnancy: FDA Pregnancy Category D. There is positi ve evidence of human fetal risk, 
but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despi[INVESTIGATOR_042] (e.g., if 
the drug is needed in a life -threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer 
drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).

Hemolytic uremic syndrome has been infrequently reported and is characterized by 
[CONTACT_778950], thrombocytopenia and renal failure. The syndrome 
can present either acutely with severe hemolysis, thrombocytopenia and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46541], or more insidiously with mild or no thrombocytopenia and slowly 
progressive rena l failure. The etiology of hemolytic uremic syndrome is unknown.The 
onset of the syndrome has been reported to occur during and shortly after Gemcitabine 
therapy. If not treated promptly, the syndrome may result in irreversible renal failure 
requiring dial ysis. Therefore, patients with impaired renal function should be monitored 
closely while being treated with Gemcitabine.  
Elevated liver enzymes: Gemcitabine causes transient and reversible elevations of liver 
function enzymes in about two -thirds of patient s. However, these increases are rarely of 
clinical significance and there is no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either 
longer duration of Gemcitabine treatment or cumulative dose.  
Fever/Flu -like symptoms: Fever of any severity was reported in 37% of patients. It is 
frequently associated with other flu -like symptoms such as headache, chills, cough, 
rhinitis, myalgia, fatigue, sweating and insomnia. These symptoms are usually mild and 
transient, and rarely dose -limiting. The use of acetaminophen may provide symptomatic 
relief.  
Severe pulmonary toxicity : Acute dyspnea may sometimes occur with Gemcitabine 
therapy,  but is usually self -limiting. However, severe pulmonary toxicities such as 
pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonitis and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome have 
rarely been reported. The symptoms are manifested as progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, 
hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph that are sometimes 
accompanied by [CONTACT_46594]. Pulmonary toxicities usually occur afte r several cycles 
of Gemcitabine, but have also been seen as early as the first cycle. Risk factors for 
pulmonary toxicities include prior radiation to the mediastinum.  
Because of its structural similarities to cytarabine, Gemcitabine is thought to cause lung 
injury by [CONTACT_46595][INVESTIGATOR_46543]. Management of 
pulmonary toxicities consists of discontinuation of Gemcitabine and early supportive care 
with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, diuretics, and/or oxygen. Although pul monary 
toxicities may be reversible with treatment, fatal recurrence of severe pulmonary symptoms 
was reported in one patient upon rechallenge with Gemcitabine.  
Skin rash : Typi[INVESTIGATOR_46544], with macular or finely granular 
maculopapula r pruritic eruption on the trunk and extremities. It is not dose -limiting and 
usually responds to topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]. If needed, antihistamines such as 
diphenhydramine can be used.

SOLUTION PREPARATION AND COMPATIBILITY:  
Injection : 200 mg and 1000 m g vials (as the hydrochloride salt). Store at room 
temperature.  
Reconstitute 200 mg vial with 5 mL of NS without preservative and 1000 mg vial with 25 
mL of NS without preservative to yield a Gemcitabine concentration of 38 mg/mL. 
Reconstitution of concent rations greater than 40 mg/mL may result in incomplete 
dissolution and should be avoided. Reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hours at room 
temperature and should not be days at room temperature and under refrigeration. 
However, the manufacturer recomm ends that the admixture be used within 24 hours since 
the solution does not contain preservatives.

General Information  
 
1.0 Purpose 
1.1 The purpose of this clinical study is to validate the SpO2 accuracy of the Stryker Sustainability 
Solutions pulse oximetry sensors during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 
as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_609] -Oximetry. Th e end goal is to provide 
supporting documentation for the SpO2 accuracy validation of the reprocessed sensors.  
In this study, the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by [CONTACT_98831]. The accuracy of a noninvasive 
pulse oximeter sensor will be assessed by [CONTACT_98832] a laboratory blood gas analyzer.  
It is required that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) performance of the Stryker pulse oximetry sensors will meet a specification of +/ -3% with a target of +/ -3% or better in non -motion 
conditions for the range of 70 - 100% SaO2 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], saturation is determined once with air 
breathing and then at one of 6 levels, e.g. 94%, 90%,  85%, 80%, 75% and 70% saturation for 
about 30 -60 seconds at each level), thereby [CONTACT_98833]2 accuracy 
performance specification.  
1.2 T his study is being conducted to support regulatory body approval  of pulse oximeter probes 
sterilized and/or decontaminated with Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide.

Intervention Model Description:  Subjects will recline for the study. Reference sensors will be placed on each subject 
to evaluate the SpO [ADDRESS_108702] devices will be 
evaluated over the oxygen saturation range between 70 -100%.

Primary Purpose:  Device Validation

Arms and Interventions:  
Experimental: Masimo and Nellcor SpO2 Adhesive 
Sensors, Adult 1859 , 2329 , MAX -A, & MAX-N 
 
Reference sensors from the reprocessed oximeter 
device will be placed on each subject to evaluate the 
SpO2 accuracy and performance.  Device: STRYKER SUSTAINABILITY SOLUTIONS Masimo and 
Nellcor PULSE OXIMETRY SENSORS  
An oximeter is a device used to transmit radiation at a known 
wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen 
saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered 
radiation. Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by [CONTACT_98834]. 
Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement, the pulse oximeter can provide non- invasive 
real t ime information.  
Sham Comparator: Covidien Nellcor SpO 2 Sensor, 
MAX -A and MAX-N 
A whole blood analyzer (CO -Oximeter) is used as the 
reference standard device for obtaining the 
functional SaO2 value from arterial blood samples 
obtained during the study.  Device: CO- OXIMETRY SENSORS 
A whole blood analyzer (CO -Oximeter) is used as the reference 
standard device for obtaining the functional SaO2 value from 
arterial blood samples obtained during the study.  
Primary Outcome Measures:

The Accuracy root mean square (ARMS) between measured SpO 2 and reference 
SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) must meet the 3 % specification for each Stryker 
Sustainability  Reprocessed pulse oximetry sensor style.  
 
Accuracy will be determined by [CONTACT_98837] a blood 
sample and calculating the arithmetic root mean square error (Arms) value. In order to obtain the Arms value, the blood oxygen saturation measurement is 
subtracted from the pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurement for a number 
of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of  the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the 
sum of the squares of bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.  
 
Fo
r each range specified, SpO2 ACCURACY of the PULSE OXIMETER EQUIPMENT 
shall be stated in terms of the roo t-mean -
square (rms) difference between 
measured values ( SpO2i) and reference values ( SRi), as given by [CONTACT_98838].

8.1 Intended Use: Reprocessed Masimo and Nellcor  Adhesive Pulse Oximeter Sensors are indicated 
for single patient use for continuous noninvasive arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate 
monitoring.  
8.2 Principle of Operation:  The principle of operation of pulse oximetry is based upon the 
fundamental principle that hemoglobin bound to oxygen (oxyhemoglobin) and hemoglobin unbound to oxygen (deoxyhemoglobin) vary in the absorption of different wavelengths of the light 
and the absorptions can be used to estimate SpO2 and PR.  The mechanism by [CONTACT_98839] (SpO2).  
8.[ADDRESS_108704]: The Reprocessed Pulse Oximeter 
Sensor provides the intended effect equivalent to the previously cleared pulse oximeter sensor in 
that it utilizes an optical sensor that is applied to the patient’s finger or  toe through which light is 
transmitted to the photodetector that detects the signal transmission.  The signal transmission is 
processed by [CONTACT_98840]2 and PR .

held for 30-60 seconds . At appropriate intervals and when oxygen levels are stable, arterial blood 
samples are obtained from the radial arterial catheter.   The operator then changes the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_98828] -state level of hypoxia.  A "run" consists of 
several stable steady -state hypoxia levels and together takes 10- 15 minutes. Each run is 
terminated by a breath of 100% O2 followed by [CONTACT_98842].  Two runs together enable obtaining a 
total of 20-[ADDRESS_108711] oximetry in a Radiometer ABL- 90 multi -wavelength oximeter. The precise 
target levels of saturation can be adjusted to suit the sponsor, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_98829], which is 70% to 100%.

shows a sudden fall or rise in oxygen saturation, not at the time of blood sampling.  This 
procedure accounts for the delays of finger circulation and uses the estimated delay from the lung to the sample site.  There is no useful correlation between the actual time of blood sampling and 
the oximeter recording because of the variability of tissue blood flow lag.  As mentioned, steady -
state hypoxia avoids the concern that oximeter reading is not aligned with a blood sample reading.

arterial saturation values) is determined by [CONTACT_98843]. This is a

muscular twitching or convulsions. This study will not seek to reach saturations below 70%. 
Hypoxia may cause tachycardia and increased blood pressure during the test, and might cause 
headache. In all the years of the lab conducting the study no subject has mentioned headache. 
Much more severe and prolonged lack of oxygen could cause brain injury or death, but the 
duration and depth of hypoxia is limited by [CONTACT_98846]. The needle catheter 
used to take blood may hurt when it is inserted despi[INVESTIGATOR_98830], and there may 
be a black and blue spot afterward. It is remotely possible the artery might be damaged or clot, or a tendon sheath near it be injured by [CONTACT_98847], resulting in some soreness. Th ese risks are 
unlikely because none of the enrolled 2000+ subjects has ever had a serious complication. 
Hyperventilating during the part of the study requiring reduced PCO2 may make subjects 
lightheaded or dizzy. Breathing air with added CO2 may make subjects feel short of breath and 
cause a headache. Some subjects feel faint when they arrive for the study, apparently related to 
the thought of having an arterial line. These subjects will likely be excluded from the study.  
18.2 Currently the FDA defines pulse oxi meters as Class II devices which transmit radiation at a known 
wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation and may be used alone or in conjunction with a fiberoptic oximeter  
catheter. All oximeters being used in this study work by [CONTACT_98848](s) through tissue to measure blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of 
reflected and scattered radiation. The devices under test and this study pr ocedure are considered 
Non-Significant Risk (NSR).  
The device and use of the device under test does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
A critical barrier to HIV -1 eradication is the maintenance of transcriptionally silent, 
replication competent proviruses in resting CD4+ T cells [1-3]. These proviru ses, which 
cannot be detected by [CONTACT_27639], comprise a reservoir with a very slow rate of 
decay [4,5] from which viremia can rebound when antiretroviral therapy is withdrawn. 
One pathway to eradication of HIV -1 requires activation of proviral transcription coupled 
with immune survei llance and elimination of residual cells harboring virus  [6]. The 
potential of this approach has been highlighted by [CONTACT_654065] -1 establishes and maintains latency.  
 
Controls on HIV -1 transcription inc lude cellular signaling machinery and epi[INVESTIGATOR_654036], with recent work highlighting several potential pathways for 
therapeutic interventions to release transcriptional control [7]. Clinical trials have tested 
candidate latency reversal agents, with  demonstrated  increases in measures of HIV -1 
RNA after treat ment of study participants with the histon e deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi ) 
vorinostat  [8,9], panobinostat [10], romidepsin [11,12], and the p hospha tase and tensin 
homolog inhibitor, disulfiram [13]. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_654037] -[ADDRESS_877530] demonstrated substantial sex -based differences between men and women in terms 
of vaccine responses, autoimmunity, and the acquisition and progression of infectious 
diseases [14,15] . Women bear a significant burden of the global HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], 
estimated at slightly more than half of worldwide infections, with a marked risk for young 
women to acquire HIV in sub -Saharan Africa (UNAIDS Global Factsheet, 2017). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_278507], women a re underrepresented in clinical trials relevant to HIV cure [16]. As a

  12/8/[ADDRESS_877531] genomes  [17]. Agents investigated in clinical trials to 
date have significantly lower efficiency at HIV -1 induction in vivo compared to the 
maximal induction observed in vitro with T cell receptor stimulation, requiring further 
research into potential synergistic approach es to enhance reactivation with a 
combination of agents. In an unbiased, genome -wide small hairpin  RNA (shRNA) 
screen, Karn et al  identified the estrogen receptor -1 (ESR -1) as a cellular factor critical 
to HIV -1 latency reversal in the Jurkat cell model (F igure 2.2-1).

reversal (left panel). Silencing of the ESR -1 with a shRNA activates transcription of HIV -1 as

FINAL Version 1.0  
  12/8/17  
 
These findings were validated in a primary cell model of HIV -1 latency  [18], where Karn 
and collea gues demonstrated that exposure to estrogen (or stilbestrol, an estrogen 
agonist) decreased HIV -[ADDRESS_877532] (F ulvestrant or gossypol) 
led to incre ased HIV -1 expression in combination with other activation stimuli ( Figure 
2.2-2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taken together, these data suggest that the estrogen receptor is a key cellular factor in 
modulating HIV -1 latency reversal, and, thereby, a potential therapeutic target. To probe 
the physiologic relevance of these observations, a cohort of HIV -infected wo men and 
men (matched on age, duration of viral supression, CD4 cell nadir and current CD4 cell 
count) with full viral suppression on ART was recruited for asessement of multiple 
metrics of HIV persistence. The women in this study had full viral suppression  of at least 
a year, had active menstrual cycles, and were not on hormonal contraception or 
replacement. Leukapheresis samples from women in this cohort on fully suppressive 
ART were exposed in vitro to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, or latency reversa l

enhanced the activity of vorinostat ( Figure 2.2 -3).  
 
The effect of combining TCR stimulation with estradiol ex vivo was significantly 
influenced by [CONTACT_654067]; leukapheresis samples from men displayed a 43 -fold higher 
induction of HIV RNA with exposure to TCR+estradiol compared to samples from 
women (p<0.[ADDRESS_877535]). Conversely, the combination of vorinostat and the estrogen 
antagonis t (ICI) had a larger induction effect among samples from women compared to 
men (fold effect 1.7, p<0.01). These ex vivo results are consistent with the cell line and 
primary cell in vitro models summarized above [14,15], suggesting an important role for 
hormonal modulation of HIV -[ADDRESS_877536] that 
concurrent exposure to estrogen may limit the e fficacy of latency reversal agents  
currently under study . Given the small size and exploratory nature of clinical trials of cure 
to date, the stark underrepresentation of women in trials relevant to cure  [16], and 
variation of endogenous estrogen levels over the course of a menstrual cycle, these 
findings argue for boosting the inclusion of women in trials with careful investigation of 
their hormonal milieu. Further, these results suggest a novel biological pa thway as a 
target for synergistic activation of HIV -[ADDRESS_877537]  is 
more pronounced in women than in men.

  12/8/[ADDRESS_877538] generally favorable safety profiles, with risks 
notable for venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular events, and inducing 
menopausal symptoms [19]. Tamoxifen is a SERM with an extensive record of clinical 
use with favorable pharmacologic properties. Tamoxifen is tak en orally, has a terminal 
half-life of [ADDRESS_877539] being more 
pronounced in females  (representative in the right panel) versus males  (left panel). 
Finally, the combination of the HDACi vorinostat with tamoxifen has already been tested 
among patients in a Phase II trial with refra ctory breast cancer and was well -tolerated 
[20]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.2-4. Direct assessment of the synergy between tamoxifen and vorinostat  
confirms that in a female participant  there is synergistic activation of transcription 
as measured by [CONTACT_654068].  
 
As above, multiple agents are currently under investigation for potential efficacy in 
latency reversal. Of those that have been used in clinical trials in the [LOCATION_002] and 
internationally, vorinostat , panobinostat, and romidepsin have all shown some e fficacy in 
induction of HIV RNA transcription. Panobinostat has the caveat of concerns about 
potential cardiac toxicity requiring more intensive monitoring during the period of 
administration. Romidepsin has anti -estrogenic activity, competing with β -estra diol for 

 21 A5366  
FINAL Version 1.0

binding to estrogen receptors in vitro and showing reversible effects on testes and 
ovaries in mice [21]. To isolate the effects of tamoxifen -mediated estrogen blockade, we 
have opted to use vorinostat, with the safety of this combination already demonstrated in 
the context of breast cancer.  
 
Taken together, preliminary data suggest a role for estrogen in the control of HIV -[ADDRESS_877540] cancer. The formation of tamoxif en active metabolites, including N -
desmethyl -tamoxifen, 4 -hydroxy -tamoxifen, and 4 -hydroxy -N-desmethyltamoxifen 
(endoxifen), is predominantly catalyzed by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2D6 [22]. Thus, 
alterations of tamoxifen metabolism through a modulation of the CYP system may 
directly affect the efficacy and t oxicity of tamoxifen. Inhibition of the CYP3A4 isoform 
with protease inhibitors, i.e., darunavir/ritonavir or cobicistat, would potentially decrease 
drug activity due to a significant decrease of active  metabolite formation. The impact of 
CYP3A4 and -2D6 i nduction by [CONTACT_654069], however, is difficult to predict in that increased 
generation of active metabolites could result in both improved efficacy and/or worse 
adverse effects, whereas a reduction in tamoxifen efficacy might be also possible due to 
overall increased systemic clearance [23]. There are no data to confirm these theoretical 
drug interactions between tamoxifen and antiretrovirals. A significant reduction in 
tamoxifen (86%) and N -desmethyl -tamoxifen (38%) exposures by [CONTACT_21446][INVESTIGATOR_654038] a ra ndomized, placebo -controlled, crossover study, suggesting that the 
efficacy of tamoxifen could be compromised by [CONTACT_654070]3A4 inducers [24]. 
Members of the non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class (NNRTIs), such as 
efavirenz and rifampin, are CYPP3A4 inducers. However, the clinical significance of 
interactions between tamoxifen and efavirenz remains unclear as efavirenz exhibits 
significantly weaker inductive effects (~3 fold) in comparison to that of rifampin (~6 fold) 
[25].  
 
The modulating effects of CYP system by [CONTACT_654071]3A4 have been noted [26-28]. The current consensus is that 
tamo xifen exhibits mild CYP3A4 inductive effects based on findings from a case report 
and a clinical study with unexpected 38% lower letrozole concentrations following 6 -
week combination therapy with tamoxifen [29,30] . There are no data currently available 
that document the effects of tamoxifen -mediated CYP3A4 induction on antiretrovi rals. A 
recommendation on the use of alternative non -CYP3A4 dependent regimens was made 
based on the theoretical interaction that tamoxifen might decrease protease inhibitor and 
elvitegravir concentrations. This recommendation, however, does not consider t he 
potent CYP3A4 inhibition by [CONTACT_654072] (ritonavir and cobicistat) used in 
 22 A5366  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  12/8/17  
 
combination with protease inhibitors and elvitegravir [31]. While a significant interaction 
between tamoxifen and darunavir/ritonavir or elvitegravir/cobicistat is unli kely, this 
requires confirmation by [CONTACT_654073]. Tamoxifen is also an inhibitor of P -
glycoprotein (P -gp) and endoxifen is a substrate of P -gp [32]. No P -gp mediated 
tamoxifen drug interactions, however, have been reported to date.  
 
Vorinostat  exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics in Phase I studies [33,34]. Cmax 
increased with dose between 100 -400 mg, but not when the dose exceeded 400 mg. Its 
mean t1/2 ranged f rom ~2 h our (400 mg daily) to 4 hour  (500 mg daily) and Cl/F 
decreased from 605 (100 mg BID) to 313 l/ hour (400 mg daily) . Meals containing high fat 
increase vorinostat exposure by 38% and significantly delay the absorption rate [35]. 
Vorinostat is prima rily metabolized through glucuronidation mediated by [CONTACT_654074] 
-1A1, -1A3, -1A7, -1A8, -1A9, -1A10 , -2B7, and -2B17 [36] into inactive metabolites, O -
glucuronide and 4 -anilino -4-oxobutanoic acid, whereas the cytochrome P450 system 
plays a negligible role in its metabolism [37], suggesting a low drug interaction potential 
between vorinostat and antiretrovirals . However, the inductive effects of vorinostat on 
multiple transporters including P -gp, breast cancer resistance protein, and multidrug 
resistance -associated proteins have been demonstrated in the in vitro studies, 
suggesting potential drug interactions with P -gp substra tes and/or inhibitors [38,39].  
 
Rationale for selection of study participants  
This protocol  focuses exclusively on women, seeking to specifically interrogate the role 
of the estrogen receptor pathway in HIV -1 latency reversal. Women represent 
approximately half of all individuals living with HIV -1 worldwide but are a minority of 
participants in clinical trials relevant to HIV -1 cure [16]. Clinical data suggests that there 
are relevant differences in virologic and immunologic measures between men and 
women and understanding how these differences may affect curative efforts is critical to 
ensure that an intervention will be likely to be efficacious in women as well as in men. 
For this initial trial, we have opted to include only postmenopausal women. The reasons 
for this are to maximize patient safety; due to  concerns  for potential genotoxicity of 
vorinostat, including only postmenopausal women eliminates concerns about future 
fertility. From the perspective of tamoxifen, the drug is less likely to induce menopausal 
symptoms in women who have already stopped m enstruating and has a significant track 
record of use within this population. To verify the role of the estrogen receptor pathway 
in this population, we examined cryopreserved PBMCs from four postmenopausal 
women on fully suppressive ART followed as part o f a longitudinal observational cohort 
(ACTG A5321). These samples were stimulated ex vivo and induction of HIV -1 RNA was 
measured using the EDITS ( Envelope Detection by [CONTACT_654075] -based 
Sequencing) assay, which measures inducible cell -associated  HIV-1 RNA. The 
production of RNA is normalized to a calibration curve of known cell inputs with HIV RNA 
expression. These results demonstrated a strong susceptibility to estrogen -mediated 
repression of transcription as well as an increase in HIV -1 RNA pro duction after a brief in 
vitro treatment with tamoxifen alone. In this set of samples, levels of HIV -1 RNA 
production induced by [CONTACT_654076] ( Figure 2.2-5).

3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a randomized, open -label, exploratory study among HIV -1-infected virologically 
suppressed postmenopausal women on ART to assess the effects of vorinostat versus 
tamoxifen and vorinostat on HIV -1 transcription. Participants (n=30) will be ra ndomized 
2:1 to receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 38 days (Arm A) plus two doses of vorinostat 
400 mg (days 35 and 38) or to a 38 -day observation period with no tamoxifen (Arm B) 
plus two doses of vorinostat 400 mg each (days 35 and 38).  
  
The lead -in pha se will allow tamoxifen to reach steady -state plasma levels and provides 
the opportunity to assess the influence of this SERM on HIV -1 activity and immune 
function alone prior to administration of vorinostat. Following HDACi treatment, all 
interventions wi ll be discontinued and observation will continue until day 65.

An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the 
conduct of the study  REGARDLESS of the attribution (i.e., relationship of event to 
medical treatment/study product/device or procedure/intervention). This includes any 
occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline 
condition.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_877587] been met:  
• All grade ≥3 AEs  
• All AEs that led to a change in study treatment regardless of grade  
• All AEs meeting SAE definition or EAE reporting requirement  
 
NOTE: SAEs or events meeting EAE reporting requirements should also be entered into 
the DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS ), an Internet -based reporting 
system.

7.3.3  Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, 
must be used and is available on the DAIDS RSC website at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/clinical -research -sites/ safety -reporting/daids -grading -tables . 
 
7.3.4  Expedited AE Reporting Period  
 
• The expedited AE reporting period for this study is for the duration of the 
protocol.  
• After the protocol -defined AE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only 
suspected, unex pected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), as defined in 
Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual, will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff 
become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available 
information).  
• Overdoses of vorinostat , should the st udy team be aware of them,  do not 
require expedited reporting, but will be reported to [COMPANY_006] every three  months 
by [CONTACT_295188] ( SDAC )/DMC. Overdoses of 
vorinostat should be recorded on the CRF and keyed in the database in a 
timely manner.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_877588] of the study via regular summaries 
pooled over treatment arms of accrual, baseline characteristics, data completeness , and 
specimen collection. The core protocol team will review individual participant -level safety 
data frequently to assess the relation of all reported AEs to study treatment; core team 
review of AEs will be unblinded to study treatment arm. In addition, the core team will 
regularly review by -arm summaries of  premature study discontinuations and premature 
study treatment discontinuations (and reasons), AEs, any missed vorinostat doses, and 
any reported interruptions or changes in  ART and HIV -1 RNA levels ≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
(see section 6.2.3). Any interruptions in tamoxifen will also be summarized and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_356522].  
 
The DAIDS clinical representative will review and assess EAE reports for potential 
impact on the study part icipant safety and protocol conduct as per DAIDS policies, 
guidance documents, and SOPs , as applicable.  
 
The study will undergo interim review at least annually by [CONTACT_654092] -
appointed Study Monitoring Committee (SMC). The SMC will review accrual , baseline 
characteristics, conduct of the study (including premature study discontinuations, 
premature study treatment discontinuations and any reported interruptions or changes in 
ART), AEs by [CONTACT_654093] (including core protocol team assessment of 
relationship to study treatment), CD4+ T -cell counts and HIV -1 RNA levels/suppression 
over time by [CONTACT_654093], and completeness of follow -up and sample 
availability. In particular, AEs of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding will be

enrolled and initiated study treatment. Regarding review of study implementation in 
terms of accrual, if the study has not enrolled 50% of the target sample size within [ADDRESS_877590] participant is enrolled (i .e., enrollment of n=15 within 12 months), 
this will trigger a review of the protocol by [CONTACT_654094]. This 
review will focus on barriers to enrollment and steps that the team and the ACTG can 
take to increase the pace of enrollment. Potential steps include changes to the protocol 
design, in particular the study eligibility criteria. If the study is no t able to accrue the 
target population and sample size, consideration will be given to possible study 
termination for futility. This discussion will also include members of the Cure TSG 
leadership. An interim review may also be convened if a concern is ide ntified by [CONTACT_654095], the study chairs, or study statisticians in consultation with 
the team. See also section 10.5 for statistical considerations related to interim 
monitoring.  
 
Detailed plans for study monitoring will be outlined in a Study Monitoring Plan developed 
by [CONTACT_163413] (SDMC) prior to enrollment of the first 
participant.

  12/8/17  
 
Vaginal Bleeding  
Participants should be instructed to report vaginal bleeding. If a participant develops 
vaginal bleeding, the site should consult with the core protocol team , which may 
recommend  tamoxifen discontinuation, an endometrial ultrasound, a gynecological 
evaluation , deferral of subseq uent vorinostat administration, and/or another course of 
action.  
 
Diarrhea/ Nausea/ Vomiting  
Participants are permitted to receive supportive care measures as considered 
appropriate by [CONTACT_654096]:  
• Diarrhea: Diarrhea should be treated promptly with appropriate supportive care per 
guidelines. Supportive care should begin at the first sign of poorly formed or loose 
stool, occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in one day , or unusually high 
volume of stool. Sup portive care should be deferred, and evaluation per standard 
clinical guidelines pursued, if blood or mucus is prese nt in the stool or if diarrhea is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_411]. Participants should also be advised to drink at least 2 
liters/day of clear fluids to help prevent dehydration.  
• Nausea and Vomiting : Nausea and vomiting should be managed according to 
standard practic e. 
  
Vorinostat Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Non-hematologic dose -limiting toxicity is defined as any confirmed symptomatic Grade 
≥3, if related (definitely, probably, or possibly) to vorinostat therapy, with the specific 
exception of:   
• Grade 3 vomiting or diarrhea th at lasts for less than 12 hours  
• Grade 3 elevation of liver function tests (LFTs), glucose, lipase, or creatinine without 
associated cli nical symptoms, lasting for 7 –14 days  
 
For any symptoms Grade ≥3 reported between the two scheduled vorinostat  doses, the 
following modifications may be considered  in consultation with the core protocol team : 
• Vorinostat dosing may be halted  
• Laboratory testing may be performed  
 
Any participant who does not complete the full vorinostat dosing schedule will have 
premature study treatment discontinuation evaluations performed as noted o n the SOE. 
The site should notify the core protocol team within [ADDRESS_877598] of care with referral to primary care and/or

tamoxifen arm (Arm A) will additionall y receive daily tamoxifen for 38 days  prior to and 
during receipt of vorinostat. Accrual of the targeted 30 participants is anticipated to take 
18 months.

definitely, probably, or possibly related to study treatment (as judged 
by [CONTACT_654054])

10.2.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single copy HIV -1 RNA assay  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Total HIV -1 DNA levels  
 
10.2.3  Exploratory  Outcome Measures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Integrated HIV -1 DNA levels, HIV p24 antigen expression , and ex vivo 
HIV-1 RNA expression  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  HIV-specific immunity and activation: HIV -1-specific immune

10.3 Randomization and Stratification  
 
Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A (tamoxifen and vorinostat) vs. Arm 
B (vorinostat alone), using permuted blocks. The rationale for the 2:1 randomization is 
that it provides for a greater number of participants to evaluate the safety of the 
combination treatment than in a 1:1 design.

10.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
Regarding the assessment of safety, the sample size of 20 participants in the tamoxifen 
plus vorinostat arm provides >90% probability of observing a treatment -related adverse 
event ([IP_ADDRESS]) that would occur in 11% or more of combination treated participants.  
 
The analysis of whether tamoxifen enhances the  viral re -activation effect of vorinostat 
will be based on a [ADDRESS_877602] of the change from baseline in resting CD4 cell -
associated HIV -1 RNA ([IP_ADDRESS]). With the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], the test will be 
based on a [ADDRESS_877603]  deviation (SD) of the change in log 10-
transformed cell -associated HIV RNA is assumed to 0.38, based on data from two 
longitudinal measurements in 18 virally suppressed individuals  [40]. A similar SD was 
seen in the recent ACTG A5342 study: SD=0.40. Note that a smaller SD was observed 
in the single -dose vorinostat study (SD=0.28, n=8 ) [8], but this was based on assaying at 
each time point  between18 -72 million resting CD4 cells obtained by [CONTACT_74886]; this 
study will instead obtain cells fr om large -volume blood draws and thus a smaller number 
of analyzed cells than in Archi n et al. (2012) is anticipated.  
 
With evaluable sample sizes of n=18 and n=9, respectively, in the two arms, the study 
will have 80% power to identify a 2.[ADDRESS_877604] on HIV transcription as assessed 
by [CONTACT_28474]-RNA  in the tamoxifen and vorinostat arm compared to vorinostat alone. To 
address the potential for early treatment or study discontinuation, or other analysis 
exclusions, an additional three  participants will be  enrolled. Hence,  the study will enroll 
and randomize a total of 30 participants.  
  
(To obtain 80% power for a 2.[ADDRESS_877605] size, n=14 and 7 evaluable are needed.  
With a 1 -sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_877606] size, n=18 and 9 are needed to 
achieve 80% power.)  
 
10.[ADDRESS_877607] been exposed to the study treatment will be included in 
this analysis. The primary safety outcome (see [IP_ADDRESS]) will be summarized 
separately by [CONTACT_2939], including a 1 -sided 95% confidence interval using 
exact binomial methods.  Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_654099], including reasons, separately by [CONTACT_2939].

Because the a im of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_654043], the primary 
efficacy analysis will be as -treated, limited to participants who received the full 
study treatment. In addition, any participant who interrupts ART or has confirmed 
HIV-1 RNA  level ≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] /mL between the pre - and post -treatment time 
points  will be excluded. The primary efficacy outcome ([IP_ADDRESS]) is the change 
from baseline (average of the pre -entry and entry time points ) to the post -
vorinostat time point  (5 hours following vorinostat  dosing) of resting cell -
associated HIV -1 RNA. The change (and the average of the pre -treatment 
measurements) will be done on log 10-transformed measurements; results below 
assay limits will be set to half the lower limit prior to statistical analysis. (Onl y a 
minority of results, estimated to be 10%, are anticipated to be below assay limit; 
[CONTACT_654114] , Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  personal communication.) The 
primary analysis to assess whether tamoxifen enhances the effect of vorinostat 
will be based  on a [ADDRESS_877608] for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_654044] 
a 1-sided alpha=0.1.  
 
10.6.2 Secondary Analyses  
 
Secondary analyses of HIV -1 persistence measures, immunologic 
measurements and histone acetylation will be analyzed similarly to the primary 
efficacy outcome (see 10. 6.1) but using 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 for each 
comparison. It is anticipated that measures of HIV -1 persistence will be log -
transformed prior to analysis. Plots and descriptive data summaries will also be 
presented, by [CONTACT_2939], including 95% confidence intervals of changes from 
baseline to post -baseline time points. This will address, for example, the potential 
effects of tamoxifen alone on HIV -1 reservoir measures. Because it is anticipated 
that a subs tantial fraction of single copy HIV -1 RNA measurements will be below 
assay limit, changes will be evaluated using statistical methods for longitudinal 
censored data [41]. The proportion below assay limit, by [INVESTIGATOR_216], will also be 
summarized longitudinally.  
 
Correlations between measurements will also be examined, in particular 
correlations between changes in the cell -associated RNA and changes in the 
other virologic and immunologic measures.  
 
While measurements at pre -entry and entry will be averaged to assess  treatment 
effects (see 10. 6.1), supplemental descriptive analyses will summarize the 
biologic and measurement variability, and stability, of the virologic and 
immunologic measures while on stable suppressive ART (i .e., prior to treatment 
intervention).  
 
Section 11.0, Pharmacology Plan, provides details of the analyses of the PK -
related objectives.

11.0 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 
A5366 is designed primarily to evaluate safety of a sequential combination of 3 8-day 
tamoxifen and vorinostat treatment and its effecti veness on latent virus reactivation in 
women who are suppressed on ART in comparison to that of vorinostat alone.  
 
Pharmacologic Considerations/Hypotheses:  
 
1. Tamoxifen pharmacologic effects are due to the parent drug plus the active 
metabolite . Drug interactions that influence the ratio of parent/metabolite may 
influence the receptor blockade that is thought to contribute to viral latency.  
2. Participant s will be on suppressive ART regimens that may have either inductive or 
inhibitory effects on metabolic pathways, thus influencing the ratio of tamoxifen 
parent/metabolite.  
3. Vorinostat is a P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inducer and tamoxifen is an inhibitor. Therefore, 
a pharmacokinetic interaction between vorinostat and concurrent tam oxifen may 
occur at the membrane transporter level.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_877609] dosing.  Dose information (date/time of the day 35 and day 38  
vorinostat  dose s) will be captured on an eCRF . 
 
11.2.2  Repeated trough samples of tamoxifen (Arm A) on day s 35, 38 , and 65. Dose 
information (date/time of last 3 doses) will be captured on an eCRF.  
 
11.2. 3 Antiretroviral plasma concentrations on day s 0, 35, 38 , and 65. Dose 
information (date/time of last 3 doses) will be captured on an eCRF.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  12/8/17  
 
11.3 Primary and Secondary  Data, Modeling, and Data Analysis  
 
11.3.1  Vorinostat. The intensive plasma samples will be required and used to calculate 
key pharmacokinetic parameters of vorinostat, including exposure, as indicated 
by [CONTACT_604888] (AUC) and clearance (Cl/F) due to its 
short half -life.  
 
11.3.2  Tamoxifen. Since tamoxifen exhibits a prolonged half -life (5 -7 days), the trough 
concentrations of tamoxifen w ill adequately represent its exposure .  
 
11.3.3  Pharmacodynamics. The vorinostat pharmacoki netic estimates and tamoxifen 
trough concentrations will then be used in analyses to correlate with the 
magnitude of HIV reactivation ([IP_ADDRESS]) and for comparison of exposure 
between participants with and without treatment -related adverse effects 
(10.2.1. 1). 
 
11.3.4  Drug interactions. The potential drug interactions between tamoxifen and 
selective antiretroviral agents including elvitegravir, dolutegravir, raltegravir , and 
efavirenz, will be explored as well as the relationship between 
pharmacokinetics an d changes in other biomarkers.  
 
11.4 Anticipated Outcomes  
 
We anticipate that participant s in A5366 will enter the study on a variety of ART  
regimens . These participant s will receive the recommended doses of tamoxifen and 
vorinostat, as per protocol, but t here will be a wide range of individual plasma exposures  
of these two agents  based on interpatient variability. The proposed clinical 
pharmacology objectives will provide additional PK data and strengthen the multivariate 
analysis that will help identify s pecific covariates that are associated with the primary 
outcomes as well as provide a confirmation of vorin ostat -driven HIV reactivation. The 
pharmacokinetic interactions between tamoxifen and selected antiretroviral agents will 
be explored to identify potentially significant ones for further investigation.  
 
12.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING

INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a woman who is 
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and you are currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs) 
to treat your HIV infection. This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_654108] s of Health (NIH). 
The doctor in charge of this study at this site is: ( insert name [CONTACT_789] ). Before 
you decide if you want to be a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
  
This is a consent form. It gives you informati on about this study. The study staff will talk with you 
about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to 
take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
ARVs are effective for treating HIV, but it is impossible to completely eliminate HIV infection 
from the body because some virus “hides” in the cells of the immune system. These cells with 
“hidden” virus are called latent im mune cells. If a person stops taking ARVs, the virus in these 
latent immune cells makes more copi[INVESTIGATOR_654050]. 
Some investigational medications (these are medications not approved by [CONTACT_654109] [FDA] ) have been shown to wake up these latent cells so that they can 
expel the virus that is hiding there, but these medications have only been partially effective and 
the results are not the same in all people. Early studies suggest that these m edications may not 
work as well for women as they do for men due to women’s hormones.  
 
This study will look at a medication (vorinostat) that has been shown to wake up latent immune 
cells. Vorinostat will be given with an approved  medication (tamoxifen) t hat blocks the hormone 
estrogen. Researchers will study whether these two medications given together are safe and 
tolerable. Researchers will also look at whether the two drugs work better together in waking up 
the latent virus in women than vorinostat giv en alone . Because Vorinostat is not an approved 
medication, taking it is considered experimental.

  12/8/[ADDRESS_877624] TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Screening  
If you would like to be in this study, after you have read and signed this consent form, you will 
come to the clinic for a screening visit to make sure you meet the requirements for joining the 
study. This will take about 1 hour. At this visit:  
• You will have a physical exam and answer questions about your medical history and any 
medications you are tak ing or have  taken in the past.  
• You will have approximately 2 tablespoons of blood drawn. This blood will be used for the 
following tests:  
o For routine lab tests for safety and to see if you are infected with  hepatitis B and/or C 
virus ( infection s of the liv er). 
o To measure the amount of HIV in your blood and to measure your CD4+ cell count (cells 
that help fight infection).  
• You will be asked to give blood (1 teaspoon) or a urine sample for a pregnancy test.  
• If your HIV status is unknown or not documented, additional blood may be drawn to confirm 
your HIV status. You may have to sign a separate consent form for this test.  
• You will have an electrocardiogram to look at the electrical activity of your heart.  
 
Pre-Entry  
If the tests at screening show that you are eligible for the study, you will have one more study 
visit before you join the study. This visit will take about 1 hour. At this visit:  
• You will have a physical exam.  
• You will have approximately 5 tablesp oons of blood drawn. This blood will be used for the 
following tests:  
o For routine lab tests for safety.  
o Some of the blood will be stored for future protocol -required testing.  
• You will answer questions about how well you take your antiretroviral (ARV) medications.  
 
If you enter the study  
At the study entry visit, you will be assigned to one of t wo treatment groups : 
 
Group  A:  
Days 0 -38: Tamoxifen 20 mg by [CONTACT_31943] a day  
Day 35: Vorinostat 400 mg PO (vorinostat will be given by [CONTACT_654110])  
Day 38: Vorinostat 400 mg PO  (vorinostat will be given by [CONTACT_654110])  
  
Group  B:  
Days 0 -38: Observation period (no tamoxifen)  
Day 35: Vorinostat 400 mg PO (vorinostat will be given by [CONTACT_654110])  
Day 3 8: Vorinostat 400 mg PO  (vorinostat will be given by [CONTACT_654110])  
 
Your assignment is random, like the flip of a coin. You will have a chance of being in each of the 
two groups, but you are more likely to be in Group A because more people will  be assigned to 
that group. You will not be able to choose your group, but you and the study doctor, as well as 
the study staff, will know which group you are in.  
 62 A5366  
FINAL Version 1.0

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
The drugs u sed in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed below. Please note 
that these lists do not include all the side effects seen with these drugs. These lists include the 
more serious or common side effects with a known or possible relationsh ip. It is very important 
 65 A5366  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  12/8/[ADDRESS_877626] the right to ask questio ns on possible and /or known risks.  
 
Risks of Vorinostat  
Vorinostat comes as a capsule to take by [CONTACT_1966]. It will be given to you with food. We will be 
with you when you take this medicine. Do not crush or open a vorinostat capsule. Swallow the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_654051].  The medicine inside the capsule can be dangerous if it gets in your eyes, mouth, or 
nose, or on your skin. If contact [CONTACT_110534], wash your skin with soap and water or rinse your eyes 
thoroughly with plain water.  
 
The risks associated with vorinostat have a g reater chance of occurring when vorinostat is taken 
every day  over several weeks. In this study, you will receive two doses of 400 mg v orinostat. 
Your total dose will be 800 mg . In previous studies  done with cancer patients who took  a single 
high dose (800 mg) of vorinostat, the drug was generally well tolerated . No serious clinical or 
laboratory abnormalities were reported and no patient had to leave the study  because of a bad 
side effect caused by  [CONTACT_188758].  
 
The most common side effects seen with this one time dose : 
• Nausea  (10%)  
• Fatigue  (9%) 
 
The most serious side effects observed with multiple doses of vorinostat taken  every  day for 
many weeks are:    
• The development of blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)  
• The development of blood clots in the lungs or pulmonary emboli (4 out of 86 patients or 
4.7%)  
• Squamous cell carcinoma (3 out of 86 patients or 3.5%)  
 
Additional side effects were seen when people were given multiple doses of vorinostat every  
day for many weeks. These included:  
• Nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea (40 -50%)  
• Loss of appetite  
• Dehydration  
• Vomiting  
• Low red blood cell counts or anemia (2 out of 86 patients or 2.3%)  
• Low platelet counts  
• Weight loss (10 -20%)  
• Decreased kidney f unction  
• Altered taste  
• Increase in blood sugar  
• Constipation (10% or less)    
 
Although some of the serious side effects noted above occurred in a study population with 
cancers, we still need to  let you know this information.  We think you are unlikely to experience 
these side effects with the two doses of vorinostat that you will receive in this study.

  12/8/[ADDRESS_877627] at are: cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation), death (of unknown 
cause), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot), enterococcal (bacterial) infection, exfoliative 
dermatitis ( scaly  skin), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding in the stomach or intestine), 
infection, lobar pneumonia, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ischemic stroke (stroke caused 
by a clot), pelvi -ureteric obstruction, sepsis (blood infection), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], streptococcal 
bacteremia (bacterial infection in the blood), fainting, T -cell lymphoma, thrombocytopenia (low 
platelet count) , and ureteric obstruction (obstructions in the tubes that drain urine from the 
kidneys to the bladder).  
 
Vorinostat  has the potential to be “genotoxic”, that is, it could cause damage to your genes that 
might increase your risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876].  
 
Dehydration often occurs when you take this medicine. You will need to drink at least 1 liter of 
water (32 ounces or 4 cups)  on the days that you are receiving the drug to keep from getting 
dehydrated.  
 
Risks of Tamoxifen  
Tamoxifen comes as a tablet that you should swallow whole, with water or another non -
alcoholic drink. You may take tamoxifen with or without food but you should take it at about the 
same time each day.  
 
Although study doctors think it is unli kely, tamoxifen may decrease some the levels of ARV 
medications in your blood.  
 
The following serious side effects have been associated with the use of tamoxifen . The side 
effects listed below are more common in people who have received longer courses of t amoxifen 
than will be given in this study. If you have any of the following signs or symptoms contact [CONTACT_654112].  
 
Changes in lining (endometrium) or body of your uterus (womb). These changes may be due to 
serious problems such as cancer of the uterus. If you have these changes , you may notice:  
• Vaginal bleeding or bloody discharge that could be a rusty or brown color  
• Pain or pressure in your pelvis (below your belly button)  
 
Blood clot s. These can occur in your veins or lungs  or can cause a stroke. These may be 
serious  and can cause death. You may get clots up to [ADDRESS_877628] a  blood clot, you may notice:  
• Sudden chest pain  
• Shortness of breath   
• Coughing up blood

Risks of Electrocardiogram  
You may experience mild irritation, slight redness, and itching on your skin where the electrodes 
from the electrocardiogram machine are placed.  
 
Risks of Social Harm  
It is possible that participating in this study will make it difficult for you to keep your HIV status 
secret from people close to you. This may lead to unwelcome discussio ns about or reactions to 
your HIV status. Please talk with the study staff if you are worried about this.  
 
Risks of Stored Samples  
There is a risk that your stored samples and/or health information may be misused. There are 
laws against this kind of misus e, but they may not fully protect you. The chance that this will 
happen is considered small because of the security taken with your samples and information.  
 
Risks to Future Study Participation  
If you participate in this study you may not be able to parti cipate  in future studies because you 
have taken tamoxifen and/or vorinostat.  
 
 
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 
Vorinostat and tamoxifen are not safe  for unborn babies. You can only participate in this study if 
you are postmenopausal (you no longer have a menstrual period) at the time of study entry and 
if you agree not to participate in assisted reproductive technology in the future.

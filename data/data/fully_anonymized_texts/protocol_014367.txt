Leukemia and Myelodysplasia 
 
Study Chairperson: John E. Wagner, M.D. 
Study Co-Chair: Joanne Kurtzberg, M.D. 
Primary Objective:  The primary objective is to determ ine the efficacy of using two UCB 
units versus one UCB unit.  The pr imary endpoint is one-year survival. 
Secondary Objectives:  Patients randomized to the two study arms will be compared for the 
following endpoints: disease-free surv ival, incidences of neutrophil 
and platelet engraftment, chimerism, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, transplant-r elated mortality, infections, 
immune reconstitution, and relapse. 
Study Design:  This study is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center, 
prospective study of single UCB transplantation vs. double UCB 
transplantation in pediatric patien ts with hematologic malignancies. 
Accrual Objective:  The target sample size is 110 pa tients per study arm (total of 220 
patients). 
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is five years to enroll the targeted sample 
size. 
Eligibility Criteria:  Patients 1-[ADDRESS_1210390] be HLA-matched at 3 of  6 HLA-A and B (intermediate 
resolution molecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and DRB1 (high resolution molecular 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) with each other and [ADDRESS_1210391] 1.5 x 107 per kilogram. 
Patients will be randomized no more th an 14 days prior to initiation of 
conditioning.  UCB units will be shipped prior to initiation of 
conditioning.   
Treatment Description:  The preparative regimen will consist of: 
- Fludarabine: 25 mg/m2/day IV on Day –10, –9 and –8. 
- Total Body Irradiation (TBI): 165 cGy twice daily on Day –7, –6, 
–5 and –4. 
- Cyclophosphamide: 60 mg/kg/day x 2 on Day –3 and –2. 
- Rest on Day –1. 
- Day 0 will be the day of the UCB transplant.

(UCB) transplantation, cell dose is identified as an important factor  influencing the incidence and 
rate of hematopoietic recovery, risk of transplant-related morta lity and probability of survival.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_867569]-matc hed UCB units, which always 
augments the graft cell dose, is  safe and may improve neutrophil recovery and survival.  To 
determine whether the infusion of two UCB units enhances survival, a multi-center, open-label, 
randomized trial is proposed.  As adequate si ngle UCB units can be identified for > 80% of 
pediatric recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (in contrast to < 30% for adults), this study will be open only to pediatric 
patients.  The population will be restricted to patients with hi gh-risk hematologic malignancy, 
the most common indication of UCB transplantation in children.  
1.2. Background 
 
Human UCB contains sufficient nu mbers of hematopoietic stem ce lls (HSC) for transplantation 
as evidenced by [CONTACT_867627] i mmune reconstitution of UCB cell derived donor 
cells after myeloablative therapy.  A recent survey by [CONTACT_867628] 180,[ADDRESS_1210398] been performed.  UCB tr ansplants offer several advantages over adults 
bone marrow or peripheral blood stem  cell transplants, including: 
1. Rapid availability; 
2. Absence of risk to the mother or infant donor; 
3. Reduced incidence of some blood-borne inf ectious disease agents (e.g., Epstein-Barr 
virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV]); 
4. Reduced donor attrition; 
5. Reduced risk of severe acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the setting of donor-
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_768382] (as compared to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867570]). 
 1.2.1.  Unrelated Donor UCB Transpla ntation: Clinical Results 
 The first UCB transplantation was performed by [CONTACT_732905]. in [ADDRESS_1210399] repository of unrelated donor UCB was 
established in [LOCATION_001]2, 3.  Currently, private and publicly funded UCB banks worldwide store 
an estimated 180,000 cryopreserved HL A-A, B, and DRB1 typed units4.  Several findings 
emerge from review of the literature.

Engraftment.   The incidence of neutrophil recovery  after single UCB transplantation ranges 
from 65-92% in larger series 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.  Findings consistently reported 
include the following: 1) Engraftment after UCB tr ansplantation is signif icantly slower and less 
complete than after bone marrow transplantation6, 18, 19. 2) Time to neutrophil and platelet 
recovery is cell dose dependent with more rapid recovery in those receiv ing higher cell doses.  
In a report by [CONTACT_732905].14, a graft nucleated cell dose > 3.7 x 107/kg was associated with 
shorter time to neutrophil recovery (25 vs. 35 days).  Similarly, Rubinstein et al.7, 16 
demonstrated that a step-wise increase in gr aft nucleated cell dose was associated with 
progressively shortened time to neutrophil recovery.  Further, this study showed graft CD34+ 
cell dose predicted speed of recovery.  3) There is a threshold cell dose required for consistent 
engraftment.  Rubinstein et al.16 suggested that the threshold was a cryopreserved nucleated cell 
dose ≥ 2.5 x 107/kg; while Wagner et al.5 observed a threshold infused  CD34+ cell dose of ≥ 1.7 
x 105/kg5.  Other prognostic factors are also reported but are not as consistently observed as the 
association with cell dose. As one example, Rubinstein et al.7, 16 observed a relationship between 
HLA match and neutrophil recovery (23 days  for HLA-matched versus 28 days for HLA 
mismatched grafts, p=0.0027); this association was not observed by [CONTACT_732905].14 and 
Wagner et al.5. 
 GVHD .  The incidence of acute GVHD reported in la rger series ranges from 33-44% and 11-
22% for grades II-IV and II I-IV acute GVHD, respectively
5, 6, 7, 14.  The incidence of chronic 
GVHD ranges from 0-25%5, 6, 7, 14.  These results are particular ly notable since most UCB donor-
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867571] 1-[ADDRESS_1210400] 
studies demonstrate no or weak associations between HLA match and occurrence of GVHD.  
Although few in number, Rubinstein et al.16 did report a significantly lower rate of acute GVHD 
in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570]-matched gr afts with no further increase obs erved in those with increasing 
HLA disparity (1 vs. 2 vs. 3 antigen mismatch es).  Associations between HLA-match and 
chronic GVHD are not reported.  Survival.  The probability of survival after single UCB transplantation ranges from 18-78% in 
larger series 
5, 6, 7, 14.  This wide range can be explained, in part, by [CONTACT_867629].  However, nearly all studies demonstrate a significant relationship 
between UCB cell dose and survival. The associa tion between HLA match a nd survival is more 
controversial, which may, in part , be explained by [CONTACT_867630][INVESTIGATOR_29039].  For 
example, Locatelli et al.[ADDRESS_1210401], in two series by [CONTACT_867631]. (562 patie nts and subsequently 
updated for 862 patients) and Wagner et al., a si gnificant association between HLA-mismatch 
and survival was observed5, 7, 16.  Further, data comparing the results of 492 unrelated donor bone 
marrow transplants and 508 UCB transplants in pa tients younger th an 16 years from the Center 
for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the [LOCATION_001] Blood 
Center indicates a significant association betw een degree of HLA disparity and overall and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210402] after HLA-matched UCB tr ansplantation (60%); probabil ities were similar after HLA-
matched bone marrow transplants and UCB transpla nts mismatched at 1-locus with cell dose  
> 3.0 x 107/kg (40% and 41% respectively).  Probabiliti es were lower with 1-antigen mismatched 
bone marrow, 1-antigen mismatched UCB with cell doses ≤ 3.0 x 107/kg and UCB grafts 
mismatched at 2-loci (30%, 36%  and 33% respectively) .  Importantly, the da ta demonstrate an 
impact of cell dose within each mismatch category (one or two antigen mismatch) in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867572].  For those with a one-antig en mismatched UCB graft, recipi [INVESTIGATOR_867573] (> 3.0 x 107/kg) had a probability of survival that was similar to that observed after 
HLA-matched BM.  Among those with a two-antigen  mismatched UCB graft, higher cell doses 
were associated with improved su rvival but were still inferior to that observed with better HLA-
matched UCB units.  Together these data suggest that graft selec tion should be principall y based on HLA match for 
those units with an acceptable cell dose ( ≥  2.5 x 10
7/kg).  
 1.2.2.  Cord Blood Transplantation Study (COBLT) Study 
 Recent results of COBLT, a multi -institutional, prospective NIH- sponsored trial of unrelated 
donor UCB transplantation have further adva nced the field of UCB transplantation
19.  In this 
Phase II study, 191 pediatric patients diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy [(median age = 
7.7 years) (range: 1-18)]; [(medi an weight = 25.9 kg) (range: 7.5  – 118.4 kg)] were transplanted 
with one UCB unit.  All patients received to tal body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide and 
antithymocyte globulin (ATG) fo r pre-transplant conditioning a nd post-transplant cyclosporine 
and methylprednisone for GV HD prophylaxis.  Sixty-one percent were males, 51% CMV 
seropositive and 28% of ethnic minority back grounds.  The median cell dose delivered as 
measured by [CONTACT_7416]-cryopreservation cell count was 5.2 x 107 cells/kg and 1.5 x 105 CD34 
cells/kg.  Donor selection was based on low re solution DNA-based HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_867574] I A and 
B and high resolution DNA-based t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_867575]1.  Retr ospectively, d onor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867576] I A, B, C and Class II DRB1 by [CONTACT_83502][INVESTIGATOR_867577], GVHD, relapse and survival.  The 
primary endpoint of the study was 180-day survival and secondary  endpoints included disease-
free-survival, incidence of  neutrophil and platelet engraftmen t, incidence of acute and chronic 
GVHD, infection burden a nd incidence of relapse .   
 Engraftment .  The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment, defined as achieving an ANC 
of 500/mcL by [CONTACT_2006] +42 with > 90% donor chimerism,  was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
69-81%).  The cumulative incidence of platelet e ngraftment, defined as maintaining a platelet 
count of > 50 x 10
9 /L without transfusion support, by [CONTACT_2006] 180 was 50% (95% CI 42-59%) as 
shown below:

In multivariate analysis, the pre-cryopreservati on cell dose (P= 0.05) and gestational age of the 
UCB donor (P = 0.04) were sign ificant predictors of engr aftment.  HLA matching, low 
resolution or high resolution, was not  associated with engraftment. 
 Graft-versus-Host Disease.  The cumulative incidence of acute  grades III/IV GVHD at Day +100 
was 19% (95% CI 12-24%).  The incidence of  chronic GVHD at 1 year was 20% (95% CI 15-
26%) with 70% of the chronic GVHD classified as  limited disease.  In multivariate analysis, 
HLA matching was associated with the incidence of GVHD (P = 0.007). 
 Disease-free Survival (DFS) .  Most of the children enrolled on this study had high risk (beyond 
first remission) hematologic malignancies.  Thei r cumulative incidence of relapse at one year 
was 19% (95% CI 14-25%).   Overall 95/191 patients died on stud y, with 41% of deaths from relapse, 19% from graft failure 
and 18% from GVHD (50% of those dying from GVHD had infection as a secondary cause of 
death).  Overall survival at 180 days and one year was 67% (95% CI 61-74% ) and 57% (95% CI 50-
64%), respectively with a median follow-up of 24 months.  In multivariate analysis, factors associated with survival in cluded early engraftment P = < 0.001), recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867578] (P = 0.002) and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867579] (P = 0.01).  Total nucleated cell dose significantly impacted engraftment and survival, but CD34 dose did not 
correlate with either suggesting that CD34 may not  be the ideal surrogate marker for stem cell 
dose in UCB transplantation.

banks, selecting appropri ate units for transplantation and performing UCB successfully in a 
variety of conditions, particularly  in children.  The main clinical  lessons learned were 1) that 
outcomes were sufficiently good to perform unrel ated UCB transplantation as a reasonable 
alternative for children with hematologic mali gnancies considered appr opriate indications for 
transplantation but no HLA-iden tical sibling donor; an d, 2) that the major transplant-related 
causes of death were the slow rate and low incidence of engr aftment and the risk of GVHD. 
 Immune Reconstitution Studies.   The pace and quality of immune reconstitution after unrelated 
donor cord blood transplantation is an important predictor of overall outcomes.  Multiple factors 
may influence immune reconstitution including, but not limited to, the cell dose and quality of 
the donor graft, HLA-matching, GVHD, age, prep arative regimen and in fections.  Previous 
studies in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867580], 
as measured by [CONTACT_398]4 counts, PHA responses and leve ls of TRECs, is more rapid in children (1 
year) than adults (3 years)
20.  In the COBLT Study, pediatric pa tients between 1-18 years of age, 
enrolled on the pediatric malignancy strata were longitudinally evaluated over a 3-year period for 
the presence of T cells capable of recognizing herpes virus spec ific antigens.  Approximately 
43% of patients developed a positive T lymphocyte proliferative response to one or more herpes viruses and that group had a lowe r probability of post-transplant leukemic relapse.  The presence 
of herpes virus reactive T cells did not correlate with  immunophenotypic T lymphocyte 
reconstitution, graft cell dose or th e presence of acute or chronic GVHD.  In the current study, 
these observations will undergo additional study with specific emphasis on the contribution of 
donor-derived naive T cells to immune reco nstitution.  Since the COBLT study has shown 

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
1-6 poorer correlations with more tr aditional measures of immune reconstitution (e.g., CD4, mitogen 
responses), this study will test interventions th at directly challenge the developi[INVESTIGATOR_867581]-transplant period.  Acco rdingly, children will be immunized with tetanus 
vaccine at [ADDRESS_1210403] transplants. 
 1.2.3.  Double UCB Transplantation 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Double UCB transplantation after my eloablative preparative therapy 
 It is clear that cell dose is a cr itical determinant of hematopoiet ic recovery and survival after 
single unrelated donor UCB transplantation
6.  However, unlike bone marrow or peripheral blood 
stem cell transplantation where large numbers of cells may safely be harvested, the number of 
cells obtained from a single UCB unit is limited.  Since the number of UCB cells needed to 
safely transplant a patient is calculated on the basis of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s body weight, adolescents 
and adults (typi[INVESTIGATOR_867582] 70–90 kg ) require larger numbers of U CB cells than children (typi[INVESTIGATOR_867583] 10-20 kg), as noted above.  The limita tion of cell dose is a major obstacle in the 
application of UCBT to adolescents and adults. 
 Various methods of augmenting UCB cell dose have been considered
21, 22.  One strategy is to 
infuse two UCB units.  This strategy has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_867584]-matched with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (4-6/6 
HLA match) and with each othe r.  The hypothesis was the incr eased cell dose would enhance 
engraftment.  In a Phase I-II study, 23 consecu tive patients (median age 24 years [range: 13-53]; 
weight 73 kg [48-120]; 57% male; 61% CMV positive)  were transplanted with two UCB units.  
All patients received  cyclophosphamide 120 mg/ kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m2 and TBI 1320 cGy 
pre-transplant and cyclosporine, mycophenolat e mofetil (MMF) and filgrastim (G-CSF) after 
UCB infusion.  Engraftment .  The incidence of sustained donor engraf tment was 100% at a median of 23 days 
(range 15-41) post-transplant.  All patients had complete donor chimerism and there were no 
secondary graft failures.  By [CONTACT_2006] 18 0, the incidence of platelets > 50 x 10
9/L was 71% (95% CI: 
47-95%).  These data demonstrate the safety of double UCB infusion in terms of engraftment, a 
previous concern because of the theoretical poss ibility of bi-directiona l immunological rejection.

1-7 Chimerism.   In this series, 16 (76%) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867585] 21.  
While the remaining five patien ts (24%) had evidence of both units at Day 21 (median total 
donor chimerism 91% [range 64-100%]), one unit predominated (median 74% [range 42-85%] versus 20% [range 15-40%]).  Skewed engraftm ent progressed such that evidence of ‘double 
chimerism’ was observed in only two patients at Day 60, and in none by [CONTACT_2006] 100 (n=17).  The 
relative percent viability, orde r of infusion, ABO match, gender match, infused cell dose and 
HLA match of the UCB units did not pr edict which unit would predominate. 
 GVHD and Transplant-relat ed Mortality (TRM) .  Incidences of grad e II-IV and III-IV acute 
GVHD were 65% (95% CI 42-88) a nd 17% (95% CI 2-32), respec tively.  Of the three patients 
with grade III-IV acute GVHD, one had involvement of skin  only, one of skin and gut, and one 
of skin and liver.  All res ponded to immunosuppression.  Five patients have had chronic GVHD 
(all extensive) for a cumulative incidence of  23% (95% CI 6-40%).  Six month TRM was 22% 
(95% CI 5-39%).  Disease-free Survival (DFS) .  With a median follow-up of  10 months (range: 3.5 months-2.5 
years), the probability of DFS at 1 year is 57% ( 95% CI 35-79%).  For those in remission at the 
time of transplantation (n = 15), DFS was 72% (95% CI 49-95%) versus 25% (95% C0-64%), 
respectively (P=0.04) (Figure [IP_ADDRESS]).  Causes of death we re GVHD/infection (n=3), 
GVHD/organ failure (n=2), hemorrhage (n=1), and relapse (n=3).

on the COBLT study despi[INVESTIGATOR_867587] 5 x 107/kg.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_867588] e University of Minnesota demonstrate an 
improved rate of engraftment (> 95%) with much  lower cell doses administered overall.  The 
mechanisms underlying the effect on engraftm ent are currently unknown.  They could be 
secondary to a facilitating function provided by [CONTACT_867636], a difference in the 
preparative regimen (e.g., substitution of fludarabine for ATG) or GVHD preparative regimen (e.g., substitution of Cellcept for steroids) or another yet to be discovered phenomenon.  None-
the-less, the superior engraf tment with the Minnesota double cord protocol leads to the 
hypothesis that double cords may also be bene ficial in children a nd that the mechanism 
underlying this benefit is not simply related to in cremental increases in ce ll dose, but instead is 
related to more complex interac tions between the donors and the host.  Furthermore, we expect 
that increased rates of engraftment will result in improved rates of overall survival.  Effects on rates of GVHD, early and late TRM, and leukemic  relapse (the leading cause of death in the 
COBLT study) are unknown but will be examine d.  The number of T lymphocytes will 
significantly increase with the use of two units.  Additionally, the requireme nt for two units will 
increase the likelihood of infu sing at least one that is [ADDRESS_1210405] an available unit 
with the minimum cell dose of 2.5 x 10
7/kg and thus would not be eligible for randomization.  
Further immune reconstitution is bi ologically different in children as compared to adults and this 
is an important endpoint of the study.  Thus, this study will test whether the addition of a second cord blood unit to a conventional cord 
blood transplant is beneficial.  We will speci fically study whether the double cord transplant 
improves rates of overall survival and engraftment, without increasing rates of GVHD, while decreasing rates of leukemic relapse.

randomization.  Based on prior analyses, a cell dose of 2.5 x 10
7 nucleated cells/kg is required 
for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867590].  Therefore, the following selection algorithm will be used. 
• Unit [ADDRESS_1210414] available HLA-ma tched (with the patien t) UCB unit with a 
nucleated cell dose ≥ 2.5 x 107 /kg except as noted below. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
2-4 • Unit [ADDRESS_1210415] HLA-matched UCB with a nucleated cell dose ≥  1.5 x 107/kg 
that is at least 3 of 6 HLA-A, B and DRB1 HLA loci with Unit 1.   
 General Comments: 
• Unit selection is based on cryopreserved nucle ated cell (NC) dose & HLA-A, B, DRB1 
matching using intermediate resolution A a nd B and high resolution DRB1 typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Each 
unit must be at least 4/6 HLA-matched with the patient. 
• CD34+ cell dose will not be used for unit selection unless [ADDRESS_1210416] blood bank.  Then the unit with the larger CD34+ dose 
should be selected. 
• A UCB unit that is 5/6 matched but homozyg ous at the locus of mismatch should be 
chosen over a 5/6 unit with bidi rectional mismatch even if the latter unit is larger (has 
more cells).  This also applies to 4/6 units.  This is only applic able to choosing units 
within a given match level.  
• If the patient is randomized to receive a single UCB unit,  choose the best HLA-matched 
unit from all units with a dose 2.5 x 107/kg (this may not be the same unit chosen to be 
Unit [ADDRESS_1210417] blood transplant since the selection of Unit 1 may be influenced 
(within a given match level) by [CONTACT_867638]-Unit HLA-matching).  
• Within an HLA match level, the unit contai ning the greatest number of cells will be 
chosen.  If there are two units of  equivalent cell dose (± 0.5 x 107/kg) within a match 
level, choose the unit with match by [CONTACT_867639] r resolution molecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], if known).

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Fludarabine 
 Fludarabine 25 mg/m
2/day will be administered over 30-60 minutes intravenous infusion on 
Days –10 through –8.  Fludarabine will not be dose adjusted for body weight.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Cyclophosphamide 
 Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day will be administer ed as a 2 hour intravenous infusion with a 
high volume fluid flush on Days –3 and –2.  Cy clophosphamide dose adjustments for ideal body 
weight are recommended but not required.  Dose s and schedule for uroprotective agents (i.e., 
mesna) should follow local institu tional guidelines.  For patients weighing more than 125% of 
their IBW, cyclophosphamide will be dosed based on the adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW).  The following are dose adjustment formulas:  
Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Formulas: 
 
Patients Over 18 Years 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
 
Patients 1 to 18 Years of Age 
 
Less than 60 inches 
IBW = (ht2 x 1.65)/1000 where ht = cm, IBW = kg 
 
More than 60 inches 
Males IBW = 39.0 + [2.27 x (ht - 60)]  where ht = inches, IBW = kg 
Females IBW = 42.2 + [2.27 x (ht - 60)] where ht = inches, IBW = kg 
 
 Adjusted Ideal Body Weight Formula: 
 
 AIBW = IBW + [(0.25) x (ABW - IBW)] 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Radiotherapy 
 Patients may be treated either in the AP/PA position and/or in the right and left lateral position.  
Compensators or blocks may be used to compen sate for the thinner part s of the anatomy (neck, 
head, lower legs, and feet).  Total dose will be [ADDRESS_1210419].

  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
2-6  
The dose along the central axis of the patient shoul d be kept to within 10% of the prescription 
dose.  Compensators, bolus, or transmission blocks  may be placed in an effort to accomplish this. 
 To compensate for decreased attenuation through th e lungs, partial compensators may be used to 
prevent the lung dose from exceeding
 the prescription point dose.  No adjustments are made for 
lower lung density.  The estimated lung dose is calculated  by [CONTACT_867640]-axis thickness in 
the mid-lung area: 
• If the patient is treat ed with AP and PA fields, the l ungs may be partially blocked with 
50% transmission blocks such that the lung r eceives an estimated minimum of 675 cGy.  
With the use of 50% transmission blocks, an  anterior and posterior electron chestwall 
boosts, calculated to D90, where electron ener gy is selected to place the D90 at the 
pleural surface, must be empl oyed.  300 cGy per fraction for a total of two fractions will 
be given to both the anterior and posterior ch estwall.  Regardless of the partial blocking 
used, the lung may receive an estimated maximum of the prescription dose (1320 cGy). 
• If the patient is treated with right and left lateral fields, separations are taken with the 
arms placed along the axis of the thoracic cavity, and the tissue deficit calculated 
(without lung correction).  Since the effect ive thickness at th e level of the mid-
mediastinum is often greater than the thic kness at the umbilicus, this may be all the 
compensation that is necessary.  However, if additional tissue deficit is calculated, lung compensators may also be placed such that the estimated lung dose is between a minimum of 1000 cGy and a maximum of 1320 cGy.  (The minimum lung dose allowed 
with this technique is somewhat higher
 than the right left lateral technique since, by 
[CONTACT_15094], some of the mediastinum and sp ine will also be under the compensator.) 
 
A total of 8 fractions are given ove r 4 days (Days -7, -6, -5, and -4 ).  The two fractions are given 
at a minimum of 6 hours apart from beam on to beam on.  The TBI will be delivered from either a linear accelerator or cobalt source at a dose rate of 
between 4 and 26 cGy/minute using energies of between [ADDRESS_1210420] 90% of the prescribed dose.  If a higher energy beam (> 4 MV) 
is used for the TBI treatments, a beam spo iler should be used to accomplish this or 
thermoluminescent dosimetry data submitted showing that the skin dose is ∃ 90% of the 
prescribed dose. 
 Testicular boosts should be used for all males with ALL (and according to institutional practice 
for other diseases).  The testicul ar boost is given in at least a single [ADDRESS_1210421] depends on the thickness of the testicles and is 
chosen so that the D90 corresponds to the posterior surface of the scrotum.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Cyclosporine A (CSA) 
 CSA will be administered beginning on Day –3 and dos es will be adjusted to maintain a level of 
200-400 ng/mL by [CONTACT_331265] (or 100-250 ng/mL by [CONTACT_867641]).  CSA can be admi nistered per institutional practice. 
 Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of t oxicity and low CSA levels  with a trough level of 
< 200 ng/mL.  Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has a normal gastro-intestinal 
transit time, CSA will be converted to an oral fo rm at 2-3x the current IV dose.  CSA dosing will 
be monitored and altered as clinically appropriate.    Patients will receive CSA until Day +180.   If no GVHD, the dose will be tapered 10% per week 
beginning on Day 100. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
 MMF will be given at a dose of 1 gram IV q 8 hours if > 50 kg or 15 mg/kg IV q 8 hours if  
< 50 kg beginning the morning of Day –3.  (If renal failure and GFR < 25 mL/min do not exceed 
dose of 1 gm q 8 hours.  No dose adjustment for liver disease.)  MMF should be given IV until patient can tolerate oral medications and has a nor mal gastro-intestinal transit time.  Tablets or 
suspension may be used to achieve calculated dos es.  MMF will be dosed based on the patients 
actual body weight.  MMF should be continued for 45 days or 7 days after engraftment, whichever day is later, if 
acute GVHD has not occurred.  If GVHD occurs  before Day 45, continue MMF and treat 
according to institutional protocols.  Methylpred nisolone, 2 mg/kg divided q12H IV, is suggested 
as initial therapy.  If no response after 7 days , treat with second line agents per institutional 
guidelines.  If the patient has active acute GVHD requiring system ic therapy, treat according to institutional 
guidelines.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210422] blood 
units were thawed and washed in Dextran 40 + 5% albumin as  described by [CONTACT_660456]
23.  
This approach is the recommended method of thawing for patients transplanted on this study.  
This method results in the lowest exposure to DM SO and control of the vo lume of the transplant 
product(s) for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  It  is important that young and smaller children not be exposed to 
excessive amounts of DMSO, free hemoglobin or volume when undergoing transplantation with 
[ADDRESS_1210423] blood cells 
without a wash.  The rationale for dilution with  the hypertonic solution without a wash is to 
minimize cell loss due to aggregat ion and/or to avoid the sma ll risk of loss of product bag 
integrity during the wash centrifugation.  Both d ilution alone or dilution and wash are acceptable 
practices as long as the transpla nt recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867592] e volume or DMSO 
with the transplant.  These ar e concerns in small children receiving two cord blood units. 
 There are two types of UCB products that are curre ntly banked: red cell and plasma depleted or 
plasma depleted only.  The later products have a larger amount of lysed red blood cells in the product and thus there is a greater  risk of hemolytic reaction during infusion.  Since the majority 
of red cells in the product are lysed during thaw, the presence or absence of ABO incompatibility 
is not significant.  It is important that the cellula r therapy laboratory and clinical team review the 
type of unit(s) that are being used and the thaw plans prior to the day of transplant. 
 Guidelines for thawing UCB(s): 
 Final product* Dilution only Dilution and wash 
DMSO concentration <3% final volume acceptable acceptable 
 >3% final volume not recommended recommended 
Red cell lysate  <2 ml RBC 
volume/kg acceptable acceptable 
 > 2 ml RBC

Final volume of infusate <20 ml/kg acceptable acceptable 
 >20 ml/kg not recommended recommended 
    
*Note: since both units are infused in close proximity  the calculations should be based on the sum of both 
units. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  UCB unit thaw 
 The cord blood should be thawed, diluted with or without wash per validated institutional or 
supplying cord blood bank procedur es with the exception that bedside thawing and direct 
infusion is not allowed.  Bedside thaws are not recommended because of the inability to rescue the product if there is loss of integrity of the UCB bag on thaw at the bedside and because of the 
instability of the cells in 10% DMSO post thaw. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
2-9  
All transplant centers/ce llular therapy laboratories must be familiar with thawing of cord blood 
units.  They must have validated procedures and maintain competency in the thaw process (see 
Appendix F for sample thawing procedures).  The cord blood unit must be thawed in a qualified 
laboratory by [CONTACT_21724].  Generally the cryopreserved unit is removed from the protective 
cassette, placed in a ziplock bag and thawed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91590] a 37◦ C waterbath.  The ziplock bag 
allows for recovery of cells if the cryopres ervation bag cracks or l eaks during the thawing 
process, a rare but possible event.  Once the cont ents of the bag reach a slushy consistency, the 
cells can be diluted in dextran/albumin, a hypertonic  solution that buffers ag ainst the intracellular 
hypertonicity created by [CONTACT_865722].  Cell suspensions  can subsequently be  washed to remove 
DMSO, free hemoglobin and other cellular de bris allowing for resu spension in a volume 
appropriate for the size of the patient to be transplanted.  The full procedure is detailed in Appendix F.  [IP_ADDRESS].  UCB infusion on Day [ADDRESS_1210424] blood (i.e., no pi[INVESTIGATOR_865683]).  Vital signs should be monitored before beginning the 
infusion and periodically during administratio n.  Infusion should begin within [ADDRESS_1210425] blood infusion will be administered per institutional procedure.  Diphenhydramine, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and hydrocortisone should be availabl e at the bedside for emergency use if infusion 
reactions occur.  Oxygen with nasal prongs for standby [CONTACT_867642].  The 
two units for double UCB transplantation are infused one after the other.  2.6.4.  Supportive Care 
 Patients will receive transfus ions, infection prophylaxis and nutritional support according to 
institutional guidelines.  Inf ection prophylaxis should include, but  is not limited to, agents or 
strategies (e.g., PCR screening and preemptiv e therapy) to prevent herpes simplex, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), Pneumocystis carinii, and fungal infections.   
 Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be consistent with BMT CTN MOP and 
standard institutional guidelines.  A ll blood products will be irradiated. 
 Additional details are provided in Appendix E.  2.6.5.  Immunizations 
 
Tetanus immunizations will be done at Day 100, [ADDRESS_1210426]-

2-10 2.6.6.  Growth Factors 
 G-CSF will be given beginning on Day 1 at a dose  of 5 mcg/kg/day (rounding to the nearest vial 
dose is allowed), until absolu te neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥  2,000/mm
3 for three consecutive 
days.  G-CSF should then be titr ated to maintain ANC > 1,000/mm3.  G-CSF may be given by [CONTACT_867643].  2.6.7.  Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG) 
 Bi-weekly IVIG infusions (200-500 mg/kg/ dose) are recommended for immunoprophylaxis 
through Day 100 to maintain IgG levels in the normal  range for age.  Altern atively, if IVIG is not 
given on a regular schedule, IgG levels should  be monitored and IVIG infusions given to 
maintain IgG level in the normal range for age.  2.6.8.  Risks and Toxicities 
 
Cyclophosphamide:    
Cyclophosphamide side effects include: na usea/vomiting, cardiomyopathy, skin rash, 
mucositis, stomatitis, sterility, diarrhea, hemo rrhagic cystitis, fluid weight gain/edema, 
alopecia and hemolytic/anemia. 
 
Fludarabine: 
a. Neurotoxicity: Agitation or confusion, bl urred vision, loss of hearing, peripheral 
neuropathy or weakness have been reported.   Severe neurologic effects, including 
blindness, coma, and death are seen in 36% of  patients treated with  doses approximately 
four times greater than recommended; severe CNS toxicity is rarely seen with doses in 
the recommended range for nontransplant thera py of hematologic malignancies.  Effect 
of chronic use on the CNS is unknown, althou gh patients have re ceived recommended 
doses for up to [ADDRESS_1210427]  been used in adult and pediatric patients and increased 
neurotoxicity has not been observed.  
 
b. Anemia: Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been 
reported after one or more cycles of therapy in  patients with or wit hout a previous history 
of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positiv e Coombs’ test and who may or may not be 
in remission; no mechanisms for development of  this complication have been identified.  
Corticosteroids may or may not be effective in controlling these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The majority of patients re-challenged developed a r ecurrence of the hemolytic process.  
 
c. Cardiovascular: Deep venous thrombosis, phl ebitis, transient ischemic attack, and 
aneurysm (1%) are reported.    
 
d. Fever: 60% of patients develop fever.

  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
2-11 e. Skin Rash: 15% of patients develop a skin rash which may be pruritic.  
 
f. Digestive: Gastrointestinal side effects include: nausea/vomiting (3 6%), diarrhea (15%), 
stomatitis (9%), anorexia (7%), GI bleeding and esophagitis (3%), mucositis (2%), liver 
failure, abnormal liver func tion test, constipation, dysphagi a (1%) and mouth sores.  
 
g. Some other effects are: Chills (11%), peripheral edema (8%), myalgia (4%), osteoporosis 
(2%), pancytopenia, arthralgia (1%), dysuria (4%), urinary tract infection and hematuria 
(2%); renal failure, abnormal renal function te st, and proteinuria (1%); and, very rarely, 
hemorrhagic cystitis and pulmonary toxicity.  
 
Total Body Irradiation: 
TBI can cause: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pa rotitis (rapid onset within 24-48 hours, 
usually self-limited), generali zed mild erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_293644], fever, mucositis, 
and alopecia.  Late effects include: possible growth retardation, vertebral deformities, cataracts, probable increased risk of  secondary malignant neoplasms, sterility, nephropathy, 
interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease. 
 
UCB Graft Infusion: 
Potential toxicities associated with the infusion include DMSO  toxicity and side effects 
from red cells.  These may include changes in heart rate or rh ythm, changes in blood 
pressure, fever, chills, sweats, nausea/vom iting, diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache, 
allergic reaction, pr esence of DMSO taste and odor, hemoglobinuria, a nd acute renal 
failure.  Due to the washing and processi ng steps, these toxi cities are unlikely. 
 
Cyclosporine A: 
Cyclosporine may cause: nephrotoxicity, seiz ures, hypertension, hirsutism, thrombotic 
microangiopathy, electrolyte imbalances, pare sthesias/neuropathy, gingival hyperplasia, 
transient-blindness, and he patic and renal dysfunction. 
 
Mycophenolate Mofetil: 
Side effects include: pancytopenia, nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, headache, 
dizziness, insomnia, hyperglycemia, electrol yte imbalances, rash, and leg cramps/bone 
pain. 
 
Growth Factor or G-CSF (Filgrastim, Neupogen ): 
G-CSF may cause: Bone pain, insomnia, h eadaches, dyspnea, body aches, rash, fever, 
splenomegaly allergic reaction, fatigue, edema and nausea/vomiting. 
 
Graft Failure: 
Based on historical data, there could be a 20%  chance of graft failure.  Contingency plans 
are recommended and include obtaining marro w from a haploidentical relative, 
supportive care or acquisition of another compatible UCB unit.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1. Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint is one-year overall survival from the tim e of randomization.  The event 
analyzed is death from any cause.  
3.2. Secondary Endpoints 
 
3.2.1.  Neutrophil Engraftment 
 Neutrophil engraftment is de fined as achieving an ANC ≥  500/mm
[ADDRESS_1210428] 
14 days will be evaluable for this endpoint.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Autologous recovery 
 Autologous recovery is defined as an ANC ≥  500/mm
3 for three consecutive measurements on 
different days with > 50% host chimerism.  Th is endpoint will be assessed at Days 42, 100 and 
180.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Primary graft failure 
 Primary graft failure is defined as lack of neut rophil engraftment by 42 days in patients surviving 
a minimum of 14 days.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary graft failure 
 Secondary graft failure is defined as initia l neutrophil engraftment followed by [CONTACT_867644] < 500/mm
3 for three consecutive measurements on different days, 
unresponsive to growth factor therapy.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Platelet engraftment of > 20,000 and 50,000/mm
[ADDRESS_1210429] day of a minimum of three consecutive measurements 
on different days such that the patient  has achieved a plat elet count > 20,000/mm
3 and  
> 50,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusions in the pr eceding seven days.  The first day of the 
three measurements will be designate d the day of platelet engraftment. 
 Platelet engraftment will be assessed at Days 100, 180 and 365.

  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
3-2 3.2.2.  Chimerism 
 Incidence of chimerism (e.g., engr aftment of both UCB units) will be assessed at Days 28, 42, 
60, 100, [ADDRESS_1210430] Disease 
 Incidences of grade II – IV a nd III – IV acute GVHD at Day 100 w ill be graded according to the 
BMT CTN Manual of Procedures (MOP).  Th is will be assessed at Days 100, [ADDRESS_1210431] Disease 
 Incidences of chronic GVHD will be scored acco rding to the BMT CTN MOP.  This will be 
assessed at Days 100, 180, 365 and 730.  3.2.5.  Disease-free Survival 
 Disease-free survival is defined as the minimum ti me interval of the times to relapse/recurrence, 
to death or to last follow-up.  3.2.6.  Transplant-related Mortality (TRM) 
 Incidence of transplant-related mortality will be estimated at Day 100.  An event for this endpoint is death in continuous CR.   Relapse is a competing risk. 
 3.2.7.  Infections 
 Microbiologically documented infections will be reported by [CONTACT_129109], date of onset, 
organism and resolution, if any.  For definitio ns, see the BMT CTN MOP.  Patients will be 
followed for infection for [ADDRESS_1210432] faster and more complete hematologic and 
immune reconstitution, it is anticipa ted that their rates of infection will be lower.  The incidence 
of bacteremia; fungal infections  and reactivation of CMV (adjus ted for pre-HCT CMV serologic 
status) will be compared between the two arms within the first 100 days and for fungi and CMV 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210433] year.  The 
diagnosis and disease-stage adjusted risk of re lapse will be compared within the 2 randomized 
cohorts and correlated with recovery of T cells, CD4+ T cells and NK cells after HCT. 
 3.2.9.  Relapse and Residual Disease 
 Relapse of Malignancy  – Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood, marrow or other sites 
will be used to assess relapse af ter transplantation.  For the purpose of this study, relapse is 
defined by [CONTACT_867645], ALL, CML, or MDS 
consistent with pre-transplant features.    Minimal Residual Disease – Minimal residual disease is defined by [CONTACT_207125], or fluorescent in situ hybridiza tion (FISH), or Southern blot, 
or Western blot, or polymerase chain reactio n (PCR), or other techniques, in absence of 
morphological or cytogenetic evidence of disease in blood or marrow.  Since the frequency of 
testing for minimal residual dis ease is highly va riable among centers, and th e sensitivity is highly 
variable among laboratory technique s, evidence of minima l residual disease will  not be sufficient 
to meet the definition of relapse in th e context of this study.  Data on tapering 
immunosuppression, administering ch emotherapy or biological agen ts to attempt reducing the 
tumor load will be captured in the case report forms.  Acute Leukemia  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is: 
1. The reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the peripheral blood; or, 
2. > 5% blasts in the marrow, not attribut able to another cause (e.g., bone marrow 
regeneration); or,  
3. If there are no circulating blasts, but the marrow contains 5-20% blasts, a repeat bone 
marrow examination ≥ one week later demonstrating > 5% blasts is necessary to meet 
this criterion for relapse; or, 
4. The appearance of new dysplastic ch anges within the bone marrow; or, 
5. The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_13858]. 
 
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML ) –  
Hematologic relapse will be diagnosed when: 
1. Immature hematopoietic cells are persistently  documented in the pe ripheral blood; or,  
2. There is myeloid hyperplasia in the bone  marrow in the presence of cytogenetic 
relapse. 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
3-4  
Cytogenetic relapse will  be diagnosed when:  
1. 50% of the metaphases exhibit the characteristic 9;[ADDRESS_1210434] ten 
metaphases analyzed; or, 
2. At least one metaphase exhibits the 9;[ADDRESS_1210435] one month apart, regardless of number of 
metaphases analyzed. 
Myelodysplastic (MDS) and Myeloproliferative Syndromes -  Relapse will be diagnosed when 
there is: 
1. Reappearance of pre-transplant mor phologic abnormalities, detected in two 
consecutive bone marrow specimens take n at least one month apart; or, 
2. Evidence of satisfying above criteria for evolution into acute leukemia; or,   
3. Reappearance of pre-transplant cytoge netic abnormalities in at least 50% of 
metaphases with at least ten metaphases examined; or, 
4. Reappearance of pre-transplant a cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase 
on each of two separate consecutive examina tions at least one month apart, regardless 
of the number of metaphases analyzed. 
Relapse will be defined to occur in the absence of  the evidence above if specific therapy, such as 
use of interferon or second transplant , is initiated for relapse reversal. 
 
3.3. Other Definitions 
 
3.3.1.  Complete Remission for Acute Leukemias Pre-transplant 
 Complete remission prior to entering the study w ill be defined as all of the following according 
to the revised recommendations of  the international working group: 
• A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_867593] < 5% blasts  with a count of at least 
200 nucleated cells and no Auer rods seen.  If spi[INVESTIGATOR_190877], a bone 
marrow biopsy should confirm that  < 5% blasts are present. 
• ANC > 1,000/mm
3 and platelet count > 100,000/mm3. 
• No extramedullary leukemia. 
• No blasts in peripheral blood.

3.3.3.  CML Stages 
 Chronic phase is defined as:  
• Stable, not hematologic remission: blasts pr esent in marrow and/or peripheral blood, but 
disease does not qualify as accelerated or blast phase 
• Hematological remission: no blast cells or  precursor cells in the blood or marrow 
• Partial cytogenetic remission: Ph+ metaphases >0% but < 35%

Accelerated phase is defined as: 
• WBC difficult to control (> 50 x 10
9/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175]) 
• Rapid doubling of WBC (< 5 days) 
• Anemia or thrombocytopenia unresponsive to standard treatment 
• Persistent thrombocytosis (> 1000 x 109/L) 
• Cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to Ph+ 
• Increasing splenomegaly 
• Marrow fibrosis

4.1.  Enrollment Procedures 
 
4.1.1.  Screening and Eligibility Procedures 
 Patients will be registered using the BM T CTN Electronic Data Capture System 
(AdvantageEDC
SM).  The Children’s Oncology Group (C OG) should follow instructions in 
Section 4.1.2 prior  to following the instructions below.  The following procedures should be 
followed: 
1. Prior to initiation of conditioning regimen, but no more than 14 days prior to initiation of 
conditioning regimen, an authorized user at  the transplant cente r enters the patient 
demographics and Segment A of the Enrollmen t Form in AdvantageEDC.  The eligibility 
screening (Segment A) includes a question conf irming that the patien t (or legal guardian) 
signed the informed consent. 
2. Prior to initiation of the condi tioning regimen, the selected co rd blood unit must be at the 
transplant center.  In the event that the patie nt has been randomized to receive two units, 
at least one of the units must be at the transplant center.  However, it is strongly recommended that both units are present at the transplant center in this case. 
3. If the patient is eligible, a study number is generated and a tr eatment assignment is 
displayed. 
4. A visit schedule based on treatmen t start date is displayed for printing and is referred to 
as ‘Segment A Follow-up.’ 
 4.1.2.  COG Patient Registration Procedures 
 Prior to enrollment on study, all patients must have  been registered via the Remote Data Entry 
(RDE) system into the COG Cancer Registry (Diagnosis/Registry).  Th e patient registration

5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
5.1. Study Design 
 
This is a Phase III, multi-center, open label, rand omized clinical study to determine the benefit of 
double UCB unit infusion on survival after UCB tr ansplantation in child ren with high-risk 
leukemia or MDS.  The central hyp othesis is that the infusion of  additional hematopoietic stem 
and progenitor cells from a partially HLA-matc hed second UCB unit will improve survival.   
 5.1.1.  Accrual 
 The target enrollment is 220 patients.  It is estimat ed that five years of accrual will be necessary 
to enroll the targeted sample size.  Both Core a nd Affiliate Centers will enroll patients on this 
study.  Accrual will be reported by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, and gender. 
 5.1.2.  Randomization 
 All patients will be randomized within 14 days prior to the initiation of conditioning therapy.  
Randomization will be performed in a 1:[ADDRESS_1210448] ratified by [CONTACT_867647] (each transplant center expected to 
enroll more than [ADDRESS_1210449] its own stratum and transplant 
centers expected to enroll fewer than 10 patients w ill be considered together in a single stratum) 
and age (patients ≤ 10 years of age will be in one stratum and patients > 10 years of age will be 
in another stratum).  5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint 
 The primary endpoint is one-year survival.  The primary analysis will be performed using the 
intent-to-treat principle so that all randomized patients will be included  in the analysis.   
 5.1.4.  Primary Hypothesis 
 The primary null hypothesis of the study is that there is no differe nce in overall survival after 
UCB transplantation using two versus one UCB units.    
H
o: OS d(t) = OS s(t) for all t  
Ha: OS d(t) ≠ OS s(t) for at least one t 
 
5.2. Sample Size and Power Calculations 
 
Overall survival will be compar ed between double and single UCB unit transplant arms using the 
log-rank test.  The final analysis will be performe d after all patients have been followed for at 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210450] one year.  The sample size of  110 patients per group is sufficien t to maintain type I error of 
5% across all planned interim anal yses (see below) while providi ng > 86% statistical power for a 
two-sided test to detect an in crease in the proportion survivi ng at one year from 0.[ADDRESS_1210451] (DSMB) at approximately 
one-year intervals.  Monitoring of key safety endpoints will be conducte d monthly, and if rates 
significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in orde r that the DSMB can 
be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's MOP. 
 5.3.1.  Interim Analysis for Efficacy 
 At the time of each interim analysis , the log rank test statistic will  be computed, and if the null 
hypothesis is rejected, the DSMB will be consulted to discuss the continuation of the trial.  In 
order to preserve the over-all type I error rate  at 5%, the critical values used for the interim 
analysis will be inflated over 3.84, th e value that would be used if no repeated testing were used.  
Equivalently, the nominal p-value at which an observed difference is declared significant will be reduced below 0.05.  The actual cr itical values and nominal p-va lues will be computed using 
statistical methods for group sequential testing with O’Brien Fleming boundaries. 
 As an example, Table 5.3.1a shows the critical values and nominal p-values for tests conducted 
at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 years after the study opens to enrollment.

The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for c onsultation with the DSMB  for additional review, 
and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment. 
 The rate of TRM at [ADDRESS_1210453]-transplant will  be monitored.  Monitoring will be performed 
monthly until enrollment is closed.  Each month, the null hypothesi s that the 100-day TRM rate 
is less than or equal to 30% is tested.  Base d on published reports of single UCB transplants, 
TRM of 30% at Day [ADDRESS_1210454] (SPRT) will be used to monitor TRM.  A description of the SPRT is provided below.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At ea ch monthly interim analysis, the total time on 
study is plotted against the total number of patie nts experiencing TRM.  The continuation region 
of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_110893].  Only the lower boundary will be used for 
monitoring to protect against excessive 100-day TRM.  If the graph falls below the lower 
boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more events than 
predicted by [CONTACT_258075].  Othe rwise, the SPRT conti nues until enrollment 
reaches the target goal.  This procedure assumes an exponential distribution for the time until TRM during the first [ADDRESS_1210455]-transplant .  Only events that 
occur on or before the patient has been followed for 100 days are counted.  Total time on study is 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210456], summed for all patients who initiate conditioning regimen 
therapy.  
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α and β of rejecting 
H
0 when θ = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|θi).  The test to be used in this prot ocol was developed from the following SPRTs: 
 
y A SPRT contrasting 30% versus 40% 100-day ra te of TRM results in  a common slope of 
0.638 and the intercepts  are –3.801 and 3.182 with α=0.1 and β=0.15. 
 y A SPRT contrasting 20% versus 30%  42-day rate of graft failu re results in a common 
slope of 0.446 and the intercepts are –1.892 and 1.584 with α=0.1 and β=0.15. 
 
Note that since the test uses only the lower bou ndary, and is truncated by a finite sample size, 
both the size and power of the test will be lower than nominal levels.  The actual operating characteristics of the trun cated test, shown in Table 5.4.1, were determined 
in a simulation study that assumed uniform accrual of [ADDRESS_1210457] two digits of precision.

 The testing procedure for TRM rejects the null hypot hesis in favor of the alternative 7% of the 
time when the true TRM rate is 30%, and 68% of the time when the rate is 40%.  This 
corresponds to a type  I error rate of α = 0.07 and a type II error rate of β = 0.32.  When the true

The testing procedure for graft failu re rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alte rnative 7% of 
the time when the true 42-day graft failure rate is  20% and 76% of the time when the rate is 30%.  
This corresponds to a type I error rate of α = 0.07 and a type II error rate of β = 0.24.  When the

primary null hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference in overall survival between 
double and single UCBT arms.  Th e alternative hypothesis is that survival differs between 
double and single UCBT strategies.    The primary outcome will be assessed in a final analysis to be performed after the last enrolled patient has been followed for one year post-transp lant.  The one-year overall survival probability 
and confidence interval will be calculated.  The ev ent is death from any cause.  Patients alive at 
the time of the last observation ar e censored at the time of the la st observation.  Overall survival 
will be compared between treatment arms using a log-rank test, and the survival curves will be 
estimated using the Kaplan Meier product limit estimator.

5-6 A secondary analysis will be performed using only patients who were transplanted.  Multi-
variate analysis using the Cox proportiona l hazards model will also be performed. 
 5.5.2.  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 A number of secondary endpoints will be examined  to compare the patient’s disease status over 
time between the two treatment arms.  
•  Disease-free Survival (DFS): One-year DFS distribution will be estimated by [CONTACT_17680]-Meier product limit estimator. The two treatment arms will be compared using the log-rank test.  A Cox proportional hazard model will be fit to control for important 
prognostic variables.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of two years post-
transplant for mortality.  
 
•  Neutrophil Engraftment:  To assess the incidence of ne utrophil engraftment from day of 
transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will  be computed along w ith a 95% confidence 
interval.  Death will be considered as a comp eting risk.  A log-rank test will be used to 
compare the two treatment arms. 
 
•  Platelet Engraftment:  To assess the incidence of plat elet engraftment from day of 
transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will  be computed along w ith a 95% confidence 
interval.  Death will be considered as a comp eting risk.  A log-rank test will be used to 
compare the two treatment arms. 
 
      •  Chimerism:  The proportion of patients with ch imerism at each timepoint will be 
estimated along with a 95% confidence interval. 
 
•  Acute GVHD:   To assess the incidence and sever ity of grades II-IV acute GVHD from 
day of transplant.  The first day of acute GVHD  onset at a certain grade will be used to 
calculate a cumulative incidence curve fo r that acute GVHD grade.  An overall 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed  along with a 95% confidence interval at 
[ADDRESS_1210462] will 
be used to compare the two treatment arms. 
 
• Chronic GVHD:  To assess the incidence and severi ty of chronic GVHD from day of 
transplant, rates of chroni c GVHD will be compared betwee n the two groups using a log-
rank test and the cumulative incidence curves will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at two years post-transplant .  Death will be considered as a competing 
risk.  
 
•  Transplant Related Mortality (TRM):  TRM is death occurring in patients in 
continuous complete remission.  The TRM distribution will be estimated by [CONTACT_867649], with relapse considered a competing risk.  A log-rank test 
will be used to compare the two treatment arms. 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
5-7 •  Infections:  The incidence of definite and probable viral, fungal and bacterial infections 
will be tabulated for each patient according to criteria in the BMT CTN Manual of 
Procedures.  Infections will be classified by [CONTACT_867650], site and severity.  Infection burden 
will be compared between treatment arms.  
 
      •  Relapse:   To assess the incidence of relapse fr om day of transplant, the cumulative 
incidence of relapse, treating death as a co mpeting risk, will be compared between the 
two groups using a log-rank test. 
 
      •  Immune Reconstitution:   Descriptive statistics will be  computed for all the immune 
reconstitution assays.  Treatment arms will be compared using chi-square tests, t-tests or 
non-parametric tests as a ppropriate for the assay. 
 
5.6. Subgroup Analyses 
 
Subgroup analyses will be performed on the following subgroups defined by [CONTACT_654] ( ≤  10 years and 
> 10 years), donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867601]-match (5 or 6 of 6 and 4 of 6), ethnicity, and gender.  
5.7. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
All entered patients will be included in the safety analysis.  All reported serious treatment-related adverse events will be carefully examined with respect to the severity and relationship to study treatment.  The reporting of serious adverse event will be 
consistent with standard BMT CT N procedures.  Adverse events wi ll be graded according to the 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Ev ents (CTCAE), Version 3.0.  The incidence 
for each reported study group associated adverse experience delineated in Section 4.2 will be 
presented for each group.

use of fludarabine, total body ir radiation (TBI) or cyclophospha mide should be discussed as 
objectively as possible.    The consent document should be reviewed with th e patient and family prior to proceeding to 
transplantation  Informed consent from the patient will be obt ained using a form approved by [CONTACT_867651].  
  
2. Confidentiality  
 
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_867652] a patient 
identifier code.  The code relaying the patient’s id entity with the ID code will be kept separately 
at the center.  The ID code will be transmitte d to the BMT CTN Data Coordinating Center upon 
enrollment.   
3. Participation of Women and Mi norities and Other Populations  
 
Women and ethnic minorities and ot her populations will be included in this study.  Accrual of 
women and minorities at each center will be mon itored to determine whether their rates of 
enrollment are reflective of the distributio n of potentially eligible women and minorities 
expected from data reported to the CIBMTR.  Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those expected  and asked to develop appropr iate recruitment strategies. 
 Since UCB transplantation allows  for greater HLA disparity be tween recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83433], it is 
anticipated that this study w ill recruit more minority patient s than a study using other 
hematopoietic cell sources (e.g., bone marrow or peri pheral blood stem cells).  It is expected that 
number of minority patients on this study will be  more than accrued on studies using adult bone 
marrow or PBSC donors.  In 2005, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) reported 27% 
of patients receiving cord blood transplants we re non-Caucasian, while only 12% of patients 
receiving bone marrow or PBSC transplants were non-Caucasians.

A-2 4. Ethical Considerations 
 
Patients are referred to the Transplant Cent er for consideration of hematopoietic cell 
transplantation.  While there will be every effort  to seek out and include females and minority 
patients, the patient population is dependent upon the referral pattern and the ability to identify 
suitable UCB units.  Female and minority patients  are eligible for all aspects of the study and 
their participation will be actively encouraged.

CONSENT FORMS 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210464] udy will help future patients.  The Study doctor (the person in charge 
of the research) will explai n the clinical trial to you and your child.  Clinical trials include only 
people who choose to take part.  Please take your time to make your decision about allowing 
your child to take part.  You may discuss your decision with family and friends.  You and your 
child can also discuss this with your child’s he alth care team.  If you or your child have any 
questions, you and your ch ild can ask the Study doct or for more explanation.  
 
 
Your child is being asked to take part in this study by [CONTACT_51443]’s doctor because your child has leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has failed other treatment or your child’s 
leukemia or MDS is not likely to respond to other treatment.  Thes e diseases can be treated and 
sometimes cured with very high doses of chem otherapy and radiation th erapy given to kill 
leukemia or MDS cells. However, this treatment also harms normal cells in the bone marrow.  
The bone marrow is the body’s “blood factory.”  It makes the cells that circulate in the blood, 
including: red blood cells (which carry oxygen), wh ite blood cells (which fight infection), and 
platelets (which prevent bleeding).  The bone marrow can be fixed by [CONTACT_91959] “hematopoietic or 
blood stem cells” donated by [CONTACT_24663].  This is  called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
Blood stem cells are the “parent cells” of the bone marrow that produce all blood cells.  For a 
transplant to be successful, the donor blood stem cells must have a tissue type that is completely 
or closely matched to the patient’s tissue type.  Genetic markers on the surface of cells make up 
our tissue type.  These genetic markers are like a “finger print” and help our immune system to 
determine which cells belong to the body and whic h do not.  For patients needing a transplant 
who do not have a family donor who is a match (has  the same tissue type), blood stem cells from 
unrelated donors can be used.  Blood stem cells are found in bone marrow and in umbilical cord blood. Umbilical cord blood is 
the blood left over in the placenta (afterbirth) after a baby [CONTACT_50835].  Usually this blood is thrown 
out with the placenta.  Over the past [ADDRESS_1210465] blood 
unit.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210466] your child join the study, please read the information 
below.  Feel free to ask questions to understand your child’s rights and pr otections.  It is your 
choice and that of your child to take part in this study. 
 
Sponsor and source of funding: 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_867653] (NIH), which gives financial support 
through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN).  The NIH is a 
government funded research program and the BMT CTN is a not-for-profit group of transplant 
programs conducting research on hematopoietic stem cell transplant to benefit future patients. 
 
If you decide to allow your child to  take part in this research study: 
• You or your child’s insurance company will pay for all medical bills for your child’s 
treatment  
• You or your child will not incur additional cost for any research  lab tests that are part of 
this study (i.e., lab tests that are not part of routine care)  
• You or your child will not be paid  to participate in this study  
• Your child will face the same risks and be nefits as any other transplant patient 
 
If you decide not to allow your ch ild to participate in this study,  your child’s doctor will 
discuss other treatment options with you.  
What other choices does my child have if my child does not take part in the study? 
Your child’s other choices may include: 
• Treatment with other drugs  
• Experimental treatment with drugs or cells 
• A transplant with umbilical cord bl ood that is not pa rt of this study 
• A bone marrow transplant from a tissue-type mismatched re lated donor or from a tissue-
type matched or mismatched adult unrelated donor  
• No therapy to try to control your child’s leuk emia but treatment to make sure your child 
remains comfortable for the remainder of his or her life  
 Please talk to your child’s doctor about your child’s treatment choices before you decide to allow 
your child to take part in this study.  
Why is this study being done? 
More than 6,[ADDRESS_1210467] bl ood unit given divided by [CONTACT_676097][INVESTIGATOR_841]’s weight (cell dose).  
Patients who receive a hi gh cell dose (> 2.5 x 10
7 cells/kilogram) have better marrow recovery 
and a higher rate of survival than those who receive a lower cell dose.    In an attempt to make umbilical cord blood transplantation possible for bigger children, adolescents and adults, research ers have tried giving two cord blood units on the same day for 
their transplant, one after the other.  The data from more  than 150 “double cord blood” 
transplants in adults suggest that the “double cord blood” transplants may allow bone marrow 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210468] blood unit with  enough cells for 
successful transplantation.  It is not known whether giving two units will improve bone marrow 
recovery or survival over a single un it with a high number of cells.   
 
What the doctors need to know from this study: 
Your child’s doctor and others would like to know whether giving two umbilical cord blood 
units will result in faster bone marrow recovery and improved surv ival compared to giving only 
one unit of umbilical cord blood that has an acceptable cell dose for your child.   
 
How many children will take part in the study? 
Two hundred and twenty (220) patient s will take part in this study.   Half (110) will receive two 
umbilical cord blood units and the other half ( 110) will receive a single umbilical cord blood 
unit.  To be part of the study your child must: 
• Be between 1-21 years old 
• Have leukemia or MDS  
• Have two suitable umbilical cord blood units available 
• Have your informed consent 
• Give assent if your child is  old enough to understand the ri sks and benefits and sign an 
assent document 
 
What will happen if your child takes part in this research study?  Before enrolling on study: 
Your child will have the following examinations, tests or procedures to determine whether your 
child can be included in the study.  These examinati ons, tests or procedures are required as part of 
regular pre-transplant care and may be done ev en if you decide not to allow your child to 
participate in this study: 
• Medical history 
• Physical examination 
• Blood and bone marrow tests including a bone  marrow biopsy to evaluate your child’s 
leukemia  
• Other tests such as a spi[INVESTIGATOR_867602]’s leukemia 
• Blood tests to determine whether your child ha s had prior illness such as HIV, hepatitis and 
other viral illness  
• Heart function tests  
• Lung function tests 
• Kidney function tests 
• If your child is a teenager and female, a blood  pregnancy test will be performed to make 
sure that your child is not pregnant.  If your ch ild is pregnant, your chil d will not be able to 
take part in this study.  The study tr eatment could be harmful to the fetus. 
 
Randomization:  
If your child is enrolled on this study, your child will be randomized to r eceive either one or two 
umbilical cord blood units.  Randomization m eans that your child is assigned to a group by 
[CONTACT_3364].  This is done using a sp ecial computer program.  Your child has a 50/50 chance of being 
in either group.  Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group.  If your child is assigned to 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210469] blood unit, that unit will contai n enough cells for bone  marrow recovery 
and survival.  
Pre-transplant: 
If your child does not have a centr al intravenous (Hickman) line, your child’s doctor will ensure 
that your child has a cent ral intravenous line prior to transplant.  All drugs that may be required 
during your transplant will be given through the ce ntral intravenous line.  Blood required for any 
tests will also be collected from the central in travenous line in an effort to minimize pain.  
Starting 10 days prior to transplant your ch ild will receive chemotherapy and total body 
irradiation (TBI).  This is calle d the preparative regimen because it prepares the body to receive 
the donor (cord blood) cells.  The preparative regimen kills leukemi a/MDS cells.  It also kills 
cells in the body that would reject the donor cell s.  The chemotherapy and TBI will also damage 
your child’s normal bone marrow cells.  The tran splanted cord blood will replace the damaged 
cells.  The drugs used as chemothera py are fludarabine and cyclophos phamide (often called by [CONTACT_867654], Cytoxan).  Fludarabine will be gi ven intravenously (through your child’s central 
line) once a day for the first 3 da ys.  Next, TBI will be given twice a day for 4 days.  Then 
cyclophosphamide will be given intravenously (t hrough your child’s central line) once a day for 
2 days.  This will be followed by a “rest day” when your child will not receive chemotherapy or radiation.  Three days before the transplant, and continuing in the weeks after the tr ansplant, your child will 
receive drugs to allow the umb ilical cord blood stem cells to grow up inside your child’s body.  
These drugs decrease the chance of a complicati on known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  
GVHD results when the cord blood cells recogni ze your child’s body as foreign and attack it.  
Your child will receive two standard drugs to prevent GVHD.  These drugs are called 
cyclosporine (also called Gengraf or Neoral) and mycophenolate mofetil (also called MMF or 
Cellcept).  
 
Transplant day: 
On the day of transplant your child will receive either one or  two umbilical cord blood units, 
given intravenously through the centr al intravenous line.  Whether your child receives one or two 
umbilical cord blood units is decided at the time  of randomization.  The date of transplant is 
referred to as Day 0.    
Post-transplant follow-up and care: 
To speed the recovery of blood cells as much as possible your child will receive granulocyte-
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or Neupogen).  G-CSF is a hormone that tells the bone 
marrow to make white blood cells.  Your child w ill start receiving growth factor the day after 
transplant.  Your child will con tinue to receive it daily until his or her white blood cell count 
recovers. 
 
After your child’s transplant, your child will be watched very closely.  He or she will have a 
physical examination and blood test s at least twice weekly.  A dditional blood tests and bone 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
B-5 marrow tests will be done if your child’s doctor th inks it is indicated to take care of your child.  
Samples of blood (up to 75 ml or 5 tablespoons) and bone marrow (up to 15 ml or 1 tablespoon) 
will be drawn to evaluate how the new marrow is functioning.  The blood tests will be done on 
Days 28, 42, 60, 100, 180, 1 year, and 2 years after tran splantation (Day 0 is the day of transplant 
and all days are counted from the day of transplant, for example: Day 28 is the 28th day after 
transplant).  If necessary, bone marrow tests will also be done.  These examinations and tests are 
part of regular care after transp lant and may be done even if you do not allow your child to join 
the study and may be done more frequently than described here if necessary for your child’s 
care.  As part of the study your child will have blood samp les drawn to evaluate the function of his or 
her immune system at Day 100, Day 180, [ADDRESS_1210470] ion can be effective 
sooner than generally believed.  There is no additio nal risk to receiving this vaccine other than 
the risk of a tetanus injection.    Your child will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_867603]’s doctor feels he/she is ready.  
At first, your child will need to visit the bone marrow transplant clinic several times a week for 
check ups.  Eventually, the visits will be less frequent.  Your child’s doctor will likely want to see your child at 6 months, 1 year , and 2 years after the transplant as part of your child’s care 
after a transplant.  In some cases, it may be necessa ry for your child to vis it the transplant clinic 
more frequently and your child’s doctor will determine this.  Blood tests other than those 
mentioned above may also be necessary.  Your child’s doctor will make this decision.  Follow up for your child’s transplant will last as  long as your child requi res care related to the 
transplant and afterwards for any of the late co mplications that may occur from chemotherapy or 
transplant.  We encourage patients who have ha d a transplant to be followed either by [CONTACT_867655] r with late complications that may arise from 
transplantation.  We would like to keep track of  your child’s medical condition for the rest of 
your child’s life.  We will do th is by [CONTACT_867656] (or your child) and the doctor providing your 
child’s regular medical care by [CONTACT_867657] a year.  Checking on your child’s condition 
every year helps us look at the long-term effect s of the study and transplantation in general.  
Many transplant centers include th is type of long-term follow-up as  part of their regular medical 
care.  However, it is not necessa ry for you to agree to follow-up of your child for longer than 2 
years in order to partic ipate in this study.  If you would like to learn mo re about long-term care, 
please discuss it with your child’s doctor. 
 
How long will your child be in the study? 
Your child will be in the study for 2 years.  Your  child’s doctor (the doctor taking care of your 
child during his/her transplant or  your child’s oncologist or your  child’s primary care doctor), 
however, will follow your child indefinitely and provi de us with information as described above.

B-6 Please notify your child’s transpla nt doctor if you move or cha nge your child’s primary care 
doctor so that we will be able to obtain all the information requested. 
 
Can your child stop being in the study? 
You can decide to stop your chil d’s participation at any time.  Tell your child’s doctor if you or 
your child are thinking about st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  The doc tor will tell you and your child 
how to stop safely.  It is im portant to tell your child ’s doctor if you or your  child are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_867604].  Another reason to tell your 
child’s doctor is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for your child. 
 If you decide to withdraw your child, or your child’s doctor wit hdraws your child from the study, 
we will ask your permission to use all the information about your child that has already been collected as part of the study a nd to continue to allow your child ’s doctor to tell us about your 
progress until at least two years post-transplant.  You can choose to grant or not to grant this 
permission.  
Can the doctor who is the Principal Investi gator withdraw your child (you) from this 
study? 
Your child can be taken off the study (with or without your consent) for any of the following 
reasons: 
• Your child needs a medical treatm ent not allowed in this study 
• The investigator decides that  continuing in the study would be harmful to your child 
• Your child becomes pregnant and the study treatment coul d be harmful to the fetus 
• The study is cancelled by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) or the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) 
 
What are the risks of being in this study? 
So far, none of the studies using two cord blo od units for transplantation show risks that are 
different from using a single cord blood unit for tran splant.  However, it is possible that there are 
new and unknown risks from receiving two cord blood units instead of one.  For example, 
because the double cord transplant gives more d onor cells, the frequency or severity of GVHD 
might be increased.  Also, with two cord blood donors, each donor’s cells could react against the 
other, rather than make new healthy bone marro w for the patient.  While early studies of double 
cord blood transplants do not show  a risk of either of these pr oblems, we will be monitoring 
patients carefully during this study to be sure that they do not occur when a larger group of 
patients are treated.    If your child develops GVHD, you r child’s doctor will treat th e GVHD with the best available 
treatment.  If your child’s bone marrow does not gr ow back as expected, your child’s doctor will 
discuss it with the Principal I nvestigators of this study and th e BMT CTN.  We would try to 
identify another cord blood unit to be used for a second transplant if that  is felt to be a good 
treatment.

B-7 Chemotherapy drugs and total body irradiation (TBI) used in this study: 
The standard approach for treating patients with leukemia and/or MDS is to give high doses of 
cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and TBI, followed by a transplant using stem cells from donor 
bone marrow or cord blood.  This treatment can  cure patients who have these diseases.  
However, this treatment can also cause short and long-term side effects which can be uncomfortable, and in some cases, danger ous, life threatening, or even fatal  (see RISKS AND 
TOXICITIES RELATED TO STANDARD TRANS PLANT PROCEDURES below).  In this 
study, in addition to TBI and cyclophosphamide, fludarabine is also given in an attempt to improve recovery after cord blood transplants.  All patients r eceiving transplants must also 
receive GVHD prophylaxis (i.e., drugs to preven t GVHD).  The drugs used to prevent GVHD 
are cyclosporine (CSA) and mycophenolate mo fetil (MMF).  These drugs are usually well 
tolerated, but they can cause seri ous side effects.  The most co mmon and most important of these 
side effects are listed below.  Since this combination of treatments is relatively new, there may be additional unexpected side effects.   Everyone taking part in the study wi ll be carefully monitored for side effects.  Side effects can be 
mild or very serious.  Your child’s doctor and the health care team will give you medications to 
help lessen the risk of side effect s, and make your child more comfortable if they occur.  In most 
cases, the side effects are temporary and reversible .  In some cases, side effects may be serious, 
last a long time or never go away.  You should talk to your child’s doctor about  any side effects 
that your child has while taking part in this st udy.  A group of experts will carefully watch the 
side effects experienced by [CONTACT_867658].  If unexpected, dangerous complications are 
reported, and the experts determine that these side effects might occur in other patients on the 
study, you and your doctor will be no tified and the study closed.  Y our child will continue to 
receive all the care related to his/her transplant.    There are other potential complications that all patients undergoing a transplant face, regardless 
of whether or not they participate in the study.  Be sure to ask your doctor to discuss those with 
you.  
Are there benefits to taking part in the study? 
This research study is to determine whether giving two umbilical cord blood units results in 
faster bone marrow recovery and improved survival  compared to giving only one umbilical cord 
blood unit.  At this point doctors do not know whether two umbilical cord blood units are better 
than one umbilical cord blood unit. The informa tion obtained from this study will help doctors 
treat future patients with leukemia who require an umbilical cord blood transplant.  If one group 
does better than the other group, and your child is randomly assigned to that group, your child may benefit from being in the study.  Beyond that , there are no other speci fic benefits for your 
child from taking part in this study.

RISKS AND TOXICITIES RELATED TO STANDARD TRANSPLANT PROCEDURES 
 
Risks of Cord Blood Transplantation 
The following problems may occur as a result of the transplantation of umbilical cord blood. 
These are risks that would be present whether such a transplant was done as part of a study or not:  
1. Slow Recovery of Blood Counts.   The red blood cells, white  blood cells and platelets 
can be slow to recover after umbilical co rd blood transplantation.  Until your child’s 
blood counts recover, he or she will need blood  and platelet transfusions, and will be at 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210471] blood stem cells (t he “graft”) may fail to grow inside 
your child’s body.  Past experi ence suggests that there can be up to a 20% chance for 
failure to graft.  If graft failure occurs, this will result in low blood counts for a long 
period of time and can be fatal.  Should this  happen, your child will not receive additional 
stem cells from the same cord blood donor.  However, your child may be able to receive a second transplant with stem cells from a nother person (e.g., a different umbilical cord 
blood donor or an adult donor).  
3. Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD).   This condition results from the umbilical cord 
blood cells recognizing your child’s body as fo reign and attacking it.  You are more 
likely to get GVHD if you recei ve a mismatched (tissue type) than a matched cord blood 
unit.  In most cases, GVHD can be successfully  treated.  Sometimes GVHD is severe or 
difficult to treat and may lead to death.  Yo ur child will be watched closely for this 
complication and given treatment to prevent and treat it. 
 
There are two forms of GVHD: acute GVHD (occurs in the first 3 months after 
transplant) and chronic GVHD (after the fi rst 3 months).  Ac ute GVHD may produce 
skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdomi nal pain, abnormalities of liver function and 
an increased risk of infection.  Chroni c GVHD may produce skin rashes, hair loss, 
thickened skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver dis ease, weight loss, diarrhea and an increased 
risk of infection.  To confirm the diagnosis  of acute or chronic GVHD, your child may be 
asked to have a skin biopsy (i.e., taking a small sample of tissue to look at under the microscope) and possibly a gut biopsy  and rarely a liver biopsy.   
 4. Genetic Disease within the Cord Blood Cells .  It is possible that certain genetic 
diseases (for example thalassemia or  immunodeficiency) may be passed through the 
umbilical cord blood stem cells.  While these diseases are very rare, each umbilical cord 
blood can only be tested for a few of the ma ny possible genetic diseas es.  To reduce this 
possibility, cord blood is not collected from ba bies that have genetic diseases running in 
their family. 
 5. Incorrect  Labeling of the UCB .  Though rare, it is possible th at incorrect labeling of an 
umbilical cord blood unit could occur so th at your child receives the wrong unit.  To 
avoid this, umbilical cord blood unit is re-typed to ensure that the tissue type of the donor 
and your child are as previously  reported (i.e., when the donor  unit is confirmed).  If the 
umbilical cord blood unit does not have an atta ched segment for us to re-type, there are 
several ways the unit labeling can be confirmed. 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210472] blood stem cells or this 
study include:  A. Damage to the vital organs in your body.   This could result in problems in any 
body organ, such as, heart, lungs, liver, gut, ki dneys and bladder, brain etc.  The lungs 
and the liver are particularly vulnerable.  Some patients will experience severe lung 
problems due to infections and/or due to a reaction of the lungs to the chemotherapy 
and radiation.  Some patients can suffer ve no-occlusive disease of  the liver (VOD).  
This complication results from high doses of  chemotherapy and/or radiation.  Patients 
with VOD become jaundiced (yellowish skin), have liver function abnormalities, 
abdominal swelling, and abdominal pa in.  Although many patients recover 
completely, these complications may cause permanent damage or even death. 
 B. Serious infections.   Full and complete recovery of your child’ s immune system may 
take many months following the initial rec overy of your child’s cell counts.  During 
this time, there is an increased risk of in fections.  Your child will be prescribed 
certain medications to reduce the chance of those infections.  However, preventative 
treatments are not always eff ective.  If your  child has an infection, he/she may have to 
stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504007]-hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_867606].  Although most 
infections can be successfully trea ted, some infections are fatal. 
 C. Recurrence of disease.   Your child’s leukemia or MD S may come back even if the 
transplant is initially successful. 
 D. Risk to the unborn.  The treatments in this study have  NOT been proven to be safe at 
any stage of pregnancy.  Therefore, if your child is pregnant or nursing, your child is 
not eligible for this study.  Women who have the potential of becoming pregnant 
must use some form of effective birth c ontrol while receiving chemotherapy, TBI and 
GVHD prophylaxis.  Effective bi rth control is defined as the following: 1) refraining 
from all acts of vaginal intercourse (ABS TINENCE); 2) consistent use of birth 
control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]; 3) injectable birth control methods (Depo-Pr overa, Norplant); 4) tubal 
sterilization or male partner who has under gone a vasectomy; 5) placement of an IUD 
(intrauterine device); and, 6) use, with every act of intercourse, of a diaphragm with 
contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam. 
 
E. Sterility and future childbearing potential for men and women.  Chemotherapy 
and/or irradiation may affect your child’s ab ility to have children.  Male patients are 
likely to become sterile (unable to produ ce sperm) and should discuss with their 
doctor regarding sperm banking prior to tran splantation.  Female patients who have 
attained puberty may find th at their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or stops 
permanently.  However, this DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOUR CHILD CANNOT BECOME PREGNANT, and your child must use some effective method of birth 
control (if she has a sexual partner) during transplant and afterwards until she is off 
GVHD prophylaxis.  Damage to reproductive tissu e may result in infertility (inability 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210473] children).  It is not  known if the damage could re sult in birth defects.  You 
and your child should discuss these risks an d options in detail with your child’s 
doctor before entering this study. 
 
F. Central venous catheter.  Central venous catheters are intravenous (IV) lines that are 
placed under the skin and in a large vein in the chest and which may remain in place for 
many months.  Central venous catheters are us ed to draw blood and administer fluids 
and medicines.  There is considerable experi ence with central venous catheter use.  The 
most common complications associated with central venous catheters are blood clots in 
the catheter and an infection where the catheter was inserted  which can sometimes lead 
to a generalized infection in the blood.  Clotting may require the catheter to be removed 
or treatment with a fibrinolytic agent (med icines that dissolve blood clots).  Sometimes 
if a blood clot occurs, the catheter may need to  be replaced.  Infections will be treated 
with drugs; sometimes, remova l of the infected catheter is required and a new catheter 
will be placed.  There is also a small risk of  puncturing the lung at the time the catheter 
is put in.  If this occurs, a temporary chest tube may be placed in the lung to re-inflate 
it.  There are no long-term effects once the lung puncture has repaired. 
 
What are the costs of taki ng part in this study? 
Most of what happens in this study is standard  care; it will be billed to you or your child’s 
insurer in the usual way.  Stan dard costs include t hose of your child’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], doctor's 
visits, standard laboratory tests, the radiation therapy, the drugs, and the cost of the umbilical 
cord blood unit(s).  There will be no charge for research tests.  In  the event that this research 
activity results in an injury, treatment will be av ailable, including first-aid, emergency treatment 
and follow-up care as needed.  Care for such injuri es will be billed in th e ordinary manner, to 
your child’s insurance company.  If you or your child thinks that your child has suffered a 
research-related injury, let th e study doctors know right away. 
 
What happens if your child is injured b ecause of participation in this study? 
It is important that you tell your child’s doctor, __________________ [investigator's name] , if

 Storage of blood fo r future research: 
Please note:  This section of the informed consent form  is about future research studies that 
will be done using blood samples from children  who are taking part in the main study 
described above.  Your child may give samples for these future research studies if you want to.  You can say "yes" or "no" to allowing blood sa mples for future resear ch studies.  You can 
still be a part of the main study even if you sa y 'no' to allowing these samples to be used for 
future research studies.  Please mark yo ur choice at the end of this section.

Your child will be asked to provi de samples of blood to be used for research to determine how 
the immune system is recovering after transplant.  These samples will not require additional procedures.  The samples will be taken from blood drawn normally for other tests and will not require additional needle sticks.  Your child’s name [CONTACT_867679].  You do not 
have to agree to provide these research sample s from your child in or der for your child to 
participate in the study.  Samples will be labeled with unique codes that  do not contain information that could identify 
your child.  A link to this code doe s exist.  The link is stored at the Data Coordinating Center for 
the Blood and Marrow Transplant  Clinical Trials Network (B MT CTN).  The staff at the 
laboratories where your samples are being tested do not have a link to this code.  Your samples 
will be stored at these laboratories until the entire sample has been used for the research tests or 
until the end of the study.  If you agree, we will collect your child’s (you r) blood at Day 100, 6 months, 12 months and 24 
months after transplant (approximately 15 mL, 1 tablespoon, each time) for immune recovery 
studies.  
Things to think about regarding use of blood for immune recovery studies: 
The choice to let us have a blood samples for immune recovery studies is up to you (and your 
child).  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your ch ild’s care.  Even if you decide 
now that your child’s blood sample can be kept  for studies, you (or your child) can change your 
mind later.  If this is the case, tell us that you are no longer interested in allowing us to use your 
child’s blood sample for research.  We  will then destroy the blood samples. 
 Benefits: The benefits of research using blood include  learning more about what causes cancer 
and other diseases, what causes complications af ter transplantation and how to prevent and how 
to treat them.   Risks: The main risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  We will do 
our best to make sure that your personal informa tion will be kept private.   The chance that this 
information will be given to someone else is very small.   Making Your Choice: Please read each sentence below and think about your choice.  After 
reading each sentence, please indicate your choice below.  If you have any questions, please talk 
to your doctor or nurse, or call our  research review board at ___________________.  
 No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. 
 
 Yes, I agree to allow my child’s blood used for future research. 
 
 No, I do not agree to ha ve my child’s blood used  for future research.

_________________________________________________ Printed Name [CONTACT_867682] – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210476] leukemia.  Leukemia is cancer of th e blood cells made in your  body’s “blood factory”, 
which is called the bone marrow.  Leukemia is treat ed with special medicines.  These medicines 
are called chemotherapy.  They kill cancer cells.  If chemotherapy doesn’t kill all of the cancer 
cells, a special and stronger treatment called a transplant may be needed.   
 During a transplant, you get a very large am ount of chemotherapy medicines and radiation 
therapy.  These kill the leukemia in your body.  The chemotherapy drugs you will receive are so 
strong that they also kill th e normal cells in your blood and bone marrow.  To make your bone 
marrow grow new, healthy cells, you are given a transplant from a donor.  The cells in the 
transplant travel to your bone marro w and grow new cells.  Your docto rs think that a transplant is 
the best treatment for you.  They believe that it will increase your chance of cure. 
 Cells from the donor’s bone marrow or cord blood can be used in a transplant.  Bone marrow 
cells are donated by [CONTACT_75820].  Bone marro w donors have to have the same kind of bone 
marrow as the patient.  If your doctor cannot  find a bone marrow donor for you, you can be 
transplanted with blood cells from a baby’s umb ilical cord.  Umbilical cord blood is the extra 
blood left over after a baby [CONTACT_50835].   It used to be thrown awa y.  We know now that it contains 
blood-forming cells like the ones found in bone ma rrow.  Cord blood can be collected after a 
baby [CONTACT_867662].  Collec ting cord blood does not hurt the baby [CONTACT_867663].  
When a patient, like you, needs a transplant, cord  blood can be removed from storage and sent to 
your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_867611].  There have been  many transplants using umbilical cord blood.  
Sometimes the transplants grow back too slowly or not at all.  In th is study, your doctors are 
trying to figure out if the tran splant will grow back faster if blood cells from two umbilical cords 
are used instead of one umbilical cord.  They do n’t know the answer. They need to do this study 
to find out whether two cord bl ood units are better than one. 
 If you agree to participat e the following will occur: 
1. Your doctor will check to make sure that  there are two umbilical cord blood donors 
available for you.   
2. Then a computer program will decide whethe r you will get one or tw o cord blood units.  
This is called randomization.  Randomization is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  You have the same 
chance of receiving one or two cord blood units.  By [CONTACT_867664], your 
doctors will be able to learn whic h of these treatments is better. 
 
Transplant Procedure 
Before the transplant, you will be given the drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.  These 
drugs will be given through a central  line – an IV that will be plac ed in your chest.  If you do not 
already have a central line, we will put one in  as a surgical procedure (you will be asleep for 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
B-21 this).  A central line makes it easier for you to  receive drugs and for dr awing blood for tests (you 
will not be poked for blood or rece ive shots).  You will also ge t radiation to your whole body 
twice a day for four days.  After you have r eceived these drugs and radiation, new blood cells 
from cord blood will be given through your central  line.  When the blood gets into your body, 
you may feel sick to your stomach but that will go away quickly.  You will be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_867612] r you to recover from the chemotherapy and 
radiation.  You will need to be  on a number of medications during your transplant, which will 
either be given through your lin e or will be taken by [CONTACT_1966].  
 It will be necessary to check your blood and bone marrow after the transplant to make sure the 
cord cells are growing in your body.  Your doctors will do bl ood tests and bone marrow tests. 
Blood tests will also be done by [CONTACT_808695]. 
 
Risks/Discomforts   
The drugs and radiation may cause hair loss, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.  Your blood 
counts will fall and you may get fevers, infections  or start bleeding.  You may also get mouth 
sores.  These are temporary and you will feel  better as your new bone marrow grows.   
 During the period your new bone ma rrow is growing back after the cord blood transplant, you 
may need to get antibiotics since you will not be ab le to fight infections.  You may also need to 
get blood transfusions since your new bone ma rrow will not be making new blood cells right 
away.  It is possible that your new bone marrow will not grow back.  This is unlikely but if it did 
happen, it may even be necessary to do a second transplant.  You may get graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD), which happens when transplanted  cells attack your b ody causing skin rash, 
vomiting, diarrhea and liver probl ems.  These problems could be mild, or they could be very 
serious.  Your doctors will do their best to  make you feel better and keep you safe. 
 The above information has been explained to  me.  My questions have been answered. 
 I agree to participate in this study.   _________________________________  ____________________________ P a t i e n t        P a r e n t    _________________________________ Physician

designated by [CONTACT_126423].  HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_126376]-A, and -B, at intermediate resolution, and DRB1 at high resolution, consistent with NMDP 
standard procedures.    After Transplantation:  High resolution HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_867614] 
(from the wash or unused attach ed segments) is conducted as an ongoing resear ch study by [CONTACT_867665].  Data will be shared with the BMT CTN.   
2. CHIMERISM  
 
Samples of peripheral blood or marrow are collecte d from the patient and samples from the UCB 
pre-transplant for chimerism studies according to institutional standards.  Patient samples are also collected on Day 28, 42, 60, [ADDRESS_1210477]-transplant.  Chimerism will be measured 
by [CONTACT_867646]. On Da y 28, chimerism tests will be performed on total, lymphoid and 
myeloid fractions. At all other time poi nts, only total chimerism is required. 
  
3. PATHOLOGY/CYTOGE NETICS STUDIES 
 
A Day 21 bone marrow biopsy/as pi[INVESTIGATOR_867615] < 500.  Flow cytometry and

institutional guidelines.    
4. IMMUNE  RECONSTITUTION – STANDARD OF CARE  
 
While the kinetics of immune reconsti tution following peripheral blood and marrow 
transplantation have been extensively studied, there are limited data on immunologic recovery 
after UCB transplantation in children.  The im mune reconstitution studies listed in the table 
below allow assessment of hum oral immunity (total imm unoglobulin levels and post-
immunization antibody titers) and cellular immune recovery (lym phocyte subset analysis to 
quantify numbers and proportions  of different lymphocyte s ubpopulations and assessment of 
lymphocyte function by [CONTACT_867666].  
Antigen specific responses have been noted  as early as 6-[ADDRESS_1210478] blood

5. IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION – INVESTIGATIONAL RESEARCH ASSAYS  
 
One of the questions to be addressed by [CONTACT_867668]  a single UCB unit.  We plan to compare the 
tempo of immune recovery in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_867617]. double UCB units  using the results of 
standard (described above) and in vestigational immunologic assays.   
 Analysis of the COBLT immune reconstitution data suggests a strong association between 
immune reconstitution and decreased leukemia rela pse and improved survival in children with 
acute leukemia.  In order to dissect the mech anisms underlying this, the following assays of 
immune reconstitution will be performed.  Cellula r immune reconstitution will be studied by [CONTACT_867669] ( by [CONTACT_867670]ïve/memory CD4 cells, quantifying T-cell recep tor excision circles or TRECs and T cell 
receptor repertoire analysis) and the assessment of  recovery of T cell responsiveness to specific 
antigens such as herpes viruses.    The following investigational assays will be perfo rmed by [CONTACT_867671].

SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES 
 
 
1. Anemia 
Transfusions of packed red blood cells are indicated for symptomatic management of 
anemia.  An attempt will be made to maintain the hematocrit >24% and hemoglobin  >8 g/dl.  Irradiated (1500- 3000 cCy) blood products will be  used.  If CMV negative 
patient, CMV negative blood products or leukocyte poor blood products will be administered.   
 
2. Thrombocytopenia 
Prophylactic platelet tr ansfusions should be given to maintain the platelet count  
>10,000 ml or above the level at which signs of bleeding are known to occur, whichever 
is greater.  When available,  autologous stored platelets may be used.  All aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-
containing drugs are to be avoi ded.  The patients should receiv e no IM nor SQ injections.  
Irradiated (1500-3000 cCy) blood products will be  used.  If CMV negative patient, CMV 
negative blood products or leukocyte poor blood products will be administered. 
 
3. Fever 
Aggressive diagnostic and therap eutic management of fever in the neutropenic patient is 
mandatory.  At the onset of fever, the patient  will be thoroughly examined and cultured, 
after which empi[INVESTIGATOR_132327]-spectrum antibiotics  will be initiated. An ti-mold antibiotics 
should be considered for patients failing to  respond to antibiotics.  Granulocyte 
transfusions may be given at the investigator 's discretion.  Irradiat ion (1500-3000 cCy) of 
blood products is required. 
 
4. Nutrition 
All patients will be candidates for total pa renteral nutrition; length of use is at the 
attending physician's discretion. 
 
5. CSA Dose Modifications 
To minimize the risk of CSA toxicity, the serum creatinine/BUN will be determined daily 
for the first 30 days after transplantation.  S ubsequently, the frequenc y will be determined 
by [CONTACT_102]'s clinical status.  Trough CSA levels will be determined twice weekly for 
all inpatients with levels obtained on the basis of the patients clinical  status thereafter.  
CSA dose adjustment on the basis of toxicity or  low trough level.  The goal is to achieve 
a CSA trough level of at leas t 200-400 mg/L without signifi cant renal toxicity.   
 
Adjustment of CSA should be based on CSA levels in conjunction with clinical 
observations of the biological effects of the drug, i.e., renal and neurologic toxicity, and 
the physician's assessment of the patient's n eed for immunosuppression.  As a guideline, 
if the serum creatinine exceeds 2x baseline or  is >2.0 mg/dL, then the CSA dose should 
be decreased by 50%; if the serum creatinine exceeds 3x baseline or the patient requires 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol 0501 
  Version 7.0 dated March 18, 2010 
 
 
E-2 hemodialysis, then the CSA dose should be hel d.  As a guideline, if the patient becomes 
disoriented or develops visual  disturbance, paresis, apha sia or seizure, the CSA dose 
should be held during the evaluation of the neurological disturbance.  CSA should be 
reinstituted as soon as possible. 
 
6. G-CSF 
All patients will receive G-CSF 5 µg/kg/day IV based on th e actual body weight IV 
beginning on Day +1 after PBSC infusion.  G-CSF will be administered daily until the 
ANC exceeds 2.5 x 109/L for three consecutive days a nd then discontinued.  If the ANC 
decreases to <1.0 x 109/L, G-CSF will be reinstituted.

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  Pediatric UCB Transplant – Protocol [ADDRESS_1210488] blood units are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_867623] a 37o C 
water bath. The slushy content is  then slowly and gently diluted with a hypertonic solution 
containing 10% Dextran a nd 5% human albumin.   
Albumin absorbs out the intracellular Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) improving significantly the 
post thaw viability.  Centrifugation helps in  the removal of the solubilized DMSO, free 
hemoglobin and the majority of cell debris. 
 
 
B.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Umbilical cord blood units are cryopreserved in  a solution containing 10 % Dimethyl Sulfoxide 
(DMSO) and 1% Dextran. Stem cells cryopres erved in DMSO have limited viability upon 
thawing, resulting in the potential for significant loss of cells available for transplantation.  
DMSO, the cryoprotectant of choice, has cytotoxic effects when warmed to 37 °C.  Immediately 
upon thawing, intracellular DMSO cr eates a hypertonic intracellular environment which leads to 
sudden fluid shifts that compromi se cell viability. In addition, DMSO causes adverse side effects 
in vivo after reinfusion, including bl ood pressure instability, fever, chills, and nausea.  Lyses of 
red blood cells leads to accumulation of free he moglobin that can be nephrotoxic when infused 
intravenously.  Mixing the thawed cells with a hypertonic solution, immediatel y upon thawing can ameliorate 
many of these problems. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the hypertonic  thawing solution contains 5% human albumin 
and 10% Dextran 40 in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Dextran-Albumin thawing solution helps 
to restore the osmolarity of the blood cell su spension, promoting colloidal-osmotic intracellular 
equilibrium. Cell suspensions can then be wash ed to remove DMSO, free hemoglobin and other 
cellular products, thus allowi ng other procedures to be performed prior to reinfusion. 
   
C.  SCOPE 
 
This procedure describes in de tail the use of a hypertonic   
solution of Dextran and human albumin for thawing  cryopreserved cord blood units . The procedure covers  
all required steps for the app lication of the methodology.  
It starts with the initial prepar ations and continues from the  
time the selected unit is rem oved from the storage Dewar  
until the product is ready for patient infusion.  
Cord blood units are stored in double compartment  cryopreservation bags, which enables working with the  compartments independently if required. (Figure 1)

2.0 Background
The Role for Busulfan in Marrow Transplantation for Advanced 
Hematologic Malignancies
Busulfan [1, 4-bis-(methanesolfonoxyl) butane] is a bifunctional alkylating 
agent, and its use for a long period (~1954-1975) was limited to low dose oral therapy with palliative intent, requiring frequent blood count monitoring (Canellos 1985, Hughes 1991).  In 1974, however, Santos and Tutschka investigated the use of busulfan to create a murine model of aplastic anemia (Santos 1974).  Subsequently, the experience gained in this model system was used to introduce high-dose combination chemotherapy based on oral busulfan for pretransplant conditioning of non-human primates and, thereafter, for patients undergoing both autologous and allogeneic marrow transplantation (Santos 1983, Lu 1984, Yeager 1986, Tutschka 1987, Peters 1987, Geller 1989, Grochow 1989, Dix 1996, Sheridan 1989, Clift 1994, Schwertfeger 1992, Vaughan 1991).  Since then, high-dose busulfan, most commonly in combination with cyclophosphamide (BuCY), has proven to be an effective antileukemic regimen when used in conjunction with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell support.
Rationale for the Combination of Busulfan and Melphalan
Several series have demonstrated the potent antitumor effects of melphalan in 
advanced hematologic malignancies (Maraninchi, 1986).   Furthermore, because it has tolerable non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], non-hematologic toxicities with busulfan, it has been combined with busulfan to provide an effective, myelosuppressive 
2010-[ADDRESS_375462] (Vey 1996, 
Cony-Makhoul 1995, Meloni 2001).  However, the majority of these studies used oral busulfan, and extensive mucositis and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were documented.  Trials from our insitution and others (Andersson 2003, De Lima 2004, Shimoni 2003, Callander 2003, Schuler 2001) have shown that the i.v. preparation of busulfan is more effective and less toxic. 
However, some experience has already accumulated from a phase I study of 
escalating doses of i.v. busulfan with fixed dose melphalan in multiple myeloma patients receiving autologous HSCT at the University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center in San Antonio. Engraftment and toxicity data were recorded for patients receiving busulfan, with doses ranging from 10-13.5 mg/kg i.v., combined with 
melphalan at 140 mg/m
2.  Thus far, [ADDRESS_375463] received this regimen: 
neutrophil engraftment occurred at 9.5 +  0.9 days, platelet engraftent occurred at 
11.3 +  1.5 days, no grade IV mucositis or diarrhea occurred, and notably, no 
patients developed VOD (Callander 2003).    
We will use fixed doses of i.v. busulfan, derived from the pharamcokinetic (PK) 
data from a previous phase II study (see below), and melphalan in this phase II study.  
The main cytotoxic actions of busulfan and melphalan are through DNA 
alkylation.  To investigate whether these biochemical events can be correlated with treatment outcome, we intend to collect cells from consenting patients with circulating myeloma cells (>2,000 cells/µL), or bone marrow cells and study the in vitro alkylating effects of busulfan and melphalan and, if possible, in relation to cytokine activation.  Correlative samples will also be collected after the i.v. administration of busulfan and melphalan during the conditioning treatment. All of these correlative studies will be conducted under separate IRB-approved studies and will require separate consent.
2.[ADDRESS_375464] J. Russell (Calgary), who has used i.v. busulfan with fludarabine, as pretransplant conditioning therapy for approximately 250 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for hematologic malignancies (J Russell, MD, personal communication, December, 2000). His dose of 3.2 mg/kg body weight was extrapolated from our previous experience of using 0.8 mg/kg IV every six hours for a total of 16 doses.  The 0.8 mg/kg dose has previously been demonstrated to be pharmacokinetically similar to what was achieved with an oral dose of 1.0 mg/kg.  The 3.2 mg/kg body weight is equivalent to a dose of 130 mg/m2 dose.  This dose can be anticipated to yield a median target AUC of 5 – 6,500 µM-min, and it should be considered safe, affording a low risk for hepatic VOD.  The careful PK analysis of i.v. busulfan in relationship to dosing 
2010-0071

Page 4
weight, actual weight vs. adjusted ideal weight vs. ideal weight, yielded the 
information that dosing based on body surface area (BSA) derived from actual weight would give the most consistent dosing of i.v. busulfan for adults (Vaughan 1999).  Therefore, in this protocol, BSA will be derived from actual body weight for all patients, including those who are greater than 20% above their ideal body weight.  This is a shift in dosing strategy from our previous standard, in which we used ideal body weight to derive BSA to determine dosage.
Rationale for Melphalan Dose and Schedule
The melphalan total dose of 140 mg/M2 has been well-studied in a variety of  
combination regimens both at MD Anderson and elsewhere and is tolerable.  In subsequent studies, we propose to test the addition of a third agent, e.g a nucleoside analogue, to busulfan plus melphalan to effect controlled inhibition of DNA repair which is produced by [CONTACT_254913]/melphalan, and thus wish to allow a safety margin for any additional organ toxicity which might result. We have provided for a 24 hr "rest day" between busulfan and melphalan for two purposes: 1) to allow repletion of hepatic glutathione stores which will be depleted by [CONTACT_254913] (Meister 1988) and which can exascerbate melphalan toxicity (Awasthi 1996, Troyano 2001) and 2)  to allow for pi[INVESTIGATOR_306654].  Ultimately, we propose to  deliver both busulfan and melphalan in pharmacokinetically(PK)-directed doses to minimize interpatient variability in toxic and therapeutic effects.  To this end, we have shown that when melphalan is administered as a fractionated dose over 2-[ADDRESS_375465] day's dose predicts well for the PK of the subsequent doses (Jones, unpublished data).  Administering melphalan over two days not only coincides with a pattern established here in multiple other studies, but would allow an alternate method of PK-directed dosing if the pi[INVESTIGATOR_306655].
Rationale for the Combination of Busulfan and Melphalan for Myeloma
At least two randomized trials have shown that compared to conventional agents, 
high dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_306670] (MM).  However, relapse remains the most important cause of treatment failure in these patients.  Based on the results of randomized phase III trials, high-dose melphalan at 200 mg/m2 is considered the standard preparative regimen for MM. The median duration of remission after this regimen is only about [ADDRESS_375466] trial, conditioning with oral busulfan 12 mg/kg plus melphalan 140 mg/m(2) was associated with longer progression-free survival but equivalent survival to that achieved with melphalan 200 mg/m(2).  There was a higher frequency of veno-occlusive 
2010-[ADDRESS_375467] together with the 
limited access to novel salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_306656] 12 mg/kg plus melphalan 140 mg/m(2) may explain the absence of a survival difference. Oral busulfan was used in that study; and the authors concluded that the use of intravenous busulfan may reduce toxicity and result in greater efficacy, and warrants further investigation in myeloma patients. 
In the second trial from our institution, intravenous (i.v.) busulfan (Bu) was 
combined with melphalan (Mel) in patients with advanced lymphoid 
malignancies undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. Bu 130 mg/m
[ADDRESS_375468] 
dose of i.v. Bu at 32 mg/m2 given [ADDRESS_375469] day, followed by 2 daily doses of Mel at 70 mg/m2.  Eighty 
patients had i.v. Bu delivered per test dose guidance. The median daily 
systemic Bu exposure was 4867 μmol-min. One hundred two patients (Hodgkin lymphoma n = 49, non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 12, multiple myeloma = 41) with a median age of 44 years (range: 19-65 years) were treated. The 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 82% and 42%, respectively, for patients with multiple myeloma. The regimen was very well tolerated with treatment-related mortality at 100 days, 1 year, and 2 years of 1%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. Intravenous Bu-Mel was well tolerated. Disease control was encouraging, and should be explored in larger phase II studies.
We compared the CR rates and PFS in patients who received an 
auto-hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HCT) after Bu-Mel with several novel preparative regimens that were used at our institution. We restricted our analyses to patients undergoing auto-HCT for consolidation of first remission. The results are summarized in the Table below.

phase III trial to compare the safety and efficacy of a combination of a 
combination of IV busulfan and  melphalan 140 mg/m2 with melphalan 200 mg/m2 in an autologous SCT setting. 
At least two randomized trials have shown that high dose chemotherapy 
followed by [CONTACT_306671], when compared to conventional agents (Attal et al. 1996, Child et al. 2003) However, relapse remains the most important cause of treatment failure in these patients.  Based on the results of randomized phase III trials, high-dose melphalan at 200 mg/m2 is considered the standard-of-care preparative regimen for MM. The median duration of remission after this regimen is only about 24 months. (Attal et al. 1996, Child et al. 2003)That warrants exploration of more effective preparative regimens for MM. Earlier attempts at improving results with more intensive regimens have not resulted in improved outcomes. Based on at least two recent single arm clinical trials, a combination of busulfan and melphalan was found to be safe and effective in patients with myeloma. There is a suggestion from these trials that this combination may result in a superior outcome. (Lahuerta et al. 2010, Kebriei et al)
In this phase III trial we propose to compare the safety and efficacy of a 
combination of single daily dose IV busulfan and melphalan 140 mg/m2 with melphalan 200 mg/m2 in an autologous stem cell transplant setting. 
This was a randomized clinical trial of IV Busulfan + Melphalan (B+M) versus 
Melphalan (M) as preparative regimens for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) for multiple myeloma.  Following the prescribed rule in the trial design, this trial was stopped early due to an imbalance in the empi[INVESTIGATOR_306657] 90 (CR90) in the two arms.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_306658] 35% in the M arm versus 16% in the B+M arm.  This result was the opposite of what was anticipated when planning the trial, which was motivated by [CONTACT_306672].
On closer inspection of the data, a very surprising result was seen in terms of 
progression free survival (PFS) time.  For PFS time, the opposite effect of that for CR90 was seen.  Specifically, the B+M arm has better PFS than the M arm, as shown in Figure 1, which  records PFS time from day 90 when CR90 is evaluated. A similar difference is seen for PFS time recorded from date of transplant. This statistical result may be considered perplexing because, within each treatment arm, for patients for whom CR90 was evaluated, on average the occurrence of CR90 increased the time to failure (progression or death). That is, CR90 improved PFS in both arms.  
So the question has arisen of how it can be the case that 
2010-0071
December 14, 2015
Page 7
1) CR90 is higher in the M arm compared to the B+M arm, 
2) CR90 improves PFS in both arms, yet 3) PFS is superior in the B+M arm compared to the M arm.
A computation explaining this somewhat counterintuitive result is given in the 
Appendix.  Essentially, for each treatment arm, the time to failure probability distribution is a mixture (average) of the time to failure probability distributions for the two subgroups of patients for whom (i) treatment achieves CR90 and (ii) treatment does not achieve CR90.  
At this point, the trial has been stopped because the rule based on CR90 worked 
correctly, showing that the M arm is superior the B+M arm in terms of CR90, but the data also show that the B+M arm is superior to the M arm in terms of PFS.  
However, the current data are not sufficiently strong, in terms of sample size and 
magnitude of the difference in PFS, to provide confirmatory evidence that B+M is superior to M for these patients. 
Consequently, we feel strongly that this trial should be re-opened, but using a design 
based on PFS time as the primary endpoint, with CR90 as a secondary endpoint. 
3.0 Background Drug Information
Busulfan:
Therapeutic Classification : Antineoplastic Alkylating agent. 
Pharmaceutical data : Busulfan injection is a sterile, pyrogen-free solution provided in 
a mixture of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG400).  It is supplied in 10 ml single use ampoules at a concentration of six (6) mg busulfan per ml.  Each ampoule contains 60 mg of busulfan in 3.3 ml of DMA and 6.7 ml of PEG400.  When diluted in normal saline or D5W to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, the resulting solution must be administered within eight (8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour infusion of the drug. 
Stability and storage
: Ampoules should be stored refrigerated at 2-8°C (35-46°F).  
Stable at 4°C for at least twelve (12) months.  Additional stability studies are in 
progress.  DO NOT use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  DO NOT use if the solution is cloudy or if particulates are present. 
Solution Preparation
: Prepare the busulfan solution as follows (The patient is to 
receive a dose of 130 mg/m2 of busulfan): mix into normal saline to a final 
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. In each bag 6.0 mg busulfan (1.0 ml at 6 mg/ml and 11 ml saline) should be added 
to compensate for drug lost in the tubing with each infusion (approximately 12 ml at 0.5 mg/ml is lost in the tubing when using the controlled rate infusion pump). 
2010-0071
December 14, 2015
Page 8
Route of Administration : It is to be noted, that a sufficient amount of diluted busulfan 
should be added to compensate for the amount needed to prime the IV tubing; when 
hanging the infusate, the tubing should be primed with the busulfan solution and connected as close to the patient as possible, i.e. by a 3-way connector at the level of the central venous catheter.  After completed infusion, the tubing with remaining busulfan (approximately 12 mL) should be disconnected and discarded.  All busulfan infusions should be performed by [CONTACT_306673]. 
The high-dose busulfan will be given by [CONTACT_46598] (3) 
hours into a central venous catheter. 
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS
. 
An infusion pump will be used with the busulfan solutions as prepared above.  A new 
infusion set must be used for administration of each dose.  Prior to and following each infusion, flush the catheter line with normal saline or (approximately 5 ml).  Start the three-hour infusion at the calculated flow rate.  DO NOT infuse concomitantly with another intravenous solution of unknown compatibility. 
If a delay in administration occurs after the infusion solution is prepared, the properly 
identified container should be kept at room temperature (20-25°C), but administration must be completed within eight (8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour drug infusion. 
Adverse Events
: Dose limiting toxicity is expected to be hematological when used 
without stem cell support. Other toxicities seen frequently following high-dose 
busulfan in preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation include: VOD, nausea, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis, seizures, rash, and an Addison’s-like syndrome.   
Mechanism of action
: Interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA 
through DNA alkylation, and ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid 
function. 
Animal Tumor Data : Busulfan has been shown to be active against a variety of 
animal neoplasm in vivo , including mouse sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich’s mouse ascites 
tumor. Human Pharmacology
: Limited pharmacology data are available for the parenteral 
formulation to be used in this study and is detailed in the evaluation of IV Bu in a 
Phase II Trial using IV Bu at 0.8 mg/kg BW given over 2 hr every 6 hr for a total of 16 doses (Andersson et al, 2002) and when administered once daily for 4 days at a dose of 130 mg/m2 in combination with Flu (Madden et al, AHS 2003, de Lima et al, BLOOD 2004).  The pharmacokinetic data suggests that the plasma decay of the formulation fits an open one-compartment model with linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 12 mg-130 mg/m2.  Based on studies of oral Bu, the drug is reported 
2010-0071

to be extensively metabolized; twelve (12) metabolites have been isolated, but most 
have not been identified.  The drug is slowly excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid.  Ten to fifty percent (10-50%) of a dose is excreted as metabolites within twenty-four (24) hours (Nadkarni 1959). 
Melphalan
Therapeutic Classification : Melphalan is an alkylating agent of the 
bischloroethylamine type.  As a result, its cytotoxicity appears to be related to the 
extent of its interstrand cross-linking with DNA, probably by [CONTACT_46599] N7 position 
of guanine.  Like other bifunctional alkylating agents, it is active against both resting 
and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46548].
FORMULATION :  Melphalan for injection is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, 
freeze-dried powder.  Each single-use vial contains melphalan hydrochloride 
equivalent to 50 mg melphalan and 20 mg povidone.
PREPARATION :  Melphalan for injection must be reconstituted by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_46549] 
10 mL of the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a 
sterile needle and syringe.  This provides a 5 mg/mL solution of melphalan.  Immediately dilute the dose to be administered in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL.  Administer the diluted product over a minimum of 15 minutes.  Complete the administration within 60 minutes of reconstitution.
STORAGE AND STABILITY
:  Melphalan for injection vials should be stored at 
controlled room temperature 15o to 30o C (59o to 86o F) and protected from light.  The 
time between reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan should be kept 
to a minimum because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan are unstable.  Over as short a time as 30 minutes, a citrate derivative of melphalan has been detected in reconstituted material from the reaction of melphalan with the diluent.  Upon further dilution with saline, nearly 1% label strength of melphalan hydrolizes every [ADDRESS_375470]. 
ADVERSE EVENTS : The following information on adverse reactions is based on 
data from both oral and IV administration of melphalan as a single agent, using 
several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies.  Please refer to the Adverse Reactions and Warnings sections of the product package insert.
Hematologic:  The most common side effect is bone marrow suppression.  White 
blood cell count and platelet count nadirs usually occur 2 to 3 weeks after treatment, with recovery in 4 to 5 weeks after treatment.  Irreversible bone marrow failure has been reported.
Gastrointestinal:  Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, 
2010-0071
December 14, 2015
Page 10
diarrhea, and oral ulceration occur infrequently.  Hepatic toxicity, including 
veno-occlusive disease, has been reported.Hypersensitivity:  Acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis were reported in 2.4% of [ADDRESS_375471] also been reported with oral melphalan.
Carcinogenesis:  Secondary malignancies, including acute nonlymphocytic 
leukemia, myeloproliferative syndrome, and carcinoma, have been reported in 
patients with cancer treated with alkylating agents (including melphalan).
Other:  Other reported adverse reactions include skin hypersensitivity, skin 
ulceration at injection site, skin necrosis rarely requiring skin grafting, vasculitis, alopecia, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis.

5.0 Treatment Plan
Mobilization and Collection of Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells (PBPCs).
The mobilization and collection of the PBPCs is a standard procedure for which patients sign a separate informed consent. This procedure does not constitute part of the 
proposed research therefore can occur prior or after protocol registration.  
After registration patients will be selected to receive one of the two preparative 
regimens. The randomization will be 1:1, using a computer to assign each patient to either arm 1 (Busulfan-Melphalan) or 2 (Melphalan alone). 
Chemotherapy agents doses and administration.
Chemotherapy agents used in the proposed treatment plans will be dosed and 
administered as outlined below.   
When possible, Busulfan pharmacokinetics will be performed. In the event that dose 
adjustment is not possible Busulfan will be dosed at 130 mg/m2 starting on day minus [ADDRESS_375473] dose administration time is 45 minutes.  
Pharmacokinetic-guided (PK-guided) treatment arm: The Busulfan “testdose” of 32 
mg/m2 will be based on actual body weight, no arbitrary dose adjustment(s) are allowed 
for this busulfan dose on this protocol.
The busulfan dose in the “fixed-dose” treatment arm will be calculated as follows: For 
patients whose actual body weight is <  20% above ideal body weight, the actual body 
weight isused to calculate the body surface area (BSA). For patients whose actual body weight is >20% above ideal body weight, an “adjusted body weight” is used to calculate the BSA. 
Melphalan will be dosed as follows: for patients whose actual body weight is <
 20% 
above ideal body weight, the actual body weight is used to calculate the body surface 
area (BSA). For patients whose actual body weight is >20% above ideal body weight, an “adjusted body weight” is used to calculate the BSA. 
Formula to calculate adjusted body weight:  Adjusted BW (Kg) = IBW + 0.5 (Actual body 
weight - IBW).

10.0 Statistical Considerations
This is a randomized group sequential design to compare B+M to M based on PFS 
time, assuming a null median PFS time of [ADDRESS_375479] a median PFS of 34 months, which is a 70% increase with B+M, with up to three tests using O’Brien-Fleming decision boundaries. The tests will be conducted when there are a total of 45, 90, and [ADDRESS_375480] cut-offs  +/-  4.0757, 2.7768, and 2.2077. Assuming an accrual rate of 5 patients per month, this design has an expected accrual of 205 patients total, for 205 - 92 = [ADDRESS_375481] transplant
In the original design of this randomized trial, an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_306662] 90-day complete remission (CR90) was used.  Following this rule, the trial was stopped early due to an imbalance in the empi[INVESTIGATOR_306663]90 in the two arms.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_306658] 35% in the M arm versus 16% in the B+M arm, which was the opposite of what was anticipated when planning the trial, motivated by [CONTACT_306672]. On closer inspection of the data, a very surprising result was seen in terms of progression free survival (PFS) time.  For PFS time, the opposite effect of that for CR90 was seen.  Specifically, the B+M arm has better PFS than the M arm, starting from day 90 when CR90 was evaluated. A similar difference was seen for PFS time recorded from date of transplant. This statistical result may be considered perplexing because, within each treatment arm, for patients for whom CR90 was evaluated on average the occurrence of CR90 increased the time to failure (progression or death). That is, CR90 improved PFS in both arms.  So the question now arises of how it can be the case that 
1) CR90 is higher in the M arm compared to the B+M arm, 
2010-0071
December 14, 2015
Page 17
2) CR90 improves PFS in both arms, yet 
3) PFS is superior in the B+M arm compared to the M arm.
A computation explaining this somewhat counterintuitive result is given in the Appendix.  
APPENDIX
This appendix provides a detailed explanation of the counterintuitive results of this 
randomized clinical trial of IV Busulfan + Melphalanj (B+M) versus Melphalan (M) as preparative regimens  for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) for multiple myeloma.
For simplicity, the following are landmark analyses starting at day [ADDRESS_375482] CR90 evaluated.  The same conclusions for PFS are obtained, however, if time is started at the time of transplant, i.e. if all patients are included. 
Notation
CR90 = the event that the patient had a CR when evaluated at day 90T = Progression free survival (PFS) time = time to progression or death, starting at day 
90.
P(T > 12 | M, CR90) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan arm who achieved 
CR90 had  PFS time of at least 12 months
P(T > 12 | M, NCR90) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan arm who did 
NOT achieve CR90 had  PFS time of at least 12 months
P(T > 12 | M+B, CR90) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan + Busulfan arm 
who achieved CR90 had  PFS time of at least 12 months
P(T > 12 | M+B, NCR90) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan+ Busulfan 
arm who did NOT achieve CR90 had  PFS time of at least 12 months
P(T > 12 | M ) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan arm had  PFS time of at 
least 12 months
P(T > 12 | M+B ) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan+ Busulfan arm  had  
PFS time of at least 12 months
Pr(CR90 | M) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan arm achieved a CR90Pr(CR90 | M+B) = the probability that a patient on the Melphalan + Busulfan arm

achieved a CR90
Probability Mixture Computations
For the M arm,P(T > 12 | M ) = P(T > 12 | M, CR90) x Pr(CR90 | M)  + P(T > 12 | M, NCR90) x {1 - 
Pr(CR90 | M)}
For the B+M arm,P(T > 12 | M+B ) = P(T > 12 | M+B, CR90) x Pr(CR90 | M+B)  
+ P(T > 12 | M+B, NCR90) x {1 - Pr(CR90 | M+B)}
In words, these equations say that, in each treatment arm, the overall probability of 
12-month PFS (starting at day 90) is the average of two 12-month PFS probabilities: one for the patients who achieved a CR at day 90, and the other for the patients who do not achieve a CR at day 90.
Statistical Estimates from the Trial Data
Using a * to denote a statistical estimatePr(CR90 | M)* = .35Pr(CR90 | M+B)* = .16P(T > 12 | M, CR90)* = .91P(T > 12 | M, NCR90)* = .68P(T > 12 | M+B, CR90)* = 1.00P(T > 12 | M+B, NCR90)* = .89Note that the M arm has a much higher CR90 probability, .35, compared to .16 for  the 
B+M arm. This is why the trial was stopped early.  Substituting these estimates into the mixture model equations gives 
P(T > 12 | M )* =   .91 x .35 + .68 x (1 - .35) = .76        ( 95% ci .65 - .89 )P(T > 12 | M +B)* = 1.00 x .16 + .89 x (1 - .16) = .91       ( 95% ci .83 - .99 )The logrank test to compare PFS has p-value  = .047, so the M+B arm had significantly

higher PFS
Conclusions :  
1. The M arm had a much higher CR90 rate, more than double that of the M+B arm.2. In each arm, CR90 increased the probability of 12-month PFS.3. M+B had higher PFS than M among patients who achieved CR90.4. M+B had higher PFS than M among patients who did not achieve CR90.5.  M+B had higher overall PFS probability than the M armThis is because the 12-month PFS probability was very high for both the CR90 and 
NCR90 groups  in the M+B arm, 1.[ADDRESS_375483].  The randomization will use the Pocock-Simon method [Pocock 1975] 
will used to balance  dynamically on age, dichotomizing this as [age <
 65 ] and [66 <  
age <  70] be carried out using the Department of Biostatistics Clinical Trials Conduct 
Website. The interim and final decision rules will be applied using a specialized computer program written by [CONTACT_306683], and will be based on the interim and final CR data provided by [CONTACT_20767]’s Principal Investigator.
Secondary Endpoints.  Overall survival (OS) time, transplant related mortality, NIH 
toxicities, quality of life, and 90-day complete response (CR) will be evaluated as 
secondary endpoints. CR is defined as (i) negative immofixation of the MM protein in urine and serum, (ii) disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and (iii) less than 5% plasma MM cells in the bone marrow.
Trial Conduct.  The randomization will use the Pocock-Simon method [Pocock 1975] 
will used to balance  dynamically on age, dichotomizing this as [age <
 65 ] and [66 <  
age <  70] be carried out using the Department of Biostatistics Clinical Trials Conduct 
Website. 
Data Analyses.   Logistic regression models will be fit to assess the joint effects of 
treatment arm and patient covariates on the probability of CR [Venables 2002]. 
Kaplan-Meier plots [Kaplan 1958] will be used to estimate the unadjusted OS and PFS time distributions in the two arms. Time-to-event regression analysis will be used to evaluate the ability of treatment arm and patient covariates to predict OS and PFS, with the model underlying model chosen based on preliminary goodness-of-fit analyses of the data. Additionally, landmark analyses of PFS and OS will be conducted starting at day 90, when CR is evaluated.

Title: Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes among Patients Receiving Palbociclib
Combinations for HR+/HER2 -Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer in Real World Settings.
Rationale and background: Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer -related death in females 
worldwide.  Hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
2negative (HER2 -) breast cancer is the most commonly  diagnosed subt ype accounting for 
around 73% of all diagnosed breast cancers.  Palbociclib is a first in class CDK4/6 inhibitor 
that has been approved for use in HR+/HER - advanced/metastatic breast cancer (ABC/MBC) 
patients in a number of indications on the basis of efficacy demonstrated in three pi[INVESTIGATOR_402377]; PAL OMA -1 and PALOMA -2 (initial endocrine -based therapy ) and 
PAL OMA -3 (after progression following endocrine therapy ). As a result of the recent 
approvals there is a need to understand the real world usage and clinical outcomes of patients 
receiving palbociclib in order to inform future treatment decisions. This study  has been 
previously  conducted in the US and Argentina with an additional ‘interim’ chart review 
conducted in German y whereb y no long term clinical outcomes were collected.
Research question and objectives: The primary  objectives of this study  are to describe t he 
patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of 
adult female patients who have received palbociclib combination treatments in line with 
locally licensed indications in real world settings across multiple coun tries.
Study design: This retrospective ph ysician based medical record review will collect data from 
medical records of patients, who have received palbociclib combination in line with locally  
approved indications in 13countries globally (data collection in four countries, US ,
Argentina and “interim” German data in 2018 and Canada and [LOCATION_013]  “core” data in [ADDRESS_823163] alread
y been conducted) . In countries where palbociclib has been on the market for a 
sufficient period of time and therefore sufficient follow-up data are available, a one- time 
review of patient’s medical records will be conducted. The study  composed of two data 
collection phases, a core medical record review and an interim medical record review. The 
core stud y will be conducted across all markets whereb y all variables collected, including 
sections relating to clinical outcomes (progression free rates, survival rates, best response 
etc.). The interim study  will collect all data except the clinical outcomes due to lack of 
follow up time (ie, time since palbociclib approval was not long enough ago in some markets 
for sufficient follow up time to collect clinical outcomes data). The interim study  was 
conducted in German y in 2018 and is not planned fo r additional markets .
Population: Data will be collected from [LOCATION_009], Italy, [LOCATION_006], Switzerland, Belgium , Spain, 
Netherlands, Portugal and Japan, with approximately  15-[ADDRESS_823164] treated or be 
treating a minimum of 
2or more (dependent on country ) HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC patients 
who meet the eligibility  criteria for this study .  Each phy sician will complete between 
3-14electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  Previously , data has been collected in the US

palbocicib combination .  The ‘index date’ will be defined as [ADDRESS_823166] 
prescribed palbociclib + partner therap y following the availability of specific indication in 
the market.  To be eligible, patients must be female, aged [ADDRESS_823167] been diagnosed 
with HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC and must have received palbociclib combination in line with 
locally  approved indications.  For the core study , patients must have initiated palbociclib 
with fulvestrant a minimum of three months, or palbociclib with letrozole/aromatase inhibitor 
a minimum of six months prior to data collection.
Variables: The variables assessed in this study  will be patient demographics at the time of 
data collection, clinical characteristics, comorbid conditions, earl y and advanced breast 
cancer treatment history , palbociclib treatment patterns including dose changes, clinical 
outcomes (core medical record review onl y) andtime since deceased (no. of day s)if 
applicable.
Data sources: Patient medical records will be used as the data source.
Study size: For the core st udy up to approximately 476-[ADDRESS_823168] in Argentina 162 eCRFs were collected from 41 physicians. For the German i nterim 
review 42 ph ysicians were recruited with 257 eCRFs completed and for the German core 
study  35 phy sicias were recruited completing 251 eCRFs. In Canada, 33 phy sicians 
comp
leted 259 eCRFs.
Data analysis: All analy ses will be descriptive in nature. Categorical variables will be 
described using the number of observations, number and percent (%) in each category , and 
number of missing observations . Numeric variables will be described using the number of 
observations, mean and standard deviation, and minimum, maximum, median ,interquartile 
range , and number of missing observations . Time to event will be described using a 
Kaplan -Meier chart or the median.

cancer diagnosed globally in 2012, which equated to 12% of all diagnosed cancers. Out of 
these new cases 522,000 females died of the disease, which represented 15% of female 
deaths from cancer in [ADDRESS_823172] cancer survival 
rates, ranging from 80% or more in North America, Sweden and Japan to 60% in 
middle -income countries and as low as 40% in low -income countries .2Breast cancer 
survival rates have increased over the last 50 years, as relative survival increased from 
75.2% in 1975 to 90.6% in 2008.3The 5 y ear survival rate for females with stage 0/ I breast 
cancer is near to 100%, compared to that of Stage II and III, which are 93% and 72% 
respectivel y. Females who are diagnosed with metastatic or sta ge IV breast cancer have a 
much lower 5 year survival rate of 22%.[ADDRESS_823173] tumors are grouped according to the expression of hormone 
receptors (HR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2). Over all HR status is 
the most important biomarker for breast cancer classification, as around 75% of all breast 
cancer tumors are HR positive (HR+). Tumors that are HR+ grow in response to increased 
levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. HR+ breas t tumors are the most 
favorable, as they  respond well to hormone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In contrast HR -breast tumors do not 
respond well to hormone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These tumors are known to be the most aggressive 
cancers, in regards to tumor size, grade, stage and patient outcome. HER2 positive (HER2+) 
breast tumors represent around 15% of all breast tumors. These tumors tend to be more 
aggressive and faster growing than HER2 negative (HER2- ) tumors. HR+/HER2 -breast 
cancer is the mo st common subty pe diagnosed in the US. This subty pe accounted for around 
73% of diagnosed breast cancer cases in 2010. Around 15- 20% of breast tumors do not 
contain HR or HER2; these are known as triple negative breast cancers .[ADDRESS_823174] 
emerged as the preferred treatment for HR+ breast cancers. Following the success of the 
Phase II PALOMA - 1 trial, the FDA granted accelerated approval of the CDK4/CDK6 
inhibitor palbociclib that causes cell cy cle arrest to be used in combination with letrozole to 
treat advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2 -post-menopausal breast cancer. The PALOMA -[ADDRESS_823175] -menopausal patients

indication .8

Page 13of 28In October 2016, palbociclib was granted approval to be used in combination with 
fulvestrant. This was following the success of the P hase III PALOMA -3 trial, conducted in 
patients with advanced/metastatic HR+/HER - breast cancer that had relapsed or progressed 
during endocrine therap y. The PALOMA -3 trial demonstrated a median progression- free 
survival of 10.8 months in those receiving fulvestrant in co mbination with palbociclib 
vs.4.8months in patients receiving fulvestrant with placebo .8
As a result of the recent approval of palbociclib, there is scarce information regarding how 
and when palbociclib combination is prescribed in routine clinical practice, and the outcomes 
associated with palbociclib use. Therefore, real world data on the characteristics, treatment 
patterns and clinical outcomes amo ng patients receiving palbociclib combinations to treat 
HR+/HER - advanced/metastactic breast cancer (ABC/MBC) will provide valuable insight to 
help inform treatment decisions.
7.RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of this real world study  is to describe patient demographics, clinical 
characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of adult female patients who have 
received palbociclib combination treatments in line with locally licensed indications in real 
world settings across multiple countries:
Canada/Argentina:
Palbociclib in combination with letrozole as earl yendocrine therapy to treat
advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2- post-menopausal breast cancer (CAN: May 2016,
ARG: December 2015).
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of females with
HR+/HER2
-ABC/MBC with disease progression following endocrine therapy
(CAN: May 2017, ARG: August 2016). In pre -or perimenopausal females, the 
endocrine therap y should be combined with a luteinizing hormone -
releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist.
Across the EU , Switzerland , US 
andJapan:
Palbociclib in combination with aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therap y 
for the treatment of females with HR+/HER2- locally  ABC/MBC (EMA: November 
2016, Switz: October 2017, US: Feb 2015, updated Mar 2017) .
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of females with 
HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC who have received prior endocrine therap y 
(EMA: November 2016 Switz: March 2017 ).In pre-or perimenopausal females, the 
endo crine therap y should be combined with a luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist.

specific indication in the market (eg, If palbociclib + letrozole was available Feb 1, 2015 in 
the US and the ph ysician initiated a patient on palbociclib+ letrozole the next day , the index 
date will be April 2, 2015).  The index date will differ for the specific 
indications/combination partners if approved on different dates.
Study  materials (ie, the CRF) will be subject to pi[INVESTIGATOR_619282], feasibility , ease of understanding and use, and the relevance 
to the objectives.
The advantage to a retrospective medical record review approach over a database anal ysis is 
that of being designed specificall y to collect data that fulfils the study  objectives.  Thus, it 
readil y collects and informs on all key drug related clinical outcome measures of critical 
importance to this study , in a consistent manner, across countries.  The resulting data set 
enables direct comparisons across markets
, delivering in turn greater confidence in the 
reliability  of conclusions drawn from the research.  An additional advantage of this approach 
lies in the ability  to obtain information that only  the treating phy sician may  be aware of, such

The sample size above should be considered flexible, with scope to increase the sample size 
if feasible.  This will be assessed on a country  by [CONTACT_619291].
The objectives do not state any hypotheses and therefore, do not require any statistical 
testing.  All the anal yses will be descriptive and so sample size calculations are not required.
8.6.Data Management
Physician reported data from the eCRF will be transferred to a single electronic database.  All 
data will be de -identified and anony mized.  I ncomplete data may  be excluded from analy sis 
following discussion with [COMPANY_007].
De-identified raw data files will be transferred to [COMPANY_007] by  a secure file transfer protocol 
(FTP)site.
Analy ses wi ll be conducted in STATA statistical software version 14.1 (StataCorp, 2016.  
Stata statistical software: Release 14.  College Station, TX, StataCorp L P).

Page 22of 288.7.Data Analysis
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of data collected in this stu dy will 
be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will be dated, filed and 
maintained by [CONTACT_456]. The SAP may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; any  
major modifications of primary  endpoint definitions or their anal yses would be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
All analy ses are to be descriptive and so all methods to be used will reflect this descriptive 
nature. The specific method that will be used depends on ty pe of variable being anal ysed and 
those methods are:
Categorical variables – will be described using:
Number of observations (n);
Number and percent (%) within each category ;
Number of missing observations .
Numeric variables –will be described using:
Number of observations (n) ;
Mean andStandard deviation ;
Minimum, Max imum, Median and 1stand3rdQuartiles
;
Number of missing observations.
Time to event –willbe described using:
A Kaplan -Meier chart that will visually  estimate the distribution of times to some 
events, eg ,progression, and will take into account those pa tients for which the 
event has not as yet occurred ;
1-yr and 2 -yr rates, median or some more appropriate percentiles if the median 
time is not reached in the sample.
The anal yses will be conducted (using the methods above) in a number of phases, as already
detailed in the study  design section.
1.Non EU countries – all variables (as shown in Section 8.3 ) will be described .

outcomes) will be described .
3.EU countries - all variables will be described .
Missing data will be excluded on a case by [CONTACT_619292]. This will 
mean that each table will not necessaril y be based on the same number of patients.
Subgroup Analysis
Exploratory  stratifications will be conducted to explore differences between line of therapy , 
demographics, treatments, clinical characteristics, baseline co -morbidities or ‘responders’ 
and ‘non- responders’ to treatment, however these wil l be only  descriptive in nature. 
Responders and non -responders will be defined according to the best recorded response to 
palbociclib treatment.
Sample size permitting, additional stratifications may  include:
Insurance ty pe.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) Performance status.
Age.
Menopausal status.
Denovo vs. recurrent disease.
Bone only disease.
Visceral vs. non- visceral metastases.
By[CONTACT_398093], eg,liver, lung .
Burden ofmetastases (eg,visceral involvement, multiple liver lesions, bilateral vs 
single lung involvement, presence of pleural effusion) .
Duration ofdisease free interval (DFI) .
Specific comorbidities .
Comorbidity index .
Prior endocrine treatment .

8.8.Quality Control
To maximize data quality  the following will be undertaken:
Provision of standardized instructions on study  design, methodology  and procedures:
Physicians will be contact[CONTACT_619293] (detailing study objectives, patient inclusion criteria, correct
completion of eCRF andinterview andanyother logistical aspects ofthe study );
Follow -up with the phy sicians to ensure queries are resolved quickl y.
The electronic materials will be tested thoroughl y to ensure that all questions appear 
correctly  on screen, allow eas y interpretation/completion and that all routing and 
logic checks are working correctly
. As such, there should be no missing data (given 
the online nature of the study , the ph ysician will have to complete a question before 
he/she is able to move on the next) however, ‘don’t know or unknown’ will be valid 
responses.
There will be no monitoring visits or source data verification in this study .
8.9.Limitations ofthe Research Methods
A key  limitation of a study  of this nature is the reliance on accurate, complete eCRFs; which 
is dependent on the correct completion of the study materials and the availability  of a 
detailed, complete patient records. We have outlined a number of importan t quality  control 
steps to be taken as part of the study procedures to minimize the impact of this. Notably , to 
reduce the administrative burden on all ph ysicians, the materials will be as short and 
user-friendly  as possible.
The representativeness of the sample is limited to the consulting population for participation, 
who has been previousl y prescribed palbociclib combination in line with locally  approved 
indications. We will not collect data from patients from non- participating phy sicians, thus 
introducing a potential selection bias. To minimize this multiple phy sicians will be recruited 
in each country  from a diverse geographical spread and mixed private/public practice where 
possible. To eliminate any  patient identification bias during data collecti on a sy stematic 
patient selection criteria will be included and stressed to each participating phy sician. This 
will be further defined in the eCRFs, but will take into account the date of palbociclib 
approval for each indication. Patients who received palbociclib prior to approval or off -label 
are not represented in this study .
Due to the observational design of the study , treatments received by  [CONTACT_619294] a channeling bias and thus must be interpreted with caution.

9.1.Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws.  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality  and protection of patient personal data.
This study  will involve secondary  data collection which will include human review of 
unstructured data. No protected h ealth information (PHI) will be collected and all data will 
be de -identified. The research poses a minimal risk to patients, will not affect the rights or 
welfare of the patient and the study  would not be feasible should informed consent be 
required. As a result, informed consent will not be sought for this study .

10.MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVE RSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS REQUIREMENTS
This study  protocol requires human review of patient- level unstructured data; unstructured 
data refer to verbatim medical data, including text- based descriptions and visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_539935], such as medical records, images of ph ysician notes, neurological scans, 
X-rays, or narrative fields in a database.  The reviewer is obligated to report adverse events 
(AEs) with explicit attribution to any  [COMPANY_007] drug that appear in the reviewed information 
(defined per the patient population and study  period specified in the protocol).  Explicit 

Palbociclib
A5481 090NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Final, [ADDRESS_823189] be based on a definite statement of causality  by a healthcare provider linking drug 
administration to the AE.
The requirements for reporting safet y events on the non -interventional study  (NIS) adverse 
event monitoring (AEM) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safet y are as follows:
All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit attrib ution to any [COMPANY_007] drug that 
appear in the reviewed information must be recorded on the eCRF and reported, 
within 24 hours of awareness, to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the NI S AEM Report Form.
Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy , exposure 
during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of 
efficacy , and occupational exposure associated with the use of a [COMPANY_007] product must 
be reported, within [ADDRESS_823190] one patient identifier (eg, gender, age as captured in the narrative field of 
the form) will be reported on the NI S AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be 
considered a valid one in accordance with pharmacovigilance legislation.  All identifiers will 
be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35- year-old female...” or “An elderl y 
male...”  Other iden tifiers will have been removed. 
Additionally , the onset/start dates and stop dates for “Illness”, “Study  Drug”, and “Drug 
Name” may  be documented in month/y ear (mmm/yyyy ) format rather than identify ing the 
actual date of occurrence within the month /y ear of occurrence in the day /month /year 
(DD/MMM/YYYY) format.
All research staff members must complete the following [COMPANY_007] training requirements:   
“YRR Training for Vendors W orking on [COMPANY_007] Studies (excluding interventional 
clinical studies and non- interventional primary data collection studies with 
sites/investigators) ”.

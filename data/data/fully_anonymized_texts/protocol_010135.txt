 
Effects of Adrenaline Infiltration on Surgical Field of View in 
Endoscopic Sinus Surgery 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
March 27, [ADDRESS_319056] perform chart review to screen for patients who were scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery for rhinosinusitis that meet both our inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. We will check the date of the patient’s  next visit to meet them and explain th e 
study protocol and ask for their consent. If they consent to the study, on the day which they have the surgery we will follow the protocol, giving topi[INVESTIGATOR_262372] (patient will 
receive 1% xylocaine with adrenaline (1:100,000) on one side and saline on the contralateral side, they will be randomized to which side receive which solution for 
infiltration). The Estimated blood loss on each side and the duration of the surgery on 
each side will also be recorded. The Video of the surgery will be evaluated by [ADDRESS_319057] operativ e follow up as for endoscopic 
sinus surgery. At the patient's first follow up at [ADDRESS_319058] under a well -controlled  circumstance as under general anesthesia where 
patient's vital signs are closely monitored we believe that it is safe to perform th e 
procedure. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_262373] a number of 
surgeons world wide in the use for endoscopic sinus surgery and has known to be safe 
and potent with great result in bleeding control.  
c. Use of Deception in the Study  
Deception will not be used to enroll the patient. We will not perform the procedure 
without the patient’s consent.  
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
Video recording will be performed in the study (our department usually has all the 
surgeries recorded as a routine pr ocedure). This will be reviewed by [ADDRESS_319059]'s university (attendings or rhinology fellows). The otolaryngologist  reviewing 
and grading the video will be blinded to which side of the sinus surgery was  performed under only topi[INVESTIGATOR_262374]. The  video given will be labeled  by [CONTACT_262383].  
e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment  
Many different methods and many different agents have been used to help reduce bleeding in endoscopic sinus surgery. Currently, adrenaline has become the consensus as 
the best agent used for this purpose; however, there is no one conse nsus method of 
delivery, each center practices according to their experience for the best of the patients. 
At our center, half of the team use only topi[INVESTIGATOR_262375] w ith topi[INVESTIGATOR_262376]. 
Therefore, the alternative at our center depends on the surgeon’s experience between 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_262377]. In this study the 
participant instead of one or the other will get a comb ination of pure topi[INVESTIGATOR_262378]. Using both topi[INVESTIGATOR_262379], 
however infiltration of adrenaline may have potential side effect e.g. cardiovascular and 
central nervous system side effects. However, xylocaine with adrenaline is a widely used anesthesia and administering at appropriate dosage and route under an extremely well 
controlled environment as being under general anesthesia in the operating room where all 
patient's vital signs are monitored shouldn't be risky. Now that topi[INVESTIGATOR_262380].  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
After the study, the participants will be  able to use any therapy that is appropriate for 
them.  
g. Study Endpoint(s)  
The study will end after the required number of participant has been enrolled. Since both 
method is the standard we currently perform at  the department we do not expect any 
harmful results to the participants.  
3. BACKGROUND  
a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
In the past there have been studies which tried to address the best methods to help 
optimize the surgical field. However, none has actually compared the injection of 
adrenaline to the control using a proper endoscopic grading score (which is a more 
accurate way of assessing visual field in comparison to using the estimated blood loss). 
Since estimated blood loss may give just a crude estimate of the surgical field, we suspect 
that it may be the reason why the previous studies couldn't demonstrate the significant of 
infiltration of adrenaline to the surgical field of view in endoscopic sinus surgery.

i. Screening Procedures  
Screening will be done by [CONTACT_14716]. Personal health information, e.g., patient’s 
history, symptoms, prior treatment, endoscopic and computer tomography of paranasal 
sinus findings may be reviewed to see if the patient may fit the inclusion criteria. If the 
patient meets the criteria then on the patient's preoperative visit we will explain the study 
and discuss enrollment. No additional laboratory test apart from their routine preoperative 
test will be requir ed. 
j. Participation in Multiple Protocols

participant to fill out.  
9. RISKS 
a. Potential Risks  
i. Investigational devices  
The study doesn't involve an investigational device.  
ii. Investigational drugs 
The study doesn't involve an investigational drug.  
iii. Commercially available drugs, biologics, reagents or chemicals  
Irritation to infiltration site, persistent paresthesia, central nervous system excitatory or 
depressant effect which may cause headache, nausea, ringing in the ear, confusion, 
cardiovascu lar effect such as bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse or 
tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_262381],  hypersensitivity reaction .  
 
Correct route and dosage of the medication is important to avoid the adverse effects, the 
medication will be  infiltrated by [CONTACT_262385].  
iv. Procedures 
The procedure is intranasal infiltration of 1% xylocaine with adrenaline which is a 
routine procedure in endoscopic sinus surgery.  
v. Radioisotopes/radiation -producing machines  
There will be no use of radioisotopes/radiation-producing machine for the study.  
vi. Physical  well-being  
We do not anticipate that participants in this study will be placed at risk in terms of 
physical well -being.  
vii. Psych ological  well-being 
We do not anticipate that participants in this study will be placed at risk in terms of psychological well -being.  
viii. Economic well -being  
We do not anticipate that participants in this study will be placed at risk in terms of economic well -being.  
ix. Social  well-being 
We do not anticipate that participants in this study will be placed at risk in social well -
being.  
x. Overall evaluation of risk  
Low risk  
b. International Research  Risk Procedures  
N/A 
c. Procedures to Minimize Risk  

Overall potential risk to the patient should be very low. The patient will get the 
infiltration right before the surgery after general anesthesia where the vital signs will be 
closely monitored in the intra operative setting by [CONTACT_172761]. Also any intranasal 
bleeding from the surgery is easily controlled in the operating room under endoscopic 
view with medications and equipment set up ready for the surgery.  
d. Study Conclusion 
The participants will only be given one dose of the infiltration throughout the study. If any adverse effects were to happen, the participant will be terminated from the study and 
will be closely taken care of. As the infiltration will take place in the operating room after 
the patient is under general anesthesia, where the patient will be fully monitored, any 
adverse effects would be easily detected at a very early stage and best appropriate 
treatment will be given.  
e. Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
i. Data and/or events subject to review 
Monitoring will include bleeding intraoperatively and postoperatively, the visual 
field grading sc ale score, patient's vital sign intraoperatively, the overall blood loss 
on each side, the operative time on each side.  
ii. Person(s) responsible for Data and Safety Monitoring 
The protocol director, co-protocol director and academic sponsor will be responsible 
for data and safety monitoring of the study.  
iii. Frequency of DSMB meetings  
The protocol director will meet with the other researchers conducting the study on a 
weekly  basis (every Monday evening) to review the protocol.  
iv. Specific triggers or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262382]. However, this is very unlikely since intranasal infiltration of xylocaine with adrenaline is a 
routine procedure perform for endoscopic sinus surgery and infiltration at correct 
dosage and by [CONTACT_262386]'t result in any 
major complications.  
v. DSMB Reporting  
The IRB will be informed if any abnormal outcomes were to occur.  
vi. Will the Protocol Director be the only monitoring entity? (Y/N)  
Yes 
vii. Will a board, committee, or safety monitor be responsible for study monitoring? 
(Y/N)  
No

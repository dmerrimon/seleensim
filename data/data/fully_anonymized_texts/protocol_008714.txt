Synopsis
Title A Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of copanlisib in combination with rituximab in patients with 
relapsed indolent B -cell non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL) –CHRONOS -3
Short title Copanlisib and rituximab in relapsed iNHL
Clinical study phase III
Study objective(s) The primary objective of this study is:
To evaluate whether copanlisib in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo 
in combination with rituximab in prolonging progression -free survival (PFS) in 
patients with relapsed iNHL who have received one or more lines of treatment, 
including rituximab , and who either had a treatment -free interval of ≥[ADDRESS_655303] rituximab -containing treatment, or who are unwilling to 
receive chemotherapy /forwhom chemotherapy is contraindicated on reason of age, 
comorbidities, and/or residual toxicity
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate:
The follow ing characteristics of disease -related symptoms: “ time to 
deterioration ”and “time to improvement ” 
Other radiological and clinical indicators of treatment efficacy
Safety and tolerability of copanlisib
The other objectives of this study are to evaluate:
Pharm acokinetics
Biomarkers
Quality of life

Indication Relapsed indolent B -cell non -Hodgkin ’slymphoma
Diagnosis and main 
criteria for inclusionHistologically confirmed diagnosis of iNHL in CD20 positive patients with 
histological subtype limited to :

progression after partial response) after the last rituximab -, rituximab biosimilars -, or 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (e.g. obinutuzumab) -containing therapy (other 
previous treatment lines after rituximab are allow ed). A previous regimen is defined 
as one of the following: at least 2 months of single -agent therapy (less than 2 months

has not been previously irradiated) according to the Recommendations for Initial 
Evaluation, Staging ,and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification .For patients with splenic MZL this 
requirement may be restricted to splenomegaly alone since that is usually the only 
manifestation of measurable disease.
Patient saffected by [CONTACT_507946] -dimensionally measurable 
lesion in the baseline radiologic assessment must have measurable disease, defined

inclusion criteria ( progression -free and treatment -freeinterval of ≥[ADDRESS_655309] rituximab -containing treatm ent vs. unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherapy), 
presence of bulky disease (yes vs. no) and previous treatment w ith PI3K inhibitors 
(yes vs. no). If the patient fulfills both entry criteria, the criterion “unwill ing/unfit to 
receive chemotherapy ”should be selected.
After the 30thrandomized patient has completed the first cycle of treatment , theData 
Monitoring Committee will review the unblinded safety data accumulated up to that 
time andprovide recommendation on whether it is safe to continue inthe 
combination arm at the initial dose of copanlisib . The investigators, patients and the 
sponsor w ill remain blinded.
Methodology The p rimary efficacy variable isPFS, defined as the time (in days) from 
randomization to PDas assessed by [CONTACT_507948] (if no 
progression is documented ). 
Secondary efficacy variables are objective tumor response rate (ORR) , duration of 
response (DOR) , com plete response rate (CRR) , time to progression (TTP) , overall 
survival (OS), time to improvement andthe time to deterioration in disease -related 
symptoms -physical ( DRS -P)of at least 3 points as measured by [CONTACT_507949] -18 
questionnaire (FLymSI = NCCN -FACT Lymp homa Symptom Index) .
Other efficacy variables are FLymSI -18subscale, total score analyses and time to 
onset of physical symptoms of lymphoma based on DRS -P, and ECOG performance 
status.
The study is composed of the following periods: Screening, Treatment, Safety 
follow -up, Active f ollow -up (if applicable) and Survival follow -up. 
Patients randomized to copanlisib +rituximab arm will receive 60 mg copanlisib IV 
infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 -day treatment cycle ,and 375 mg/m2
rituximab during Cycle 1 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 
7 and 9. 
Patients randomized to placebo + rituximab arm will receive placebo IV infusion on 
Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 -day treatment cycle, and375 mg/m2rituximab during 
Cycle 1 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7 and 9. 
An end -of-treatment (EOT) visit will be performed no later than [ADDRESS_655310] 30 days (window  
of +5 days allowed) after the last administration of study treatment .
Patients who discontinue study treatment because of PD will enter Safety follow -up 
period and patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD will 
enter the Active follow-up period (which also serves as a Safety follow -up), except 
for patients who object to follow -updata collection. The patients in the Active 
follow -up will have follow -up tumor assessments by [CONTACT_507950] -up period, defined as when either PD is documented or a new  anti-
tumor treatment is administered, w hichever occurs first.
All patients will be followed off -study for overall survival at 3-month intervals 
during the Survival follow -up period (up to [ADDRESS_655311] patient started study 
treatment), except for patients who object to follow -up data collection.
Study participants may be offered the option to transition into a roll -over study
(ROS) .
Safety evaluations will be done at Screening , on the first day of study treatment 
administration (Cycle 1 Day 1), at each clinic visit during treatment, and at the safety 
follow -up visit.
The first radiological tumor assessments with IV (andoral, if indicated ,per Imaging

Manual) contrast -enhanced computed tomog raphy / magnetic resonance imaging 
(CT/MRI) scans of neck , chest , abdomen and pelvis will be performed at Screening
(including WM patients) .Corticosteroids must be stopped or reduced to the allow ed 
dose ( ≤15 mg of prednisone or equivalent ) at least 7days before performing the 
screening CT/MRI (if a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy ,corticosteroids 
should be de -escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening) . The 
method chosen at baseline must be the same throughout the study. MRI shall be 
performed instead of CT whenlocal regulations do not permit the use of CT as 
requested per protocol schedule
.
During the treatment period as w ell as during the Active follow -up period, tumor 
assessment swith the same modality will be performed every 8 w eeks (7 days) 
during Year 1, every 12 w eeks (7 days) during Year 2, and every 24 w eeks 
(7days) during Year 3and onwards , starting from Cycle [ADDRESS_655312]/MRI scans 
are not required at the EOT visit if the patient discontinues because of PD which has 
been radiologically confirmed w ithin the 4 weeks preceding the 
EOT .
As long as the patient has not experienced PD , investigator’s assessment is sufficient 
for case management. In the event of progression, radiological real -time confirmation 
by [CONTACT_507951] a final decision to stop 
the treatment is made. Radiological real -time confirmation will only be conducted 
until the database cut -off for the primary analysis . The final evaluation of treatment 
response (best response: ORR and CRR )will be done by [CONTACT_507952]
-confirmation in retrospective setting .
WM patients who do not have radiologically measurable lesion at Screening will not 
have further radiological a ssessments as per protocol. Their tumor response will be 
measured only by [CONTACT_13754]/clinical tests. However, in cases when WM patients will 
develop disease progression confirmed radiologically by [CONTACT_507953](s) without simultaneous increase in IgM, the imaging scans should be 
submitted for central review and PD confirmation. WM patients who have 
radiologically measurable lesion at Screening will continue having radiological 
assessments and, in addition, will have laboratory t ests per formed on the same days .
Bone marrow  biopsy will be mandatory at Screening andwill be sent to central 
pathology review after local bone marrow  assessment .Biopsies taken up to [ADDRESS_655313] 
complete response (CR) by [CONTACT_507954] , and also at the investigator discretion if clinical eva luation leads 
to suspi[INVESTIGATOR_507912].
Type of control Inactive control: placebo
Number of patient s Assuming 30% screening failure rate, 643patients ( including FL and other iNHL) 
need to be 
enrolled to have 450 randomized patient s.Patient swill not be replaced. 
Prim ary variable The primary variable is PFS, defined as the time (in days) from randomization to PD
as assessed by [CONTACT_507948] (if no progression is 
documented ).
Plan for statistical 
analysisEfficacy analysis : The primary efficacy variable is PFS , as assessed by [CONTACT_507955] (FAS), which is defined as all pat ients who were 
randomized . Patient s alive without documented progression at the time of analysis 
will be censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation .Copanlisib in combination 
with rituximab vs. placebo in combination with rituximab will be compared in the 
FAS, using a one - sided log-rank test stratified by [CONTACT_507956] : FL vs. other iNHL histologies andprogression -free and treatment -
freeinterval of ≥12months after completion of the last rituximab -containing
treatment vs. unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherapy .

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Non-Hodgkin’s l ymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of l ymphoproliferative 
malignanc ies arising either from B l ymphocy tes (85 –90%) or from T/NK lymphocy tes. These 
malignancies ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y originate in the l ymph nodes, but can involve almost any  organ 
tissue (1).
It is estimated that worldwi de there were around 356,000 new cases of NHLs in 2008 (2). The 
incidence of NHLs is increasing in man y regions, but the frequency of specific histologic 
subty pes of lymphoma varies substantially  by [CONTACT_1617]. Over two -
thirds of patients 
are 60 years and older (1).
NHL s can be divided according to their clinical behavior in two main prognostic groups: 
indolent NHL  and aggressive NHL. Aggressive lymphomas are characterized by  [CONTACT_507959] a lethal presentation if not immediately  treated. 
However, with modern chemo -immunotherap y regimens and stem cell transplant 
consolidation a definitive cure can be reached in 50- 60% of patients. Indolent NHL s have a 
relativel y good prognosis with a median survival longer than [ADDRESS_655326] chemotherap y regimens and to radiotherap y,their natural 
history  is characterized by  a continuous pattern of relapses, which can be generall y treated 
with success, but the time to next relapse progressively  decreases each time, finally  evolving 
into a refractory  disease or in a transformation into an aggressive histo logic type. The risk of 
transformation has been estimated to be 2- 3% per y ear.
Indolent NHLs encompass the following low
-grade histologic subt ypes of B -cell NHL
included in the 2008 WHO classification of l ymphoid neoplasm: follicular ly mphoma (FL), 
small ly mphocy tic ly mphoma (SLL), ly mphoplasmacy tic ly mphoma (L PL), which is defined 
as Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) when associated with a monoclonal IgM 
component and bone marrow involvement, splenic marginal- zone ly mphoma (SMZL), nodal 
marginal -zone ly mphoma (NMZL) and marginal- zone ly mphoma of mucosa -associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT) ( 3).FL is the second most common subty pe of NHL  (22% of newl y 
diagnosed cases) (4),followed b y MALT l ymphoma (7% of all NHL), while other subty pes 
are rather rare, with SLL, L PL, SMZL and NMZL accounting for 3%, 2%, 2% and 1% of 
NHL patient s, respectively .
Optimal treatment of advanced stages of indolent NHL is controversial because of low cure 
rates with the current therapeutic options. The first -line standard therap y includes rituximab, 
usually  administered together with cy totoxic combinat ions (CHOP, CVP) or single agents 
(alky lators, e.g. bendamustine, or purine nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine or 2-
chlorodeox yadenosine ).
There is no a cknowledged standard treatment for patients with recurrent disease. As long as 
disease appears to be responsive to rituximab ( treatment -
freeintervals of > 6months after the 
previous rituximab -containing treatment), a rituximab- based chemoimmunotherap y using 
non-cross -resistant cy totoxic agents would be administered at the next relapse.
While the good t olerability  of rituximab makes repeated administration possible, alky lating 
agents and purine nucleoside analog scan progressively  reduce the bone marrow reserve (5)

and cause secondary  malignancies (6, 7). Doxorubicin is associated with dose -dependent 
cardiac toxicity . Cardiac abnormalities can occur in patients treated with doxorubicin for 
lymphoma in the absence of congestive heart failure , even in patients who received moderate 
anthracy cline doses (8, 9). More than h alf of all l ymphomas occur in patients older than 
65years(10). Acute and residual toxicities of chemotherapy  are particularly important in an 
elderly patient population because they  interfere with the ability  of the patient to tolerate 
treatment at optimum dose and schedule, and reduce the number of options for subsequent 
treatments. In addition, these elderly patients will frequentl y have various c omorbidities, 
which further limit their ability  to cope with toxicity .
As patients will invariably relapse, further active and well -tolerated agents are needed. 
Copanlisib has a molecular target and mechanism of action different from those of cy totoxic 
agents, a non- overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_420069] y profile, and single -agent activity  in patients with 
relapsed/refractory  iNHL. Therefore, copanlisib could represent an adequate partner for 
rituximab in a cy totoxic -free combination that could be offered to patients expected to derive 
a benefit from rituximab
-based treatment.
1.1.1 Copanlisib (BAY 80-6946)
The phosphatidy linositol 3 -kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamy cin (mTOR) 
pathway  is one of the prominent pathway s that promote cellular survival and constitutively  is 
activated in man y types of cancers ( 11, 12 ). Class I PI3Kisdownstream of most cancer -
associated t yrosine kinase growth factor receptors (such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
[EGFR ]/human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] [ HER ], insulin -like growth factor 1 receptor 
[IGF-1R], platelet -derived growth factor receptor [ PDGFR ] , vascular endothelial growth 
factor [ VEGF ]
, c-KIT or mesench ymal epi[INVESTIGATOR_43920] [ Met]). Once PI3K is 
activated, it activates Pleckstrin Homology  Domain (PH -domain) proteins including 3-
phosphoinositide -dependen t protein kinase -1 (PDK -1) and AKT as well as guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor b y generation of phosphoinositol -
3-phosphate (PIP3). The tumor suppressor 
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) antagonizes PI 3K b y dephosphorylating PI P3, and 
its activity  isfrequently  lost in cancer cells ( 13). In addition to mediating cancer associated 
signals, activation of the PI 3K/AKT pathway  is also one of the maj or mechanisms by  [CONTACT_507960], and become resistant to, the effects of cy totoxic chemotherap y, targeted 
agents such as trastuzumab ( 12),and radiation ( 12, 14). 
Four of these PI3K isoforms (PI 3Kα, PI 3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ) are categorized as class I 
enzy mes because they  can use phosphatidy linositol
-4,5- bisphosphate (P I-4,5-P2) as a 
substrate to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5- trisphosphate (PI P3). Elevated PI P3 in 
cellular membranes drives several hallmarks of the cancer phenot ype: cell proliferation, 
survival, metabolic reprogramming, and migration. PI 3Kα and β are ubiquitous; PI3Kγ and δ

been demonstrated b y the activi ty of idelalisib (PI3Kδ
-targeted compound) in patients with 
refractory  iNHL (15).
As expected from its pharmacological properties, copanlisib, a small molecule PI 3K inhibitor, 
showed excellent anti
-tumor activity  in pre -clinical models with up -regulated PI 3Kα pathway . 
However, copanlisib not only inhibits PI 3Kα with IC 50of 0.5 nM, but also PI 3Kδ with IC 50of 
0.7nM. Copanlisib also potently  regulates nuclear localization of the forkhead famil y 
members resulting in the induction of transcriptional programs that lead to rapid cell death by

copanlisib in Phase I, Phase IIand Phase III clinical trials as a single agent or in combination 
with other agents.
As of 10 FEB 2014, a total of 57 cancer patients were treated in the Phase I  monotherapy  
study  [ZIP_CODE], with 17 patients in the dose escalation cohorts and 34 patients in the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohorts (two cohorts including 9 patients with NHL and 
25patients with solid tumors), as well as 6 patients with Ty pe II diabetes mellitus in the 
diabetic expansion cohort at 0.4 mg/kg. In AUG 2013, the enrollment in study  [ZIP_CODE] was 
completed. Dose -limiting toxicity  was observed at 1.2 mg/kg with MTD est ablished at 
0.8mg/kg when administered intravenously  (IV) over 1 h, on Day s 1, 8 and 15 of every  
28daysas a single agent .The flat dose of 65mg correlates with 0.8 mg/kg (MTD level) dose 
and was selected in order to control copanlisib exposure in obese patients. 
In the NHL expansion cohort of Study  [ZIP_CODE], a total of 6 non -diabetic patients with FL and 
3patients with diffuse large B -cell l ymphoma (DLBCL) were treated, all initially  dosed at 
0.8mg/kg. As of 01 FEB 2014, according to investigator’s assessment, 7 patients (77.8%) with 
NHL experienced partial response (PR) as best overall response and 2 patients (22.2%) had 
progressive disease. Partial responders included 6 patients with FL and 1 patient with DLBC L. 
Aretrospective independent review performed in8 ofthe9NHL patients (excluding the
clinical assessment) concluded that a complete response (CR) was the best overall response in
the2FLlong-term responders (assessed as partial responders by  [CONTACT_473]).
The most common treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), regardless of seriousness, 
severit y, and causality, occurring in ≥20% of the 57 subjects were hy pergly cemia (64.9%), 
nausea (52.6%), fatigue (40.4%), diarrhea (33.3%), hy pokalem ia (31.6%), hemoglobin 
(decreased) and h ypertension (29.8% each), rash / desquamation and vomiting (28.1%, each), 
anorexia (26.3%), constipation (24.6%), cough and dehy dration (22.8%, each), and 
dyspnea (21.1%).

Pharmacokinetic (PK) results indicate nearl ydose proportional increase in maximum 
concentration (C max) and area under curve (AUC (0-25)) values in the 0.1 to 1.2 mg/kg dose 
range and lack of significant accumulation after once weekl y dosing. At the maximum 
tolerated dose of 0.8 mg/kg, the geometric mean half -life, (t 1/2) was approximately  36-42 h 
(preliminary  data), supporting a once weekl y dosage regimen. To date, one metabolite, the 
morpholinone derivate M -1, showing approximately  4 to 16% of the AUC (0-25) of copanlisib 
has been identified and is currentl y being investigated in clinical studies. Results of a 
preliminary  population PK anal ysis of copanlisib in studies [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE] (Phase I 
monotherap y study in Japanese subjects) and Phase II stud y [ZIP_CODE] (part A) showed no 
correlation between bod y weight and copanlisib clearance, indicating that body weight -based 
dosing does not reduce between -subject variability  in copanlisib PK .The use of a fixed dose 
regimen for all patients was therefore considered suitabl e. Using the available data on 
preliminary  safety  and efficacy  of copanlisib monotherapy , a fixed dose of 60 mg copanlisib 
has been defined as the recommended dose for use in all patients in future clinical studies. 
As of 28 FEB 2015
, a total of 81 patients with various indolent and aggressive ly mphomas 
were treated at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg in the ongoing study  [ZIP_CODE] (part A) . The 
objective of the study was to identify activity signals in various histologic NHL subtypes and 
to further explore the sa fety profile of copanlisib. In the group of patients with indolent NHL , 
the following histologies were represented: FL ( 16patients), CLL/SLL (14 patients), and 
MZL (3 patients). Median age was 68 years and 61 % of the patients had ≥4 previous lines of 
systemic treatment. A s ofthe cut -
off date the median duration of copanlisib treatment was 
6cyclesin the indolent group . The objective response rate ( ORR) was 40% in FL, 38% in 
CLL, 100% in SLL, and 67% in MZL .
The most frequent TEAEs, regardless of relationship to study  drug, occurring in >20% of the 
whole study  population were hy pergl ycemia ( 59.3%), h ypertension ( 56.8%),diarrhea 
(40.7%), fatigue ( 35.8%), nausea ( 32.1 %), neutropenia (28.4%) andanemia ( 27.2%). The two 
most common study  drug -related 
TEAEs were hy pergly cemia ( 56.8%) and hy pertension 
(
53.1%). A t the time of the cut -off, a total of 75patients (92.6%), 30with indolent, and 
45with aggressive l ymphomas ,had discontinued the study  treatment. Altogether 20 patients

1.2 Rationale for the study
Rituximab is approved for the treatment of CD20+ relapsed or refractory  iNHL , and is widel y 
used as a single drug or in combination regimens (16-20). Retreatment with rituximab alone 
or in combination has been shown to be feasible and active
(21, 22) also in a large 
comparative trial involving rituximab retreatment in relapsed patien ts with FL initially  
responsive to rituximab
-containing therap y (23).
To further improve outcomes in relapsed iNHL including augmenting the efficacy  of 
rituximab retreatment, additional therapeutic options that incorporate novel active drugs are 
needed.
Consideri ng the pre -clinical profile of copanlisib and the promising p
reliminary  efficacy  data 
from the Phase I stud y [ZIP_CODE] and the ongoing Phase II stud y [ZIP_CODE] , it is expected that in 
comparison to rituximab with placebo, copanlisib in combination with rituximab w ill lengthen 
progression- free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed iNHL who have received one or 
more lines of treatment, have been exposed to rituximab and who either had a treatment -free
interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655329] rituximab -containing treatment, or who
are unwilling to receive chemotherap y
/for whom chemotherapy  is contraindicated.
The prolonged rituximab treatment (4 weekl y infusions + 4 bimonthly ) has proved to be 
associated with a longer event -free survival and response duration compared to the standard 
4weekl y infusions schedule, without additional clinical toxicity  in both relapsed iNHL ( 24, 
25)and as front line therapy (26), and this is the reason wh y it was chosen as a reference drug 
in this study .
1.3 Benefit-risk assessment
The proposed indication is a serious and, in the long -term, life -threatening disease. Advanced 
iNHL  can be controlled with the current treatments for a relatively  long time, but remains an 
incurable disease of which the patient would ultimately  die. While at the early  stages of 
advanced iNHL effective treatments are ava ilable (e.g. rituximab + CHOP and rituximab + 
bendamustine), the efficacy  of subsequent lines of treatment tends to diminish, with 
progressively decreasing response rate and PFS. There are no guideline recommendations, or 
widely  accepted standards of care for patients beyond first relapse. The treatment given 
depends on patient’s condition, phy sician’s preference, and availability  of drugs not already  
used with other in previous lines of treatment. In patients with limited ability to cope with 
toxicity  the number of options is further reduced . There is therefore a need for drugs with new 
targets and mechanism sof action that are effective and have a safet y profile different from 
that of drugs used in earlier lines of treatment.
Copanlisib showed activity  inpatient swith relapsed or refractory iNHL (see Section 1.1.2).
Hypergl ycemia and h ypertension, the most frequently observed and expected toxicitie s with 
copanlisib, proved to be manageable , without CTC AEGrade [ADDRESS_655330] one cycle. A Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC )
will be instituted to 
ensure the safet y of patient sparticipating in the study .

22 MAY 2020 Page: 26of 144
Considering the existing evidence of the efficacy  of copanlisib treatment in patients with 
iNHL  and the manageable toxicities, the benefit/risk rati o of the copanlisib treatment is 
assessed as positive.
2. Study objectives
The primary  objective of this study  is:
To evaluate whether copanlisib in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo in 
combination with ritu ximab in prolonging progression- freesurvival (PFS) in patients 
with relapsed iNHL who have received one or more lines of treatment, including 
rituximab ,andwho either had a treatment -free interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655331] rituximab -containing treatment, or who are unwill ing to receive
chemotherap y/for whom chemotherap y is contraindicated on reason of age, 
comorbidities, and/or residual toxicity
The secondary  objectives of this study  areto evaluate :
The f ollowing characteristics of disease -related s ymptoms: “ time to deterioration” and 
“time to improvement”
Other radiological and clinical indicators of treatment efficacy
Safety and tolerability  of copanlisib
The other objectives of this study  areto evaluate :
Pharmacokinetics
Biomarkers
Quality  of life

4. Study design
Design overview
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, two-arm, Phase III study  to evaluate 
efficacy  and safet yof copanlisib in combination with rituximab, in comparison to placebo in 
combination with rituximab, in patient s with relapsed iNHL. 
Approximately  450 ( including FL and other iNHL ) patients who meet the eligibility  criteria 
will be randomly  assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the double -blinded treat ment arms: 
copanlisib plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab. Patients will be stratified by  a 
combination of NHL histology (FL vs. other iNHL) ,inclusion criteria ( progression
-free and 
treatment -free interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655334] rituximab -containing
treatment vs. unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherapy ),presence of bulky  disease (yesvs . no)
and previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors (yes vs . no). For details see Section 6.3.
After the 30thpatient has completed the first cy cle of treatment theData Monitoring 
Committee will review the unblinded safet y data of all patients treated up to that timepoint

The start of the stud y period is defined by [CONTACT_507963] (ICF). 
Patient s who meet the eligibility  criteria as defined in Section 5.1will be randomized to one 
of the two arms and will start treatment (see Section 6.3).
The start of the treatment period is defined b y the first administration of study treatment. 
Treatment with copanlisib or placebo will be continue
duntil the occurrence of PD (per central 
independent blinded radiology  review) as defined in the Lugano Classification (for patients 
with WM according to the Owen Criteria ), unacceptable toxicity , or until another criterion is 
met for withdrawal from the study treatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) For the definitions of 
Lugano Classification and Owen Criteria please refer to theDefinitions of terms. Rituximab 
treatment will be continue duntil the same criteria as defined for copanlisib are met, for a 
maximum of 8 infusions (until Cycle 9 )
.
An end-of -treatment ( EOT )visit will be performed no later than [ADDRESS_655335] 30days (window of +5 day s allowed) after t he last 
administration of study  treatment. 
Patients who discontinue study  treatment because of PD will enter the Safety- follow up period 
and p atient swho discontinue study  drug for reasons other than PD will enter the Active 
follow -up period (which also serves as a Safet y follow -up), except for patients who object to 
follow -up data collection . The patient sin the Active follow -up will have tumor assessment s
by [CONTACT_507964] f ollow -up period, defined as when either PDis 
documented or a new anti-tumor treatment is administered, whichever occurs first. During the 
Active f ollow -up period, serious adverse events ( SAEs )and AEs assessed as related to study  
procedures b y the investigator will be reported. AE pages of the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF) and the SAE Form should be completed in the usual manner and forwarded to the 
sponsor’s GPV department.

All patient s will be followed off stud y for overall survival at 3-monthly  intervals during the 
Survival follow -up pe riod ( up to [ADDRESS_655336] patient started study treatment ), except 
for patient s who object to follow -up data collection. During this period, patient s are not 
considered to be “on -study ”. 
Safety  evaluations will be done at Screening, on the first day of study  treatment administration 
(Cycle 1 Day  1), at each clinic visit during the treatment, and at the Safety  follow -up visit. NCI -
CTCAE v ersion 4.03 will be used to grade toxicities/AEs. Doses may  be delay ed or reduced in 
casesof clinically  significant hematological or other toxicities that are possibly , probably  or 
definitely  related to study  treatment. The dose modification levels and the delay  of 
copanlisib /placebo administration will follow pre- defined rules (see Section 6.4.1 ).
The first radiological tumor assessments with IV (andoral, if indicated, per Imaging Manual)
contrast -enhanced CT/MRI  scans of neck, chest , abdomen and pelvis will be performed at 
Screening (including WM patients) . Corticosteroids must be stopped or reduced to the 
allowed dose ( ≤ 15 mgof prednisone or equivalent ) at least 7daysbefore performing the 
screening CT/MRI (if a patient is on chr onic corticosteroid therap y, corticosteroids should be 
de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening) . The method chosen at 
baseline must be the same throughout the study .MRI shall be performed instead of CT when 
local regulations do not p ermit the use of CT as requested per protocol schedule (for further 
details see Section 7.3.2 ).
During the treatment period as well as during the Active follow up period tumor assessments 
with the same modality  will be performed every  8 weeks (7 day s) during Year 1 ,every  
12weeks (7 day s) during Year 2, and every  24 weeks ( 7 day s) during Year [ADDRESS_655337]/MRI scans are not required at the EOT visit if the 
patient discontinue sdue to PD,which has been radiologicall y confirmed within the 4 weeks
preceding EOT .
The response assessment will be done according to the Lugano Classification , and, for 
patients with WM, according to the Owen Criteria . As long as the patient has not experienced 
PD, investigator’s assessment is sufficient for case manageme nt. In the event of progression, 
radiological real-time confirmation by  [CONTACT_507965] a final decision to stop the treatment is made. Radiological real-time confirmation will 
only be conducted until the database cut -off for the primary  anal ysis.The final evaluation of 
treatment response (best response : objective t umor response rate and complete response rate ) 
will be done by  [CONTACT_507966]- confirmation in
retrospec tivesetting .
WM patients who do not have radiologically measurable lesion at Screening will not have 
further radiological assessments as per protocol. Their tumor response will be measured only  
by [CONTACT_13754] /clinical tests. However, in cases when WM pati ents will develop disease 
progression confirmed radiologicall y by [CONTACT_507967](s) without 
simultaneous increase in IgM, the imaging scans should be submitted for central review and 
PD confirmation . WM patients who have radiologically  measurable lesion at Screening will 
continue having radiological assessments and, in addition, will have laboratory  tests 
performed on the same day s.
Bone marrow biops y will be mandatory  at Screening and will be sent to central pathology  
review after local bone marrow assessment. B iopsies taken up to [ADDRESS_655338] dose are 
acceptable. If the baseline biopsy  is positive for l ymphoma infiltration at Screening , it will be

discretion if clinical evaluation leads to suspi[INVESTIGATOR_507917]. 
Tumor tissue collection will be mand atory  at Screening for central pathology  review . 
In addition, additional pre -treatment tumor tissue samples will be collected when available to 
investigate or identify biomarker s that may  be predictive of copanlisib effects/efficacy  in 
NHL and to contribu te to better understanding the disease (see Section 7.6.1 ).
Blood samples for PK analy sis will be collected from all patients to characterize the PK of 
copanlisib and rituximab (see Section 7.4). Plasma samples for biomarker analy ses will be 
collected from every  patient , according to the schedule specified in Section 7.1.Blood 
samples for exploratory  genetic biomarker anal ysis will be collected on Cycle 1 Day  1 from 
patient s who provide “genetic research” consent ( voluntary ).
PK and biomarker samplings are not applicable to sites who cannot obtain approval b y 
competent Health Authority .
Primary variable
The primary  efficacy  variable isPFS, defined as the time (in day s) from randomization t o PD
as assessed b y central review or death from an y cause (if no progression is documented ).The 
main anal ysis of the study  will be performed when at least 190 PFS events (PD by  [CONTACT_507969]) are observed in the study .
Justification of thedesign
Single -agent rituximab represents a valid therapy  option for patients who had a long response 
following the last rituximab -based treatment, as well as for non -refractory  patients with 
responses of shorter duration in whom chemotherapy  is contraindicated for medical reasons
(see Section 1.2).
The 2:1 randomization in favor of the treatment arm increase s the probability  for a study  
participant to receive the study  drug.
The use of placebo in this study is justified for the followin g reasons:
Use of placebo can minimize investigator bias in assessing treatment effects bey ond 
tumor shrinkage. This is particularl y important when assessing duration endpoints and 
patient -reported outcomes.
Although treatment with copanlisib is associated with two specific AEs, 
hypergly cemia and hy pertension, the risk of inadvertent unblinding is low. In the 
majority  of the cases, the intensity  of both sy mptoms is low; both sy mptoms are 
relativel y frequentl y found in the age group to which the majority of iNHL patients 
belong; and most investigators will treat 1- 2 patients only  due to the rarity  of patients 
with the requested profile.
End of study
For each participating European Union ( EU) country , the end of the study  will be reached 
when the last visit of the last patient for all centers in the respective country has occurred. The

5.2 Withdrawal of patient s from study
5.2.1 Withdrawal
A patient who discontinues study  participation prematurely  for any  reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the patient has al ready been randomized. A patient who, for any reason (e.g., 
failure to satisfy  the selection criteria), terminates the study  before randomization is regarded 
a “screening failure”.
Re-screening of patients who have failed screening may  only be allowed once after discussion 
with the sponsor’s designated medical representative and after approval b y the sponsor. 
Sponsor approval of re -screening for the patient who has failed screening must be 
documented .The screening failure will be registered in IVRS/I WRS to close the patient 
identification number (PID), and rescreening will start again b y signing a new ICFand being 
assigned a new PID.
All initial screening laboratory  tests will need to be taken within 7 day s prior to planned Day 1 
of Cy cle 1 (C1D1). If one or more screening laboratory  tests do not support eligibility , 
laboratory  re-test is permitted only  once without the need of re- consent . Only  the laboratory  
tests with results out of range need to be repeated. Re-testing must be performed within [ADDRESS_655358] of practice 
(e.g. includ ing fresh tumor tissue, CT/MRI  scans, bone marrow sample, MUGA/
echocardiogram and hepatitis testing) will not need to be repeated during the [ADDRESS_655359] laboratory  results are still out of eligibility  range, this will be considere d a 
full screening failure, and only  one re -screening will be allowed following the rules as 
outlined above .
For patients with newl y diagnosed diabetes mellitus that cannot meet protocol requirements, a 
single re -screening (which includes all screening pr ocedures) should be performed when the 
patient’s diabetes is controlled and can meet protocol requirements for HbA1c.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of study treatment
Patient s must be withdrawn from the stud y treatment for the following reasons:
At their own request or at t he request of their legally  acceptable representative. At an y 
time during the stud y and without giving reasons, a patient may decline to participate 
further. The patient will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result. Patient s who withdraw 
consent from treatment will still participate in the Safet y, Active or Survival follow -up 
unless they  object to follow -up data collection (see Section 11.2).
If,in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study would be harmful to the 
patient's well -being .
Disease progression as defined in the Lugano Classification and, for patients with 
WM, according to the Owen Criteria.

[IP_ADDRESS] Withdraw al from follow -up period
Following completion of the EOT visit,patient s who discontinue study  treatment due to PD 
will enter the Safet y follow -up period, and patients who discontinue study  treatment for 
reasons other than PD will enter Active follow -up period (which also serves as a Safet y 
follow -up).
During the Survival follow-up period a ll patient s will be contact[CONTACT_457]  3 months to 
determine survival status (up to [ADDRESS_655362] patient started stud y treatment) .
Reasons for not performing the Safet y follow -up or discontinuation of the Survival follow -up 
include the following:
Death
Objection to follow-up data collection
Lost to follow -up
5.2.2 Replacement
Patient s will not be replaced.
5.3 Patient identification
At Screening upon signing the ICF, each patient will be assigned a unique patient 
identification number (PID) b y the IVRS/I WRS for unambiguous identification. The PI D will 
be constructed as follows:
a.Digits 1 to 2: Unique country  code 
b.Digits 3 to 5: Center code (unique within each country )
c.Digits 6 to9:Unique patient code (unique within each center)
Within the unique patient code ,the first digit (digit 6) represents the study  a patient is 
participating in.
Patients participating in study  [ZIP_CODE] (this study ) have a “7” as the 6thdigit. As an example,
PI[INVESTIGATOR_507922] “aabbb 7ccc”. 
Once allocated, the patient ’s PID number will identify  the patient throughout the study  and 
will be entered into the Site Enrollment Log and in the eCRF.

requirements. For full details on rituximab and instructions for dilution, please refer to the 
current prescribing information /Summary  of Product Characteristics (SmPC) .
6.3 Treatment assignment
At the end of the screening period, eligible p atient swill be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 
the two double -blinded treatment arms : copanlisib + rituximab or placebo + rituximab , 
respectivel y. 
Treatment will be assigned based on information obtained from IVRS /IWRS.
IVRS/I WRS will stratify  patients according to four factors based on baseline characteristics :
NHL histology
oFL histology
oOther iNHL histology (SLL, MZL, LPL/WM)
Entry  criterion:
oprogression -free and treatment -free interval of ≥12months after completion 
ofthe last rituximab -containing treatment
oconsidered unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherapy  for age or comorbidities
(see inclusion criterion 13for further details)
If the patient fulfills both entry  criteria, please select the criterion “considered 
unwilling/unfit to receive chemotherap yfor age or comorbidities” .
Presence of b ulky disease (as defined by [CONTACT_46917] a nodal or extranodal mass

scheduled dosing, any of the following criteria is met:
CTCAE Grade 4neutrophil count decreased (ANC < 500/mm3)
(G-CSF is mandatory  if ANC <1000/mm3and should be administered as per label)
CTCAE Grade ≥3 platelets count decreased (platelets < 50,000/mm3)

Doses scheduled for Days 8 and 15 may  be delay ed by  [CONTACT_8622] 2 day s. A delay  of more than 
2days will be considered a missed dose. Missed doses w ill not be replaced. The minimum 
interval needed between two infusions of copanlisib /placebo is 5 day s.
6.4.1 Dose modification
Dose modification sdue to toxicities described below apply  to copanlisib and placebo for
copanlisib (“dummy  dose modification”) .There will be no dose reduction ofrituximab. If 
severe (life-threatening) reaction to rituximab infusion occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_507925] s should be withdrawn from the stud y treatment. Patients must have received at least 
4complete rituximab infusions until Cy cle 3 Day  1 (included) to continue the treatment with 
single agent copanlisib/placebo.
It is recognized that attribution of causality  of any AE to the test drug specifically  may  be 
difficult. However, certain toxicities were seen only in relation to copanlisib in Phase I  and II 
trials: e.g., transient incre ases in glucose and blood pressure. Based on this knowledge the 
investigator may  decide on t he necessary  dose modifications .
Dose modifications and treatment interruptions must be done according to the guidelines in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and6.4.1.2 . The investigator may  judge a more conservative dose 
modification appropriate. If therefore these guidelines are not followed, the rationale for other 
measures is to be document ed in detail in patient’s medical record. Deviations from the 
guidelines must be discussed with the sponsor.
The dose modification levels of copanlisib and placebo areoutlined in Table 6–3:
Table 6–3 Dose levels of copanlisib and placebo
Dose level 1 (starting dose): 60 mg of copanlisib or placebo
Dose level -1: 45 mg of copanlisib or placebo
Dose level -2: 30 mg of copanlisib or placebo
After having fully  recovered from toxicity and in the absence of any  criteria for further dose 
reduction or stud y drug discontinuation , re-escalation from dose level - 2 to dose level -1, or 
from dose level -1 to dose level 1 will be allowed at the investigator’s discretion , with the 
exception of non- infectious pneumonitis ( NIP).

laboratory  anal ysis despi[INVESTIGATOR_124385] 2 infusions of 
copanlisib/placebo will r equire dose reduction b y one dose level.
Further dose reduction is allowed as long as discontinuation criteria w erenot met.
Dose re -escalation is allowed when a patient has achieved controlled glucose levels 
per investigator’s judgment.
Persistent occurre nce of post -infusion blood glucose > 500mg/dL based on laboratory  
analysis which occurred at the lowest copanlisib/placebo dose level despi[INVESTIGATOR_507920] y (after at least one cy cle of treatment) requires permanent 
discontinuation of th e study  treatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
b)Arterial hypertension

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_507927] y in standard doses 
accord ing to local medical practice. Goals of therapy  are to keep fasting trigl ycerides
< 300 mg/dL and low -density  lipoproteins (LDL) < 190mg/dL (lower LDL depending on 
cardiovascular risk) in patient s with a life expectancy >1 year. The goals for fasting 
triglycerides can be raised to < 500 mg/dL for patient s with life expectancy  <1 y ear(31). 
Although there is a paucity  of data on the effects of hy perlipi[INVESTIGATOR_345302], 
these goals have been chosen to decrease risk of established complications of 
hypertrigly ceridemia (pancr eatitis) and h ypercholesterolemia (cardiovascular events). For 
evaluation of lipid -panels including trigly cerides , patients must be fasting prior to sampling 
according to local standards. For patient s who cannot adhere to fasting requirements ,the 
evaluati on of lipid -panels including trigly cerides is considered as not feasible.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of blood pressure increases associated with copanlisib
It is important that patient s with pre- existing arterial hy pertension adhere to their regular 
medication schedule, and take their usual doses on the day s of study  drug infusion. The 
management of acute arterial h ypertension following copanlisib /placebo will need to be 
individualized for each patient , but the experience in P hase I  has suggested the benefit of 
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (i.e., amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Nitrates, verapamil 
and diltiazem can also be considered .In general, it is advisable for sites to be prepared ,so that 
antihy pertensive medication is readily  available in case of need. In the event of the occurrence 
of arterial hy pertension ≥ 150/90 mmHg during infusion of copanlisib/ placebo at an y cycle
antihy pertensive treatment is suggested as indicated above. In the event of the occurrence of 
CTCAE Grade 3 arterial hy pertension (≥160/100 mmHg ) during infusion of

[IP_ADDRESS] Guidance for monitoring and prophylaxis of opportunistic 
infection (OI) 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Monitoring guidelines for OI
In addition to the weekl y clinical review and laboratory tests outlined in the schedule of 
assessment, the following should be performed in all patients prior to IV in fusion of 
copanlisib /placebo :
Evaluation of an y new onset or worsening of pulmonary s ymptoms (i.e. cough, 
dyspnea or fever) that includes a lung examination at each visit prior to infusion.
Laboratory  tests: CD4 (for patients with signs of infection, blood cultures if febrile
neutropenia occurs or when ANC of CTCAE grade 4, PCR for CMV (every  cycle on 
Cycle X Day  [ADDRESS_655389] 6 months of study treatment and every  3 cycles thereafter).
CMV can be anal yzed retrospectivel y in case the results are not immediately available. 
oNote: If PCR test is positive for CMV, treatment should be delay ed until 
recovery . Treatment of CMV should be initiated based on local standard of care 
(SOC). Retreatm ent with copanlisib will be allowed without dose reduction once 
PCR test for CMV is negative.
Enhanced monitoring when prior medical history  or laboratory  parameters could be associated 
with one of the following risk factors:
Intensive chemotherap y (≥2 lines of my elosupressive cy totoxic therapy )
History  of CMV, herpes
History  of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], history  of immunodeficiency  (excluding 
lymphoma) in the last 12 months
Lymphocy tes count < 500/mm3while on treatment in clinical study .
For pati ents with identified risk factors and those who developed OI on study  treatment , 
additional assessments can (per institutional recommendation/guideline) include:
CD4 and CD8 count and ratio, C- reactive protein ( CRP ), blood cultures
Any additional laboratory  and diagnostic methods according to local SOC reported as 
unscheduled laboratory  and diagnostic methods of assessment 
Radiological imaging (i.e. chest X- rayor CT scans)
oNote: Treatment of developed OI should be based on local SO C.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Prophylaxis of OI
Mandatory  proph ylactic therap y is not recommended in all patients:
Review of copanlisib data does not support risk benefit ratio favoring prophy laxis in 
all patients
Mandatory  proph ylaxis may  cause a higher risk of side effects associated with 
supportive treatment where no risk factors are present
Currently  implemented schedule of assessments and additional enhancements provide 
frequent monitoring and flexibility  for prophy laxis based on local SOC.
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 54of 144
Although not mandated in all pa tients, OI proph ylaxis may  be initiated at the discretion of the 
treating investigator’s judgment of the benefit/risk ratio in any  patient, irrespective of whether 
a high -risk feature is present, per local SOC. If so, treatment , dosage and route of 
adminis tration must be reported on the concomitant medication page of the eCRF.
Prophy lactic treatment of OI should be initiated based on SOC in patients when high risk 
factors are identified (see protocol Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).
6.5 Blinding
Patients will be randomized to receive copanlisib in combination with rituximab or placebo in 
combination with rituximab , in a double- blinded fashion, so that neither the investigator, nor 
the sponsor, nor the patient will know which agent is being administered. The randomization 
number will be assigned through the IVRS/I WRS based on information entered by [CONTACT_507976] . 
The DMC will review the safet y data of the first [ADDRESS_655390] cycle in an 
unblinded manner, to assess the safet y of the copanlisib + rituximab combination. However, 
the investigators, patients and the spons or will remain blinded.
The appearance of the packaging for copanlisib and placebo will be identical in order to 
preserve blinding. Both will be packaged in a drug pack labeled with a unique drug pack 
number which will be pre- printed. The stud y drug pack n umber will be assigned to the patient 
through the IVRS/I WRS.
Because copanlisib solution may  have a yellowish color while the placebo solution is 
colorless , measures will be taken to preserve the blind . This includes a n unblinded, study -
independent pharmacist (or qualified person) who will handle the preparation of the study  
drug, and independent monitors, separate from the blinded monitoring team, to conduct the 
monitoring of the pharmacy  and drug supplies . Additional details will be described in the 
Pharmacy  Manual .
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a suspected, unexpected, serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R ) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), the patient’s treatment code will usually  be 
unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, ethic committees and investigators (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) if the S[LOCATION_003]R was related to the blinded treatment.
Emergency unblinding by [CONTACT_507977]’s treatment assignment may  be carried out by  [CONTACT_507978] y. Investigators should note that the occurrence of an SAE should not 
routinely  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_507931]. If unblinding is necessary 
for the treatment of a patient who has experienced an SAE, the treatment assi gnment of a 
patient will be unblinded via instructions provided through the IVRS/I WRS. This sy stem 
allows the investigator, or other responsible person, to identify  the study  drug in case of an 
emergency , without jeopardizing the double -blind integrit y of the remainder of the study .
The code can be broken by  [CONTACT_093], or other responsible person, when knowledge of 
the patient’s treatment is required for the clinical management of the patient. I f it becomes 
necessary  to know the individual’s treatmen t during the study  and, thus, break the code for 
that patient, the date and reason are to be entered in the relevant eCRF page. The investigator 
is required to promptly document and explain to the sponsor’s designee any  premature 
unblinding (e .g., unblindi ng due to an SAE) of the study  drug.

rules. This applies to patients on study  treatment and in follow -up.
6.9 Prior and con comitant therapy
For prohibited prior therapy please refer to Section 5.1.2 .
6.9.1 Prohibited concomitant therapy
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (see App endix 14.1):copanlisib is primarily  
metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 
(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithrom ycin, ritonavir, indi navir, nelfinavir ), and 
strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin , phen ytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
St.John’s Wort ) isnot permitted from Day - 14 of Cy cle1 until the Safety  follow -up 
visit.
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice (CYP3A4 inhibitor) consumption is not permitted 
during the stud ytreatment until the Safety  follow -up visit .
Anti- arrhythmic therapy  othe r than beta blockers or digoxin
Systemic corticosteroi d therap y at a dail y dose higher than [ADDRESS_655392]/MRI . If a patient is on chronic 
corticosteroid therap y, corticosteroids should be de- escalated to the maximum allowed 
dose before the screening . Patient s may  be using topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].

antiemetics prior to copanlisib /placebo administration will not be allowed. 
Myeloid growth factors removed by [CONTACT_507980] 1
Ongoing immunosuppressive therap y 
Concomitant radiotherapy (it is assumed that radiation would be indicated only  in case 
of progression, when the patient would come off study  medication any way)
Use of biotin (vitamin B7) produces high levels of the vitamin, which can interfere 
with the result of the immunoassay  tests including biomarker anal ysis, HBcAb, 
HBeAg , HBsAg, HCV Ab, HIV- Ag/Ab combo, HIV combo . Therefore ,refrain from
the use of biotin for at least [ADDRESS_655394] collection.
6.9.2 Permitted concomitant therapy
Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39674] 
Treatment with non -conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (for example herbs or acupuncture), and 
vitamin/min eral supplements is acceptable provided that they  do not interfere with the 
study  endpoints, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator. St John’s Wort is not permitted.
Bisphosphonates
Patient s who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or hep arin will 
be allowed to participate provided that their medication dose and INR/PTT is stable. 
Close monitoring is recommended according to standard of care. If either of these 
values is above the therapeutic range, the doses should be modified, and the 
assessments should be repeated weekl y until it is stable.
Antiemetics: Prophy lactic anti -emetics may  be administered according to standard 
practice. The routine use of standard antiemetics, including5 -HT3 blockers, such as 
granisetron, ondansetron, or an equ ivalent agent, is allowed as needed . The use of 
corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib /placebo administration will be not 
allowed.
Palliative and supportive care for the other disease- related s ymptoms (with the 
exception of radiotherapy) and fo r toxicity  associated with treatment will be offered to 
all patient s in this trial. 
Patient s may  receive palliative and supportive care for an y underl ying illness (with the 
exception of radiotherapy) .
Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (maximum 100 mg/day ) and low -dose hep arin are permitted .
Patient s taking narrow therapeutic index medications should be monitored proactivel y, 
ifthese medications cannot be avoided. These medications may  include quinidine and 
digoxin. 
Substrates of the renal drug transporter MATE2K (e.g. me tformin, cimetidine, 
procainamide and N methy lnicotinamide) need to be used with caution. Metformin 
should be temporaril y discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving

During the treatm ent phase as well as during the active follow up period , radiological (IV [ and
oral, if indicated ,per Imaging Manual] contrast -enhanced CT/MRI) tumor assessment will be 
performed every  8 weeks ( 7 day s) during Year 1, every  12 weeks ( 7 day s) during Year 2, 
and every  24 weeks ( 7 day s) during Year [ADDRESS_655429]/MRI  scans are not required at 
the EOT visit if the patient discontinue sdue to PD which has been radiologically  confirmed 
within the 4 weeks preceding EOT .
At each tumor assessment during the course of the study  (from baseline to EOT and during 
active follow up if applicable) radiological measurement of spleen vertical length (from 
cranial to caudal) must be performed and reported .
As long as the patient has not experienced PD, investigator’s assessment is sufficient for case 
management. In the event of progression, radiological real-time confirmation by  [CONTACT_507995] a final decision to stop treatment is made. Radiological 
real-time confirmation will only  be conducted until the database cut -off for the primary  
analysis.In case of uncertain radiological disease progression the patient may  stay on 
treatment at the investigator’s discretion until progression is definitely  confirmed on the 
subsequent tumor assessment .The final evaluation of treatment response (best response: ORR 
and CRR) will be done by [CONTACT_507966]-
confirmation in retrospective setting . 
The response assessment will be done according to the Lugano Classification. For patients 
with WM, additional criteria appl y (see Section 7.3.3 ) . Detailed instructions on tumor 
assessment are provided in 
Appendix 14.4.
The same technique (e.g., slice thickness, field of view) should be used f or all scans during 
the study  treatment period. Preferably  all scans should be interpreted by  [CONTACT_31593]/radiologist during the stud y whenever possible. CT/MRI  scans must be 
performed with contrast agents and must meet the standard of care for i maging of lesions in 
the respective organ s ystem(s). If at baseline IV (andoral, if indicated, per I maging Manual ) 
contrast -enhanced CT is medically  contraindicated, sites may  acquire MRI (contrast -
enhanced) of the neck, abdomen and pelvis , and an unenhan
ced CT of the chest above lung 
api[INVESTIGATOR_6125] s to the bottom of the adrenals. Only ifa patient develops contra -indication to both CT 
and MRI  contrast medium during the treatment phase of the study , the case examinations 
should be continued without contrast .In cer tain countries MRI  should be used based on local

pharmacokinetic approach will be used for the analy sisand reported in a standalone report.
7.5 Safety
7.5.1 Adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Definition of adverse event (AE)
In a clinical stud y, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e.any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, including abnormal laboratory  findings, s ymptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study .Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporally  or causally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study  by [CONTACT_507999] (however, the con dition for which the surgery  is 
required may
 be an AE).
New lesions or disease progression per se (by [CONTACT_5071] ) should not be regarded as AEs. Instead, the 
associated signs and s ymptoms should be recorded as AEs .
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term “condition” may  
include abnormal e.g.physical examination findings, s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory , ECG.
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical 
history  (e.g. seasonal allergy  without acute complaints).
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are presen t after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g.allergic pollinosis) .
Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events.
Definition of serious a dverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose, meets any  of the 
following criteria (a –f):
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 81of [ADDRESS_655432] one of the following exceptions is met:
-The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours
- The admission is pre- planned 
(i.e.elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the study )
-The admission is not associated with an AE 
(e.g.social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes preceden ce.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e.Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect
f.Is another medically  important serious event as judg ed by [CONTACT_093]
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_655433] be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity
The intensity /severity  of an AE will be graded using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03. For 
events not liste d in the NCI  CTCAE version 4.03, the following scale will be used:
-Grade 1: Mild
-Grade 2: Moderate
-Grade 3: Severe
-Grade 4: Life -threatening
-Grade 5: Fatal
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the 
CRF.
The causality  assessment should be done separately  for each study  treatment as detailed 
on the 
CRF.
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 82of 144
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”
An assessment of “no” would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g.mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g. the patient is struck by  [CONTACT_508000]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_382301].
Important f actors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment 
include:
- The temporal sequence from drug administrat ion:The event should occur after the drug is 
given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical 
context of the event.
-Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re- introduction (re -
challenge):
- Patient ’s response after de -challenge or patients response after re -challenge should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
-Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be evaluate d in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the patient may have.
-Concomitant medication or treatment: 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether an y of them may  be suspected to cause the event in 
question.
-The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of 
the study  treatment, co upled with the individual patient ’s pharmacod ynamics should be 
considered.
Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”

Any action on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed below .
-Drug withdrawn
-Drug interrupted
-Dose reduced
-Dose not changed
-Not applicable
-Unknown
The study  treatment action should be recorded separatel y for each study treatment as detailed 
on the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events
-None
-Remedial drug therap y
-Other
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Outcome
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows: 
-Recovered/resolved
-
Recovering/resolving
-Recovered/resolved with sequelae
-Not recovered/not resolved
-Fatal
-Unknown
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments and documentation of adverse events
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by  a member of the investigator team or 
spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_508001]. AEs will be documented in an 
event -based manner , using NCI -CTCAE v.4.[ADDRESS_655434] dose of study  drug. T he safet y follow -up visit shall occur 30 day s(window of +5 day s 
allowed) after the last dose of study  medication .AEs still present at the end of the observation
phase should be followed until resolution or stabilization unless, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
the condition is unlikely  to resolve due to the patient ’s underl ying disease.
AEs to be documented include all AEs that were ongoing at the end of treatment as well as 
new AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], could be related to study  treatment 
(information may  be obtained via phone call). Documentation must be supported by  [CONTACT_508002] ’s file.
During the Active 
follow -up period, AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study  procedures by  
[CONTACT_507992]. AE pages of the eCRF and the SAE Form should be 
completed in the usual manner and forwarded to the applicable sponsor’s GPV department.

The investigator is responsible for the grading of each category  mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
For all SAEs the sponsor is to carry  out a separate assessment for exp ectedness, seriousness 
and causal relationship to the test drug.
If any patient dies in the safet y follow
-up period 30 days(window of +5 day s allowed) after 
last dose of study  medication , the investigator will inform the sponsor and record the cause of 
death in detail within [ADDRESS_655435], action taken and outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of serious adverse events
The definition of SAEs is given in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be thoroughl y instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant contact 
[CONTACT_8972], is summarized in the investigator site file. This information will be updated as needed.
All SAEs occurring during the observat ion period defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must 
immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507933] t he manual. An SAE form must also be completed within [ADDRESS_655436] be followed 
up until resolution or stabilization by  [CONTACT_508003].
SAEs occurring after the protocol -defined observation period will be processed by  [CONTACT_508004].
If disease progression leads to signs and s ymptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the associated signs and s ymptoms , not the underly ing cause, should be 
reported as SAE, (i.e., “progressive disease” should not be recorded as SAE). Inthis case, 
disease progression should be mentioned on the SAE form as 
an “alternative 
explanation”.
In the event of a fatal or life -threatening reaction, the investigator must seek relevant follow-
up information and must complete a follow -up report to be faxed to the sponsor as soon as 
possible but not later than 8 calendar day s after the initial report is sent.
For all SAEs, the investigator is required to document in full the course of the SAE and any  
therap y given, including any  relevant findings / records in the report.
An isolated laboratory  abnormality  that meets the criteria for a CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_655437] 
International Conference on Harmonization (I CH) cri teria for an SAE (see SAE definition in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required b y the protocol, only 
additional primary  tumors regarded as related to study  treatment should be reported.
Progressive disease should not be reported.

[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse events
For this study , the applicable reference document is the most current version of the IB for 
copanlisib and prescribing information / SmPC for rituximab.
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical development are 
shown in the current IB. If relevant new safet y information is identified, the information will 
be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed to all participating sites.
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_246223].
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events of special safety interest
Copanlisib is an investigational drug and current knowledge of the AEs associated with this 
compound is limited. As with any new chemical entity , there is alway s potential for 
unexpected AEs, including h ypersensitivity  reactions.
Based on data from Phase I studies with copanlisib , as soon as there is reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_507934], the investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor as outlined in

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs
Pulse, blood pressure and temperature will be assessed according to the schedule summarized 
in the flow chart of Section 7.1. If clinicall y indicated, it is at the investigator’s discretion to 
perform these measurements more frequentl y.
Blood pressure measurement on infusion days
Blood pressure will be measured prior to each copanlisib/placebo dose (no more than 
4measurements) until there are two consecutive results <150/[ADDRESS_655441] 15 min 
interval between the measurements, to be able to start copanlisib/place boinfusion (pre -dose) .
The investigator can consider a medical intervention to maintain blood pressure values 
appropriate for infusion. The investigator must delay  the infusion until blood pressure values 
are <150/90 mmHg
. The patient should restfor 5 -10 min before blood pressure is recorded .
On copanlisib/placebo infusion day s:blood pressure will be measured at pre-dose, 
30min after the start of infusion , right after the end of infusion ,and1 hand2 hafter 
the end of copanlisib/placebo infusion. 
In addition , on the day s of rituximab adminis

7.6 Other procedures and variables
7.6.1 Biomarker investigations
Overview
There will be several parts to biomarker testing in this study :
1)tumor -genetic testing of fresh (preferred) or archival tumor tissue , and possibly  of 
circulating tumor DNA isolated from plasma 
2) non- genetic biomarker testing
3)genetic biomarker research
Genetic biomarker research of the whole blood require sseparate ‘genetic’ research consent 
(optional testing for research) .All other anal ysesare covered b y the main ICF.

Biomarker investigations
The planned biomarker analyses utilize tumor tissue, plasma and blood ,and involve the 
analysis of protein and nucleic acids (i.e., RNA and/or DNA). Details o nthe collection, 
processing, storage and shipment of biomarker 
samples will be provided in separate 
documents (e.g. sample handling sheets or laboratory manual) . 
The biomarker results may  be reported separately.
Collection and use of biomarker specimens
Biomarker samplings are not applicable to sites who cannot obtain approval by  [CONTACT_508006] .
Optional Tumor Tissue
One or more of the following pre- treatme nt tumor tissue samples should be collected during 
Screening when available with the purpose of investigating or identify ing biomarkers that 
may be predictive of copanlisib effects/efficacy  in NHL and to contribute to better 
understanding the disease.
Subm ission of archival tumor tissue from a biopsy performed within 180 days before 
signing of the informed consent
Submission of fresh tissue from a biops y performed during Screening (between Day -
28 and Day  -8 prior to the start of study  treatment) is highl y encouraged when the 
above is not available.
In the absence of either of the above, submission of an older archival tumor tissue 
sample (collected prior to 180 day s before study  enrollment) is mandatory when 
available .
A tumor biopsy  is also encouraged at the time of progression (optional) to allow investigation 
of copanlisib resistance. In addition, if a tumor biopsy /excision occurs during the course of the 
study  based on medical need, a sample should be submitted (though no biopsy  is required 
during treat ment)
Archival FFPE tissue may  be supplied as a block (preferred) or as precut slides. Details on the 
preparation of slides and number of slides to be prepared as well as detailed guidance on fresh 
biopsy  sample preparation and storage will be described in separate documents (e.g. Sample 
Handling Sheets or Laboratory  Manual)
All tumor tissues may  be used as a source of RNA or protein for the stud y of gene and protein 
expression. The tumor tissue may  in addition be used as a source of tumor DNA for the 
evaluation of tumor -
associated alterations in genes of interest (e.g., PIK3CA and genes 
associated with NHL) .
Plasma for non -genetic biomarker analysis:Blood samples will be obtained and used for 
plasma preparation at the time points as indicated in the stud y flow chart (see 
Table 7–1 ). 
Plasma may  be used to quantify  the circulating levels of various proteins. 
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 91of 144
Plasma for tumor genetic s: Blood samples will be obtained and used for plasma preparation 
at the time points as indicated in the stud y flow chart (see Table 7–1) . Plasma may  be used as 
a source of circulating tumor DNA for the evaluation of mutations in tumor -related genes of 
interest.
Whole b lood (only applicable for 
patient s who provided ‘genetic’ research consent): At
Screening , a whol e blood sample will be obtained . The blood sample will be used as a source 
of DNA and gene products for the evaluation factors that are associated with the drug or the 
pathomechanisms of the disease. Results will be reported under separate cover, if the 
evaluations are performed.
In addition to the proteins and genes listed above, other biomarkers deemed relevant to gain 
further knowledge about the pathomechanism of the disease or about the drug (i.e. mode of 
action or safety  of the drug) may be measured, based on newl y emerging data from other 
ongoing trials of these investigational drugs and/or literature data. However, t he study  
sponsors reserve the right not to conduct all or part of the aforementioned biomarker anal ysis. 
Data from this biomarker anal ysis may  be correlated with various other data obtained in this 
study  (e.g., clinical efficacy , pharmacokinetics, toxicity ).
If a scheduled biomarker sample collection is missed, this should not be regarded as a 
protocol deviation .
7.6.[ADDRESS_655443] of treatment on the phy sical sy mptom sof lymphoma is an important issue for 
patient s;therefore ,the collection of this information is a routine component in many  
protocols.
The main purpose of the sy mptom assessment in this study  is to describe any differences 
between the treatment groups in the time to deterioration and time to improvement in disease -
related ph ysical sy mptoms (DRS -P) 
of at least [ADDRESS_655444]
Lym phoma S ymptom Index -18 ( FLymSI-18), version 2(see Appendix 14.5) (NCCN -FACT: 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network -Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap y).
The FLymSI-18 is a ninstrument that was developed to assess s ymptoms of lymphoma, 
symptoms of tr eatment of ly mphoma, and health related QoL of patient
s with ly mphoma .The 
instrument was developed in accordance with recent Food and Drug administration ( FDA )
guidance for the development of instruments for patient- reported outcomes ( PRO s).
The instrument contains 18 items, each of which utilize sa Likert scale with 5 possible 
responses ranging from 0 “Not at all” to 4 “Very  much” . Nine items reflect DRS -P, and the 
responses to the items are summed to calculate a DRS -P subscale score . Four items represent 
disease -related emotional sy mptoms (DRS -E),and the responses to those items may  be used 
to calculate a DRS -Esubscale score. Three items represent treatment side effects, and the 
responses to these items may  be summed to calculate a treatment side -effect (TSE) subscale 
score. Finally , two items represent function and well- being (FWB), and response sto those 
items may  be summed to calculate a FWB subscale score. The questionnaire allows for 
calculation of total score and four subscales: DRS- P, DRS -E, TSE and FWB (33, 34).
The FLymSI -
18 will be administered according to the schedule specified in the study  flow 
chart (see Table 7–1).
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 92of 144
At the visits where it is scheduled to be completed, the FLymS I-18 should be completed at the 
start of the visit before the patient sees the ph ysician and before any  study -related procedur e is 
conducted ,so that an y interaction between the patient and phy sicians or other health care 
providers does not influence the response to the FLymSI-18 questionnaire.
A PRO information sheet will be provided and completed by  [CONTACT_508007] -
18 questionnaire is to be administered, regardless of whether or not the 
FLymSI-18 questionnaire is completed b y the patient. This is to document information such 
as questionnaire completion, date of completion, and reasons for no n-completed 
questionnaires.
7.6.3 Electronic patient
-reported outcomes evaluation
Electronic PRO ( ePRO )device wil l be implemented in this study . It will be used to complete 
the Fl ymSI-18 questionnaire . A Site Manual will be provided to sites and each patient will be 
trained 
how the e PRO device work sand how to use it correctly . If, for an y reason, a device is 
not available at the site, or technical problems prevent it from working properly , the FLy mSI-
18 questionnaire will not be completed at that visit .
7.7 Appr opriateness of procedures / measurements
The efficacy  assessments used in this study  include those considered standard of care to 
evaluate objective tumor response rate in patient s with iNHL . Although the recentl y published 
Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response
Assessment of Hodgkin and 
Non-Hodgkin Ly mphoma: The Lugano Classification (27) strongl y support the use of PET -
CTfor staging and response assessment of routinely  FDG -avid histologies, especiall y in 
clinical trials, it was decided to use in this study  only  a CT -based response. CT /MRI -based 
response remains in fact preferred for histologies with low or variable FDG av idity and in 
regions of the world where PET
-CT is unavailable. Moreover, in trials exploring new agents
in multiply  relapsed disease where data are lacking regarding PET-CT and where assessment 
of disease control is more important than likelihood of cure, CT/MRI -based response may  
also be more relevant. 
The safet y assessments are appropriate and standard to monitor safet y and assess toxicity .
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
8.1 General considerations
Statistical analy ses will be conducted by  [CONTACT_43754]’s study  
statistician , except for the anal ysis of biomarker data, which will be performed by  [CONTACT_508008]’s genomics and biomarker statistical expert . Statistical anal yseswill 
be performed using Statistical Analy sis System (SAS); the version used will be specified in 
the statistical analy sis plan ( SAP). 
Further details on the statistical analy ses including handling of missing data will be provided 
in the SAP that will be approved before database release .
8.2 Analysis sets
The statistical anal ysis sets are defined as follows:
Clinical Study  Protocol Global Amendment 11
No.  BAY 80 -6946 / [ZIP_CODE]
22 MAY 2020 Page: 93of 144
Full anal ysis set (FAS): all patient s randomized.
Safety  anal ysis set (SAF): 
all FAS patient s with at least one intake of copanlisib/placebo or 
rituximab . 
All patient s with valid PK data will be included in the evaluation of PK concentrations and 
parameters. 
The efficacy  variables will be anal yzed in the FAS.
The SAF will be used for the anal yses of the safety variables. The FAS will be used for the 
display of all other variables.
8.3 Variables
8.3.1 Efficacy variables
Disease progression (PD) in the context of statistical efficacy  evaluation is considered to be 
radiological progression, as assessed b y central review . For WM patients without radiologicall y 
measure able disease, clinical progression will be used . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy variable 
Progression- free survival (PFS), defined as the time (in days) from randomization to 
PDor death from any  cause (if no progression is documented ).The actual date of 
tumor assessm ents will be used for this calculation. PFS for patient s without PD or 
death at the time of anal ysis will be censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation. 
PFS for patient s who have neither tumor assessments nor death after baseline will be 
censored at Day  1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy variables
Objective tumor response rate (ORR) assessed in all patient s up to the time of analysis
of PFS . ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best response rating 
over the whole duration of the study  (i.e. until time of anal ysis of PFS ) of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Lugano Classification andfor 
patients with WM a response rating of CR, very good partial response (VGPR), PR, or 
minor response (MR) according to the Owen Cr iteria .Detailed instructions on tumor 
assessment are provided in Appendix 14.4.
Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time (in days) from first observed tumor 
response (CR , VGPR, 
PR, or MR ) until PD or death from an y cause , whichever is 
earlier . DOR will only  be defined for patients with at least one CR , VGPR, PR, or MR . 
Patient s without PD or death at the time of anal ysis will be censored a t the date of 
their 
last tumor evaluation.
Complete response rate (CRR) , assessed in all patient s up to the time of analy sis of PFS.
Time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from randomization to PDor death 
related to PD, whichever is earlier . The a ctual dates of tumor assessments will be used 
for this calculation. TTP for patient s without PD at the time of anal ysis or death not 
related to progression will be censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation. TTP 
for patient s who have neither tumor assessments n or death related to PD after baseline 
will be censored at Day  1. Death related to PD is considered to be an y death except 
for:

oDeath due to an AE unrelated to progression
oDeath with a specification of “other” as reason (which excludes PD)
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time (in day s) from randomization until death 
from an y cause . OS of patients alive at the time of anal ysis will be censored at the last 
date they were known to be alive. 
Time to deterioration in DRS -P of at least 3 points, as measured b ythe FLy mSI-18 
questionnaire . Patient s will be considered as “censored” at the date of their last tumor 
evaluation, if the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507935]. Patients droppi[INVESTIGATOR_507936]
-related reason o r experiencing a PD event or death due to an y 
reason will be considered as having had their decline in DRS-P at the date of their last 
tumor evaluation. 
Time to improvement in DRS -P of at least 3 points, as measured b y the FLymS I-18 
questionnaire, will be evaluated for patients with a baseline DRS -P score of 30 points 
or less (i.e. patients who still have room for improvement in sy mptoms). Patients will 
be considered as "censored" at the date of their last tumor evaluation, if the reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507935]. Patients droppi[INVESTIGATOR_507937] -
related reason or experiencing a PD event or deaths due to any  reason will be 
considered censored at the largest observation time (of events and censoring in all 
patients evaluated fo r improvement), plus 1 day .
Further sensitivity  anal ysesfor the DRS -P anal yseswill be described in the SAP (e.g. might 
involve different handling of the last response status for that patient or considering PD and 
death as censored ). Considering at least [ADDRESS_655445] to DRS-P is the current assessment. The important change for 
DRS -P is however under continuing research b y the developer of the questionnaire. 
Therefore, the value of 3 point s might be updated in the SAP, considering forthcoming 
research findings.

containing treatment vs. unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherap y).See S ection 8.6.
Evaluations from central
blinded review will be used for the primary  efficacy  analy ses of 
primary  and secondary  
endpoints containing radiological tumor assessments.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy analysis
All randomized patients (FAS) will be included in the primary  analy sis.
In order to evaluate whether copanlisib in combination with rituximab is superior to placebo 
in combination with ritu ximab in prolonging PFS in patients with relapsed iNHL who have 
received on e or more lines of treatment, including rituximab, the following null hy pothesis 
will be tested in the FAS :
H0, PFS: SCopanlisib+Rituximab (t) = S Placebo+Rituximab (t) for all time points t ≥ 0
The alternative hy pothesis will be:
H1,PFS: SCopanlisib+Rituxim ab(t) > S Placebo+Rituximab (t) for at least one time point t ≥ 0, and
SCopanlisib+Rituximab (t) ≥SPlacebo+Rituximab (t
) for all time points t ≥ 0,
where SCopanlisib+Rituximab denotes the survival function of the copanlisib + rituximab group and 
SPlacebo +Rituximab denotes the survival function of the placebo + rituximab group in the total 
study  population .
The following decision rule to test the null hy pothesis will be applied:
According to the size of this study  it is justified to assume under H 0, PFS the one -sided log -rank 
test ( 36) is a sufficient lyclose approximation to the normal distribution. I f the z -value from 
the one -sided log -rank test (for the difference SCopanlisib+Rituximab -SPlacebo+Rituximab , stratified by  
[CONTACT_508012]
: FL vs. other iNHL  histologies, and progression- free and 
treatment -free interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655449] rituximab -containing
treatment vs. unwilling/ unfit to receive chemotherapy ) is larger than the critical quantile from 
the normal distribution ( z0.975= 1.96), the null hy pothesis will be rejected in favor of the 
alternative h ypothesis .
The PFS will be tested inthehierarch y test (see S ection [IP_ADDRESS]).
Additional analyses of the primary efficacy variable
Kaplan -Meier estimates of median times to PFS ( including 95% confidence interval) and 
Kaplan -
Meier curves will be presented for each treatment group.
The hazard ratio s(including 95% confidence interval) will be derived from Cox proportional 
hazards model s that are stratified by  [CONTACT_508013] d for the primary  efficacy  
analysis.
The censoring mechanism of subjects without PFS event at the time of analy sis is assumed to 
be non- informative for the primary  efficacy  analy sis. Sensitivity  anal yses will be performed, 
assessing the impact of a potential informative censoring of such subjects. These will include

the use of different rules for considering subjects without PFS events as having an event or 
being censored and will be further outlined in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary efficacy parameters
All secondary  efficacy  variables will be anal yzedin the FAS at the time of the anal ysis of the 
primary  variable .
The ORR will be anal yzed using the Cochran
-Mantel -Haenszel test ( 37), stratified for the 
same stratification factors as used for PFS. The null hy pothesis is defined as:
H0, ORR : ORR Copanlisib+Rituximab ≤ ORR Placebo+Rituximab
The alternative hy pothesis is:
H1, ORR : ORR Copanlisib+Rituximab > ORR Placebo+Rituximab
The following decision rule to test the null hy pothesis will be applied:
If the p -value for the two -sided Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test is smaller than the 0.05
significance level and the estimated difference ORR Copanlisib +Rituximab -ORR Placebo +Rituximab
(comparing copanlisib + rituximab vs. placebo + rituximab ) is greater than 0.0, the null 
hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative hy pothesis.

The two treatment arms copanlisib in combination with rituximab and placebo in combination 
with rituximab will be compared. Superior ity of the copanlisib + rituximab arm over the 
placebo + rituximab arm will be tested for the FAS.
Sample size justification for primary efficacy test on PFS in the total study population
A recent study  (AUGMENT, 51) reported a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI 0.34 -0.62) for the
PFS,andamedian PFS of 14.1 months in therituximab + placebo arm in the indication of 
second line iNHL. Based on the results fr om this study , Bay er has decided to update the 
sample size justification.
With at least 190 PFS events (progression based on central review or death if death occurs 
before progression), a randomization ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_655457] ratio of 0.61 (i.e., median PFS of 23 months for copanlisib 
+rituximab arm and 14 months for placebo + rituximab arm ) can be detected with a power of 
at least 89%.
Based on the planned [ADDRESS_655458] 190 
events is 59 months, (with maximum accrual rate being approximately  10 patients per month). 
The percentage of dropouts (ie. lost to survival follow -up or withdrawal of consent before 
their PFS event) rate is assumed to be 135 (30%) dropout patients over the duration of the

22 MAY 2020 Page: 101of [ADDRESS_655459] 190 centrally  evaluated PFS events are 
observed in the stud y.
As an additional criterion, a sufficient number of PFS events has to be observed in each of the 
two strata defined b y the inclusion criterion ( progress ion-free and treatment -free interval of 
≥[ADDRESS_655460] rituximab -containing treatment vs. unwilling/ unfit to 
receive chemotherap y)before the study  is unblinded for primary  evaluation .This especiall y 
ensures the contribution of events also from patients who have previousl y shown a good 
response to rituximab.
The required minimum number of PFS events in these strata will depend on the relative 
proportion of patients recruited into the respective cohorts and can be seen from Table 8–2
The observed proportions and event numbers will be determined during blind data review 
after the end of recruitment.

As an example: I n case 32% of patients would be recruited in the “progression -free and 
treatment -free interval of ≥[ADDRESS_655461] rituximab -containing 
treatment ”stratum, then at least 46PFS events are required in this stratum. I n addition, at 
least 86 PFS events from the complement stratum “ considered unwilling/ unfit to receive 
chemotherap y by [CONTACT_508015] -G”are required. To fulfill the overall criterion of at least 190PFS 
events, approxima tely58additional events from any  of the two strata are required.
In case of an extreme proportion of censored/discontinued patients in a stratum that severel y 
impacts the relation of "Proportion of recruited patients" ≈ "Proportion of PFS events", the 
study team might decide to deviate from the above rule during blind data review.

Data recorded from “only screened patient s (screening failures)”
Data of 'onl y screened patient s' will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason for 
the premature discontinuation is ide ntifiable. At minimum, data to be recorded on the CRF are 
demographic information ( patient number, yearof birth/age, sex, race and ethnicity ), the 
reason for premature discontinuation and date of last visit. These data will be transferred to 
the respectiv e database.
For screening failures with an SAE, the following additional data should be collected on the 
CRF , in addition to demographic information, primary  reason for discontinuation and date of 
last visit: 
All information about the SAE
All information related to the SAE such as: 
Concomitant medication
Medical history
Other information needed for SAE complementary  page
9.2 Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s/CRO’s procedures, monitors 
will contact [CONTACT_3899] e prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also inc lude 
identification and documentation of source data items.
Thesponsor /designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete
Safety  and rights of patient s are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
(including stud y treatment being used in accordance with the protocol)
Any other study  agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements are met.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (whe re applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.

TheSAS datasets to be used for statistical anal ysis to be included in the clinical study  report 
will remain unmodified after the data is declared clean and read y for anal ysis. 
After its initial r elease for biometrical anal ysis, the clinical database is planned to be re -
opened for the inclusion of the following additional data: pharmacokinetic data, biomarker 
data.
9.4 Audit and inspection
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a me mber of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality  assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study  site and of the study  documents originating there. The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by [CONTACT_8993](s)/I RB(s) are 
possible. The investigator should notify  the sponsor immediately  of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to 
discuss findings and an y issues. Audits and inspections may  occur at an y time during or after

If the stud y conduct ( e.g.recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data qualit y; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time 
frame.
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consulta tion between involved parties. Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions ( e.g.IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority (ies); study  center ; 
head of stud y center ) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returned to the sponsor. The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In case of a partial study closure, ongoing patient s, including those in post study  
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.
Details for individual patient 's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_655466], evaluation, and 
documentation of this study , are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by

11.2 Patient information and consent
All relevant information on the study  will be summarized in an integrated patient information 
sheet ICFprovided by  [CONTACT_508016] y center. A sample patient information and ICF
is provided as a docum ent separate to this protocol. Separate patient information sheets/ I CFs 
will be provided to th e patient s on a voluntary  basis for the following:
Pharm acogenetic ICF
ICF for collection of data on pregnancy  and birth
ICF on study  updates
Based on th epatient information sheet, the investigator or designee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the stud y to each patient , prior to his/her entry  into the study (i.e.before an y 
examinations and procedures associated with the selection for the stud y are performed or an y 
study -specific data is recorded on study -specific forms).
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB/IEC has been obtain ed.
Each patient will be informed about the following aspects of premature withdrawal:
Each patient has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time without any  
disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.
The patient’s data th at have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be 
retained and statistically  anal yzed in accordance with the SAP.
Patient- specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may be 
generated after withdrawal (e.g. image reading, ana lysis of biological specimen such 
as blood, urine or tissues); these data would also be retained and statistically anal yzed 
in accordance with the SAP. The patient has the right to object to the generation and 
processing of this post -withdrawal data. The p atient’s oral objection may  be 
documented in the patient’s source data.
Each patient will have ample time and opportunity  to ask questions .
Only  if the patient voluntarily  agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done so, may  
he/she enter the stud y.Additionally , the investigator and other information provider (if any ) 
will personally  sign and date the form. The patient will receive a cop y of the signed and dated 
form.
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locall y 
required, in the patient ’s note/file of the medical institution.
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are 
performed, the study  record or patient ´s clinical record must clearl y show that i nformed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
The informed consent form and an y other written information provided to patient s will be 
revised whenever important new information becomes available that may  be relevant to the 
patient ’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the 
content of the patient information and / or the written informed consent form. The investigator 
will inform the patient of changes in a timel y manner and will ask the patient to confir m 
his/her participation in the study  by [CONTACT_23667]. Any revised

13. Protocol amendments
13.1 Amendment 1
Amendment 1 is dated 23 JAN 2015 .
13.1.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1 –inclusion criteria changed
Inclusion criteri awere supplemented with the following condition: patients must either have 
had a treatment -free interval of 12months or longer after completion of the last rituximab -
containing treatment, or be considered unfit to receive chemotherap y for reasons of age, 
concomitant morbidities and/or residual toxicity  from previous treatments. Contraindication s 
to chemotherapy were added , as well as an appendix on Cumulative I llness Rating Scale for 
Geriatrics (CI RS-G).Based on this criterion the stratification factors were also updated (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Rationale: patients considered unfit for chemotherapy  forreason sof 
comorbidities, residual toxicity, or advanced age may  respond less well to study  treatment.
To adjust to the new patient profile the following changes were made toinclusion criteria :
Laboratory  entry  criteria were changed : amy lase and serum creati nine were removed 
from the inclusion criteria, and entry  values for hemoglobin and ANC were decreased 
(hemoglobin from 9 g/dL to 8 g/dL , ANC from 1,500 mm3to 1,000 mm3). 
Criterion for l eft ventricular ejection fraction was specified to be no lessthan 45% . 
Consequently , the following changes were made in other protocol sections:
Dose modification in the event of NIP was adjusted , as we ll as text related to NI P in 
prohibited medications section ,and a separate chapter was added , for patients who are 
unfit to receive chemotherap y.
One more MUGA/echocardiogram test was added for patients with LVEF below lower 
level of normal for the institution, with flexibility  regarding the time point (any time 
between [ADDRESS_655479] dose and before the next administration).
In addition, the inclusion criteria were changed as follows:
The possibility  for the second evaluation of GFR was add ed, if it is not on target at the 
first screening , and either MDRD or 24 -hour sampling can be used to ful fill the 
inclusion criterion. This was added because GFR can be more accurately  calculated by  
[CONTACT_508020] b y using a formula
and to give a chan ce for reevaluation of the patient.
Eligibility  threshold of platelet and neutrophil count s was reduced for patients with 
confirmed lymphomatous bone marrow infiltration ( ≥ 50,000 /mm3and≥ 750/mm3for 
platelet a nd neutrophil counts, respectivel y). Therefore, laboratory  test criteria for 
Days 1, 8 and 15 of subsequent cycles were updated. This change was made because 
in patients whose cy topenias are due to ly mphomatous bone marrow infiltration as 
histologically  proven during screening, the benefit from treatment is expected to 
exceed the risk of drug -induced marrow depletion.

Appendix 14.7 (appendix added).
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 2 –exclusion criteria updated
To adjust to the new patient profile the following changes were made to the exclusion criteria:
Criteri on “renal failure requiring hemo -or perito neal dial ysis” was removed. 
More exceptions were added to the following exclusion criteria: previous or 
concurrent cancer (as ymptomatic prostate cancer without known metastatic disease) 
and unresolved toxicity  higher than CTCAE Grade 1 (peripheral neuropathy  andbone 
marrow parameters). 
Cut-off time period for excluded my eloid growth factors and blood or platelet 
transfusion was changed from 14 day s to 7 day s before the start of treatment 
After consultation with regulatory  authorities prior exposure to PI 3K inhibitors was removed 
as an exclusion criterion, and documented progression to PI 3K inhibitors was added instead
(patients pre -exposed, but not resistant, to PI 3K inhibitors, can be accrued to the study ). 
Consequently , prior treatment with PI 3K inhibitor was added as a new stratification factor 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Definition of r ituximab refractoriness was replaced by  a condition excluding patients whose 
last rituximab infusion was within 12 months of the start of the next treatment , and, for 
patient s unfit to receive chemotherap y –within [ADDRESS_655481] treatment were exempt of the required 
minimum time for the following criteria:
Treatment with investigational drugs other than PI3K inhibitors less than 28 day s 
before start of treatment
Radiotherap y or immuno -/chemotherap y less than 4 weeks before start of treatment
Radioimmunotherapy  or autologous transplant less than [ADDRESS_655482] of previous treatment can safely  
be excluded and because evidence of progression bring s urgency  to the treatment of this 
elderl y population.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 3 – target population for efficacy analysis changed
Following advice received by  [CONTACT_10200], the study  target population for efficacy  
analysis was c hanged from iNHL  patients to FL patients, with a possibility  to also recruit 
other iNHL patients. However, the stud y will be powered for FL patients .Conse quently , the 
number of PFS events and the number of patients were re- calculated , with patients divide d 
into FL  subgroup and other iNHL group . 
Likewise, the confirmatory  statistical test strategy  was revised to include separate tests in the 
FL subgroup and total population , respectivel y. In accordance with the target population of FL 
patients, the study -wise alpha is initially  split with 80% to the primary  analy sis in the FL 
subgroup. Furthermore, any  potential alpha propagation is initially  done within the FL 
subgroup or from the total population to the FL  subgroup as well. 
Sections affected b y this mod ification: Synopsis, 4Study  design, 8.4.[ADDRESS_655483] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 4 –randomization ratio and stratification changed
Randomization rat io was changed from 1:1 to 2:1. Stratification factors were changed to 
comprise iNHL histology (FL histology  vs. other iNHL histology ), newl y added inclusion 
criteri on (treatment -free interval after rituximab treatment vs. contraindication for 
chemotherap y), presence of bulky  disease (yes vs. no)and prior exposure to PI 3K inhibitors .
FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_507938] s.Rationale: randomization was changed to 2:1 in order to 
increase the patients’ odds of being randomized to the study  treatment arm, and to increase the 
level of experience with the study  drug. Stratification was changed because histology , 
patient’s profile as defined by  [CONTACT_508021]. The FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_507939] d at the suggestion 
of FDA because the usefulness of the FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_507940] .

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 5 –time to improvement in DRS -P added as s econdary 
efficacy variable
Because of a change in the patient population, t ime to improvement in disease -related 
symptoms -physical (DRS -P)was added as an additional secondary  efficacy  variable , to be 
measured for patients with a baseline DRS -P score of 30 points or less (i.e. patients who still 
have room for improvement in sy mptoms) . Consequently , study  objectives and fixed sequence 
test hierarch y were updated.

clinical trials, a section describing a pre -defined region definition , as well as briefl y describing 
subgroup anal ysesfor regions and other subgroups (e.g. based on stratification factors and 
other baseline characteris tics),was added to the protocol.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 7 – patient enrollment and DMC review of safety data
changed
After the 30thrandomized patient has completed the first cy cle treatment, enrollment will not 
be stopped. Data Monitoring Committee will review the safet y data of all patients treated up 
to that time point. 
Rationale: If no safety -relevant events occur in the first [ADDRESS_655484].
Sections affected b y this modification: Synopsis , 4Study  design .
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 8 –language on informed consent , re-screening and re -
testing revised
Wording related to the re-consent of the re -screened patients was corrected. Text about 
screening was updated to clarify  which test results can be accepted even if performed as part 
of routine practice provided that they fall into the protocol -specified time window and the 
patient has given informed consent to use them .

Manual.
Sections affected b y this modification :6.4Dosage and administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 10 – guidelines on m anagement of hyperglycemia
updated
Recommendations regarding management of hypergly cemia were changed in order to 
simplify  and harmonize guidance between planned clinical studies. Modifications are based 
on review of the latest data on P hase I studies and Phase II stud y [ZIP_CODE] (part A) . These 
modifications include changes in patie nt’s fasting requirements and subsequent modifications 
on glucose measurement time points on Cy cle [ADDRESS_655485] for day s of infusion from Cy cle 1 Day  8 onwards. 
Therefore onl ythose non-diabetic patients will be req uired to monitor their blood glucose at 
home who develop h ypergl ycemia > 250 mg/dL or require insulin administration. 
In addition, d iary was added to record home glucose measurement and insul in administration, 
if applicable.

ECG measure ment ti ming was changed to be performed within 28 day s of Cy cle 1 Day 1 
(instead of 14 day s) andon Cycle [ADDRESS_655487] cy cle was 
removed (tests on Day [ADDRESS_655488] cy cle and EOT remained unchanged). This was done 
to monitor patients’ E CG parameters .
The required position for the patient before blood pressure and ECG measurement was 
changed from “l ying down” to “rest” as being more common in clinical practice.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 13 – t umor assessments clarified
Starting time point for tumor assessment was added for clarit y(Cycle 1 Day  1), as well as 
tumor assessments guidance for WM patients. Oral contrast agent for radiological tumor 
assessment was added to IV contrast for consistency  with the I maging Manual. Footnote 
explaining the reason for performing MRI instead of CT in German y was deleted as being too 
specific to be described in a protocol .

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 16 – collection of biomarker and PK samples revised
Requirements about collection of tumor tissue were specified further to make sure the best 
material is received if a vailable but at the same time not to restrict patients from participating 
in the study  if sufficient sample is not available for biomarkers (tumor tissue for central 
pathology  review is still mandatory ). Timing of plasma collection for tumor genetic sand n on-
genetic biomarker anal ysis was changed to onl y be performed at C ycles 1, 2 (non -genetic 
sample only ), and end- of-treatment visit, i.e. sam pling on Day  1 of subsequent cy cles was 
removed . 
PK sampling on Day  15 of Cycle 2 and higher was removed . The numb er of required samples 
on Day  8 of C ycle 1 was decreased to three samples.
This was done to reduce the burden on the patients and the sites, and to reduce the overall 
number of samples to be shipped and processed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1 7 – tumor response crite riaudpated
Criteria for assessing tumor response were updated following the most recent publication by  
[CONTACT_27856] ( 27); assessment of response and disease progression will be done according to the 
Lugano Classification .According to the new criteria organomegal y is only defined b y CT 
imaging therefore splenomegaly /hepatomegal y will no longer be checked at physical 
examinations. Ann Arbor terminology will no longer use suffixes A and B for sy mptoms 
related to NHL (they  will only  be included for Hodgkin Ly mphomas), therefore B s ymptoms 
will not be collected. The change in CT -based criteria resulted in an updated table for tumor 
response definitions ( Appendix 14.4). However, even though PET CT was for mally  
incorporated into standard staging for FDG- avid ly mphomas, the current study  will only  use 
CT scan for response assessment (see Section 7.7).Criteria for assessing tumor response in 
WM patients were also u pdated.

Amendment 6 is dated 18 FEB 2016.
13.2.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1 – update of clinical experience with copanlisib
Introductory  information on patients treated with copanlisib was up dated based on most recent 
data. In addition, the results from copanlisib studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] part A were updated.
Section affected b y this modification: 1.1.2 Clinical experience
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 2 –previous exposure to alkylating agents removed
Mandatory  exposure to alky lating agents was remove d since onl y the assessment of r ituximab 
effectiveness is evaluated by  [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion criteria of this protocol and the 
mandatory  use of alky lating agents could potentially  exclude part of the population who is 
considered unfit for chemotherap y.

objective s, 5.1.1 Inclusion criteria, [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  efficacy  anal ysis
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 3 –clarification of inclusion criterion related to WM 
patients
Clarification was added that WM patients who do not have radiologicall y measurable lesio n 
should have a positive immunofixation test result in addition to elevated IgM levels 
(≥ [ADDRESS_655489]) at Screening to indicate the presence of IgM paraprotein. The modification was 
done because IgM level alone does not show that the protein is clonal. Immunof ixation 
establishes that the elevated IgM is clonal and therefore a real paraprotein.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 4 – m odification of coagulation language 
Inclusion criterion was updated to clarify  that INR should be ≤ 1.5 at Screening and PT can be 
used instead of INR if ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_655490] . The modification was done because previous language 
(INR ≤ 1.5 x UL N) allowed patients with INR of 1.8 to be eligible. INR and PT may  be used 
interchangeabl y, since the INR is a standardized prothrombin time (which was initially 
designed to account for differences in thromboplastin).
Furthermore,“PT ratio or PT Quick method” was removed from the coagulation panel to 
avoid redundant testing report on the coagulation method.
Sections affected b y this modification: 5.1.1 Inclusion criteria and [IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory
[IP_ADDRESS] Modif ication 5 – m odification of contraception and pregnancy testing
requirements
Text was added in the inclusion criteria to clarify  the required time period of contraceptive 
use, to provide a detailed description of effective contraception and to provide definition of a 
woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and a post -menopausal state. In ad dition, it was 
clarified that the use of condoms by  [CONTACT_507970] y sterile to ensure the effective contraception for males who appear to mainl y 
confer risk to females (WOCBP) via exposure to copanlisib in seminal fluid. 
Serum pregnancy  test was added to be performed at the EOT visit in countries where it is 
required b y local regulations. The list of specific countries where pregnancy test is mandatory 
after C ycle 1 was removed to avoid confusion and to pr esent a general statement applicable to 
all countries with such a requirement .
These changes were made according to recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy  testing in clinical trials by  [CONTACT_508023].

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 6 – c larification of the requirements for baseline 
laboratory analyses
Inclusion criteria related to adequate baseline laboratory  values were modified to clarify  that 
platelet tran sfusion, packed red blood cells or erythropoietin ; and myeloid growth factors 
should not be given less than [ADDRESS_655491] as confou nding factors in order 
to establish evidence of minimal bone marrow function, hence the limitation of treatment 
period providing an improved assessment.
Section affected b y this modification: 5.1.1 Inclusion criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 7 –modification of conditions for rituximab use and 
alignment of time frame reference
Progression of disease after the last rituximab infusion within defined time period be fore next 
treatment was added as an exclusion condition to ensure that rituximab had been previousl y 
proven to be beneficial to the target population. For patients considered unfit to receive 
chemotherap y the timeframe reference was also realigned to match that of the overall 
population.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 8 – m odification of exclusion criterion related to arterial 
hypertension 
The conservative requirement for blood pressure levels during the evaluation of patient’s 
eligibility  was removed due to feedback from the investigators and ly mphoma specialists. 
Appropriate blood press ure levels prior to study  treatment and available prophy lactic 
treatments are considered to be the most important safet y points.
Section affected b y this modification: 5.1.2 Exclusion criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 9 – e xclusion of patients based on plasma glucose levels 
removed
Exclusion of patients with fasting plasma glucose > 160 mg/dL at Screening was removed to 
implement the advisory  board recommendatio ns. The rationale for this change was to 
eliminate the eligibility  evaluation requirement for plasma glucose testing considering the 
study  patient population and to ensure enrollment of patients with diabetes mellitus in a 
compensation state that will be c onfirmed b y HbA1c testing at Screening.
Sections affected b y this modification: Sy nopsis, 5.1.2 Exclusion criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 10 – prophylaxis fo r HBV and monitoring of HBV and

Requirement was added that prophy lactic antiviral therapy  should be given for patients who 
are positive for HBsAg or HBcAb at screening. Further, monthly  monitoring of HBV and 
HCV (HBV DNA test for patients positive for HBsAg and/or HBcAb; and HCV- RNA test for 
patients positive for anti -HCV antibody ) was added to the protocol; also included recurrence 
as withdrawal criteria. The change was made because patients with HBV and HCV are at risk 
of recurrence while receiv ing rituximab.

to the allowed dose at least 7 day s prior to the screening tumor scan . This modification was 
made to eliminate a bias in the tumor response assessment; as to not potentially  change the 
lesion status from time of baseline scan to stud y treatment start.

feedback from the investigators. 
Changes include:
Management of transient gluco se increases should be based on persistent post -infusion 
blood glucose results.
Additional guidance regarding meal timing was provided.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 21 – clarification of tumor response language
The language related to radiological tumor assessments was modified to clarify the process for 
central review that the evaluation of tumor response will be done retrospectively  only for 
those patients who did not experience PD.
Modifications were also done to harmonize the language across the protocol and with other 
copanlisib protocols , e.g. language regarding t umor assessment in patients with WM was 
clarified . 
In general, CT/MRI  needs to be performed with IV contrast agents. A clarification was added 
to explain, in which situations the switch from CT to MRI  is required and when to proceed 
after the first treatm ent without a contrast- enhanced CT/MRI .

Original wording from the L ugano Classification 2014 ( 27) was inserted to the column 
“bone marrow” for PD.
Language in column “spleen” for PD was updated; a rule was added to minimize any  
measurements errors, and the value of ≥ 1 cm was used after advice from professor 
Cheson, the auth or of the L ugano classification ( 27). The total value of increase is also 
in line with the total increase required for the bigger lesions, i.e. les ions > 2 cm.
A footnote regarding the longest diameter (LDi) was added to provide more details as 
was outlined in the table; the rule or the content was not changed.
A note was added to further clarify  the evaluation provided in the response table,

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 5 –modification of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
criteria for copanlisib dosing
ANC laboratory  test criteria were modified for copanlisib/placebo dosing; the ANC limit was 
lowered to ≥500/mm3 for Day  8 and 15. Neutropenia can be managed b y G-CSF in many  
cases and data shows that the ANC nadir coincides with copanlisib administration (Day s 8 
and 15), therefore, a strict ANC dosing criteria may be unnecessaril y limiting for copanlisib 
dosing and therefore compromise the potential efficacy  of the drug. Table 6–4“Dose

monitoring and proph ylaxis of opportunistic infections in patients who are at risk for 
opportunistic infection development while on study  treatment.
The guidance includes additional CD4, CD8, CMV and blood culture laboratory  tests, and 
lung ex aminations to be monitored during stud y treatment in patients who are at risk of 
development of infections. Schedule of procedures were modified to be consistent with the OI  
guidance.
Also exclusion and withdrawal criteria were modified: patients with cyto megalovirus (CMV) 
infection are to be excluded from the stud y (re-screening is allowed once), and delay  in test 
drug administration due to reactivation of CMV can be up to [ADDRESS_655493] at baseline.
These criteria were modified to avoid worsening of CMV infection in patients with active

Amendment 9 is dated 02 FEB 2018 . 
13.4.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1 –changes in the statistical analysis and sample size 
There is no regulatory  obligation of powering on a specific subt ype of iNHL. As a result, the 
total sample size was reduced from 567 patients to 450 patients and primary efficacy  anal ysis 
will be performed in th e FAS instead of both FAS and FL subgroup. 
Based on more updated site information, the recruitment ramp up period was increased from 
6months to 29 months and the dropout rate was increased from 20% to 30%.
In addition, minor clarifications were done in t he statistical sections. The language regarding 
deaths that are related to PD was transferred from Section 8.3.1 to Section [IP_ADDRESS] since it is 
only applicable for the secondary  efficacy  variable “time to progression”. Also, the definition 
of PFS was further clarified and the reference related to minimum number of PFS events was 
included in Section 8.4.2 .

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 2 –clarifications/modifications of inclusion criteria
Although introduced changes do not alter the essence of the protocol, some modifications 
were considered necessary to i mprove clarit y of the protocol procedures. 
Inclusion criterion 2was clarified to provide less chance for misinterpretation. The definition 
of SLL was also adjusted to utilize more updated diagnostic definition of the pathology  as 
well defining the require ments only  for stud y entry.

rituximab -containing therapy  ensuring that the treatment was eff ective. Regarding the 
definition of a previous regimen, the specific requirement for rituximab monotherap y was 
included to ensure the alignment with the current clinical practice.
Inclusion criterion 4was clarified. A footnote describing the minimum values for measurable 
disease according to the Lugano Classification was added. The requirement for splenic MZL 
was also clarified since this group of patients presents manifestations which usually  include 
only spleen and bone marrow. Nodal and extranodal involvement is rare, and therefore 
requiring a bi -dimensionally  measurable lesion for this subty pe is unreas onable.
It was added that archival tumor tissue was to be obtained within 5 y ears of the consent date 
in inclusion criterion 9. The modification was done for further clarification.
Inclusion criterion 13was adjusted to be consistent with exclusion criteri on 4. I n addition, 
following wording was harmonized throughout the protocol since there were minor variations 
although the meaning was the same: progression -free and treatment -free interval of 
≥ [ADDRESS_655498] rituximab containing t reatment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 3 –clarifications/modifications of exclusion criteria
The requirement of “histologicall y confirmed diagnosis” was removed from exclusion 
criterion 3. A suspi[INVESTIGATOR_507942] 3b or transformed disease, or chronic ly mphocy tic 
leukemia should preclude the enrolment to the study. If confirmation i s required, there is a 
potential risk of enrolling this unwarranted population.
For exclusion criterion 4, see Modification [IP_ADDRESS] .
A reference to inclusion criterion 2was added to exclusion criterion 5to further clarify  
indolent B -cell NHL histologies that are allowed in the study .
Based on drug -drug interaction data, it was clarified that the use of strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 is prohibited (exclusion criterion 39). See also Modificati on [IP_ADDRESS] .
Sections affected b y the modification: Sy nopsis, 5.1.2 Exclusion criteria 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 4 –clarification of stratification factors related to entry 
criteria
The definition of stratification factor related to entry  criteria was adjusted according to the 
clarification of inclusion criterion 13 (see Modification [IP_ADDRESS] ). Since inclusion criterion 13 
was modified to be consistent with exclusion criterion 4, following wording was also 
harmonized in the definition of the entry  criteria stratification factor: p rogression -free and 
treatment -free interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655499] rituximab containing 
treatment.
The patients considered unwilling/unfit to receive chemotherap y were bundled to differentiate 
them in a subgroup different from the long- term responders (i.e. progression -free and

22 MAY 2020 Page: 130of 144
treatment -free interval of ≥ [ADDRESS_655500] rituximab containing 
treatment). In case a patient fulfills both entry  criteria the preferential assignment should be 
for the group labeled as “ unwilling/unfit to receive chemotherap y” providing a resolution to a 
possible impasse.
In addition, all applicable protocol sections were updated to clarify  that patients may  be 
unwilling or unfit to receive chemotherap y.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 5 –updated guidance for management of glucose 
increases
Based on available safet y data on copanlisib and to align with copanlisib prescribing 
information, the dose reduction guidance and withdrawal criterion (at the lowest study  drug 
dose level) for persistent occurrence of post -infusion blood glucose was modified from 
> 400 mg/dL to > 500 mg/dL. 
The language related to meal timing on infusion days was revised. Based on available safet y 
data, fasting status has no significant clinical impact on post- infusion blood glucose. On 
infusion day s, the timing of meal intake and additional glucose testing (if applicable) is 
managed and monitored by  [CONTACT_473].
Based on available data, post-infusion blood glucose increase related to copanlisib treatment 
is transient and manageable. Home glucose monitoring language was changed to allow 
investigator to determine if home glucose monitoring is needed based on post -infusion 
glucose profile and clinical status of the patient.
On infusion day s the allowed time window for post -infusion glucose measurements was 
changed from 5 min to 10 min for easier site compliance. In addition, the language related 
to glucose measurement time points was clarified.
The schedule for HbA1C measurements was updated and an additional measurement of 
HbA1C 3 months after the EOT visit was implemented in order to assess/demonstrate that 
HbA1C elevations revert to baseline after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507943].

avoid study  drug interruptions i n case the results are not immediately available.
Since all patients have l ymphoma at study  entry , clarification was added that ly mphoma 
should not be considered a risk factor for enhanced monitoring of OI (history of

The language stating that non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and 
diltiazem) should be used with caution due to a potential CYP3A4 interaction was removed 
from the protocol as there is a low drug -drug interaction liability  based on the current clinical 
knowledge with copanlisib.
The list of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers was updated and it was further clarified 
that the use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and strong inducers of CYP3A4 is not permitted.
To be aligned at the project -level, the guidance text for the use of substrates of the renal drug 
transporter MATE2K was included to the protocol.

14.6 Glomerular filtration rate
In accordance with established nephrology  practice and guidelines, renal function at baseline 
and throughout the study  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_23640] 
(GFR), calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study  abbreviated 
formula.
This equation of 4 variables (serum creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicit y) is recommended 
by [CONTACT_508030] 18 y ears or older.
The formula is as follows:
GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = k x 186 x SCR-1.154x age-0.203
where k = 1 (men) or 0.742 (women), GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate, and serum 
creatinine level is measured in mg/dL.
NOTE: This equation should be used only  with those creatinine methods that have not been 
recalibrated to be traceable to isotope dilution mass spectroscop y (IDMS).
If standardized IDMS -traceable creatinine assay  is used, please use the calculator provided in 
the following link: http://www.kidney .org/professionals/kdo qi/gfr_calculator .
The above result should be multiplied by  1.212 for African- Americans.
Patients with a baseline GFR < 30 ml/min calculated by  [CONTACT_508031] y.If not on target, this evaluation may  be repeated o nce after at least [ADDRESS_655508] abbreviated f ormula or b y 24 hour sampling. If the later 
result is within acceptable range, it may  be used to fulfill the inclusion criteria instead .
For further information on assessing renal functi on using GFR estimates, see references 43, 44
and45.

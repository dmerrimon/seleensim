CONFIDENTIAL  SYNOPSIS   
Study Title:  A Phase II I, Double -Masked, Randomized, Controlled Trial 
of KPI -121 in Postsurgical Inflammation  
Objectives:  The prima ry objective  of the study is: 
• To investigate the efficacy and safety of KPI -[ADDRESS_241409] surgery.  
The secondary objective of the study is: 
• To investigate the comparative efficacy and safety of  
two different concentrations and two different dosing 
regimens of KPI-121. 
Study Population:  
 The study population will consist of subjects who  have 
undergone routine uncomplicated cataract surgery and experience ocular inflammation postoperatively. 
Number of Subjects  Up to [ADDRESS_241410] surgery  
will be screened . One study eye from approximately 402 
subjects will be randomized.  
Study Products:  
 KPI-121 drug products  (0.25% and 1.0% ) or placebo 
solution s (A and B ) will be supplied as study product . 
Route and Duration of 
Administration  Study product  will be instilled in the study  eye only. Study 
groups include KPI-[ADDRESS_241411] 0.25% four times a day 
(QID) , KPI -[ADDRESS_241412] 1.0% two times a day ( BID), 
Placebo  A QID and Placebo B BID.  Study product will be 
administered for 14 days.  
Study Design:   
 This is a Phase II I, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of two doses and two dosing regimens 
of KPI-121 ophthalmic suspension ver sus placeb o in subjects 
who require treatment of postoperative anterior ocular 
inflam mation. Approximately 500 subjects will be screened 
and up to 402  subjects with one study eye each will be 
randomized in this study at approximately 25 centers located 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US). Subjects who experience 
postoperative inflammation on the first day following routine, uncomplicated, cataract surgery and who meet all other 
eligibility criteria  will be randomized to one of four study 
groups in an approximate 2:2:1:[ADDRESS_241413] (0.25% QID or 1.0% BID) or Placebo 
A or B QID or BID.  Drug product or placebo will be  initiated 
on the day following surgery  and instilled as one to two drops

14 days.   
This study will include up to 7 clinic visits (including the 
surgery day) over 18 to 33 days total study duration. Visit 1 
(Screening) will occur between 14 to 1 day(s) prior to 
surgery, and subjects who meet preoperative screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. At 
Visit 2  (Surgery/Day 0) subjects will undergo routine cataract 
surgery according to the Investigator’s normal procedures.  Visit 3 (Randomization/Day 1) will occur on the day 
following surgery. Subjects who meet the qualifying 
postoperative randomization criteria will be eligible for randomization to one of the four study groups and will 
initiate study product on that day. Following randomization, 
subjects will be instructed to return to the clinic to be 
evaluated at Visit 4  (Day 4 ±1 day), Visit 5 (Day 8 ±1 day), 
and Visit 6 (Day 15 ±1 day). The last dose of study product 
will be administered upon completion of [ADDRESS_241414] Use Visit

the eye is accompanied by [CONTACT_202340], an increase in blood flow to t he affected area, and extravasations of protein and cellular blood 
elements. Postoperative inflammation is manifested principally as bulbar erythema, corneal 
edema, ciliary  flush and aqueous cells and flare.   
If left untreated, inflammation generally resolves within 2 to 4 weeks after surgery; however 20% to 80% of patients present with anterior chamber cells and/or flare [ADDRESS_241437] surgery may lead to compli cations such  as cystoid macular edema (CME)  
(Apple et al., 1992; 
Tennant, 1978 ) , treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticosteroids is 
employed to reduce pain and discomfort, and to facilitate recovery of the blood-aqueous barrier. When administered at the time of surgery and during the immedi ate postoperative 
period, glucocorticosteroids can reverse the clinical and non -clinical manifestations of 
inflammation

Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is an ester corticosteroid that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_202319], and has been reported to have fewer side effects than traditional glucocorticosteroids. Loteprednol etabonate was approved by [CONTACT_7214] (FDA) in 1998 under New Drug Application ( NDA) 20-583 (Lotemax
®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gained wide acceptance by [CONTACT_202341]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_202320], wherein the drug is active at the site of administration but is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_202321], Lotemax requires frequent dosing (four times per day) which may reduce patient compliance.  
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed an improved formulation of loteprednol etabonate, 
designated as KPI-121, using a proprietary technology known as Mucus Penetrating Particles (MPP). MPP technology utilizes submicron drug particles formulated to enhance penetration through the mucous layer of the tear film. KPI-[ADDRESS_241439] been used in other FDA-approved ophthalmic products.  
Kala  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_202322]. 
KPI-121 is a sterile, aqueous submicron suspension of loteprednol etabonate and will be filled 
in a white, low- density polyethylene plastic bottle with a white, controlled -drop polyethylene 
tip and a polypropylene cap. The bottle will be a 7.5 mL dropper bottle ; the fill volume will 
be determined after manufacturing trial runs, and will be in the range of 5.[ADDRESS_241440] will be supplied in two strengths: 0.25% and 1.0%.  Each 
milliliter of KPI -121 0.25% drug product contains 2.5 mg loteprednol etabonate as the active 
ingredient; each milliliter of KPI-121 1.0% drug product contains 10 mg loteprednol 
etabonate as the active ingredient.  Inactive ingredients in KPI-121 drug products  ar

KPI-121 suspensions are essentially isotonic and are buffered to maintain a power of

The study product kit consists of a box of randomized study product that contains two dropper 
bottles of study product . At Visit 3, eligible subjects will receive one bottle of study product.  
The second bottle will be retained at the site and provided to the subject, in the event the 
subject needs additional study product during the treatment period. The b ox label will contain  
the following information: sponsor name, protocol and medicinal  number, storage 
temperature and required statement(s) per the appropriate regulatory agency . The dropper 
bottle contained within the box will be labeled with the following information: sponsor name, 
protocol number and medicinal number.   
The study product w ill be  stored in a secure area with limited access at control led room 
temperature  (15-25°C/59 -77°F) . Subjects will be instructed to shake the study product bottle 
prior to administering each dose. On days when subjects receive the first dose in the clinic  
(Visit 3), the in -clinic dose will count as one of their two (BID) or four (QID) daily doses. 
Subjects will then self -administer either one (BID) or three (QID) additional doses of study 
product during the remainder of that day. Visit 3 should be scheduled in the morning to allow 
subjects to receive a full day of either BID or QID dosing. 
On all other study evaluation days, subjects in the BID group will be asked to instil l one (1) 
“Morning Dose” and one (1) “Evening Dose” approximately 12 hours following the previous 
dose. Subjects in the QID group will be asked to instill one (1) dose upon awakening and then 
three (3) subsequent doses approximately four (4) hours after their previous dose. The four (4)

procedures  ( SOPs ), following approval by [CONTACT_1034]. All returns of study product will be 
documented.  The study monitor or designee will verify drug accountability. All drug 
accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete. 
6.5. MAINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
The sponsor, the project teams at the designated Contract Research Or ganizations ( CROs ), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of  study endpoints will be masked  to study 
product assignments. In case of medical emergency, or occurrence of an SAE, the 
randomization code may be unmasked  and made available to the Investigator, sponsor, and/or 
other personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of this study. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the study is completed and the database is locked.   
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no specific antidote to KPI-121, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary. If the 
Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask  a subject’s assignment after an emergency 
situation, the Investigator may call the medical monitor and notify the sponsor. The study 
product assignment will be revealed on a subject-by-subject basis with the approval of the 
medical monitor and sponsor, thus leaving the masking of t he remaining subject s intact.  
A randomization code will be computer-generated by D.A.T.A., Inc. or designee. 
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. Study personnel, study subjects, the sponsor, and project teams at the CROs involved in the study will be masked  to study product assignments.

8.1. SAFETY PARAMETERS  
Safety parameters include:  
• Assessments of AE s 
• Snellen Distance VA by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_202324] 
• Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy including assessment of the following signs of 
inflammation: Palpebral conjunctival e rythema, corneal edema, hyphema, ciliary 
flush, bulbar conjunctival injection  
• IOP Measurement  
• Dilated Opht halmoscopy  
8.2. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event  (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where th ere is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE . For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “ reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR  implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug.  
Unexpected:   An AE or SAR is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator ’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.   
Life-threatening:  An AE or SAR  is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
NOTE:  Events that are related and expected due to uncomplicated cataract surgery 
should not be classified as an AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE  or suspected adverse reaction  occurring 
at any dose that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event  (i.e., one that may jeopa rdize the subject or may 
require intervention to  prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
A NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE  that does not meet the definitions for 
SAE s as described above.  
Each  AE will be classified as SERIOUS or NON- SERIOUS using the definitions provided 
above. 
The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use of study 
product (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE will be assessed using 
the following definitions : 
Unrelated :  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than study product use.  
Unlikely :  
• Poor temporal relationship with study product use. 
• Event easily explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
Possible : 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with study product use. 
 Event could be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
Probable:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with study product use. 
 Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_7552]. 
 Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.

8.3. PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING  BY [CONTACT_202348][INVESTIGATOR_897], the time that the informed consent is signed by [CONTACT_202349].  
If a subject will not formally enter a trial until several days or longer after the informed consent is signed, the day of randomization to treatment may be a more appropriate time to begin collecting safety information.  AEs  occurring prior to randomization may be more 
appropriately considered medical history or pre- existing conditions.  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will be recorded on the CRF with the date and time of onset, date and time of resolution, intensity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of study product ), treatment required , and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial. For example: 
• How have you felt since your las t assessment? 
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
The causality of use of study product in relation to the AE  will be assessed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_202333], unlikely, 
possible, probable, or definite. 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
If a non-SAE  is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event. The Investigator should make every attempt to follow 
SAE s to resolution. 
Expected changes resulting from routine uncomplicated cataract surgery will not be captured as AEs. Likewise, the presence of inflammation due to surgery is not an AE but rather the 
condition under investigation. 
8.4. S
ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  BY [CONTACT_202350] a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or 
their staffs ’ attention. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs

medication is at the Investigator's discretion. Any subject placed on rescue th erapy will 
discontinue use of the study medication and continue study participation through Visit 7.  
Rescued subjects will be considered treatment failures, but the need for rescue therapy will 
not be considered an AE . Rescued subject s experiencing an AE  at the time of rescue will be 
followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE  or the end of the study (whichever 
comes last ).

Continuous measures (e.g., age) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_67423], standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. Categorical measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_202352]. 
If the two placebo groups demonstrate no st atistically significant difference , they will be 
pooled for analysis. 
9.1.1. Subject Disposition, Demographic and Background Characteristics  
Subject disposition, demographic characteristics, and background variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_2060].   
9.1.2. Analysis of Efficacy  
The primary analysis population will be the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all 
subjects randomized.  A subset of efficacy analyses will be examined for the Efficacy 
Evaluable (EE) population defined as all subjects who were randomized, completed [ADDRESS_241473]’s study eye will be defined as the surgery eye .  
The set of  primary endpoint s, using hierarchical statistical testing , is (1) the difference in the 
proportion of study eyes with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (grade = 0) at  
postoperative Day 8 maintained through end of study and no need for rescue medication for 
KPI-121 0.25% QID compared to placebo; (2) the difference in the proportion of study eyes 
with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (grade = 0) at  postoperative Day 8 
maintained through end of study and no need for rescue medication for KPI-121 1.0% BID compared to placebo ;; (3) the difference  in the proportion of study eyes with complete 
resolution of pain (grade = 0) at postoperative Day 8 maintained through end of study and no need for rescue medication for KPI -121 1.0% BID compared to placebo; and (4) the 
difference in the proportion of study eyes with complete resolution of pain (grade=0) at 
postoperative Day 8 maintained through end of study and no need for rescue medication for KPI-121 0.25% QID compared to placebo. 
The following scoring scale for anterior chamber cells will be used:  
0 = No cells seen  
1 = 1 - 5 cells  
2 = 6 - 15 cells 3 = 16 - 30 cells 4 = greater than 30 cells

2 = Mild  
3 = Moderate 4 = Moderately Severe  
5 = Severe  
 If the two placebo groups demonstrate no statistically significant difference, they will be pooled for analysis. 
Using the hierarchical testing scheme, the first test will be the difference in the proportion of 
study eyes with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (grade = 0) at postoperative 
Day 8 between the pooled placebo  control group and the KPI-121 0.25% QID group using the 
chi-squared statistic.  
If this test is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of the KPI-
121 0.25% QID group, then the difference in the proportion of study eyes with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (grade = 0) at postoperative Day 8 between the pooled placebo  control group and the KPI-121 1.0% BID group will be tested using the same 
statistic.  
If this test is  statistically  significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of the KPI-
121 1.0% BID group, then the difference in the proportion of study eyes with complete resolution of pain (grade = 0) at postoperative Day 8 between the pooled placebo  control 
group and the KPI-121 1.0% BID group will be tested using the same statistic. 
If this test is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of the KPI-
121 1.0% BID group, then the difference in the proportion of study eyes with complete 
resolution of pain (grade = 0) at postoperative Day 8 between the pooled placebo control 
group and the KPI-121 0.25% QID group will be tested using the same statistic. 
Secondary endpoints will be the proportion of study eyes with complete resolution (grade  = 0) 
of anterior chamber cells (scale 0 -4) and complete resolution (grade  = 0) of pain (scale 0 -5) at 
Day 8 and at Day 15.  Additional secondary endpoints are composite m ean scores of anterior ch amber cell and pain 
grades which will be summarized for each study group at each visit.

APPENDIX 2:  SUBJECT -RATED OCULAR PAIN ASSESSMENT  
In the clinic , subjects will be handed the Subject -Rated Ocular Pain Assessment to 
subjectively rate their pain at Visit 3 to 7. The grading scale for pain to be used will be as 
follows:  0 = None:      Absence of positive sensation.  
 1 = Minimal:     Presence of mild sensation or discomfort typi[INVESTIGATOR_202338] (e.g., diffuse or focal foreign body sensation, mild transient 
      burning or  stinging, etc.)  
 2 = Mild:      Mild, tolerable aching of the eye.  
 3 = Moderate:     Moderate or more prolonged aching sufficient to require the use of  
      over the counter (O TC) analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen).  
 4 = Moderately Severe:  More prolonged aching requiring the use of an OTC analgesic  
       other than acetaminophen. 
 5 = Severe:     Intense ocular, periocular or radiating pain (e.g. constant or nearly  
      constant  sharp stabbing pain, throbbing or aching, etc.) requiring  
      prescription analgesics.

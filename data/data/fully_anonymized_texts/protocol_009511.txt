REVISION #6  
 The protocol has been reformatted and repaginated to meet the current requirements for 
electronic protocol submission. This includes addition of second level headings in 
instances where they were previously absent, reformatting the title page to include all second level headings, reformatting the protocol calendar into Microsoft® Word, removal 
of forms and form numbers, and removal of the consent document as Section 18.0.  
Additionally, cross-references have been corrected as needed.   
1.   Face page (Page 1) :  The following changes have been made to this page: 
 The version date has been updated (8/29/13).   
 The heading “Study Coordinator s” has been changed to “Study Chairs ”.  The 
change from “Study Co ordinator” to “Study Chair” was also made throughout 
the protocol in Section 7.1 (page 18), Section 8.5  (page 21), and Section 
11.3 (page 26).   
 The heading “ Biostatisticians” has been added above the contact [CONTACT_231572].

terms and assumptions for the statistical section specifications:   
 
Original  
“If one assumes roughly equal numbers of patients with newly diagnosed and 
recurrent superficial bladder tumors, then we anticipate about 60% of patients will 
experience recurrences by 2 years. It is assumed that 14 eligible patients per 
month will be randomized. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_20984] (first 
occurrence vs. recurrent disease), and number of tumors (one versus more than one).  Assuming exponential time-to-recurrence (TTR) and 40% TTR at two years in the sterile saline group, then two years of accrual (340 eligible patients) 
and two additional years of follow-up will be required for a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_279210] ratio of 1.53 (equivalent to an 
improvement to a 55% TTR rate at two years on the gemcitabine arm).  The 
primary test will be performed using the st ratified logrank test.  All eligible, 
randomized patients will be used in the prim ary analysis regard less of whether 
they actually receive the treatment to which they we re assigned (intent-to-treat 
analysis). 
 Estimate of sample size: 340 eligible 
Estimate of accrual rate: 170 eligible/year 
 Two interim analyses of ti me-to-recurrence will be pe rformed after 50% and 80% 
of the expected number of events have occurred (126 and 202 relapses, 
respectively) which will be approximately at the time accrual is completed and one year later.  Consideration will be given to reporting early at either time if (1) 
TTR on the gemcitabine arm is superior at the one-sided 0.005 level or if (2) the 
hypothesis λ=1.53 (where λ is the sterile water/gemcitabine hazard ratio) is 
rejected in favor of λ<1.53 at the one-sided 0.005 level (testing using a 
proportional hazards score test, an extension of the logrank test). 
 Assuming the study does not te rminate early, the final analysis will occur when 
approximately [ADDRESS_279211] been reported (estimated to be about two 
years after completion of accrual).  The final analysis will be based on the stratified logrank test with stratification factors as specified in Section 6.[ADDRESS_279212] for the two interim analyses, for an overall level of 
0.025 (one-sided). In addition, the trial will be monitored for safety every six months.”

transurethral resection of the bladder ( TURBT ) intravesical instillation of gemcitabine 
versus saline in preventing recurrence of completely resected Grade 1 or 2, Ta or T1 transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the bladder at two years.  
 1.[ADDRESS_279236] TURBT instillation therapy results in reduced long term morbidity as determined by [CONTACT_231578], courses of traditional intravesical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and surveillance cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_231544].  
 
1.3 Translational Medicine Objectives  
 a. The correlative studies will evaluate whether performing a combination of 
molecular/cytologic diagnostic marker tests including NMP -[ADDRESS_279237] been shown to decrease the likelihood of recurrence and to be 
well-tolerated.  (
1-5) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_213151], this type of therapy has not been embraced by [CONTACT_231579] -grade superficial bladder cancer.  
 
Superficial Bladder Cancer  
 
Natural History :  Bladder cancer is the fifth most common solid malignancy diagnosed annually in 
the [LOCATION_002] .  (6)  Between 75 - 80% of these cancers will be superficial (Stage TIS, Ta, T1), 
greater than 90% transitional cell carcinomas (urothelial cancer), and the majority well (Grade 1) or moderately (Grade 2) differentiated (roughly equivalent to tumors of low malignant potential and low-grade carcinoma by 1998 AJCC criteria, respectively).  (
7)  If one eliminates patients with 
Grade III (high- grade) cancer or carcinoma- in-situ (CIS), the risk of recurrence after endoscopic 
resection alone, is quite high, but that of progression to muscle invasion, relatively 
 
 S0337 
 Page 6 
 Version Date 10/29/13 
 
low.  (2-4)  Based upon a recently completed NCI/ILEX Corporation chemoprevention study  (CN-
[ZIP_CODE]) , roughly 60% of patients eligible for  S0337  (assuming most patients have prior histories of 
bladder cancer) , will be expected to experience a tumor recurrence within two years, as detected 
upon every three month cystoscopy.  Fewer than 20% of patients eligible for this study would be 
expected to experience grade progression upon first failure, and far less than this stage progression to T2+.  (
2-4,8) 
 The population eligible for this trial will be patients who have low (Stage Ta, low malignant 
potential [LMP]) to moderate (Stage T1, low grade) risk urothelial cancer of the bladder and whose primary urologi st believes are not candidates for more prolonged courses of intravesical or 
more aggressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231545], bladder cancer history, and other factors (e.g. upper tract evaluation, cyt ology results, tumor size, multifocality, 
etc.).  Although cystoscopic inspection for experienced urologists is usually a reliable predictor of tumor grade and stage, it is estimated that roughly 10% of cases will be eliminated after randomization and drug/placebo instillation, because high grade cancer, TIS or muscle invading cancer (Stage T2+) is documented on final histology, mandating more aggressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  (
9)  
Additionally, another 5- 10% of patients would be expected to have sufficiently deep, large or 
bloody resections that urologists would be hesitant to perform immediate post TURBT instillations.  
 
Mechanisms of Superficial Bladder Cancer Recurrence :  Particularly for LMP and low grade 
superficial bladder cancers, data would indicate that recurrences of seemingly completely resected tumors occur because of new tumor development at other regions of the urothelium (field effect), implantation of tumor cells derived from the original tumor in other sites of urothelium (presumably occurring spontaneously as well as because of perturbations induced by 
[CONTACT_231580] [TUR]), and because of failure to resect the original malignancy.  (
5,10)  Evidence to support implantation includes differences in 
locations of primary tumors compared to recurrences with the former primarily located on the lateral bladder walls (70%) and trigone (20%); while recurrences frequently arise on the dome and anterior bladder wall.  (
11)  Animal models also indicate that both spontaneous and mechanically 
facilitated implantation occurs .  Sites of urothelial injury are preferential sites of recurrence.  (12-
13)  A single, immediately post TURBT intravesical instillation of chemotherapy is primarily 
directed at reducing the rate of implantation, although it may have a beneficial effect on eliminating field effect tumors or persistent (incompletely resected) ones, as well.  
 
Intravesical Therapy :  To reduce the frequency of recurrences in these individuals at low risk for 
bladder cancer progression and at high risk for recurrence, intravesical therapy with a variety of chemo- and immunotherapeutic agents have been used.  Agents have included BCG, mitomycin-
C, doxorubicin, and thiotepa in the [LOCATION_002], as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_231546] l in Europe.  
Courses of instillation therapy starting days and weeks after the TURBT can reduce recurrences by 17 to 44% compared with controls.  (
14-16)  These treatments, however, are not without 
considerable inconvenience, expense, and morbidities for patients with side effects including 
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia with thiotepa in 9% of patients, genital rash due to mitomycin in 6% of patients, and bladder contracture in as many as 16% of those treated with doxorubicin and 
a smaller percentage of those treated with mitomycin.  Side effects from BCG therapy occur in 20 - 45% of patients and can include high fever, granulomatous prostatitis, pneumonitis, and 
hepatitis.  
 To reduce these sour ces of morbidity, inconvenience and expense immediately following TURBT, 
intravesical instillations of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been tested in prospective randomized studies .  These studies are summarized in 
Table [ADDRESS_279238] shown a 40 
- 50% reduction in tumor recurrences with active agents (see Table 1 ).

In some studies, patients with newly diagnos ed cancers were particularly advantaged, while in 
others those with recurrent tumors were advantaged.  (3,17)  The largest of the studies is that 
reported by [CONTACT_231581], carried out by [CONTACT_941] E ORTC.  (3)  In this study , 80 mg of epi[INVESTIGATOR_30461] 
50 cc of saline was compared to 50 ml of sterile H 20 immediately after TURBT of Stage Ta and 
T1 completely resected tumors in 399 patients.  Roughly 80% had new tumors and exper ienced a 
reduction of recurrence by [CONTACT_46431] 50% from 31% recurrences per year in control patients to less than 15% in treated patients.  Patients whose index tumors were recurrent cancers experienced a non-significant reduction of recurrence rates compared to controls (p=.38).  The differences in 
recurrences were primarily achieved during the first 12 months, but these differences continued in each arm up to the four years of follow -up reported.  
 
Gemcitabine in Urothelial Cancer  
 Gemcitabine 21, 21-difluoro-21-deoxycytidine is incorporated by [CONTACT_231582]. It may also inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and cytidine deaminase activity.  (
18)  This drug has been shown to be active against unresectable and metastatic cancers 
in several sites including bladder cancer.  In a variety of reports, single agent systemic gemcitabine for metastatic or unresectable TCC has had objective response rates ranging from 22.5% to 28%.  (
18)  When gemcitabine is used in "doublets " with cisplatin, carboplatin, or 
paclitaxel, response rate in the 24% -78% range, mostly 40% - 60% have been seen.  (17)  When 
used in "triplets " with cisplatin or carbopl atin plus paclitaxel , objective response rates in Phase II 
studies have been in the 68% - 77% range.  (19)  Additionally, in a randomized prospective study 
of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus methotrexate, vinblastine, adriam ycin, cisplatin (MVAC) 
chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic TCC, equivalence of the two regimens was found with less toxicity for the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm.  (
20)  Thus, this agent has efficacy both 
alone and in combination in advanced urothelial cancer.   
 
Intravesical Gemcitabine:   Based on these observations, Dalbagni and colleagues have in a 
Phase I study tested various concentrations of this agent in an intensive regimen (biweekly instillations for three weeks followed by a one week hiatus in which patients were cystoscoped, and then received three more weeks of biweekly instillations in dosages ranging from 500 to 2,000 mg of gemcitabine in 100 ml of buffered water).  (
21)  The 18 patients taking part in this Phase I 
study were at very high risk, having highly refractory TIS or more advanced superficial TCC.  Thirty -nine percent of the patients achieved complete pathologic and cytologic responses and 
another 22% had mixed responses (negative biopsies but positive cytologies).   The responses were not clearly dose related when dosages of >
 10 mg/ml were administered.  There was no 
response seen, however, at the lowest dose, 5 mg/ml.  At the 10 mg/ml dose, [ADDRESS_279240] suggested buffering the solution with sodium bicarbonate to reach a pH of 5- 6, which is physiologic in the bladder.  (O’Donnell, personal 
communication, (
22) In the clinical study performed by [CONTACT_231583], et al, such buffering was 
performed.  (21)  However, in no other studies (described below) has buffering been used.  
 In a separate Phase I study, Laufer, et al , studied 15 patients with recurrent superficial bladder 
cancer (heavily pretreated with intravesical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) with six weekly instillations of gemcitabine dissolved in 0.9% saline beginning 2- 4 weeks after TURBT.  (
23)  Three patient cohorts were 
enrolled sequenti ally, receiving doses of 500, 1,000 and 1,500 mg in 100 ml 0.9% saline.  An 
additional six patients received 2,000 mg in 100 ml or 50 ml.  Nine of 13 evaluable patients had complete responses at six weeks after completion of therapy – all responders receiv ing ≥ 1,000

mg doses.  Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated gemcitabine or its metabolite, 21 21 
difluorodeoxyuridure in plasma of patients transiently in doses ≥ 1,500 mg/100ml.  No Grade 4 
toxicities were seen but one patient receiving 2,000 mg/100 ml experienced reversible significant 
urinary frequency (stopped treatment).  While these patients received six weekly instillations, none were started for at least two weeks after TURBT.  Two other presentations of Phase I studies of escalating doses of gemcitabine in 50 ml 0.9% NaCl have been presented, using six weekly 
instillations starting 2- 4 weeks after TURBT.  (
24-25)  Each had a minimal intensity of side effects, 
primarily minor dysuria in [ADDRESS_279241] been several reports about tolerability of various dosages of gemcitabine.  In one study not yet reported, O’Donnell from the University of Iowa instilled immediate post -TURBT 
gemcitabine – five patients received 1, 500mg/100ml 0.9% saline and five received 
2,000mg/100ml for 60 minutes.  Hematuria occurred in 2 of 10 and 10 of 10 respectively.  All 
other side effects were mild, transient, and unrelated to dose.  (
22) 
 In a separate study, Buettner and Boehle performed a small Phase I study of immediate post -
TURBT instillations of gemcitabine in dosages of 500 mg/50ml, 800 mg/50 ml, 1,000 mg/50 ml, 1,000 mg/100 ml, 1,500 mg/100 ml and 2,000 mg/100 ml of 0.9% NaCl.  (
26)  No systemic 
absorption of the drug was found for any of the dosages yet tested (based on pharmacokinetic 
data).  Moreover, all dosages were well tolerated except for 1,000 mg/50 ml which appeared to cause considerable bladder irritative symptoms that were relieved as soon as the fluid was drained from the bladder by [CONTACT_231584][INVESTIGATOR_44179] .  Since this was not found at similar 
concentrations with higher volumes, even the authors are perplexed by [CONTACT_63015].  Mild (Grade 
1 or 2) hematuria and/or dysuria that was quite transient were the only other side effects (in 9 of 26 patients).  (
26)  In addition, Maddineni and colleagues from the University of Manchester , 
England administered similar dosages of gemcitabine, again finding no systemic absorption in 15 patients with frequently recurrent superficial bladder cancer.  They found the instillations to be 
quite tolerable, although at doses above 1,000 mg/ml dwell times exceeding [ADDRESS_279242] been evaluated for recurrence, five of whom were tumor free.   (
27) 
 In a separate study, Palou, et al, treated five patients each with 1,500 or 2,000 mg/100 ml 0.9% 
NaCl, within three hours of TURBT.  No significant toxic ities were seen, with only one patient at 
the 2,000 mg dose experiencing only self -limited minor urinary irritation and two patients at the 
1,500 mg dose experiencing transient  Grade 1 hypogastric discomfort.  (
28)  Mean maximum 
serum concentrations of gemcitabine were 1.8 ug/ml, and no systemic toxicity was seen.  Four of the ten patients were found to have recurrences on reevaluation.  A summary of these pi[INVESTIGATOR_231548] 2 .

Proposed Clinical Trial – Efficacy and Morbidity of Therapy:  
 
Reducing the recurrence rate of superficial bladder cancer has benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and expense, and possibly reduces serious morbidity and mortality.  Immediate post -
transurethral resection ( TUR) instillation therapy is standard treatment in Europe, but has not 
been popular in North America.  The publication of a North American study showing efficacy is likely to change practices of North American urologists.  The use of gemcitabine will not only confirm the benefits of post TURBT instillation therapy, but also will test the efficacy of this agent, which has promising effects against high risk urothelial cancer in topi[INVESTIGATOR_231549]. Since this is preventing recurrence in a somewhat mixed group of patients whose composite populations have a range of recurrence rates, designs other than randomized prospective trials have no realistic chance of establishing efficacy, and use of saline control is valuable to make certain that active agent is more efficacious than diluent alone. We propose to determine if gemcitabine in a dosage and volume that appear to be well tolerated (2,000 mg in 
100 ml of 0.9% NaCl ) when instilled intravesically immediately after TURBT (within 3 hours), is 
more ef fective than instillation of sterile saline in preventing recurrences of newly diagnosed or 
occasionally recurrent low grade superficial bladder cancer that has been endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_231550] .  Additionally, by [CONTACT_231585] -term recurrences, we believe this therapy will also 
reduce longer term recurrences, and the need for frequent TURBTs, more traditional courses of intravesical therapy, and very frequent surveillance cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Proposed Correlative S tudies : 
 
The follow -up of patients with superficial bladder cancer is a subject of great interest because of 
the inconvenience, expense and morbidity of frequent cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Use of a non- invasive 
technique which has equal accuracy to cystoscopy would be desirable, but currently no 
commercially available noninvasive test is believed to have sufficient sensitivity in itself to replace 
cystoscopy.  In this study, two commercially available, point -of-care, non- invasive tests will be 
used in addition to cystoscopy to see if any, alone or in combination, can equal  the sensitivity of a 
cystoscopy .  This will provide compelling information on each test (data on combined tests are not 
available) and are likely, if a positive result is found, to significantly change standard urologic practice. Additionally, this will provide necessary background information for a bladder cancer 
screening trial which may be proposed in the future.  
 
Summary  
 In summary, we propose that immediate (within three hours) post TURBT intravesical gemcitabine will significantly improve the recurrence free survival occurring with intravesical saline, from 40% (with saline) to 55% (with gemcitabine) at two years post TURBT in patients with newly diagnosed or occasionally recurrent Grade 1 or 2, Ta or T1 bladder cancer that has been endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_231551].

 3.0 DRUG INFORMATION  3.1 Gemcitabine hydrochloride (Gemzar
®) (NSC -613327)  (IND-73,058) 
 
a. DESCRIPTION  
 
2'-Deoxy -2', 2' -difluorocytidine monohydrochloride (Gemcitabine hydrochloride or 
Gemcitabine®) is a white to off -white or translucent solid with a molecular weight 
of 299.66.  
 Mechanism of Action:  Gemcitabine, like ara- C, is an analog of deoxycy tidine.  
This antimetabolite, a pyrimidine analog inhibiting both DNA and RNA viruses, is cell-cycle -specific in  blocking the cells at the G1/S  and is retained in human tumor 
cells for long periods.  Studies suggest that gemcitabine is activated by [CONTACT_56614].  Deoxycytidine has been shown to reverse the growth inhibitory activity of gemcitabine.

b. TOXICOLOGY  
 
Human Toxicology :  Phase I clinical experiences with intravesical gemcitabine 
have been reported in seven studies where dose ranges of 500 to 2, 000 mg at 
concentration of 20 - 40 mg/ml with  [ADDRESS_279243] common complaints. 
 (21,23,25)  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia without infection was reported in one out of six patients.  (21)  The 
remaining three Phase I studies were performed in patients immediately after, 
within three hours after, and up to 24 hours after transurethral resection.   (26-28)  
No additional adverse events were noted in these patients.   A few cases of renal 
failure of uncertain etiology have been reported with intravenous gemcitabine administration.  While on study, one patient who received prior mitomycin 
developed hemolyti c uremic syndrome requiring dialysis.  The relationship of this 
event to intravenous gemcitabine is not known.  
 
Pregnancy and Lactation :  Gemcitabine may cause fetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman.  This agent has produced teratogenic effects i n mice and 
rabbits when administered at a dose of < 2 mg/m2.  Adverse effects included 
decreased fetal viability, weight and morphologic defects.  There is no data on gemcitabine administration during human pregnancy, and it is not currently known if metabolites are excreted in human milk.  However, many drugs are excreted in human milk, and there is a potential for adverse effects in nursing infants.  Therefore, the use of gemcitabine should be avoided in pregnant or nursing women because of the potential hazard to the fetus or infant.  
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY  
 
Kinetics :  Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly to form active gemcitabine di - 
and tri -phosphates.  Additional metabolites have not been identified in either 
plasma or urine.  The gemcitabine di- and t ri-phosphates do not appear to 
circulate in plasma in measurable amounts.  The compound is metabolized principally by [CONTACT_231588] (dFdU or 2' -deoxy -
2',2'-difluorouridine).  The plasma protein binding of gemcitabine is negligible.  
Following a single 1,000 mg/m2/30 min [14C]-gemcitabine infusion, 92% to 98% of 
the dose was recovered within one week after gemcitabine administration.  
Urinary excretion of parent and dFdU accounted for 99% of the excreted dose, and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in feces.  The renal clearance of 
gemcitabine is less than 10%; therefore, the parent drug appears to be almost completely metabolized to the inactive dFdU.  
 Half-life ranged from 11 to 26 minutes for patients receiving single dose infusions 
(1,000 mg/m2 to 2,500 mg/m2) of 1.1 hours or less.  Following longer duration 
infusions (3.6 to 4.3 hours), the half -life ranged between 18.5 and 57.1 minutes 
for single gemcitabine doses between 2,500 mg/m2 and 3,600 mg/m2.  The 
increase in half-life may relate to the appearance of a possible third exponential 
phase (representing a deep compartment) that is not observed following the shorter infusions.  
 
The population pharmacokinetic analyses of the effect of patient specific 
characteristics  showed that clearance normalized for BSA was affected by 
[CONTACT_547].  The clearance obtained for the female patient for all studies was 46.2 L/hr/m
2 and the male's was 66.8 L/hr/m2.  These moderate to high gemcitabine 
values suggest that gemcitabine may be metabolized by [CONTACT_231589], including the liver.  The renal clearance for gemcitabine is less than 10% of the systemic clearance.   
 
 S0337 
 Page 13 
 Version Date 10/29/13 
 
The maximum dFdU plasma concentrations were achieved from 0 to 30 minutes 
after the discontinuation of the gemcitabine infusions, ranging from 0.4 to 4.75 hours.  The apparent formation of dFdU (determined from the fraction of the gemcitabine dose excreted as dFdU) ranged from 91.2% to 98.2% of gemcitabine clearance in a single- dose study.  Based on the imputed formation 
rate of dFdU, the mean dFdU volume of distribution at steady -state was 150.4 
L/m
2, indicating that dFdU was extensively distributed into tissues.  The 
metabolite was excreted in urine without undergoing further biotransformation.  The mean apparent clearance of dFdU was 2.5 L/hr/m2. 
 Pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravesical gemcitabine and its metabolite, dFdU, were studied in plasma and urine by [CONTACT_231590], et al.  (
23)  Plasma samples for PK were 
collected before the instillation and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the instillation.  Gemcitabine was observed in plasma of the 4 patients treated with 40 mg/mL in 50 mL normal saline, but not in the patients treated with 20 mg/mL in 
100 mL normal saline.  Peak concentrations in this and several other studies 
were below 1 µg/mL, which were significantly lower than the 10 to 30 µg/mL observed after a single intravenous (IV) dose of 1,000 mg/ m
2 (Lilly 2002).  The 
plasma gemcitabine concentrations declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], even during the 120- minu te 
dwell time, and no gemcitabine was detectable in patient plasma beyond [ADDRESS_279244] 60 to 90 minutes of dwell time, after which they remained constant during the observation period.  
 
The authors estimated that based on their PK results and the 120- minute dwell 
time, the predicted amounts of gemcitabine absorbed from the bladder ranged from 10 to 110 mg, corresponding to 0.52% to 5.52% of the total gemcitabine dose instilled.  No dFdU was measured in voided urine, and 61% to 100% of the gemcitabine was accounted for in the voided urine.  The authors also studied the in vitro decomposition at 37° C with gemcitabine incubated with three control urine 
samples.  They found no reduction in the concentration of gemcitabine, nor was any production of dFdU observed.  Minimal systemic absorption based on measured serum gemcitabine levels following intravesical gemcitabine administration was confirmed by [CONTACT_231591] I studies.  (
21,24-28) 
 
Formulati on; Storage and Stability; and Recons titution :  Gemcitabine is supplied 
as a lyophilized powder in sterile vials containing 1,000 mg of gemcitabine as the hydrochloride salt (expressed as the free base), mannitol, and sodium acetate.  The lyophilized product should be stored below 30° C.   
 The drug will be reconstituted with 25 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride I njection to 
the 1 gram vial.  The vial will be shaken to dissolve.  This dilution yields a gemcitabine concentration of 38 mg/mL which includes accounting for the 
displacement volume of the lyophilized powder (1.3 mL for the 1 gram vial). The total volume upon reconstitution will be 26.3 mL.  Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 1 gram of gemcitabine.  The procedure will be repeated with 
a second 1 gram vial to reach the 2 gram dose for treatment.  The appropriate 
amount of drug may be administered as prepared or further diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride I njection  to concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/mL.   For this trial, 
gemcitabine will be r econstituted according to above guidelines and the 2 gram 
treatment dose volume (approximately 52.6mL) will be loaded into a syringe and 
addit ional 0.9% Sodium Chloride for injection will be added to reach a 100 mL 
volume.  Rationale for the 100 mL volume is addressed in 
Section 2.0  of the 
protocol.

 Revised 10/21/[ADDRESS_279245] of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.   Since it is not possible 
to use a placebo powder in intravesical therapy without inadvertent alteration of 
the bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], the pharmacist will be unblinded in this trial.  
 
Reconstituted gemcitabine is a clear, colorless to light straw -colored solution.  
After reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, the pH of the resulting solution lies in the range of 2.7 to 3.3.  The solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, prior to administration, whenever solution or container permits.  If particulate matter or discoloration is found, do not 
administer.  When prepared as directed,  gemcitabine solutions are stable for 24 
hours at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [ See USP].  
Unused portions will be discarded.  Solutions of reconstituted gemcitabine should not be refrigerated, as crystallization may occur.  
 
Administration :  Intravesical.  
 
Handling Precautions :  Gemcitabine is a toxic material which could cause skin 
and eye irritation.  Ingestion or inhalation exposure of sufficient quantities could result in decreased white and red blood cells, hypospermatogenesis,  
gastrointestinal disturbances, and other signs of toxicity.  The compound was positive in one of three tests for mutagenicity.  Laboratory animal studies indicate that compounds in this therapeutic class may be reproductive toxins and may induce fetal mal formations.  Contact [CONTACT_231592].  The urine 
and solution drained after the foley catheter is unclamped should be discarded as hazardous waste according to local, state and federal policies.  
 
Supplier:  Gemcitabine is considered investigational for this study and will be supplied by [CONTACT_11007].  The study drug will be distributed by  [CONTACT_231593] .  
Pharmagistics will be notified automatically after each new randomization.  Study 
drug and a letter outlining the treatment preparation will be shipped via overnight

 7.7 Follow Up Period 
 
All patients will be followed for a maximum of 4 years after registration.  
  
8.0 DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
 8.1 NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  
 
Two different versions of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) will be used on this study.  
 
a. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting
 
 
The CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 4.0 will be utilized for SAE reporting only .  The CTCAE Version 4.0 is identified and 
located at the CTEP website at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE  Version 
4.0.
 
 
b. Routine toxicity reporting  
 
This study will utilize the CTCA E Version 3.0 for routine toxicity reporting.  A copy 
of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0.
 
 8.2 General Dose Modification Considerations  
 
a. There will be no dose modifications.  Duration of retention of drug/control can be shortened if  medically indicated (e.g.  bleeding, pain or bladder spasm 
uncontrollable by [CONTACT_231597], feared bladder perforation, et c.). 
 
b. Toxicity measurements include a CBC.  This will be done somewhere between [ADDRESS_279261] instillation.  If white blood count is below 3,000/mcL  or platelet 
below 75,000/mcL , these tests must be repeated at least on a weekly basis until 
they reach pre- treatment levels.  
 8.3 Gemcitabine Dose Modifications . 
 
a. Pulmonary toxicity:  If pneumonitis Grade 2 or higher develops and is related to gemcitabine, gemcitabine should be promptly discontinued and the patient should be removed from protocol treatm ent.  Treatment with corticosteroids should be 
given according to established guidelines
. 
 
b. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) toxicity:  The diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis as indicated by [CONTACT_231598], reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure

Revised 8/29/13 Page 25 
Revised 10/29/13 Version Date 10/29/[ADDRESS_279271] is time to recurrence which is defined (see 
Section 10.2 ) as time from 
date of registration to date of fi rst observation of recurrent disease subsequently 
confirmed by [CONTACT_9256].   Those without recurrence are censored at the date of last 
cystoscopy.  Patients who die without any evidence of disease recurrence, will be censored at time of death.  
 If one assumes roughly equal numbers of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent 
superficial bladder tumors, then we anticipate about 60% of patients will experience recurrences by 2 years.  It is assumed that 14 eligible patients per month will be randomized.  Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_20984] (first occurrence vs. recurrent disease), and number of tumors (one versus more than one).  Assuming exponential time-to-recurrence (TTR) and 60% TTR (40% recurrence- free) at two years in the sterile 
saline group, then two years of accrual (340 eligible patients) and two additional years of follow -up will be required for a one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_279272] ratio of 1.53 (equivalent to an improvement to a 45% TTR (55% recurrence- free) 
rate at two years on the gemcitabine arm).  The primary test will be performed using the stratified logrank test.  All eligible, randomized patients will be used in the primary analysis 
regardless of whether they actually receive the treatment to which they were assigned (intent -to-treat analysis).  
 
Estimate of sample size:  340 eligible Estimate of accrual rate:  170 eligible/year  
 
Two interim analyses of time-to-recurrence will be performed after 50% and 80% of the 
expected number of events have occurred (113 and 181 relapses, respectively , assuming 
the alternative treatment hypothesis) which will be approximately at the time accrual is completed and one year later.  Consideration will be given to reporting early at either time 
if (1) TTR on the gemcitabine arm is superior at the one-sided 0.005 level or if (2) the 
hypothesis λ=1.53 (where λ is the sterile water/gemcitabine hazard ratio) is rejected in favor of λ<1.53 at the one- sided 0.005 level (testing using a proportional hazards score 
test, an extension of the logrank test ).   
 Assuming the study does not terminate early  and the alternative treatment hypothesis , the 
final analysis will occur when approximately [ADDRESS_279273] been reported 
(estimated to be about two years after completion of accrual).  The final analysis will be based on the stratified logrank test with stratification factors as specified in 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_279274] for the two interim analyses, for an overall level of 
0.025 (one- sided).  In addition, the trial will be monitored for safety every six months and 
assuming the alternative hypothesis holds.  
 11.[ADDRESS_279275] =  ± 0.077.  There is power of 0.[ADDRESS_279276] will be used to evaluate whether worsening- free survival (see 
Section 
10.0 for definition) is better on the gemcitabine arm relative to the saline  arm.  Descriptive 
statistics will be used to evaluate the number of diagnostic tests required for individuals on each treatment arm.

 Revised 8/29/[ADDRESS_279277] errors are adjusted.  Logistic regression using general estimating equation methodology (to account for repeated evaluations of an individual) will be used to assess and compare sensitivity and specificity of accurately classifying recurrence status using information from each individual urinary marker.  
 
The BTA Stat test and the NMP -[ADDRESS_279278] responses positive, 
negative or invalid.  Invalid tests at a given time will not be used in the GEE analyses.  
Two types of analyses will be performed using these urine markers.   
 The following information was obtained from the Early Detection Research Network 
(EDRN) protocol entitled, “Detection of bladder cancer by [CONTACT_231599]:  Multi -Institutional Study, Version 1.5” with Mark Schoenberg, M.D. as the 
Study Chair  and Mark Thornquist, Ph.D. , as the study statistician.  
 In that EDRN study, they assumed that [ADDRESS_279279] during the same period if we assume 10% loss to follow -up and a 40% recurrence rate at two years.  
So the estimates that they simulated would be expected to be conservative.  
 They generated 250 datasets for each sensitivity and specificity pair.  The data are summarized by [CONTACT_231600].  The table below shows the result when the simulations assumed exchangeable correlation between observations within a patients.

 S0337 
 Page 27 
 Version Date 10/29/[ADDRESS_279281] a cystoscopy every three months, 
regardless of urine marker results.  
 Sensitivity and specificity will be defined based on the concurrent marker status.  
 M+ = positive marker  
M - = negative marker  
D+ = biopsy confirmed bladder cancer  
D- = no disease indicated 
 Sensitivity = Prob( M+ | D+)  
Specificity = Prob(M− | D− )  
 When evaluating the properties of both markers together, sensitivity will be the probability that either of the urine markers is positive given that a patient has a positive biopsy, and specificity will be the probability that both of the markers are negative given that the patient is without recurrence.  In order to test the differences between the area underneath the curves (AUCs) for the single marker versus combined marker approach, we will compute the U -statistic of DeLong et. 
al.  (
30) 
 b. A second type of analysis will be the anticipatory estimate of sensitivity and specificity of each of the urine markers and the combination.  It has been hypot hesized that the BTA Stat or NMP -[ADDRESS_279282] 
the presence of cancer earlier than cystoscopy.  If this is true, then we’d expect a fair number of false positives since the clinical diagnosis might not follow for several months.  To evaluate whether this hypothesis is true, an analysis will be 
performed on the time course of the follow -up BTA Stat and NMP -22 tests and 
cystoscopy.  In this case, sensitivity and specificity will not be based on concurrent disease status but instead disease status at a future time t.  The anticipatory period can be varied to assess the lead- time provided by [CONTACT_231601]. 
 11.4    Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Oversight  
 
a. Regular study monitoring (described in more detail below) includes an assessment of accrual, adverse events and study outcome.   In particular, the 
SWOG  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee monitors accrual, and studies with 
accrual concerns are targeted for discussion at the bi -annual meetings.   In 
addition, NCI guidelines f or study monitoring will be followed, recognizing that it 
often takes approximately 6 months for regulatory approvals at the institutions before an accrual rate can accurately be assessed.   During quarters 5 and 6, if 
the accrual is less than 20% of projected, the study will be considered infeasible, and closure will be recommended to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.   
If accrual is between 20% and 50% of projected, then attempts will be made to improve accrual in the next six month period.   By [CONTACT_231602] 8 (at the latest), if 
accrual is below 50% of projected, the trial will be assessed for an amendment to reflect actual accrual, with implications on study relevance and feasibility to be discussed with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, the study committee, and the National Cancer Institute.

 16.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
a. Purpose 
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial.  
 
 S0337 
 Page 34 
 Version Date 10/29/13 
 Revised 6/19/12 
 
(Directions for routine reporting are provided in Section 14.0. ) Additionally, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for more timely 
monitoring of patient safety and care. The following guidelines prescribe expedited adverse event reporting for this protocol. Also see 
Appendix 18. 1 for 
general and background information about expedited reporting. 
 
b. Reporting method 
 
This study requires that expedited adverse event reporting use the NCI’s Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS).  The NCI’s guidelines for  
AdEERS can be found at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adeers.htm  
 
c. When to report an event in an expedited manner  
 
Some adverse events require 24- hour notification (refer to 
Table 16.1) via 
AdEERS.  When Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24- hour notification is to be 
made to the SWOG  Operations Office by [CONTACT_1381] 210- 614-8808 or by [CONTACT_231606] [EMAIL_1196].  Once Internet connectivity is restored, a 24- hour notification 
that was made by [CONTACT_99981] [EMAIL_1196] must be entered electronically 
into AdEERS by [CONTACT_433].  
 When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within the number of calendar days of learning of the event, as  specified in 
Table 16. 1.  
 
d. Other recipi[INVESTIGATOR_231559].  
 Adverse events determined to be reportable to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient must be reported according to local policy and procedures.  
 
e. Expedited reporting for investigational  agents 
 
Expedited reporting is required if the patient has received at least one dose of the 
investigational agent  as part of the trial. Reporting requirements are provided in 
Table 16. 1. The investigational agent used in this study is gemcitabine. If there is 
any question about the reportability of an adverse event or if on- line AdEERS 
cannot be used, please telephone or email the SAE Specialist at the Operations Office, 210/614- 8808 or [EMAIL_1196], before preparing the report.

Late Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studi es:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events 
that Occur on Studies under a Non- CTEP IND within [ADDRESS_279300] Administration of the 
Investigational Agent Gemcitabine. 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or 
not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death 
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] 
≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via 
AdEERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE:  Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the 
Section 16.1f . 
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via AdEERS within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report.  
 
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within [ADDRESS_279301] administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
 
Expedited 24-hour notification followed by [CONTACT_432] 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Grade 3 adverse events

2. For this study, the adverse event  listed below does  not require 
expedited reporting via AdEERS:  
• Grade 4 myelosuppression.  
 
g. Reporting Secondary Malignancy, including AML/ALL/MDS  
 
1.  A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a 
previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
 SWOG requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under a Non- NCI IND to be reported via 
AdEERS.  Three options are available to describe the event.  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology  chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myelocytic Leukemia [AML])  
 
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 For more information see:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#adverse_events_adeers  
 
2. Supporting documentation should be submitted to CTEP in accordance with instructions provided by [CONTACT_231607].    A 
copy of the report and the following supporting documentation must also be submitted to SWOG Operations Office within 30 days:

18.1 Determination of Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. (Directions for routine reporting are provided in 
Section 14.0 .) Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. Expedited adverse event reporting principles and general guidelines follow; specific guidelines for expedited adverse event reporting on this protocol are found in 
Section 16.[ADDRESS_279303] be reported according to local policy and 
procedures.  Documentation of this reporting should be maintained for possible inspection during quality assurance audits.  
 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited  manner 
(This includes all events that occur while on treatment or within [ADDRESS_279304] dose of 
protocol treatment. ) 
 Step 1:  Determine whether the patient has received an investigational agent, commercial 
agent, or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.  
 An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Submission (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not  included in the approved 
package label.  
 Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead 
from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a t rial. 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.   
• Concurrent administration:  When an investigational agent(s) is used in 
combination with a commercial agent(s), the combination is considered to be investig ational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the 
guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administration:    When a study includes an investigational agent(s) 
and a commercial agent(s) on the same study arm with sequential adminis tration 
all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow the guidelines for the type of agent being given.  For example, if the patient begins the study on the investigational agent(s), then all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow guidelines for the investigational agent(s).  Once the patient begins receiving the commercial agent(s) then all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow the guidelines for commercial agent(s).   
 
Step 2: Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE). The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCI 
has an Index to the CTCAE that provides help for classifying and locating terms.

 Version Date 10/29/13 
 Revised 6/19/12 
 
Step 3:  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE version specified in the protocol for 
reporting serious adverse events.  
 
Step 4:  Determine if the adverse event is Expected or an Exception to Expedited 
Reporting.   Expected  events are those that have been previously identified as resulting 
from administration of the agent and are listed in one of the following:   
 
• The current NCI SPEER (Specific Prot ocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting) 
for treatments using agents provided under an NCI -held IND, or an equivalent 
listing for treatments using agents provided under a Non- CTEP- held IND; located 
in Section 3.0  of the protocol.  
• For treatments using commercial agents, the current CAEPR (Comprehensive 
Adverse Event and Potential Risks), ASAEL (Agent Specific Adverse Event List), or other list of expected toxicities located in 
Section 3.0  of the protocol, or the 
drug package insert.   
• Exception to Expedited reporting located in Section 16.1f  of the protocol.  
 
An adverse event is considered unexpected,  for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in one of the areas 
outlined above.  
 
Step 5:  Determine whether the adverse event involved hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (≥ 24 hours).  
 
Step 6:  Additionally, for commercial drugs, determine whether the adverse event is 
related to the protocol therapy.  Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.  Consult the appropriate table for expedited reporting criteria for commercial agent(s).  
 
NOTE:   Any event that occurs more than [ADDRESS_279305] dose of study agent and 
is attrib uted (possible, probable, or definite) to the study agent(s) must be reported 
according to the instructions above and as outlined in the appropriate table in Section 
16.1.

18.2 Emergency Unblinding Guidelines  
 
a. General Considerations  
 
The randomized regimen for this study includes a blinded drug, which is either 
gemcitabine or placebo.  During the course of this study it may become necessary to identify (or unblind) a patient's treatment assignment.  The circumstances that w ill warrant unblinding and the procedure for unblinding are 
described in this Appendix.  
 
b. Criteria for Emergency Unblinding 
 
In general, treatment assignments will not be unblinded unless there is a compelling medical or ethical reason that the treatment  should be identified.  In 
most circumstances it will be appropriate to treat the patient or person who received blinded drug as though he or she received gemcitabine, irrespective of the drug actually received.  Therefore, unblinding should seldom be necessary.  
 
The following events MAY require unblinding of treatment assignments in this study:  
 
1. A compelling medical need as determined by a physician, e.g., existence of a condition for which knowledge of the patient's treatment assignment is necessary for the selection of appropriate care.  
 
2. Administration of blinded drug to a person other than the patient.  
 
c. Procedure for Emergency Unblinding 
 
Emergency  unblinding of treatment assignments for patients on this study will be 
performed by [CONTACT_231608] (WPC), upon approval from a 
designated physician (either one of  the WPC's resource physicians or [CONTACT_231629]) .  The procedure for emergency  unblinding the treatment assignment for 
a patient on this study is as follows:  
 
1. All requests for emergency  unblinding must be made by [CONTACT_231609]/her designee.  
 
2. Call the WPC collect at 206/526- 2121 from outside Washington State or 
toll free at 800/222- [ADDRESS_279306] be prepared to provide the following 
information:

information received from the caller.  If none of the WPC's resource physicians can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], t
hen the WPC will contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Edward 
Messing.  The contact[CONTACT_231610] a recommendation for treatment, if any, while maintaining blinding.  The WPC will then call the person who initiated the unblinding request and tell him/her either the treatment assignment or the resource physician's treatment recommendation.  
 
5. If the WPC is unable to contact  [CONTACT_231611]. 
Messing within three hours after receiving the request for emergency unblinding, then the WPC will notify the person who initiated the 
unblinding request that treatment assignment will not be unblinded at that time and treatment of the patient or person who received blinded drug should proceed as if the blinded drug is gemcitabine.  In such cases, the 
WPC will continue to attempt to contact [CONTACT_231612], and when one of them is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], will proceed as in #4 above.  
 6. Any patient whose treatment assignment is emergency  unblinded will 
receive no further blinded drug, but should continue all other protocol treatment if his/her medical condition permits.  
 
7. Unblinding of treatment assignments for any reason must be documented on the S0337
 Treatment Summary Form . 
 
Questions regarding the unblinding may be directed to any of the following resource physicians:

 Revised 6/19/[ADDRESS_279310] sensitivities of 35- 80% in the detection of bladder cancer, and specificities of 65- 90%.  (
1-3) However, 
combined performance is not known and the performance of  each of the two tests in a 
large population of patients with low risk bladder cancer has only been partially defined.  In the current study, each test will be performed prestudy and then every three months with each surveillance cystoscopy for 2 years (or until recurrence).  This information is needed to determine the relative safety with which one or both tests could replace some surveillance cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_231566].  Additionally, based on the pattern of recurrences in the placebo arm in S0337
, and from other studies, the optimal way for 
using these markers in monitoring superficial bladder cancer can be modeled.  (4)  For 
instance, if the initial recurrence is most likely to happen at the first or second surveillance cystoscopy, these tests might be best suited for use after those examinations.  
 
Methods  
 
BTA Stat and NMP -[ADDRESS_279311] histologically confirmed recurrence (whichever is sooner).  Each test will be performed as per manufacturer’s instructions by [CONTACT_231613]’s investigators and results will be reported to the Southwest Oncology Group Data Operations Office  on the 
S0337
 Urine Marker s Form . 
 
Interpretation of Data  
 Statistical considerations appear in 
Section 11.[ADDRESS_279312] (or combination of tests) to replace any surveillance cystoscopy during the [ADDRESS_279313] and the combination (either test positive = a positive test) will be calculated.  Additionally, the anticipation rate of each marker, independently and combined, in this longitudinal study (i.e. what proportion of “false positive” results predict 
future tumor appearance and how long after the first positive test result tumors become cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_231567]), and how consistently that marker remains positive before cancer is diagnosed, will be determined.  
 Additionally, how best to use each or both tests instead of cystoscopy, will be compared with published recommendations (e.g.  alternating one marker with cystoscopy) in terms of benefit and cost effectiveness.  (

Informed Consent Model for S0337 
 
*NOTES FOR LOCAL INSTITUTION INFORMED CONSENT AUTHORS:  
 
This model informed consent form has been reviewed by [CONTACT_60842]/NCI and is the official 
consent document for this study. Local IRB changes to this document are allowed.  (Institutions should attempt to use sections of this document that are in bold type in their entirety.)  Editorial changes to these sections may be made as long as they do not change information or intent.  If the institutional IRB insists on making deletions or more substantive modifications to the risks or alternatives sections, they may be justified in writing by [CONTACT_60843].  Under these circumstances, the revised language, justification and a copy of the IRB minutes must be forwarded to the Southwest Oncology Group Operations Office for approval 
before a patient may be registered to this study.  Please particularly note that the questions related to banking of specimens for future study are in bolded type and may not be c hanged in any way without prior approval from the 
Southwest Oncology Group Operations Office.

• A blank line,  __________, indicates that the local investigator should provide the 
appropriate information before the document is reviewed with the prospective research participant.  
• The term "study doctor" has been u sed throughout the model because the local investigator 
for a cancer treatment trial is a physician.   If this model is used for a trial in which the local investigator is not a physician, another appropriate term should be used instead of "study doctor".  
• The dates of protocol updates in the header and in the text of the consent is for reference to this model only and should not be included in the informed consent form given to the prospective research participant.  
• The local informed consent must state whi ch parties may inspect the research records. This 
includes the NCI, the drug manufacturer for investigational studies, any companies or grantors that are providing study support (these will be listed in the protocol's model informed consent form) and the Southwest Oncology Group. 
 
The "Southwest Oncology Group" must be listed as one of the parties that may inspect the 
research records in all protocol consent forms for which patient registration is being credited to the Southwest Oncology Group.  This includes consent forms for studies where all patients are registered directly through the Southwest Oncology Group Data Operations Office, all intergroup studies for which the registration is being credited to the Southwest Oncology Group (whether the registration is through the SWOG Data Operations Office or

registered via CTSU and the registration is credited to the Southwest Oncology Group. 
• When changes to the protocol require revision of the informed consent document, the IRB should have a system that identifies the revised consent document, in order to preclude continued use of the older version and to identify file copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  An appropriate method to identify the current version of the consent is for the IRB to stamp the final copy of the consent document with the approval date.  The stamped consent document is then photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_231568].  Other systems of identifying the current version of the consent such as adding a version or approval date are allowed as long as it is possible to determine during an audit that the patient signed the most current version of the consent form.  
 
*NOTES FOR LOCAL INVESTIGATORS:

S0337, "A Phase III Blinded Study Of Immediate Post- TURBT 
Instillation Of Gemcitabine Versus Saline In Patients With Newly 
Diagnosed Or Occasionally Recurring Grade I/II Superficial Bladder 
Cancer" 
 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical t rial to 
you.  Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make 
your decision about taking part.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation.  You are being asked to take part in this study because you have newly diagnosed superficial bladder cancer or superficial bladder cancer that has come back .  
 
Who is doing this st udy? 
 
The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) is sponsoring this trial.  SWOG is an adult cancer 
clinical trials organization. SWOG is funded through the National Cancer Institute, and its network consists of almost four thousand physicians at almost three hundred institutions throughout the [LOCATION_002].  Your study doctor has met all requirements to be a member of SWOG and to perform National Cancer Institute-funded research through this Group.  
Why is this study being done?  
 
The type of bladder tumor that y ou have has a relatively high chance of coming back in 
your bladder after it has been removed.  It usually comes back  in a different spot of your 
bladder than where it was originally. 
 The purpose of this study is to determine if gemcitabine, a chemotherap y drug that is 
effective against very advanced bladder cancer when given through a vein (intravenously) is also effective against earlier stage bladder cancers when given into your bladder 
(intravesically).  Specifically, the study will determine whether gemcitabine is more likely than saline (salt water) to lower the chances of your tumor recurring if given into the 
bladder within 3 hours after your tumor is removed.  
 In this study, the drug gemcitabine is being used in a new (investigational) way.  
 Since the final pathology will not be available until after you receive treatment, there is a 
possibility that you may not have cancer, but still may undergo treatment.  The likelihood of this is extremely small in view of known data that indicates that experienced urologists 
are capable of accurately assessing the presence of tumor.

How many people will take part in the study? 
 
About 340 people will take part in this study. 
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
 
Before you begin the study …  
 
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the 
study.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor. 
• Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a physical examination. 
• Your doctor will perform a cystoscopy (looking into the bladder with a flexible or rigid endoscope, usually in the clinic under local anesthesia) to look inside your bladder, with the collection of urine for cytology (a laboratory evaluation for cancer cells in the urine). 
• An x-ray of your kidneys (intravenous pyelogram or CAT scan) will be performed if you 
have not had that done within the last six months .  
• Your urine will be collected for urinalysis and urine culture.  If you have a urinary tract infection you cannot participate on this study.  Tell your doctor if you believe you have developed a urinary tract infection since the urine culture was collected.  
• Routine blood tests will be performed to evaluate your white cells, red cells and platelets, and the function of your liver and kidneys. 
 
During the study: 
 
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, 
then you will need the following tests and procedures. 
 
You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below.  Randomization means 
that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364].   Neither you nor your doctor will either know or choose the group you will be in.  You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. 
 
• After  you agree to take part in the study but before you receive treatment, your urine will be 
collected for research studies.  The tests performed will be the NMP -[ADDRESS_279314] recurrence as well as cystoscopy alone.  Your urine will be collected once every three months for the firs t two 
years for these tests.  
• The study involves one intravesical instillation treatment of either gemcitabine or saline (salt  
water) into the bladder immediately following the TURBT (trans-urethral resection of 
bladder tumor) procedure.  Saline (salt water ) is a placebo, not a form of treatment for 
superficial bladder cancer.  It does not contain any medication.  You will have a catheter tube 
inserted in your bladder through the urethra.  About ¼ cup of liquid containing either the study drug (gemcitabine 2,000 mg in 100 mL of saline ) or saline alone (100 mL) will be 
instilled into your bladder after all the urine has been drained out.  You will be asked to hold   
 
 S0337 
 Page 5 
 Version Date 10/29/[ADDRESS_279315] may choose to irrigate your bladder with liquid.  If the urine becomes clear within 3 hours, the liquid  could still be instilled at the time.  
• If your urologic surgeon believes for any number of reasons, including that there is too much post-operative bleeding, or that removal of the tumor went so deep  into the bladder wall that 
instilling the liquid  might be dangerous, he/she will not place the liquid into your bladder. 
• You will be asked to keep track of any side effects you have during the treatment, and will be asked about them by [CONTACT_231615].   
• Between [ADDRESS_279316] your liver function. 
• Every [ADDRESS_279317] two years, then every 6 months for the next two years, your doctor will review your medical history and perform a physical examination. 
• Every [ADDRESS_279318] two years, then every 6 months for the next two years, your doctor will perform a cystoscopy (looking into the bladder with a flexible or rigid endoscope, usually in the clinic under local anesthesia) to look inside your bladder, with the collection of urine for cytology (a laboratory evaluation for cancer cells in the urine).  At each evaluation, if either test is abnormal your doctor will arrange for you to have a bladder biopsy performed.  
If the cancer comes back, your doctor will discuss with you other options for treatment of your cancer at that point. We will continue to follow you to see how you are doing for up to 4 years after you start the study. 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
You will continue as detailed above for up to 4 years from the start of the study.  You will need routine follow-up evaluations (cystoscopy and urinary cytology) every [ADDRESS_279319] an d 
second year and every 6 months for the next two year s.  
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
 
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_231569] /saline can be evaluated by [CONTACT_4904].  Another reason to tell your 
doctor that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  The study doctor may end your participation in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.

You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be 
watched carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after the 
gemcitabine/ saline instillation .  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or 
may never go away.    You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.    
 Risks and side effects related to the bladder tumor resection (TURBT) and intravesical gemcitabine include:  
 
Likely 
• Bladder irritation causing urinary frequency or burning  
• Hematuria (blood in the urine)  
• Bladder spasms  
 
Less Likely  
 
• Bladder perforation (a hole in your bladder).  This usually will require you to have a draining catheter for several days longer than normal after your surgery, and rarely might require you to undergo an operation to repair your bladder.  
• If gemcitabine is put into your bladder, there might be other risks including the risk of the drug getting into your blood stream.  If this happens,  you may also experience low white blood cell or platelet counts, 
which could cause increased susceptibility to infection or bleeding.  Very rarely anemia (low red blood cell count) causing fatigue and sometimes requiring transfusions may occur.  
 
Rare but Serious 
 In a few patients who received gemcitabine through a vein, the following rare, but serious  
side effects were seen:  
 
• Fluid in your lungs, which could make you short of breath, wheeze or cough 
• Kidney stress or damage as shown by [CONTACT_231616].  You may notice blood and/or protein in your urine.

Risks and side effects related to the bladder tumor resection (TURBT) and intravesical 
saline include:  
 
Likely 
• Bladder irritation causing urinary frequency or burning  
• Hematuria (blood in the urine)  
• Bladder spasms  
 
Less Likely  
 
• Bladder perforation (a hole in your bladder).  This usually will require you to have a draining catheter for several days longer than normal after your surgery, and rarely might require you to undergo an operation to repair your bladder.  
 Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_59617].  Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035].  It is important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.  Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.  Some methods might not be approved for use in this study.  
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.  
Are there benefits to taking part in the study? 
 Taking part in this st udy may or may not make your health better.  While doctors hope 
intravesical gemcitabine will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof of this yet. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors le arn more about intravesical gemcitabine as a treatment for cancer.  This 
information could help future cancer patients.  
 
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
 
Your other choices may include:  
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study.  This may 
include other intravesical treatments, surgery to remove the bladder, radiation 
therapy to the blad der, or systemic chemotherapy,  
• Taking part in another study , 
• Getting no treatment. 
 Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.

Will my medical information be kept private?  
 
We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical record will be 
kept private.  However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Your personal information may be given out if required by [CONTACT_2371].  If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name [CONTACT_3381].

• The Southwest Oncology Group  
• Lilly Pharmaceuticals   
 
What are the costs of taking part in this study? 
 You and/or your health plan/ insurance company will need to pay for some or all of the costs of treating your cancer in this study.  Some health plans will not pay these costs for people taking part in studies.  Check with your health plan or insurance company to find out what they will pay for.  Taking part in this study may or may not cost your insurance company more than the cost of getting regular cancer treatment.  Because instillation of chemotherapy immediately after surgery 
is frequently done for bladder cancer, you and/or your insurance company may need to pay for 
this as well.  If there are complications of the surgery or the drug instillation, you or your health insurance may be required to pay for the expenses created by [CONTACT_231617]/or correcting these complications.

Consent Form for Use of Specimens for Research  
About Using Specimens for Research  
Prior to receiving gemcitabine or placebo, you will have  a biopsy (TURBT) to remove your 
bladder cancer.   In addition, if your cancer recurs in the future, additional biopsies will be 
performed at that time.  We would like to obtain some of the tissue that was removed both before 
and after the treatment  so that we can do some research tests on the tissue.  We would also like to 
collect a sample of your blood 3 months after you receive gemcitabine or placebo.   The goal of these research tests it to improve our understanding of your type of bladder cancer and its 
response to the intraves ical gemcitabine treatment . 
Your tissue will be kept at: 
Southwest Oncology Group Tumor Tissue Bank: 
University of Colorado HSC at Fitzsimons  
Department of  Pathology 
RC-[ADDRESS_279322] 
Aurora, CO  [ZIP_CODE] Phone:  303/724-3086
 
 
We would like to keep some of the tissue and blood that is left over for future research. If you 
agree, these specimens  will be kept and may be used in rese arch to learn more about cancer and 
other diseases. Please read the information sheet called "How are Specimens Used for Research" to learn more about tissue research.  
The research that may be done with your specimens  is not designed specifically to help you. It 
might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
Reports about research done with your specimens  will not be given to you or your doctor. These 
reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care.

Sometimes specimens  are used for genetic resear ch (about diseases that are passed on in 
families). Even if your specimens  are used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in 
your health records.  Your specimens  will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your 
specimens  may help to develop new products in the future.  
Benefits  
The benefits of research using specimens  include learning more about what causes cancer and 
other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
Risks  
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our 
best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private.  The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.

Specimen Consent Supplemental Sheets  
 
How are Specimens Used for Research?  
 Where do specimens come from?  
 A specimen may be from a blood sample or from bone marrow, skin, toenails or other body materials.  People who are trained to handle specimens and protect donors' rights make sure that the highest standards of quality control are followed by [CONTACT_60857].  Your doctor does not work for the Southwest Oncology Group, but has agreed to help collect specimens from many patients.  Many doctors across the country are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_60773].   
 Why do people do research with specimens?  
 Research with specimens can help to find out more about what causes cancer, how to prevent it, how to treat it, and how to cure it.  Research using specimens can also answer other health questions.  Some of these include finding the causes of diabetes and heart disease, or finding genetic links to Alzheimer's.  
 What type of research will be d one with my specimen? 
 Many different kinds of studies use specimens.  Some researchers may develop new tests to find diseases.  Others may develop new ways to treat or even cure diseases.  In the future, some of the research may help to develop new produc ts, such as tests and drugs.  Some research looks at diseases 
that are passed on in families (called genetic research).  Research done with your specimen may look for genetic causes and signs of disease.  
 How do researchers get the specimen?  
 Researchers from universities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and other health organizations conduct research using specimens.  They contact [CONTACT_231621].  The Southwest Oncology Group reviews the way that these studies will be done, and decides if any of the samples can be used. The Southwest Oncology Group gets the specimen and information about you from your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and sends the specimen samples and some information about you to the researcher.  The Southwest Oncology Group will not send your name, address, phone number, social security number or any other identifying information to the researcher.  
 Will I find out the results of the research using my specimen?  
 You will not receive the results of research done with your specimen.  This is because research can take a 
long time and must use specimen samples from many people before results are known.  Results from research using your specimen may not be ready for many years and will not affect your care right now, but they may be helpful to people like you in the future.  
 Why do you need information from my health records?  
 In order to do research with your specimen, researchers may need to know some things about you.  (For example:  Are you male or female?  What is your race or ethnic  group? How old are you?  Have you ever 
smoked?)  This helps researchers answer questions about diseases.  The information that will be given to the researcher may include your age, sex, race, diagnosis, treatments and family history.  This information is collected by [CONTACT_60859][INVESTIGATOR_231571].  If more 
information is needed, the Southwest Oncology Group will send it to the researcher.  
 Will my name [CONTACT_231625]? 
 No.  Your name, address, phone number and anything else that could identify you will be removed before they go the researcher.  The researcher will not know who you are.

How could the records be used in ways that might be harmful to me?  
 
Sometimes , health records have been used against patients and their families.  For example, insurance 
companies may deny a patient insurance or employers may not hire someone with a certain illness (such as AIDS or cancer).  The results of genetic research may not apply only to you, but to your family members too.  For disease caused by [CONTACT_60860], the information in one person's health record could be used against family members.  
 How am I protected?  The Southwest Oncology Group is in charge of making sure that information about you is kept private.  
The Southwest Oncology Group will take careful steps to prevent misuse of records.  Your name, address, phone number and any other identifying information will be taken off anything associated with your specimen before it is given to the researcher.  This would make it very difficult for any research results to be linked to you or your family.  Also, people outside the research process will not have access to results about any one person which will help to protect your privacy.  
 What if I have more questions?  
 
If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at (Insert 
IRB's Phone Number) .

 Title:  
COVID -OUT : Outpatient treatment of SARS -CoV -2 infection , a factorial Randomized Clinic al 
Trial.  
Purpose:  
1) To understand whether metformin vs fluvoxamine vs ivermectin vs 
metformin+fluvoxamine vs metformin+ivermectin are superior to placebo in non -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689155] -CoV -2 infection for preventing  COVID -19 disease 
progression . 
2) To understand if the active treatment  arms are superior to placebo in improving  viral load , 
serologic markers associated with Covid -19, and gut microbiome  in non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689156] -CoV -2 infection.  
3) To understand if any of the active treatment arms prevent long -covid syndrome, PASC 
(post -acute sequelae of SARS -CoV -2 infection).  
2.0 Background  
 Significance of  Research Question/Purpose:  
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_689157] -19 disease. While vaccine development for SARS -CoV -2 has been 
promising, there may be hurdles to wide distribution, reduced immunity in persons with advanced 
age or obesity (a state of thymic aging), and reduced willingness among the public to receive a 
vaccine developed so quickly.1 Additionally, new strain s appear resistant to the vaccines.  
 Preliminary Data:  
Several observational studies have shown an association with decreased mortality with outpatient 
metformin use in patients who were then hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19, including a study we 
conducted.[ADDRESS_934980] found efficacy of fluvoxamine in prevention 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689158] d death.3,4 Biophysical modeling of the SARS -CoV -2 life cycle, which 
accurately predicted the efficacy of remdesivir and the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine,

an especially sensitive node in the model (Castle et al., 2020).

COVID -OUT (formerly called MET -COVID) (MET29324)  VERSION 3. [ADDRESS_934982] COVID : 
High glucose is associated with worse COVID -19 outcomes:  Metformin reduces blood glucose 
levels, but not below physiologic levels, by [CONTACT_689207]. Worse glucose 
control has also been associated with higher mortality and end -organ complications in patients 
with COVID -19.6 
 
Metformin could decrease endothelial injury and its complications:  Metformin has been shown 
to improve mic rovascular endothelial function in women perhaps due to a significant increase in 
response to acetylcholine, decrease in insulin resistance, and non -significant decrease in tissue 
plasminogen activating factor, as was shown in a randomized control study of  8 weeks of 
metformin versus placebo in women with angina and normal coronary arteries .7 Pulmonary 
vascular endotheli atis has been observed in the lungs of patients with COVID -19.8 Endothel ial 
dysfunction may be an important mechanism and therapeutic target in mitigating COVID -19 
sequelae. Metformin decreases thrombosis in long -term follow -up, possibly by [CONTACT_689208] (mtDNA) release,9,10 and may mediate improved 
cardiovascular outcomes via mechanisms beyond glucose control. COVID  associated 
coagulopathy and thrombosis is a unique attribute to this disease, and the pathophysiology is 
poorly understood. Further, frequently widespread micro and macrovascular thrombosis has been 
reported in autopsies of patients with COVID  19.11,12  
 
Metformin decreases neutrophil -extracellular traps (NETs),  and the neutrophil to lymphocyte  
ratio.13-15 NETs are microbiocidal compounds containing DNA, histones, and proteins.14,15 Sera 
from patients with COVID -19 demonstrate elevated levels of these histones and DNA 
components.15 It has been hypothesized that excessive NET formati on leads to cytokine storm 
and microthrombus (possibly independent of tissue factor), and ultimately acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS) in COVID -19.[ADDRESS_934983] been an important feature of severe COVID -19 disease.13,17 -19 
Metformin’s inhibition of NET release could therefore mitigate the development of downstream 
lung injury.  
 
Metformin could decrease the viral cycle:  There is evidence that metformin increases endosomal 
pH via action on v acuo lar ATPase and/or endosomal Na+/H+ exchangers,20 thus redu cing viral 
replication. Metformin leads indirectly to alteration of the mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR)  pathway,[ADDRESS_934984] MERS and COVID -19.23-25

theoretically decrease SARS -CoV -2 binding and entry into cells.29

Metformin has immune -modulatory effects:  In patients with and without diabetes, metformin has 
been shown to favorably alter inflammatory mediators, including in terleukin 6 (IL -6), TNF -
alpha , and to possibly boost interleukin 10 (IL -10), and suppress the C -C motif chemokine 
ligand.13,30 -32 Metformin’s activation of the AMPK/mTor/Stat3 pathway seems to steer

cytokines that contribute to morbidity in COVID -19.33-[ADDRESS_934986] was 
seen in a retrospective study by  [CONTACT_689212],  review 904 patients with COVID -19 which showed 
that metformin users had lower IL -6 levels compared to non -metformin users (Table 2).18 
Metformin also inhibits toll -like-receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling and interferon production, which  
appears important to COVID -[ADDRESS_934987] been found t o cause a greater increase in 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -alpha) than mast cells in male rats, which may explain the 
observational findings of reduced mortality in women on metformin, but no among men on 
metformin.41  
 
Metformin has a history of anti -infectious properties: Metformin was found to have antiviral 
activity before SARS -CoV -2. In the 1940s and 1950s, metformin was used against influenza (as 
“Flunamine”), and was found to be effective against parainfluenza and cowpox.42,43 Metformin 
has also been associated with improved response to anti -infectious agents in HIV and 
tuberculosis.44 With the Zik a virus, another RNA virus, activation of AMPK by [CONTACT_689213], with PKA Inhibitor PKI leading to decreased viral infection and replication .45,46 In 
patients with hepatitis C, metformin has been associated with improved virologic response to 
antivirals through decreased insulin resistance.47  
 
Metformin’s past anti -infectious benefits have been both against the infectious agent directly, as 
well as by [CONTACT_689214]. It is unknown if the lower mortality 
observed in patients infected with COVID -[ADDRESS_934988] important anti -viral and anti -
inflammatory effects in SARS -CoV -2 infection. There is evidence that SARS -CoV -2 infection 
causes ER stress and activates pathways of unfolded protein response.48,49 This response is 
related to several signaling pathways such as autophagy, apoptosis, innate immunity, pro -
inflammatory response, and MAP kinase pathways .48 Further study has demonstrated  that the 
virus can  take over the ER by [CONTACT_689215] 1 (IRE1) 
which  helps to regulate coronavirus -induced autophagy.[ADDRESS_934989] for immunomodulatory treatm ent.  
 
Sigma -1 receptor (S1R) is an ER chaperone protein that regulates cytokine production through 
interaction with IRE1.[ADDRESS_934990] mice from septic 
shock and reduce the inflammatory response.52 There is potential for fluvoxamine as an 
immunomodulatory treatment for SARS -Cov-2. Fluvoxamine in CACO2 cells infected with

CXCL1, and CXCL10.53 A randomized controlled clinical trial of 152 patients showed that 
patients who received fluvoxamine were  less likely to experience clinical deterioration, or 
serious adverse events  due to SARS -Cov-2 when compared to placebo  (0% vs. 8%) .4  A follow 
up real world observational cohort had similar findings of 0% (0/65) hospit alization with 
fluvoxamine vs. 12% (6/48) with observation.54  
 
 
 
Ivermectin  
Ivermectin has also shown anti -inflammatory effects that would reduce the harmful cytokine 
cascade noted in severe Covid -19 disease.55 A recent t rial assessing a multi -therapy including 
12mg one -time dose of ivermectin found a 75% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[ADDRESS_934991] be done in the US, as endemic strongyloidiasis  in other countries may confound results.  
 
Impo rtance of factorial design approach:  
It is important  to study all 3 of these medications in a factorial design because they all fit into 
the same implementation category: all are  existing , FDA -approved , generic, inexpensive, 
currently available world -wide, and have long records of excellent safety. They each hold few 
medication or co -morbidity related contraindications , and none of them require any follow -up 
for short -term use.  
 
A factorial design appro ach is important for minimizing the percentage of patients who receive 
placebo in this urgent public health emergency. A factorial design allows us to  efficiently  
compare the drugs directly to each other, as well as combination arms , while maintaining a 
placebo control.  While EUA’s and prospective cohorts have become common in the body of

 Descript ion:  
Metformin : a biguanide, administered in its immediate release  (IR) formation, 1,500mg  by [CONTACT_1966] 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_689161] 2,000mg per day) . Patients will be instructed to take 500mg  once 
on Day 1, ideally in the PM; 500mg in the AM and PM of Days 2 -5; and 500mg in the AM and 
1,000mg in the PM of Day s 6-14. 
Fluvoxamine : an antidepressant, administered in twice daily dosing, 50mg twice per day  for 14 
days (typi[INVESTIGATOR_689161]  100mg to 300mg per day).  
Ivermectin : is an antiparasitic medication administered typi[INVESTIGATOR_689162] 200 -
800mcg/kg/day .67 In order to stay within this dose range, the following doses will be given in 
the following weight categories: 74 kg - 88 kg = 35 mg; 88kg – 106kg = 42mg; 106 -124kg = 
49mg; >124kg = 56mg . See details in  Section  4.2. Treatment will be given for [ADDRESS_934995] 
the blind.  
 Rational for formulation and dose:  
Metformin : Given the current recall of Metformin Extended Release, ER, (see section on FDA 
recall below), availability of ER is limited. Additionally, it is possible that additional lots of ER 
will be recalled, further c omplicating supply issues  and exposure to the recalled substance to 
patients . The side effect profile of immediate and extended release is  similar, and we are limiting 
the dose at 1,500mg  daily to balance the need to achieve a consistent dose a nd an effect ive dose 
without causing side effects , as the risk of side effects increase at a dose of 2,000mg daily .68  
Fluvoxamine : A dose of 100mg TID was recently used in a small randomized trial,4 and 50mg 
BID were recently used in a prospective cohort study .69 The higher dose elicited side effects in 
approximately  10% of participants .[ADDRESS_934996] a lower 50mg BID dose as the risks of side effects is lower and the 
public may be more willing to take  an antidepressant medication if it is low dose. Additionally, 
the risk of serotonin syndrome and other drug interactions that may occur with fluvoxamine is 
lower with a lower dose, and thus persons currently on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
would not have to stop  or alter  their current therapy.

Acquisition:  
A sufficient quantity of the FDA -approved formulation of metformin IR, ivermectin,  and 
fluvoxamine  IR for the study has been acquired  by [CONTACT_689218] . 
 Storage and Stability:  
Store at room temperature up to 30ºC. Dispense in a tight, light -resistant container.  
 Pharmacokinetics:  
Metformin: Intravenous single -dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is 
excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have 
been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times 
greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of 
metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug 
is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half -life of 
approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half -life is approximately 17.6 hours, 
suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.  
Fluvoxamine: Onset of action: Anxiety disorders (obsessive -compulsive, panic, and posttraumatic stress 
disorder): Initial effects may be observed within 2 weeks of treatment, with continued improvements 
through 4 to 6 weeks (Issari 2016; Varigonda 2016; WFSBP [Bandelow 2012]); some experts suggest 
up to 12 weeks of treatment may be nece ssary for response, particularly in patients with obsessive -
compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (BAP [Baldwin 2014]; Katzman 2014; WFSBP 
[Bandelow 2012]). Depression: Initial effects may be observed within 1 -2 weeks of treatment, with 
continued improvements through 4 - 6 weeks (Papakostas 2006; Posternak 2005; Szegedi 2009; Taylor 
2006). Distribution: Vd: ~25 L/kg  
Protein binding: ~80%, primarily to albumin  
Metabolism: Extensively hepatic via oxidative demethylation and deamination  
Bioavai lability: Immediate release: 53%; Extended release: 84%; not affected by [CONTACT_8208].  
Half-life elimination: ~14 to 16 hours; ~17 to 26 hours in the elderly  
Time to peak, plasma: 3 to 8 hours  
Excretion: Urine (~85% as metabolites; ~2% as unchanged drug)  
 
Ivermectin:  Absorption: Well absorbed in the fasting state (Baraka 1996; Edwards 1988; Okonkwo 
1993); may be increased with a high -fat meal (Duthaler 2020; Guzzo 2002; Miyajima 2013).  
Distribution: V d: 3.1 to 3.5 L/kg in healthy volunteers; mean 9.9 L/kg (range: 6.9 to 15.3 L/kg) in 
patients with onchocerciasis; high concentration in the liver and adipose tissue; does not readily cross 
the blood -brain barrier (Gonzalez Canga 2008; Okonkwo 1993).  
Protei n binding: ~93% primarily to albumin (Gonzalez Canga 2008)  
Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 (major), CYP2D6 (minor), and CYP2E1 (minor)  
Half-life elimination: 18 hours  
Time to peak, serum: ~4 hours

*Updated sample size: [ADDRESS_935002] result will be overwhelming and make it challenging for patients  to fully 
consider whether or not they want to participate. Being informed of the study before results are 
known will facilitate enrolling soon after their result is known so that study medication can be 
started early in the course of disease or soon after  exposure.  
Clinical teams may refer patients to the study in person or over the phone, including transferring 
patients to the study phone line if they are willing to be transferred. RC’s may reach out to close 
contacts of persons with positive SARS -CoV -2 infection, and/or respond to patient emails, phone 
calls, or inquiries on the study website. The study teams may receive lists of persons who reach 
out to community patient advocacy groups looking for trials to enroll into.  The central and 
participating s ite study teams may receive names and phone numbers of persons with a positive 
SARS -CoV -2 result from other facilities conducting testing. This information will only be in a 
secure database (Redcap or Box).  
Patients may be given a brochure or electronic m essage with study information for contact[CONTACT_689219] . RC’s may also pro -actively reach out to patients 
who are scheduled for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_935003] results , as not all patients may receive or read an electronic 
message  or brochure.  
Patients can also self -refer based on seeing advertisements  (such as through all forms of social 
media, newspaper, local posters, and email referrals).

IL-6,neutrophil extracellular traps,19-26 and improved T cell immunity.27,28  Outpatient metformin use has been 
associated with lower IL-6, CRP, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in persons with Covid-19.29,30  
 
Fluvoxamine Background: a strong Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist. S1R is an ER chaperone protein that 
regulates cytokine production through interaction with IRE1 (4). S1R modulation has demonstrated significant 
changes to SARS-CoV-2 replication. The combination of metformin + fluvoxamine may be particularly powerful 
by [CONTACT_689222]. 
 
Fluvoxamine has been 
associated with reduced 
Covid-19 progression in 
a prospective cohort 
and a double-blinded 
placebo controlled trial. 
Fluvoxamine’s actions 
are likely through strong 
Sigma 1 receptor 
agonism. Seftel, Boulware, 
in press. Lenze et al, JAMA.  
 
We will be using a lower dose fluvoxamine (50mg BID), which allows patients to stay on their existing SSRI’s 
(about 20% of US adult population31), and will have lower risk of side effects.  
 
Ivermectin Background: Ivermectin has also shown anti-inflammatory effects that would reduce the harmful 
cytokine cascade noted in severe Covid-19 disease.32 A recent trial assessing a multi-therapy including 12mg 
one-time dose of ivermectin found a 75% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[ADDRESS_935004] be done in the US, as endemic strongyloides in other countries may confound results.  
 
Significance: A rigorous, double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT of metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin 
for outpatient treatment of Covid-[ADDRESS_935005]: Metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin are available, well tolerated, have years of safety data,18,37 few 
contraindications, and costs <$4/month. All three medications are safe in pregnancy and children. No follow-up 
is needed until 12 months on metformin. No follow-up is needed for short-term fluvoxamine or ivermectin. 
 
Specific Aim: Conduct a Phase III trial, placebo-controlled, double blinded multi-site, 6-arm factorial RCT of 
metformin, fluvoxamine, ivermectin, and combination arms for early outpatient treatment of Covid-19.  
Hypothesis: Outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin will 
reduce Covid-19 severity. The combination of metformin/fluvoxamine will have the greatest effect.

CoV -2 testing results rather than the research team.   
At times recruitment and enrollment efforts may be focused on priority populations  within the 
eligibility criteria . 
 Screening:  
● Based on patient feedback, to reduce participant  burden because SARS -CoV -2 symptoms 
may be present, we will offer the opportunity for patients to self -screen online to avoid 
burden and barriers to participating  
○ This will be performed via a web -based form. Eligibility criteria and medical 
history will be  by [CONTACT_6270] -report entries into the secure web -based form.  
○ After self -screening online, patients may elect to self -consent online, or have a 
consent discussion with an RC (section 5.4).  
● For patients who do not want to screen or consent via web -based form, sc reening and consent 
may be done over the phone with RC with eligibility criteria and history entered into the web -
based form by [CONTACT_122440].  
● Patients will be asked to submit proof of their positive SARS -CoV -2 result via secure means , 
but the receipt of the result may occur after enrollment.  
5.3.1 GFR  
GFR will be collected on persons > age [ADDRESS_935006] chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or liver disease  if a GFR is  
not available  within 2 weeks  in the EHR.  It may be collected from patients by [CONTACT_186413] -
collection kits sent to patients ’ homes with return arranged by [CONTACT_3476] ; or by [CONTACT_689223]-person collection.  
Participants will receive the study drug at the same time as the GFR testing kit in the mai l 
(or GFR drawn in person), as well as a return envelope for the study drug. They will start 
the study drug before their GFR result is returned. If the GFR result returns and is < 
45ml/min, they will be asked to stop taking the study drug and return the re mainder of 
the study drug. This will count as a screen failure.  
We are taking this approach for 3 reasons: a) this is consistent with clinical practice in 
which metformin us often started while a GFR result is pending, because the use of 
metformin for two weeks at a dose of 1,500mg  does not significantly increase risk of 
lactic acidosis in someone who has no known history of severe heart, liver or kidney 
injury, including in persons with COVID -19;70 b) to start the study drug early in the 
course of the disease, as in real life an outpatient post -exposure prophylactic or treatment 
therapy would be offered at the time of SARS -CoV -2 exposure or positive infection , c) 
maintain a virtual study design so as to not create unnecessary exposure and use of PPE 
by [CONTACT_689224]. Metformin is FDA approved down to a GFR > 30ml/min , 
though sometimes used down to a GFR of [ADDRESS_935007] , all measure s will be taken to mitigate risk of SARS -CoV -2 
exposure to the phlebotomy  or study  team  members,  and to the participant.

treatment response  and mechanism . A random sample of 95% of these samples will be 
analyzed. Labs  will be processed at local eligible labs, or a t the University of Minnesota

 Informed Consent  
Consent will be obtained  (via self -consent (below), or a traditional consent conversation ) before 
beginning any study procedures. The entire consen t document will be reviewed, including all 
study procedures and expectations, risks, benefits, and what volunteering means. Participants 
will be asked questions to gauge their level of understanding . 
Potential participants will be given time to read the co nsent and ask questions. If needed, a 
participant may take additional time to review the consent or discuss participating in the study 
with family/friends. The consent conversation will be done remotely, using a phone or secure 
HIPAA compliant video/web co nferencing  or in-person .  
Based on patient feedback, we will also offer the opportunity to self -consent online, waiving the 
consent conversation. This would mean that after potential participants answer eligibility 
questions  with the RC or online  (section 5.3 above), they could access the online consent module.  
○ Patients will be able to read the consent form online and asked to answer 
comprehension questions about the consent. Participants will review short 
sections and need to click in order to move to the next section to increase 
engagement and comprehension of the study during the self -consent process.  
○ If their responses to the comprehension questions indicate that they are well -
informed about the study, they would be able to sign the consent form online.  
○ If their responses indicate that they lack understanding, the RC may call them 
for a traditional consent conversation and assessment of comprehension.  
 
The consent document will be presented to the participant as an electronic document (eConsent ) 
through the University of Minnesota’s instance of REDCap.  The REDCap eConsent document 
will contain the full consent text and is compliant with FDA [ADDRESS_935009] -copy print out of th e consent form if patients are in clinic for other reasons.

 Secondary outcomes will be assessed at  14 and  28 days, including in patients who 
drop out of doing the study tasks . EHR search of outcomes will be assessed of all 
patients who enroll.  
 Patients  in the treatment arm who visit an urgent care or emergency department  and 
are sent home without being admitted should continue the study drug  through day 14 , 
unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_689231] e.  
 Long -Covid symptoms will be assessed at approximately 1 -month intervals after the 
completion of the 14 -day study treatment period.  
Oxygen Saturation:   
For the daily oxygen saturation recording, participants will be asked to measure  their 
oxygen level  ideally in the afternoon or evening . They may take a reading at any time, 
especially if they feel short of breath or are breathing faster  than normal . If they have an 
oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air on 2 readings or more, they will be advised to

Referral to medical care:  If the research staff feels a patient is unwell,  they will advise 
the patient to reach out to their doctor. P hysician investigators may also evaluate the 
participant via phone/telehealth and direct them for further care if needed.  
When a participant is directed to seek emergency medical care, they will be inst ructed 
to identify themselves to EMS or to the ED staff as having been diagnosed with 
COVID -19.  
5.5.1 Survey Data Collection:  
Participants will be given a hard -copy symptom log to capture COVID -19 related 
symptoms daily  (Appendix B).  Patients will be asked to record their medication 
adherence, their temperature, and their oxygen saturation with a home O2 monitor every

 Vulnerable Populations:  
By [CONTACT_125929] -[ADDRESS_935029] additional characteristics that add 
to this vulnerability. Our criteria for inclusion and exclusion of each of these groups is 
summarized below, followed by o ur rationale and additional safeguards built into our study 
design. Our group has significant experience enrolling vulnerable patients in emergency care 
trials , and experience with a diverse population of potential participants in high stress situations.  
COVID -19 is disproportionately impacting low -income communities and persons of color, and 
these reasons are multifactorial. It is important to include individuals of diverse backgrounds in nightl y; even if fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism, it 
would be an insufficient dose to cause QTc 
prolongation or problematic side effects).  Risk Class 
C, monitor therapy.  
2. Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are 
unwilling to cut the medication by 2 0% (rationale: 
fluvoxamine modestly inhibits the metabolism of 
these drugs).  Risk Class C, monitor therapy  
3. Participants taking theophylline, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (drugs with a narrow therapeutic index 
that are primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097] 1A2, which is  
inhibited by [CONTACT_410953]) will be reviewed with a 
study investigator and excluded unless the 
investigator concludes that the risk to the participant 
is low (this would be unlikely; example: participant 
takes clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_689182] d 
it for the 1 4 days of the study).  
4. Patients will be advised that there is a small risk that 
the following substances  will be affected by 
[CONTACT_410953], but that significant effects are not likely 
at the low dose being used:  
1. caffeine, nicotine, melatonin . Risk Class 
C, monitor therapy  
5. Taking warfarin -also known as Coumadin , NSAIDs, 
and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  (rationale: increased risk of bleeding), 
phenytoin (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its  
metabolism), clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (rationale: fluvoxamine 
inhibits its metabolism from pro-drug to active drug 
which raises risk of cardiovascular events), and St 
John's wort (rationale: fluvoxamine + St John's wort 
are considered contraindicated because of the risk of 
serotonin syndrome)  Risk C, monitor therapy.

participating sites throughout the US based on sampling diverse populations throughout the US  
(i.e. areas serving primarily Black and La tinx populations) , areas where there are high incident 
rates, and areas with  experience d PI’s.  
6.3.1 Additional  Safeguards:  
● Non-English speakers: Excluding this group would compromise the principle of justice 
in clinical research. For groups likely to be enrol led given our known demographics (for 
example, Spanish -speaking and Somali -speaking), we will translate informed consent 
forms (ICF) and use professional interpreters during both the consent and follow -up 
periods. These interpreters are available to our gr oup during daytime hours by [CONTACT_756]. 
We will request the use of the Short Form Consent for non -English speaking participants, 
and adhere to the regulations surrounding its use.  When the translated ICFs become 
available, they will be used for non -English speakers.  We will make every effort to have 
Spanish -speaking research coordinators on our team and access to interpreter services.  
● Employees or students of the researcher: This group will be excluded.  
● Undervalued or disenfranchised social group:  We will a ssure confidentiality, that they 
have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the freedom to 
refuse to answer questions.   
● Active members of the military (service members), DoD personnel (including civilian 
employees):  The status of participants of this group is not asked during the study nor 
known by [CONTACT_464], and therefore vulnerability is not increased for anyone in this 
group.   
● Individual or group that is disadvantaged in the distribution of social goods and serv ices 
such as income, housing, or healthcare: We will assure that information from participants 
in this study will be treated with the strictest confidentiality, that participants have the 
right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the fre edom to refuse to 
answer questions.  When needed, every effort at making accommodations will be made 
for those who do not have a home address, such as medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up space in a local 
shelter or emergency department. If the potential participant needs a phone in order to 
comply with study needs, one will be provided for the duration of the individual’s 
enrollment.  
● Individual or group with a serious health condition for which there are no satisfactory 
standard treatments:  We will assure confidentiality, th at they have the right to withdraw 
at any time without penalty, and they have the freedom to refuse to answer questions. We 
will also employ the teach -back method to ensure participants understand risks and 
demands of study participation.   
● Individual or gr oup with a fear of negative consequences for not participating in the 
research (e.g. institutionalization, deportation, disclosure of stigmatizing behavior):  The 
status of participants from these groups is not asked during the study nor known by [CONTACT_38992], and that vulnerability is not increased for anyone in this group.  
 Number of Participants  
Enrollment will occur remotely via the previously described methods for interested participants 
presenting to one of the PCR -testing sites or via self -referral to t he study. Patients in assisted 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA

enrolled at each participati ng institution.    
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
 Sharing of results:  
Data collected within this study will be obtained from the participants themselves or will be 
obtained from the electronic medical record and thus are already available to the patient and 
treatment team.  Any testing of biospecimens will occur at a later t ime point and do  not have 
specific clinical relevance . Research results will be shared with the participant and/or the 
participant’s primary care provider when determined by [CONTACT_689235].  
 Sharing of genetic testing  
Not applicable. No genetic testing will be conducted  
8.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
 Withdrawal Circumstances:  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Participants may be 
withdrawn from the study without their consent if at any poin t they develop an exclusion criteria 
that makes it unsafe for them to continue in the study. All data from patients withdrawn from the 
study will be analyzed up until time of withdraw. Clinical progression after withdrawal may be 
assessed via EHR or vital status review or by [CONTACT_689236].  
 Withdrawal Procedures:   
If patients choose to withdraw, study procedures including intervention and follow -ups will stop. 
Given the remote nature of this study, written notification is not re quired. If the patient chooses 
to withdraw, the study team will ask if the patient is willing to allow continued electronic medical 
record evaluation for the determination of study endpoints (partial withdrawal). We will also ask 
if the patient wishes to w ithdraw consent for the use of future biologic specimens. If the patient 
declines to participate in any component of research, no further study data will be collected, 
biologic samples will be destroyed, but existing study data may be used. Each of these 
circumstances will be documented and stored as a study document.  
 Termination Procedures:  
Upon trial termination, study outcomes will be followed until completion. Case report forms and 
collection templates will be maintained in paper format (when applica ble) and electronically for 
7 years in accordance with regulations. Collected data will be used for secondary analyses with 
approval of the principal investigators in a deidentified fashion. Data entry will be completed, 
checked for accuracy, and locked for analysis within 1 year of enrollment of the final patient.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 49 Metformin: Metformin has been safely used since the 1920s, making it an appealing option for 
treatment in asymptomatic individuals .[ADDRESS_935032] common side effects are gastrointestinal ( GI), 
and typi[INVESTIGATOR_689183] 15% of patients ; GI side effects are minimized when  
metformin is  taken at the end of a meal (rather than at the beginning or “with” a meal) , and often 
subside after [ADDRESS_935033] common GI side effects are:  
 nausea, vomiting, stomach pain;  
 lose bowel movements  
 diarrhea  
We are not obtaining safety labs after starting the trial because we are not including patients on 
medications that increase risk for hy poglycemia (insulin and sulfonylureas), and the package 
insert recommends GFR monitoring only every 12 months, and monitoring B12 levels every 2 -
3 years in patients at risk for B12 deficiency, as participant s will not be taking study drug for 
more than 14 days.  
Fluvoxamine: Fluvoxamine has been safely used since  the 1980s.  The most common side effects 
are central nervous system and gastro -intestinal. About 10 to 30% of patients may experience 
headaches or insomnia, particularly at higher doses.  About 10 to 40% or patients may experience 
nausea or diarrhea , particularly at higher doses. The dose used in this trial is lower than the dose 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_689184].  
Ivermectin:  Ivermectin has been safely used since the 1980’s. Use dur ing infection with 
onchocerciasis is associated with more side effects, so persons with concomitant infection are 
excluded. In the absence of onchocerciasis, about 4% of persons will have tachycardia; 2% will 
have diarrhea/nausea; and 3% will have dizzines s. About 2% to 3% of persons will also have 
laboratory changes (changes in CBC or transaminase levels).  
See Metformin , Fluvoxamine, and Ivermectin  Packet Insert s for additional drug information and 
risks.  
 Mitigation of Risk:   
Metformin:  
 Elevated levels of NDMA have not been found in metformin IR, immediate release. We will 
only use immediate release metformin, not extended release.  
 In order to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis, we are excluding patients with advanced heart 
failure, live r failure, or renal failure, or known alcohol use disorder  
 We are requiring a baseline GFR in persons > age 75, or with history of heart, liver, or renal 
failure, within [ADDRESS_935034] a GFR > 45.  
 
Fluvoxam ine: 
 We are using a low dose of fluvoxamine with only [ADDRESS_935035] day.  
 
 Ivermectin:  
 While the range of acceptable and safe per kilo doses of ivermectin is large, we are using 
weight -based dosing.

All arms:  
 We will use careful screening of exclusion criteria so that participants are excluded from arms 
that may include a contraindication or medication interaction.   
 We are recommending that study drug  be taken at the end of a small meal, and  that patients 
abstain from alcohol use during the study period.  
 We are creating an upper age limit in order to reduce the likelihood of a patient experiencing 
reduce d GFR during the study period.  
 Patients will be advised to let their providers know that they are in a research study that 
involves metformin , ivermectin, or fluvoxamine , and thus that they should discontinue the 
study medication at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689185] a CT scan with contrast.  
 Every effort will be made to enter a Research No te into the electronic health record stating 
that the patient is in a double -blinded randomized trial of metformin, fluvoxamine, 
ivermectin, and placebo  with the study number and contact [CONTACT_689237] .  
 Reproduction Risks:  
While fluvoxamine and ivermectin may be used in pregnancy and have no known teratogenic 
effects, they have not been assessed in prospective randomized trials in pregnancy as often as 
metformin has.  Thus, we will close the randomization arms that include i vermectin or 
fluvoxamine to pregnant women. We will have a separate group of blinded study packs for 
pregnant and lactating women, so that study staff will know that pregnant and breastfeeding 
participants are getting only either metformin or placebo, but will remain blinded to whether they 
are receiving metformin or placebo. Additionally, because pregnant and lactating women will be 
considered their own sub -study in this trial, and an important sub -study, we will enroll 
pregnant/lactating women down to age  [ADDRESS_935036] transmission of the virus.

 COVID -related potential benefits of Fluvoxamine:  
10.2.1  Fluvoxamine has been shown in a phase 2 trial and prospective cohort, as well as in

 Covid -related potential b enefits of Fluvoxamine:  
10.3.1  A recent trial assessing a multi -therapy including 12mg one -time dose of ivermectin 
found a 75% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[ADDRESS_935037] showed 
significant increased chance of viral clearance after a 5 -day course of ivermectin.57   
 Other possible benefits:  
Metformin has been a ssociated with reduced incidence of blood clots, improved outcomes in 
some cancer, improved cholesterol, and improved insulin resistance, in patients with and without 
diabetes .7,9,10,83,84 
Metformin is commonly used as a chronic medication  for type 2 diabetes, pre -diabetes, and often 
off-label use for weight management, poly -cystic ovarian syndrome, and preventing anti-
psychotic related weigh t gain .80 
Additionally, 34.5% of adults in the US have prediabetes,85 and 90% of them have never been 
told about this diagnosis.86 Metformin is indicated for many persons with prediabetes, however 
only about 1% of persons w ith prediabetes have been prescribed metformin.87  
11.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
 Storage and Access:  
Study data will be recorded and retained within a University of Minnesota  REDCap  database  
with study personnel being granted access to the database based on need as listed in the 
Delegation of Authority log.  
The electronic consent (eConsent) forms will be maintained in a University of Minnesota 
REDCap  database .  
Biologic specimens intended for research beyond the study outcomes, provided by [CONTACT_1962] , may 
be processed by [CONTACT_689238]2+ laboratory and frozen at -80 C. Samples 
will be deidentified and labeled only with a patient ’s study ID number.  
Only authorized study team members will have access to data/specimens, expect as detailed in 
section 11.2.  
 Release/Sharing:  
Data will be shared among members of the study team with appropriate access based on study 
role, training, and delegation of author ity. Data will be made available to assigned study 
monitors, the data safety monitoring board, the appropriate University of Minnesota oversight

as required b y state and federal law.  
De-identified specimens and data may be shared  for future research . Requests will be evaluated 
on a case -by-case basis.  No data will be released without proof of IRB approval or determination. 
Agreements as required by [CONTACT_689239], including data use 
agreements and material transfer agreements.   
12.0 Statistical Considerations  
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be included as an appendix and developed by [CONTACT_689240]. The SAP may be amended as needed thereafter 
by [CONTACT_689241](s). All analyses will follow a modified  intention to treat (mITT) 
approach, excluding participants who were screen failures or who did not ingest any study drug, 
unless specified otherwise.  
 Randomization : 
Eligible and consenting participants who test positive will be enrolled and randomized eve nly 
among the arms for which they are eligible, i.e. 1:1:1:1:1:1 for participants who are eligible for 
all 6 arms. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_689242]. 
Stratum specific schedules will be preemptively generated us ing mass -weighted urn 
randomization with a total mass of α = 6, which is a generalization of randomly permuted blocks 
that reduces predictability of future assignments.[ADDRESS_935038] participants who 
were eligible for both drugs in the comparison/interaction.  
 Blinding : 
Study drug will be prepared by [CONTACT_689243]. Study personnel and 
participants will be blinded to participant assignments and outcomes data for the duration of the 
study, excepting lab data as detailed below and situations that require the blind to be b roken for 
safety reasons. These instances will be recorded and reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_43323].  An un -
blinded analysis of the laboratory outcomes from the treatment cohort sub -study will be carried 
out by [CONTACT_689244] d investigators and potential sponsors 
of the trial.  
 Sample Size Assumptions : 
The statistical design is for the comparison of metformin vs placebo, controlling for the effect 
of fluvoxamine  and ivermectin .  
 
Sample size estimates are based on a marginal t est of metformin versus placebo comparison, 
controlling for fluvoxamine and ivermectin use, and selected to provide at least 80% power with 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA   
08December2021

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 49 5% two -sided type I error rate for the target  effect  indicated by [CONTACT_689245] 12.3.1 . The sample size estimates are also inflated by 1 1% 
and rounded to account for interim analysis plan (see subsection 13.4) and study withdrawals.  
 
These considerations  result in a planned enrollment of 1,124 participants ( 187-188 in  each arm). 
Because these sample size calculations are based on marginal tests, the actual power may be 
higher when based on the planned tests using adjusted logistic regression models adjusted for 
various predictive factors as described later.  
Factorial design maximizes the use of placebo

12.3.1  Hypothesized Rates:  
We hypothesize that metformin  is superior to placebo for the primary endpoint 
controlling for possible use of fluvoxamine or ivermectin. Similarly, w e hypothesize that 
fluvoxamine is superior to placebo for the primary endpoint contro lling for possible use 
of metformin; and ivermectin is superior to placebo for the primary endpoint controlling 
for possible use of metformin . Let 𝜋𝑇 and 𝜋𝐶 denote the rate of the composite primary 
endpoint in the  treatment and control  groups, respecti vely. We will evaluate the following 
hypotheses:  
𝐻0: 𝜋𝑇≥𝜋𝐶 versus 𝐻𝐴: 𝜋𝑇<𝜋𝐶 
The hypothesized marginal rate of the primary endpoint  under placebo  is 20%.89 The 
expected event rate for the primary outcome in the single medication treatment a rms is 
11% which corresponds to a relative risk reduction of 45%. To detect this effect with 80% 
power using a marginal test with 5% two -sided type I error requires 337 participants in 
each comparison group . To account for effects of other drugs used in combi nation, which 
may reduce the event rate of the control group, for the interim analysis plan , and for losses 
to follow -up, we plan to enroll 1,124 participants  in total .    
 
Prespecified analyses:  
A detailed SAP will be submitted to the DSMB and updated if  needed prior to analyses. 
The primary efficacy analysis for each study drug, metformin, fluvoxamine, and 
ivermectin, will be based on a logistic regression model with a main effect for the relevant 
drug controlling for study site, and use of the other stu dy drugs. In particular, no 
interaction effects will be included in this analysis. Prespecified subgroup analyses

 DSMB Monitoring Guidelines:  
Safety, efficacy and futility will be monitored for both cohorts by [CONTACT_689247]  (more 
info below) . Timing of analyses will be with respect to information time defined as the proportion 
of participants who have completed the primary endpoint follow -up interval relative to the 
planned sample size. Interim analyses will incl ude all participants who have been followed for 
specified window so as to exclude participants with possibly yet to be determined outcome status 
and thereby [CONTACT_689248]. Safety data will be 
reviewed regul arly by [CONTACT_4318]. The first interim analysis of efficacy data (Stage 1) will focus 
on safety and feasibility, while still allowing early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303]. Subsequent interim 
analyses of efficacy data (Stage 2) will focus on efficacy, futility and any ongoing safety or 
feasibility concerns.   
12.4.1  Safety Monitoring:  
Safety monitoring will be undertaken for each agent and combination. Regular reports 
will be provided to the DSMB at a mutually agreeable interval with an evaluation of 
safety outcomes that focus  on comparisons of the frequency of deaths, SAEs and grade 4 
events between the active treatment  arms and placebo arm irrespective of attribution to 
study drug . Proportions and 95% exact confidence intervals will be used to summarize 
the results  with uncon ditional exact tests and corresponding exact intervals to evaluate 
differences . Cumulative counts of adverse reactions and numbers of participants 
experiences and adverse reaction will be reported and compared similarly. Further safety 
assessments may be c onsidered as demanded by [CONTACT_689249]. The purpose of these 
reports is to catch any unexpected severe adverse reactions to metformin in the study 
populations.  Formal statistical comparisons of safety endpoints using p -values will be 
undertaken at the r equest of the DSMB, and will otherwise not be reported.

control. Efficacy monitoring boundaries will be based on a Kim and DeMets alpha -
spending fun ction that mimics O’Brien -Fleming boundaries (parameter value of 3). This 
upper boundary controls one -sided type I error at 2.5%, and will be modified according 
to the information fractions at the time of the actual analyses (defined by [CONTACT_689250] / maximum sample size). The monitoring boundaries that will be 
provided to the DSMB for each cohort are reported in Table 2 and updated based on the 
actual sample size(s) available at the time of each analysis. The lower futility boundary 
will be treated as non -binding and supplemented with conditional power calculations in 
conjunction with the DSMB. This futility boundary is based on a Kim and DeMets beta 
spending function with a parameter value of 1.5. The lower Haybittle -Peto boundary for 
harm of -2.5 with 50% or less of the planned enrollment and -2.0 otherwise will be 
considered binding, though harm will be assessed in conjunction with safety data and 
may be declared by [CONTACT_689251][INVESTIGATOR_689187]. (Monitoring boundary calculations have been and will be 
carried out using the gsDesign package in R version 3.6.1 or newer.)  
Following the sample size re -estimation procedure, the upper efficacy boundary will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_689252] I error rate in proportion to the specified Kim 
and DeMets alpha -spending function where the information fraction is calculated  with 
respect to the updated sample size. This approach corrects for over -spending alpha 
relative to the revised sample size and controls the overall one -sided type I error rate at 
the intended 2.5% level (or equivalently the two -sided 5% level).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 49 follow a modified intent to treat (mITT) principle, excluding participants who were post -
randomization screen failures and who did not ingest any study drug. Formal comparisons will 
use 2 -sided tests with a 5% significance level.  
Descriptive statistics will be reported for baseline covariate information. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using mean and standard deviations, as well as median and interquartile 
range for skewed variables. Binary and categori cal variables will be summarized using counts 
and percentages. Differences in important prognostic variables will be monitored visually with 
formal statistical testing undertaken only at the request of the DSMB.  
Each study drug version control comparison will be separate. Each control group will consist of 
the participants who were eligible to receive the study drug but were assigned to a relevant 
placebo control arm instead. The metformin comparison will control for fluvoxamine and 
ivermectin use, and the  fluvoxamine and ivermectin versus control comparisons will each control 
for metformin use. Primary hypotheses will be evaluated using logistic regression with a main 
effect for the relevant drug adjusted for study site and use of the other study drugs. Th e statistical 
significance of the main effect will be evaluated using a likelihood ratio test with interim 
monitoring boundaries specified above.  
A secondary analysis for each study drug versus control comparison will control for age and BMI 
as well. Metf ormin effect heterogeneity with respect to biologic sex will be assessed in both 
cohorts though a logistic regression model with an interaction term, as well as separate logistic 
regression models fit to the data from males and females. During interim anal yses, some 
participants will not have been followed adequately long for inclusion in the primary analysis. 
As a secondary analysis, marginal cumulative incidence rates in each arm at the specified follow -
up interval will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier  method by [CONTACT_689255] -up who have yet to experience the primary endpoint at their point of last study contact.   
Laboratory outcomes, which are continuous longitudinally measured outcome, will be evaluated 
using generalized estim ating equations with a treatment effect and adjustments for the 
corresponding outcome at baseline.  
Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using generalized linear models with an appropriate 
distributional assumption and/or normalizing transformations. These a nalyses will adjust for 
study site and other prognostic information as appropriate. Time -to-event outcomes will be 
compared using Kaplan -Meier and log -rank tests as well as Cox proportional hazards models 
that adjust for prognostic variables. Ordinal endpo ints will be analyzed using proportional odds 
regression models that adjust for prognostic variables and supplemented by [CONTACT_689256]. These analyses will be supplemented by [CONTACT_689257] h ordinal category by [CONTACT_1570].  Detailed plans for primary,

13.0 Safety  
 Adverse Ev ent (AE)   
At every study visit, participants will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any 
medically related changes in their  well-being. They will also be asked if they have been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or c hanged  concomitant medication 
regimens (both prescription and OTC medications).  
An AE is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience that develops or worsens in severity during 
the course of the study but does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study 
agent/intervention or procedures. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the 
participant is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be reco rded as an AE . 
A clinical trial adverse event is defined as any untoward medical event associated with the use 
of a drug or study procedure. Non -serious adverse events will be collected during the period from 
enrollment (randomization) through the period o n study drug, day 14. Any adverse event that is 
being collected as an expected Covid outcome by [CONTACT_689261], or an expected side effect being collected by [CONTACT_689262], will 
only be recorded in tho se eCRF’s and not additionally recorded in an adverse event eCRF . They 
will be reported to the DSMB at interim analyses.  
Any adverse event that is not captured in the Covid Daily Symptom Log questions, Side Effect 
Survey, or Clinical Outcomes assessments w ill be recorded as an adverse event and reported to 
the DSMB at interim analyses. AE’s will not be followed to resolution unless worsening during 
the course of the trial.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious adverse events will be collected from enrollment  through day 14 and 28.  Investigators 
will determine if the event is serious or related to the study drug.

 Assessment of Safety  
Scale used  to Grade Severity of Adverse Events . Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunt eers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials 
https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download ). The scale provides a grading severity scale for 
AEs with unique clinical descriptions of severity based on this general guidance , and for this 
study an ED visit (without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is considered Grade 3, not Grade 4 ( a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689189] 4 ).  
 Investigator Assessment of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will evaluate all SAEs with respect to Seriousness  and Causality  (relationship 
to study agent a nd relationship to research) as defined below.  
 Causality  
The likelihood that the SAE is related to the study agent will be assessed by [CONTACT_689263]. Due to the severity of COVID -19 illness further 
detailed break down will not occur:  
 Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory 
test result, occurs in a plausible time relati onship to study agent/intervention administration 
and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to 
withdrawal of the study agent/intervention (de -challenge) should be clinically plausible. The 
event must be pharmac ologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory 
re-challenge procedure if necessary.  
 Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including  an abnormal laboratory test result, 
occurs within a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study agent/intervention, 
is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA   
08December2021  
COVID -OUT (formerly called MET -COVID) (MET29324)  VERSION 3. 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 49 clinically reasonable response on  withdrawal (de -challenge). Re -challenge information is not 
required to fulfill this definition.  
 Possibly Related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). Although an adverse drug event may rate only as 
“possible” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as  requiring more information and later be 
upgraded to probable or certain as appropriate.  
 Unlikely : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to study agent/intervention administration makes a causal relatio nship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, othe r concomitant treatments).  
 Not related : The AE is completely independent of study agent/intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be 
an alternative, definitive etiology document ed by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities : 
13.6.[ADDRESS_935044] be reported on the Serious Adverse Event case report form (SAE CRF) 
within [ADDRESS_935045] be reported within 5 
business days of site awareness. The safety medical monitor will review all SAEs and 
determine the expectedness of each SAE.  
13.6.2  Unanticipated Problems  
An Unanticipated Problem is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that is  
  unexpected in terms of natu re, severity, or frequency in relation to  
o the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Package Insert,  or other study documents;  
o the characteristics of the subject population being studied (pers ons with COVID -
19); and  
 possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and  
 places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
  
Unanticipated Problems will be reported in the study database. Unanticipated problems 
may include problems with protocol implementation, participant safety, and/or concerns 
regarding informed consent.   Initial reports must be submitted within  7 calendar days of 
site awareness of the event.

The first data monitoring visit will be scheduled within an appropriate time after the first subject 
is enrolled, with subsequent visits thereafter at designated t ime intervals. Monitors will evaluate 
study team members  to ensure access is consistent with training and delegation of authority logs.  
Sites will maintain binders  (either paper or electronic)  containing pertinent documents and 
information including IRB a pproval letters, documentation of GCP training, licenses, human 
subjects research ethics training certificates, curriculum vitae, and correspondence.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been convened and includes individuals meeting 
the key element criteria below, it includes a biostatistician with prior clinical trials experience. 
The DSMB will follow the guidance as outlined in the application a nd the DSMB charter unless 
there is a compelling, unanticipated reason to deviate from these rules. Data regarding the 
primary outcome will be reported to the DSMB at weekly  intervals  or according to the frequency 
decided by [CONTACT_4318] . The DSMB may recommen d stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_125893], 
following these guidelines:

Efficacy monitoring will be monitored in accordance  to the guidelines in Section 12 .4.2.  
The DSMB will operate in accordance wit h guidelines established by [CONTACT_34033] “Guidance for 
Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring 
Committee” jointly published by [CONTACT_541848], CDER and CDRH of the FDA 
(https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -information/search -fda-guidance -documents/establishment -
and-operation -clinical -trial-data-monitoring -committees ). The key elements include:  
1. Expertise and independence: The members must have expertise in the area of study, not 
be study authors and have no financial conflict of interest.  
2. Members will sign a confidentiality agreement.  
3. It is preferred that the  DSMB have a face -to-face initial meeting, but can meet by 
[CONTACT_541849].  
4. All meetings must follow standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
If the DSMB recommends closure of the study, then the DSMB Chair will email the principal 
invest igator who will notify the  IRB. If the trial is stopped for patient safety and a repairable 
cause of unacceptably high adverse events can be identified, the action must be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_125947]. For example,  if one additional 
exclusion criterion is discovered that would account for the majority of unexpected events, this 
new exclusion criterion could be added, and the study could proceed.  
 Data Security:  
All standard confidentiality procedures will be observe d for this study. Research staff will be 
trained on protocol and GCP standards before they will be allowed contact [CONTACT_689264]. All data will be stored in a secure HIPAA compliant  manner. No indefinable data will be 
stored on individual research computers  or flash drives.

PLEASE READ:  This online application is for projects that will be reviewed by [CONTACT_152626]-
board review process.  The criteria for expedited review are listed below. Review and check what expedite
criteria is/are appropriate for your project. NOTE:  If your research involves or may involve greater than minimal
risk, an element of deception, or is FDA-regulated research, do NOT check any of the expedited criteria listed
below.  Your protocol will then be reviewed by [CONTACT_152627]-board at their next regularly scheduled meeting.  If your
project meets the exempt criteria, please submit your exempt application via email to:
[EMAIL_3134].  Information regarding exempt applications can be found here:
http://ricro.colostate.edu/IRB/ExemptReview.html
 
  Expedite Criteria:
 
1. Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met.
 
a)  Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 31,32) is
not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or
decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible
for expedited review.)
 
b)  Research on medical devices for which                                                                                       
                             
 
      i)  An investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or
      ii)  The medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in
accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.
 
2. Collection of blood samples by [CONTACT_25877], heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows:
 
a)  From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the
amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8- week period and collection may not occur
more frequently than 2 times per week; or
 
b)  From other adults and children, considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the
collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, and the frequency with which it will
be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3
ml per kg in an 8-week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per
week.
 
3. Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by [CONTACT_105]-invasive means.
 
4. Collection of data through non-invasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation)
routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x-rays or microwaves. Where
medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited
review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.)
 
Examples:
a)  Physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not
involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject's
privacy;
b)  Weighing or testing sensory acuity;                                                                                              
           
c)  Magnetic resonance imaging;                                                                                                      
     
d)  Electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring
Page 8 of 25
 radioactivity, electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow,
and echocardiography;
e)  Moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility
testing where appropriate given the age, weight, and health of the individual.
 
5. Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected, or
will be collected solely for nonresearch purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis). (NOTE:
Some research in this paragraph may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of
human subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b)(4). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)
 
6. Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.
 
7. Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior(including, but not limited to, research on
perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and
social behavior) or research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program
evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies. (NOTE: Some research in
this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. 45 CFR
46.101(b)(2) and (b)(3). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)

Original Protocol Number (e.g., 07-226H)
    Title (Please indicate if the protocol title is different from the proposal title)
Medical marijuana and its effects on motor function in people with Multiple Sclerosis: An observational
case-control study.
 
      Complete Sections 1 - 16. Specify N/A as appropriate. Do not leave any required sections blank.
1. Purpose of the study
a) Provide a brief lay summary of the project in <200 words.  The lay summary should be readily
understandable to the general public, and is, for example, what would be released to a newspaper if
requested.
Medical marijuana is commonly prescribed people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for symptom, e.g. spasticity
and pain, management. Unfortunately not much is known about its effects outside the treatment for these [ADDRESS_353354] lower
levels of physical disability and improved walking abilities. A major limitation of these previous studies is
that the investigators used subjective measures of motor function. In this proposed observational case-
control study we plan to objectively measure multiple domains of motor function, such as: fatigue, strength,
and walking ability in people with MS who are smoking medical marijuana.. No marijuana will be brought
on to campus or given to participants. After an online screening and initial phone interview cases (medical
marijuana users (smokers)) and controls (non-users) will perform a battery of clinical testing over the
course of 3 sessions spread across a 3 week period. Participants will use a log to track their medical
marijuana use, which was identified as an area that needed more investigation during the NIH’s
symposium on marijuana and cannabinoids held at the NIH campus 22 and 23 March, 2016.
 
b) What does the Investigator(s) hope to learn from the study?
We expect to identify alterations in motor performance between medical marijuana users (smokers) and
non-user who have MS. This line of inquiry will open up future research avenues into the long term
benefits and consequences of chronic medical marijuana usage for the treatment of physical impairments
in people with MS. We also hope to begin the formation of preliminary usage guidelines for people with MS
contemplating using medical marijuana for symptom management.
We hope to determine how regular cannabis use alters resting brain activity in people with MS.

must be attached in section #16 - Attachment section.)
 
a) In lay language, describe all the procedures, from screening through end-of-study, that the human subject
must undergo in the research project, including study visits, drug treatments, randomization and the
procedures that are part of standard of care.  Please note: Do NOT respond "See Attachment Section." If
you would like to add tables, charts, etc., attach those files in the Attachment section (#16).
Prospective participants will be recruited from the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory’s (INPL)
participant database, the clinical practice of [CONTACT_152673], Banner Health, Greeley CO, and through
advertisements in the Colorado and Wyoming Chapter of the National MS Society newsletters. All
experimental procedures will be performed in the INPL (Director: Thorsten Rudroff, PhD, FACSM).
Interested individuals will perform an initial screening via an online questionnaire, hosted by [CONTACT_38385],
which has a contract with the College of Health and Human Sciences. Contact [CONTACT_152628]’ information will be accessible only to the research staff according to HIPPA
regulations. After completion of the online screening form, INPL personal will contact [CONTACT_289658] 20 case/control matched pairs, [ADDRESS_353355] staff will schedule the participants’ first visit. Eligibility requirements for this study are:
medically diagnosed with MS, 30-75 years of age, Moderate disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps
score 2-6). Cases will verbally confirm their usage of medical marijuana before matching is conducted. We
will only recruit people with MS who smoke medical marijuana. Exclusion criteria include: relapse with the
last 60 days; high risk for cardiovascular disease (American College of Sports Medicine risk classification);
changes in disease modifying medications within the last 45 days; concurrent neurological/neuromuscular
disease, concurrent conditions unrelated to MS that would exacerbate fatigue (anemia, hypothyroidism,
shiftwork-related fatigue, B12 deficiency, major sleep disorder, or major depressive disorder); history of
traumatic brain injury, seizure disorders, hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury; diabetes; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289654] 90 days; alcohol dependence (>2 drinks per day); present history (last six months) of drug
abuse; and inability to understand/sign informed consent. Additional participants may be screened and
recruited if problems arise within a matched pair, e.g. participants drop out or are unable to meet time
commitments.
Medical Marijuana users will be asked to refrain from using cannabis for 8 hours prior to all testing and
training to prevent any behavioral/physiological effects of acute intoxication which result from THC.
The experimental protocol for this study consists of three testing sessions.
Session 1
Upon arrival to the Integrative Neurophysiology Lab (INPL) at CSU the investigators will explain the
protocol procedures and receive signed informed consent from the participants. After consent a urinalysis
assessment for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) will be performed to confirm case/control status. Next
participants will complete several questionnaires: Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale,
Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), the MS Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54
Instrument, the MOS Pain Effects Scale (PES), and the Numeric Rating Scale of Spasticity (NRS). After
the questionnaires are complete the participants will undergo a resting metabolic rate (RMR) test. For the
RMR participants will be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_73414] [ADDRESS_353356]. During this visit participants will
perform the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), which consists of a [ADDRESS_353357] (25FWT), the [ADDRESS_353358] (9HPT), and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). For the 25FWT participants will be
asked to walk [ADDRESS_353359] staff will walk alongside the participants to minimize the risk of falling. Next the 9HPT will be
performed. Participants will begin w/ their dominant hand and quickly move [ADDRESS_353360] moderator. (Previously performed in
IRB# 14-5152H)
After the MSFC is concluded participants will rest for at least [ADDRESS_353361] of sensory interaction on balance (mCTSIB).
For this test participants will be asked to stand with their feet together with no shoes on. They will stand
quietly in this position for 30 sec under 4 conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, eyes open on a foam pad,
and eyes closed on a foam pad. At the conclusion of balance testing participants will rest in a seated
position for at least [ADDRESS_353362] will be given/demonstrated.
After balance assessment strength testing of the right and left legs will be performed. Participants will
perform strength testing in a seated position with their knee and hip joints at 90 degrees of flexion. A linear
force transducer will be attached to the participant’s ankle. Once the participant is in the proper position
they will be instructed to perform a series of isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). Participants
will be instructed to increase the force of the knee extensors over a period of [ADDRESS_353363]. Once the participants’ MVC no longer increases in force the investigators will unstrap the person’s leg
and test the other side. (Previously performed in IRB# 14-5152H)
The next procedure to be performed will be the [ADDRESS_353364] (6MWT). For this test participants will be
asked to walk as far as they can in [ADDRESS_353365] participants will be asked their rating of perceived exertion (RPE, 0-10
scale).
Session [ADDRESS_353366] visit for both the left and right quadriceps. Three MVC will
be performed to verify strength tested during visit 2. Participants will perform 2 trials at 3 different force
levels (5, 25, and 50% MVC), in a randomized order, holding each force level for [ADDRESS_353367] will be given between each trial. Tests will be performed on the right and left legs. Surface
electromyography will be performed on the muscles of the quadriceps femoris and hamstrings (vastus
lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris). Visual feedback will be provided to the
participants on a computer monitor positioned at eye level approximately [ADDRESS_353368] performed will be the timed-up-and-go (TUG), which consists of rising from a chair, walking [ADDRESS_353369] approximately 2 hours
 
b) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project.
The goal of this project is to determine how medical marijuana affects aspects of motor performance in
people with MS. Therefore all clinical testing needs to be performed in the patient population that is being
studied.
 
c) Alternative Procedures. If the proposed study is a clinical trial of a drug, vaccine, device or treatment,
describe alternative procedures, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. Describe the important
potential risks and benefits associated with the alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment. Any
standard treatment that is being withheld must be disclosed. This information must be included in the
consent form.

3. Background
a) Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of the study, if applicable.
Several participants in our previous study investigating the predictors of physical activity in patients with
MS were using cannabis products. When these individuals were compared to matched individuals they
seemed to perform better on the tests measuring motor function. From this initial data, only 4 cannabis
users, we became interested in determining if medical marijuana would improve physical function and
fatigue in people with MS. Currently we are performing an anonymous online survey hosted through the
Qualtrics website investigating cannabis use in people with neurological disorders (CSU IRB# 126-16H ).
To date, over [ADDRESS_353370] taken this survey, with approximately 40% stating they currently use
cannabis based products for symptom management.
 
b) Describe any animal experimentation and findings leading to the formulation of the study, if applicable.

device which you have to squeeze alternately with your left and right hand up to 
five times.  
- Physical Activity:  At the end of the first session, you will be introduced to the 
ActiGraph device, which will measure physical activity.  You will be asked to wear this device on your waist  for a period of seven days (five week days and two 
weekend days). You can remove the ActiGraph at night.  You will be asked to 
return the ActiGraph at your second experimental session, which will be at least seven days after the first session.   Furthermore, you will receive a log to track 
their wear time.

- MS Functional Composite : This is a series of [ADDRESS_353384] you add (+) a series of numbers spoken on a computer.  
- Balance test:  In this test you will stand on a platform with your feet next to each 
other. You will stand quietly for 30 seconds in 4 different conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, eyes open on a foam pad, and eyes closed on a foam pad.  
- Leg Strength:  The maximal strength of each leg will be measured by [CONTACT_152643] a series of maximal effort knee extension, knee flexion, plantar/dorsi -
flexion trials.  This will be performed one leg at a time up to five times.  
- [ADDRESS_353385]:  The object of this test is to walk  as far as possible for [ADDRESS_353386] of the following tests:  
- Force Steadiness : For this test you will produce a submaximal force, 5%, 25% 
and 50% of your maximum strength, of your thigh muscles and hold for a period of [ADDRESS_353387] 4 stickers on your muscles designed to measure the electrical activity of your muscles while they are contracting.  
- Timed -Up-and-Go: For this test we will record the time it takes you to rise from a 
chair, walk [ADDRESS_353388] approximately 120- 180 minutes.

ARE THERE REASONS WHY I SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You should not take part in this study if:  
 
• A relap se of disease sym ptoms i n the last 60 days  
• A condition unrelat ed to M S that would exacerbate fatigue , such as  
anemi a, hypothyroidism , shiftwork-related f atigue, B12 deficiency , 
major slee p disorder, o r maj or depr essive disorder  
• Medi cal d iagnosis or conditi on that  makes participating i n exercise 
training dangerous , such  as major renal , pulmonary, hep atic, cardi ac, 
gastrointestin al, HIV , cancer (other than treated basal cell cancer) , other 
neurologi cal d isorders, or pregna ncy 
• History of heart attack or current diagnosis of cardiovascular disease 
• History of seiz ure di sorders (or on medications know n to 
lower seizure threshold), hydrocephal us (buildup of fluid in 
the brain) , or diabetes 
• Alcoh o l d ependen ce or abuse (>2 drinks/day) , or present  history 
(last six months) of dru g abuse 
• History of significan t traumatic brain injury or hydrocep halus 
• Pregnancy  
• Recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (withi n the last 3 months) or enf orced bed    
   rest/sede ntary stat e. 
 
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential, but unknown, risks. 
  
Risks of Performing Motor Tasks  
 Generally, the procedures outlined for measuring force and muscle activity during the 
motor tasks are safe.  Nevertheless, there is potential for injury  (muscle strain), resulting 
from the maximal contractions.   There is a 0.01% chance of death (in people who have 
heart problems), a 0.02% risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require you to go the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in people with heart problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in blood pressure.  
 All contractions are voluntary and you can stop immediately if they experience any slight 
pain or discomfort.  Following participation, you may experience some muscle soreness.  
Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not exercised recently.  Other risk factors may include increased feelings of anxiety and/or stress induced by [CONTACT_152644], which can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood 
pressure.   The electrodes that will be used to measure muscle activity could potentially

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential, but unknown, risks. 
 
Risks of Performing Motor Tasks  
 Generally, the procedures outlined for measuring force and muscle activity during the motor tasks are safe.  Nevertheless, there is potential for injury  (muscle strain), resulting 
from the maximal contractions.   There is a 0.01% chance of death (in people who have 
heart problems), a 0.02% risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require you to go the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in people with heart problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in blood pressure.  
 All contractions are voluntary and you can stop immediately if they experience any slight 
pain or discomfort.  Following participation, you may experience some muscle soreness.  
Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not exercised recently.  Other risk factors may inc lude increased feelings of anxiety and/or stress 
induced by [CONTACT_152644], which can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.   The electrodes that will be used to measure muscle activity could potentially 
cause skin irritation after removal.  Furthermore, your skin will need to be shaved prior 
to placing the electrodes, which can also cause irritation.

were calculated between demographic variables (age, height, weight, BMI, disease duration) and whole 
brain SUV to identify possible covariates for the SPM analysis. Significant factors were individually 
tested as covariates during SPM analysis.  
 
Demographic, clinical, and extracted regional SUV variables were compared between the two 
groups using unpaired student’s t- tests. If a clinical variable differed between the two groups a Pearson’s 
correlation was performed with it and regional SUVs. Cohen’s D measures of effect size were calculated 
for the regional SUVs. Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 24 (IBM 
Corp., NY, [LOCATION_003]) with alpha set to 0.05.

Formulation   
 
 
Analgesic Medication  Fentanyl will be administered as an analgesic pretreatment at a dose of 25-50 µg, 
immediately prior to administration of the initial dose of the study medication. (with 
suitable dose reductions at the investigator’s discretion for elderly and debilitated 
patients ) Top-up doses of fentanyl of [ADDRESS_1083326] ( eg naloxone) should be immediately available at  the site.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_787397] (if nasal route is used), nasopharynx and oropharynx with 3 mL of 2% 
lidocaine. In addition, lidocaine 2% gel may be applied to the nasal p assages for ease 
in inserting the bronchoscope if the nasal route is used.  
Rescue Medication  After determination of treatment failure, only midazolam may be administered as  
rescue sedation , according to local practice , in order to perform the bronchoscopy . 
Other sedatives are not allowed in this study.  
The benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787398].  
In situations where the investigator considers the use of reversal age nts as necessary,  
naloxon e should be considered in cases where the initial dose of flumazenil has not 
provided the anticipated effect.  
Investigational and 
Reference Product  In order to maintain the study blind, drug preparation will be performed by [CONTACT_787454], and the final material will be provided to the 
investigational staff in a blinded manner.  
Study Treatment Plan  If the fluid status allows, patients will receive a up to 1000  mL 0.9% NaCl solution 
bolus prior to fentanyl administration  followed by a  normal saline infusion  during the 
procedure at a rate of 50  mL/hr . The administration of supplemental oxygen 4  L/min 
will be gin shortly before the procedure and will continue until the patient is fully alert.  
Immediately prior  to the first dose of study medication , the patients will receive 25-
50 µg of fentanyl  (with suitable dose reductions at the investigator’s discretion for 
elderly and debilitated patients ). 
Patients will be randomized to manually receive in a blinded fashi on an initial single 
intravenous ( iv) dose over one minute of remimazolam or  placebo or over 2 minutes of  
midazolam in the open -label arm at the following dose level s: 
Study Drug  Initial Dose  Top-up n 
Remimazolam  5.0 mg  2.5 mg  300 
Placebo  - - 60 
Midazol am 1.75 mg*  
1.0 mg§ 1.0 mg*  
0.5mg§ 60 
*Healthy adults <60  yrs; §adults  ≥60 yrs, debilitated or chronically ill patients . 
Sedation initiation:   
 Remimazolam or placebo group:  After the initial dose, further doses may be 
applied at least two minutes apart, until adequate sedation is achieved  
 Midazolam group:  After the initial dose, further doses may be applied at least two 99

PAION Confidential Page 10 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 minutes apart, until adequate sedation is achieved.  
When adequate sedation for scope insertion has been achieved (MOAA/S ≤3) a  
flexible  bronchoscope will be inserted after prior nasopharyngeal 2% lidocaine s pray 
and the procedure will be performed according to the usual clinical practice.  
Sedation maintenance:  
Remimazolam or placebo group:  Subsequent doses of study drug will be administered  
over [ADDRESS_1083327] two minutes apart, t o maintain the sedat ion (MOAA/S ≤4) as 
needed. The total number  of do ses of study drug throughout the procedure is  not 
limited, as long as no more than  5 doses  are administered  within a ny 15 min ute 
window . 
Midazolam group:  Subsequent  doses will be administered over two minutes, at least 
two minutes apart, to maintain the sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) as needed. The total number  
of doses of midazolam throughout the procedure is  not limited, as long as no more than 
3 doses are administered  within any 12 minute  window.   
If adequate sedat ion cannot be achieved at the beginning or maintained throughout the 
bronchoscopy using the initial dose plus the maximum allowed number of top -ups 
within any 15 minute window (12 minutes for midazolam), this will be defined as 
treatment failure. After suc h determination, rescue medication ( ie midazolam) will be 
administered in such cases according to local practice in order to start or finalize the 
bronchoscopy . 
Patients will be continuously monitored for early signs of hypoventilation, airway
obstruction , or apnea, and interventions must be conducted early enough in order
to maintain homeostasis and vital signs as close as normal for the patient as
possible.
Flumazenil as a reversal agent for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787399], if required.
Bronchoscopy  The bronchoscopy procedure will be performed using a flexible device according to 
standard practice at the site . All findings from bronchoscopy will be documented, but 
will not be defined as Adverse Events (AEs).  
Assessment of Efficacy  The primary efficacy endpoint  will be the successful completion of the procedure .
Efficacy will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_787455], time to fully alert,
Assessment of Safety  Physical examination .
Venous blood samples will be collected for routine safety evaluation o f
biochemistry and hematology .
Vital signs ( body temperature, heart rate , systol ic and diastolic bloo d pressure  and
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured throughout the study.
Oxygen saturation will be measured throughout the study.100

Statistics  Efficacy and safety analysi s: 
For t he primary efficacy analsysis t he following hypothesis will be tested:  
H0: π Remi ≤ π PLA vs. H1: π Remi > π PLA, 
where π Remi and π PLA denote the success rates for remimazolam and placebo, 
respectively. The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of  these success 
rates between the remimazolam and placebo groups, using the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test to account for the actual fentanyl , benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787401] . 
Secondary efficacy analys es: 
Descriptive testing wi ll be perfor med on the  secondary efficacy parameters .
Pairwise c omparisons for these endpoints will be performed between  the
midazolam vs remimazolam groups and between the placebo vs. remimazolam
group s, in contrast to the primary endpoint , where the midazolam group serves as
an internal validation of the sedation assessment only.

 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Backgrou
nd and Rationale 
Patients underg
oing uncomfortable medical procedures of limited duration generally require 
some form of sedation and/or analgesia in order to minimize their discomfort and thereby [CONTACT_787458]. Currently, either a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (sometimes in combination 
with a narcotic) or propofol is primarily used to obtain sedation for such procedures1-5. Among 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], midazolam is the most commonly used agent. While both propofol and 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787404], each agent has 
disadvantages6, 7. 
 
Propofol is an intravenous ( iv) sedative/hypnotic agent with excellent sedative properties8. A 
second advantage is its extremely short half-life (t½), 9,10 which allows rapid recovery from 
sedation. 
 
A disadvantage of propofol or of fospropofol12,13,14, its pro drug, is due to its potential for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_787405]11, thus requiring constant monitoring of patient’s vital 
signs and respi[INVESTIGATOR_787406]. Consequently, a second physician or a nurse must be present to 
monitor the patient while the prim
ary physician performs the procedure. 
 
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787407]15 with a lower likelihood for respi[INVESTIGATOR_787408], thus these drugs require less intensive vital sign monitoring than in 
case of propofol. 
 
Their main disadvantage 
is their long half life, eg even midazolam, the shortest acting 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_719783] a half-life of approximately one to three hours17. 
 
Remimazolam, with a 
considerably shorter half-life than even midazolam should combine the

Remimazolam18,1

7.[ADDRESS_1083334] shown that treatment with flumazenil reverses loss of 
righting reflex (LRR) induced by [CONTACT_787459]21. In addition, during the dog maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) study, flumazenil was administered to a dog suffering from paradoxical 
excitation following administration of remimazolam, and the animal recovered within minutes22. 
The efficacy of flumazenil as an antidote to remimazolam in humans has been shown in part A 
of the phase Ib study (CNS7056-002)23, in which flumazenil or placebo have been applied to 
subjects after a
dministration of 0.25 mg/kg of remimazolam. While the median time to fully alert 
was 16.8 minutes after 
the administration of placebo, the time was shortened to 1.8 minutes after 
the administration of flumazenil. 
These data indicate that flumazenil is likely to be a suitable antidote to remimazolam in the case 
of accidental overdose and should be able to reverse the effects of remimazolam. Flumazenil will 
be immediately available on-site for use at the investigator’s discretion. In situations where the 
investigator considers the use of reversal agents as necessary, naloxone should be considered in 
cases where the initial dose of flumazenil has not provided the anticipated effect. Naloxone will 
also be available on-site for immediate us e. 
Skilled personnel not participating in the procedure will provide for continuous monitoring of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_751568], i.e., pulse oximetry. Additionally, supervision by a person 
trained in Advanced Cardiac Life Support will be ensured to stay with the patient until the 
patient has recovered consciousness and has normal cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. 
Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for 
bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in 
airway management will be ensured. 111

In the first- in-man, double-blind, placebo- and midazolam-controlled Phase I study, 81 subjects 
received a bolus dose of 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg of remimazolam, a dose of 0.075 mg/kg of 
midazolam, or placebo24,

03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 Remimazolam demonstrated the expected rapid onset and a quicker offset of sedation as 
compared to midazolam. Onset of sedation was within one to two minutes following bolus 
administration at sedative doses starting from 0.05 mg/kg. Depth and duration of sedation 
appeared to be sufficient at doses of 0.075 to 0.20 mg/kg to allow for a short-term procedure 
such as upper gastrointe
stinal (GI) endoscopy. Recovery from adequate sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) 
was rapid (about ten mi
nutes) compared with midazolam (about 40 minutes). Higher doses of 
remimazolam (up to 0.30 mg/kg) appeared to safely induce loss of consciousness. 
There were minim
al changes in oxygen saturation, even at doses that led to loss of 
consciousness. Airway patency was maintained throughout the study with no requirement for 
mechanical intervention. Vital signs remained stable throughout; there were no reports of hyper- 
or hypotension. The most commonly reported related adverse events (AEs) were headache (five 
events in four out of 54 subjects [9.3%] receiving remimazolam, and one event in one of 18 
subjects receiving midazolam [5.6%]) followed by [CONTACT_310914]/sinus bradycardia (two events in 
two out of 54 subjects receiving remimazolam [3.7%], and four events in three out of nine 
subjects receiving placebo [33.3%]). There was no pain on injection. No serious AE (SAE) was 
reported. 
Remimazolam was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_787411] a clearance that was approximately three-
fold greater than that observed for midazolam. The average percent dose cleared from plasma per 
cohort was 80 to 90% in one hour for remimazolam and 50% in one hour for midazolam. The 
elimination rate of the inactive metabolite CNS7054 was largely unchanged in the dose range 
studied, with linear PK. 
 
7.6.2 Phase Ib Study (CNS7056-002)  
This phase I dose-finding study evaluated the potential of flumazenil as an antidote to 
remimazolam (Part A) , and the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple 
doses of remimazolam 
in volunteers undergoing colonoscopy (part B), in combination with a 
standard dose of fentanyl. 
The efficacy of
 reversal of sedation with flumazenil (0.5 mg  three minutes after administration of 
remimazolam ) was tested in six
 subjects who were sedated with a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg 
remimazolam (part 
A). The subjects (n=6) were randomized to receive either flumazenil or 
placebo at Day [ADDRESS_1083336] dose of fentanyl, has been 
studied to provide suitable sedation levels during a colonoscopy procedure
. In this study, 
sedation was to be
 maintained for 30 minutes. The subjects received three initial doses of 
remimazolam (0.04, 0.075, or 0.10 mg/kg, in Cohorts of n=15 each), five or ten minutes after 
administration of 50
 µg of fentanyl for analgesia. In order to maintain adequate sedation for 30 
minutes, up to six top-up doses of 0.04 mg/kg remimazolam each could have been administered. 113
PAION Confidential Page 24 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 Remimazolam demonstrated a rapid onset and rapid offset of sedation for all doses tested. The 
sedation success rate (defined as MOAA/S ≤4 on three consecutive measurements and 
completion of the pr
ocedure and no requirement for alternative sedative or ventilation) combined 
for the top two cohorts were found to be 83%. No dose dependency was found for time to fully 
alert, time to recov
ery and time to ready for discharge. 
Remimazolam demonstrated hemodynamic stability: no dose-dependent drops in systolic or 
diastolic blood pressure and oxygen-saturation have been observed. Only two patients needed 
airway interventions (chin lift, supplemental oxygen) although the patients were on room air. 
There was no need for ventilation at all. No serious or severe adverse events occurred; the rate of 
moderate adverse events was low. 
 
7.6.3 Phase IIa Study (CNS7056-003)  
The Phase IIa study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-finding study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of remimazolam in patients undergoing diagnostic upper gastrointestinal 
(GI) endoscopy. One hundred and two patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive 
either midazolam at a single dose of 0.075 mg/kg, or a single injection of remimazolam at a dose 
of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 m
g/kg, or 0.2 mg/kg. Midazolam (1-2 mg) was planned as rescue medication 
in the event that the sing
le dose of study medication was insufficient to achieve the level of 
sedation needed for the upper GI endoscopy. The endoscopy procedure has been performed 
according to the study site practice. 
The primary objective, success of the procedure, defined as MOAA/S ≤4 on three consecutive 
measurements AND completion of the procedure AND no requirement for alternative sedative or 
ventilation, dose-dependently increased from 32% (remimazolam 0.10 mg/kg) and 56% 
(remimazolam 0.15 mg/kg
) to 64% (remimazolam 0.20 mg/kg) compared to 44% for midazolam 
(0.075 mg/kg). A rapid 
recovery was observed in all patients. No dose dependency was seen in 
the mean time to fully alert for all remimazolam groups, and a slightly 
longer and more variable 
duration for midazolam-trea
ted patients. 
Vital signs remained stable under treatment with any dose of remimazolam and Midazolam and 
no clinically relevant changes in ECG were observed. The rate of adverse events under treatment 
with remimazolam was comparable to the rate of Midazolam and did not show any dose-
dependency. No dose dependent drop of oxygen-saturation has been observed. No ventilation 
was necessary at any of the patients. No serious adverse events occurred. 
 
7.6.4 Phase IIb Study (CNS7056-004)  
The Phase IIb study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-finding study evaluating 
the efficacy and safety of remimazolam in patients undergoing standard colonoscopy. One 
hundred and sixty patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either midazolam at a 
single dose 2.5 mg and 1.0 mg top-ups, or an initial injection of remimazolam at a dose of 8.0 
mg plus 3.0 mg top-ups, 7.0 mg plus 2.0 mg top-ups or 5.0 mg plus 3.0 mg top-ups. The 
colonoscopy procedure h
as been performed according to the study site ’s practice. 114
PAION Confidential Page 25 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 The primary objective, sedation success rate (see Section 7.6.3 for definition) was superior for 
remimazolam over mi
dazolam with a success rate of 92.5% for remimazolam 8.0 mg, 95% for 
7.0 mg remimazolam and 97.5% for 5.0 mg remimazolam (and their respective top-up doses) 
versus midazolam with a 75% succe
ss rate. A rapid recovery was observed in all patients. No 
dose dependency was seen in the mean time to fully alert for all remimazolam groups, and a 
slightly longer duration for midazolam-treated patients. Vital signs remained stable under 
treatment with any dose of remimazolam and midazolam and no clinically relevant changes in 
ECG were observed. Analysis of QT intervals using both a Bazett’s and a Fridericia correction 
showed statistically significant differences between the treatment groups favoring the 
remimazolam groups at 5 minutes: the point nearest the C max for remimazolam. 
The rate of a
dverse events under treatment with remimazolam was comparable to the rate of 
midazolam and did not show any dose-dependency. No dose dependent drop of oxygen-
saturation has been observed. No ventilation was necessary at any of the patients. No serious 
adverse events occurred. The data also indicated that a low initial dose of 5.0 mg of 
remimazolam and top-up doses of 2.5 mg are appropriate in colonoscopy to initiate and maintain 
an adequate sedation level.

 10 STUDY DESIGN 
10.1 Overall Design 
This stud
y will be 
performed as a prospective, double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel 
group study assessing the efficacy and safety of remimazolam in patients undergoing 
bronchoscopy in comparison to placebo. An open-label midazolam group has been included as a 
validation measure for the tools to determine sedation as well as a
 comparator for safety. 420 
patients will be ra
ndomized, of which 300 patients belong to the remimazolam group, 60 to the 
placebo and 60 patients to t
he midazolam group. 
Bronchoscopy may be performed for diagnostic but as we
ll as for therapeutic reasons, such as 
biopsies, lavage, brushings, and foreign body extraction for example. It is, however, limited to 
procedures usually performed in the bronchoscopy suite, but not the ICU (for detail see 
inclusion/exclusion criteria in Section 11). Subjects should follow fasting instructions as 
provided by [CONTACT_779].  
All pati
ents will rec
eive 0.9% NaCl solution up to 1000 mL drip starting prior to the procedure , 
if their fluid status allows. 
All patients will receive 25-50 µg of fentanyl immediately prior to the 
administration of study medication (with suitable dose reductions a
t the investigator’s discretion 
for elderly and debilitated patients). All infused fluid volumes will be recorded throughout the 
procedure. The a
dministration of supplemental oxygen will be started shortly before the 
procedure and will be continued at a rate of 4 L/min until the patient is fully alert (three 
consecutive MOAA/S scores 
of 5). 
Patients will be randomized to manually receive an initial single intravenous ( iv) dose over one 
minute of remimazolam 5.0 mg or an equal volume of placebo in a blinded manner and 
bronchoscopy will start when adequate sedation (MOAA/S ≤3) has been achieved.  
Sedation may be
 maintained by [CONTACT_787461] 2.[ADDRESS_1083337]. The 
overall number of remimazolam/placebo doses is not limited as long as not more than 5 doses are 
administered in any 15 minute window. Should five doses within 15 min utes not be sufficient to 
obtain adequate sedation for
 the bronchoscopy, this is defined as a treatment failure. 
In the open-label midazolam arm, healthy adults <60 will receive 1.75 mg of midazolam as an 
initial dose over two minutes. Adults ≥60 years, debilitated or chronically ill patients will receive 
1.0 mg as an initial dose over two minutes. Sedation can be maintained by [CONTACT_787462] 
1.0 mg in healthy adults <60 years; in the case of adults ≥[ADDRESS_1083338]. The overall number of midazolam doses is not 
limited as long as not more than three doses are administered in any 12 minute window. Should 
three doses within any 12 minute  window not be sufficient to obtain adequate sedation for the 
bronchoscopy, this is to be considered a treatment failure. 
After determination of treatment failure, midazolam is defined as the only rescue sedative 
medication in such cases in order to perform or finalize the bronchoscopy. 120
PAION Confidential Page 31 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 If the pain is not adequately controlled by [CONTACT_787463] 25-50 µg fentanyl (with suitable 
dose reductions at the in
vestigator’s discretion for elderly and debilitated patients), further top up 
doses of fentanyl of 25 µg q 5-10 minutes are allowed until adequate analgesia is achieved or the 
maximum dose of 200 µg
 per procedure has been reached. It is of note, that fentanyl is strictly to 
be applied for pain control only. 
The flexible bronchoscope will be inserted and the procedure will be performed according to the 
usual clinical practice. 
If the investigator does not proceed with the bronchoscopy or does not complete the 
bronchoscopy ( eg for technical reasons), the reason will be documented. 
The primary e
fficacy endpoint is to assess the success of sedation of the bronchoscopy 
procedure. This composite endpoint will be determined for remimazolam and placebo by [CONTACT_70135]: 
 Completion of the bronchoscopy procedure, AND  
 No requirement for a
 rescue sedative medication, AND 
 No requirement for
 more than [ADDRESS_1083339] point, in the case of midazolam  a requirement for more than 3 doses 
doses within any 12 minute window  defines a treatment failure.  
Skilled personnel not participating in the procedure will provide for continuous monitoring of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_751568], ie, pulse oximetry. Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs 
and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and 
personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management will be ensured. A 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787412] (flumazenil) as well as an opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727] (naloxone) will be 
immediately available for use. See Appendix A for an overdose treatment protocol.  
Individuals trained in Advanced Cardiac Life Support will be present in the vicinity of the 
patient until he/she has recovered consciousness and has normal cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2606]. 
 
10.2 Duration of Study Participation 
The maximum study duration for any patient will be up to 28 days. The patients will be screened 
within 21 days prior to 
the bronchoscopy. A follow-up phone call will be performed on Day 4 
(+3/-1 days) a
fter the bronchoscopy has taken part (see Appendix B). 
 121

CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 Screening (up to 21 days prior to procedure day ):  
Patients will sign informed consent and undergo procedures to determine eligibility.  
Day of bronchoscopy (Day 1):  
After the completion of screening procedures patients will be randomly assigned to the 
remimazolam, placebo or midazolam group. Patients will receive their assigned treatment with 
25-50 µg fentanyl (with suitable dose reductions at the investigator’s discretion for elderly and 
debilitated patients
) and the bronchoscopy will be performed according to the study procedures. 
Following completion of the bronchoscopy procedure, the p atients will be discharged at the 
discretion of the investigator and completing the assessments after reaching fully alert status. 
Assessment of “time back to normal” in the patient’s subjective view (via telephone contact [CONTACT_787464] 2). 
 
Follow-u p (Day 4 [+3/-1  days]):   
The site will telephone the patient for safety assessments. Study participation is considered 
complete after all Day [ADDRESS_1083340] been 
followed-up until they resolve or
 become stable, or until they can be explained by [CONTACT_554019](s). 
In case there has been any indication 
for the onset of a new AE since discharge, patients should 
come back to the site immediately (preferably the same day) to perform further assessments ( eg 
clinically laboratory tests, 12 lead ECG, left to the discretion of the investigator).

 Dosing of fentanyl:  
Immediately before administration of study sedative medication, 25-[ADDRESS_1083342] 
a respi[INVESTIGATOR_305947] 8 breaths per minute or an oxygen saturation of 
less than 90%. 
Supplementary doses of [ADDRESS_1083343].  Such subsequent doses should ONLY be administered if the patient’s pain is 
not adequately controlled.  If depth of sedation is insufficient, ONLY the dose of the sedative 
should be adjusted. 
The dose and time of administration of any medication will be documented.  Patients should be 
observed closely 
for signs of adverse events and possible respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  Naloxone should 
be close at hand for emergency administration (see Appendix A) 
Immediately after the dosing of fentanyl and depending on the allocated study arm, the following 
dose instructions for study sedative medication (blinded study arm or open label midazolam) 
have to be followed: 
 
Dosing of double blind study medication (remimazolam or placebo):  
Initiation of sedation (remimazolam or placebo):  
The initial dose of 2 mL double-blinded study medication will be administered manually by [CONTACT_787470].  
MOAA/S scores will be recorded at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 minutes and further in 1-minute intervals , 
after start of blinde
d study drug dosing (t=0) until fully alert.  A t least two additional minutes 
shoul
d be allowed 
to evaluate fully the sedative effect.  If there is sufficient sedation 
(MOAA/S  ≤3) the procedure can start.  
If there is insufficie
nt sedation (MOAA/S 4 or 5) to begin the procedure after the initial dose of 
blinded study medication, a supplementary dose of 1 mL of blinded study medication may be 
administered by [CONTACT_787471] (over approximately 15 seconds) at least two minutes after the 
end of the first dose and after MOAA/S assessment. 
If initial sedation is still insufficient, further supplementary doses of 1 mL of blinded study 
medication may be administered by [CONTACT_787471] (over approximately 15 seconds), at least 
two minutes apart. 
If there is still insufficient sedation to begin the procedure after the initial dose and a maximum 
of four additional doses within a 15 minute period, “treatment failure” is recorded and the patient 129
PAION Confidential Page 40 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 should receive midazolam rescue medication at the discretion of the investigator to start the 
procedure. 
 
Maintenance of  sedation (remimazolam or placebo):  
If sedation from blinded study medication is sufficient to allow colonoscopy to begin, subsequent 
doses of 1mL double blind study medication can be administered to maintain the patient at an 
adequate sedation level (MOAA/S ≤4). 
If the MOAA/S is ≥4 additional doses (as manual bolus injections over 15 seconds) of 1mL 
remimazolam or placebo can be administered, at least two minutes apart, to maintain or again 
reach an adequate sedation level.  Two or more additional minutes should be allowed to evaluate 
fully the sedative effect. 
During the procedure “treatment failure” is recorded if adequate sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) cannot 
be maintained by [CONTACT_787472][INVESTIGATOR_787422] 15 minute period.  The 
patient should then receive midazolam rescue sedative medication at the discretion of the 
investigator to allow for completion of the procedure or for scope removal.  Only midazolam  
may be used as rescue sedative medication  
 
Dosing of open label midazolam:  
Initiation of sedation (midazolam):  
The initial midazolam dose will be administered manually by [CONTACT_787473].  In healthy adults <60 yrs, the initial dose will be 1.75 mL solution containing 
1.75 mg.  In the case of adults ≥60 yrs, or debilitated or chronically ill patients, the dose will be 
1mL solution containing 1.0 mg
. 
MOAA/S scores will be recorded at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 minutes and further in one minute 
intervals, after start of the open label midazolam dosing (t=0) until fully alert.  At least two 
additional minutes should be allowed to evaluate fully the sedative effect.  If there is sufficient 
sedation (MO AA/S ≤3) the procedure can start.  
If there is insufficient sedation to begin the procedure after the initial dose of midazolam 
(MOAA/S 4 or 5), a supplementary dose of midazolam may be administered by [CONTACT_787474], at least two minutes after the end of the last dose and 
after MOAA/S assessment.  In the case of healthy adults <60 yrs, the dose will be 1 mL 
containing 1.0 mg.  In the case of adults ≥[ADDRESS_1083344] two minutes apart. 
If there is still insufficient sedation to begin the procedure after the initial dose and a maximu m 
of two further doses within a 12 minute period, “treatment failure” is recorded and the patient 130
PAION Confidential Page 41 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 should receive midazolam rescue medication at the discretion of the investigator to start the 
procedure. 
 
Maintenance of sedation (midazolam):  
If sedation from open label midazolam study medication is sufficient to allow colonoscopy to 
begin, subsequent doses can be administered to maintain the patient at an adequate sedation level 
(MOAA/S ≤4). 
If the MOAA/S is ≥4 additional doses (as manual injections over two minutes) of midazolam can 
be administered, a
t least two minutes apart, to maintain or again reach an adequate sedation 
level. 
For health
y adults <60 yrs, the dose of midazolam will be 1.0 mg (1mL); in the case of adults 
≥60 yrs, debilitated or chronically ill patients, the dose will be 0.5 mg (0.5mL).  These 
subsequent doses should always be administered as manual injections over at least two minutes, 
and two or more additional minutes should be all
owed to evaluate fully the sedative effect. 
During the procedure
 “treatment failure” is recorded 
if adequate sedation (MOAA/S ≤4) cannot 
be maintained by [CONTACT_787475], despi[INVESTIGATOR_787423] 12 minute period.  
The patient should then receive midazolam rescue sedative medication at the discretion of the 
investigator to allow for completion of the procedure or for scope removal.  Only midazolam  
may be used as rescue sedative medication.  
 
Sedation and analgesia reversal:  
The benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787424] e for use at the site 
(see Appendix A). 
 
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_787425] (see

Start of bronchoscopy:  
The scope will be inserted when sufficient sedation is achieved (MOAA/S ≤3 ). 
 
Post-dose assessments Day 1:  
All safety and PK post-dose assessments (where appropriate) will be performed based on the 
start time of the initial infusion of study medication: 
 Hemodynamic parameters: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be recorded at 2, 5, 
10 and every five
 minutes thereafter for the duration of the procedure until the patient is 
fully alert and clinically stable. Heart rate will be monitored and recorded continuously 
using an electronic 
device (Nellcor, Covidien) and documented in the CRF at 2, 5, 10 and 
every 5 minutes thereafter for the duration of the procedure until the patient is fully alert 131
PAION Confidential Page 42 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 and clinically stable. The heart rate nadir will be determined and will also be recorded in 
the eCRF. In addition, these parameters will be recorded immediately prior to, and two 
minutes after each administration of fentanyl. 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_787426] 
(Nellcor, Covidien) until fully alert. Values will be documented in the eCRF at 2, 5, 10 
and every five 
minutes thereafter for the duration of the procedure until the patient is 
fully alert and clinically stable. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_787427]. 
 SpO 2 will be monitored and recorded continuously from 15 minutes pre-dose, and values 
will be documented in the eCRF at 2, 5, 10, and every five minutes thereafter for the 
duration of the procedure until the patient is fully alert and clinically stable. The SpO 2 
nadir will be determi
ned and will also be recorded in the eCRF.  In addition, SpO 2 will be 
recorded immediately prior to, and two minutes after each administration of fentanyl. 
 Single 12-lead ECGs will be performed one minute after the first dose, five minutes after 
initial dosing, and 
every [ADDRESS_1083345] t 
= 0 and every
 5 minutes until fully alert. Any patients with evidence of QT prolongation 
should be monitored until the ECGs re
turn to baseline. 
 MOAA/S scores will be recorded post t=0 at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 minutes and at 1-minute 
intervals thereafter 
until fully alert (fully alert is defined as the first of three consecutive 
MOAA/S measurements of 5). After fully alert, MOAA/S scores will be recorded every 5 
minutes until ready 
for discharge (see below), and after ready for discharge every 10 
minutes (up to 90 minutes) until actual discharge of patient. Following completion of the 
procedure and full
y alert, patients will be allowed clear liquids and a meal at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
 The time ready for discharge must be determined. 
 Actual times of discharge from (a) the bronchoscopy suite, and (b) the recovery room 
after the last injec
tion of study medication and after the end of the bronchoscopy will be 
recorded.  
 At 30, [ADDRESS_1083346] t=0, a ready-for-discharge score will be determined. 
  
  
 Adverse events will be a
ssessed. 
 Any airwa
y management procedures will be recorded. 
 Concomitant medications will be reviewed.  
 Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) will be 
collected at least 3 hrs after the procedure. 132

PAION Confidential Page 43 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
  Body temperature will be determined 5 minutes after end of procedure, at fully alert and 
at discharge. 
  
 
  
In order tocapture the potential time diffe
rences between the main clock  (used for assessment of 
time = 0) and the Nellcor device clock , both times shall be recorded simultaneously at some 
point within 30 minutes prior to the start of the procedure. 
 
Pharmacokinetic determinations:  
For patients ≥ 75 years at selected sities, venous blood samples (approximately 4 mL each) for 
plasma concentration analysis of remimazolam, will be collected in samples obtained at five 
accurately recorded time points during and after the procedure.  The first three during the 
procedure should be no closer than two minutes after the end of a dose, with the first sample 
taken after the initial dose.  The two samples after the anticipated last dose should be (a) between 
5 and 15 minutes later and (b) at leas t [ADDRESS_1083347] dose, but no later than about 2 hours.  
 
12.3 Follow-up on Day 2 
Assessment of “ti
me back to normal” in the patient’s subjective view (via telephone contact [CONTACT_787464] 2). 
 
12.4 Follow- up Telephone Inte rview Assessments (Day 4 [+3/-1 Days]) 
The
 following assessments will be undertaken via telephone interview at the Follow-Up Contact: 
  
 Record any concomitant medications and AEs reported since Day 1. 
In case there
 has been any indication for the onset of a new AE since discharge, patients should 
come back to the site immediately (preferably the same day) to perform further assessments ( eg 
clinically laboratory tests, 12 lead ECG, left to the discretion of the investigator). 
 
12.5 Patient Completion/Discontinuation 
A patient is consi
dered to have completed the study once all Follow-up call assessments have 
been completed or the patient withdraws from the study prematurely. 
While patients are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason. Every effort will be made to determine why any patient 133

PAION Confidential Page 44 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 withdraws from the study prematurely. This information will be recorded. If a patient withdraws 
prematurely after dosing, patients will be monitored until they are stable for discharge. All data 
normally collected
 at the End of Study Visit should be recorded at the time of premature 
discontinuation, or at the scheduled End of Study Visit. Patients’ participation may be terminated 
prior to completing the study for any of the following reasons: 
1. Adverse event 
2. Protocol violation 
3. Loss t
o follow-up 
4. Pa
tient’s own re
quest (withdrawal of consent) 
5. Endotracheal intubation 
6.
 Use of catecholamines 
7. Othe
r 
If a 
patie
nt is not reachable for the Follow-up call or is discontinued from the study, an attempt 
will be made to de
termine the reason(s). If the patient is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter will be sent to the patient requesting that he/she contact [CONTACT_3652]. 
All patients with an on
going SAE at the End of Study call (scheduled or premature) must be 
followed until the event is resolved (with or without sequelae) or deemed stable. 
 
12.6 Replacement of Patients 
Patients who withdra
w from the study before randomization will be replaced to ensure the 
planned number of patients can be randomized. 
Patients who withdraw fr
om the study after randomization will not be replaced. A log of screen 
failures and subjects who are withdrawn prior to randomization that includes the reason(s) they 
were not enrolled or reason(s) for their pre-randomization withdrawal will be kept. 
 
12.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Treatment with the 
following medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_787428] (see also Section  11): 
 Any investigational dr
ug when taken within 30 days or less than seven half-lives (whichever 
is longer) before Screening. 
 Use of unstable doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787429], insomnia, anxiety, 
spasticity. An unstable dose is a dose change of more than 50% of the previous dose,  within 
30 days prior to day of procedure. 
 Use of propofol within less than 5 half-lives prior to day of procedure 
 Diphenhydramine a
nd other anti-histamines, unless they are administered on a regular dose 
and schedule (not PRN) for at least one week before the procedure in order to avoid any 
interference. 134

site except for the pharmacist, the pharmacy staff  unblinded monitor until the 
study is completed . This exemption also applies to the DMC members. The pharmacist and staff 
will not participate in other study procedures. Patients will be blinded to treatment. 
Study-specific labe
ling meeting all applicable regulatory requirements can be found in the Drug 
Handling Manual for this study. 
 
12.9.6 Randomization an d Unblinding  
Prior to dosing, patients will be randomly assigned in a 30:6:6  ratios to remimazolam, placebo or 
open-label midazolam. The randomization schedule will be computer-generated using a 
permuted block algorithm
 and will randomly allocate study drug to randomization numbers. The 
randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially as patients are entered into the study. The 
study site will not be stratified in the randomization schedule. Although the amount of chronic 
use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787432], it is difficult to be able to 
stratify the randomization for amount of these drugs from a practical perspective. At Day 1 after 
confir
ming that a patient still meets entry criteria, the patient will get the next free random 
number in ascending order. The investigator will administer the trial medication corresponding 
to the random number. The dose
s of remimazolam or placebo will be visually indistinguishable.  
Treatment unblinding 
is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment assignment will not 
materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. Unblinding will be 
permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the patient’s treatment 
assignment. Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor if possible. For 
emergency unblinding, study site personnel will call the central IWRS. If the investigator is not 
able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he or she must notify the medical monitor 
as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the patient’s treatment 
assignment. The central I WRS will capture the date and reason for the patient’s treatment 138

electronic data capture system; compliance will be set to 100% if the patient received the initial 
dose of study medication. 
If dosing is not performed per protocol, details will be recorded as a protocol deviation. 
All incidents of abuse, misuse, overuse, or overdose (intentional or accidental) will be reported 
as AEs including case narrative. Study medication, that is lost, stolen, missing or unaccounted 
for will be thoroughly investigated and details related to such cases will also be narrated. 
 
12.9.8 Study Patient Numbering  
All consented patients are assigned unique patient identification (PID) numbers (screening 
number). The PID numbers are 6-digit numbers that identify study subjects from time of 
screening until time
 of randomization. 
Before the start of the study, a computer-generated randomization schedule will be prepared by 
 [CONTACT_787479], patients at each study site will be 
randomly assigned by [CONTACT_787480] (Table 1) in the 
chronologica
l order in which they were enrolled.

 13 DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENTS 
13.1 Efficacy Evaluat
ions 
13.1.1 Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation  
The MOAA/S is a measure of sedation based on the clinical evaluations of the practitioner and is 
also an accepted and commonly used method of assessing levels of sedation (see  Appendix D )30. 
This method will be used in concert to present a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy 
profile of remimazolam. 
The MOAA/S Score
s will be recorded pre-dose and then post-dose as follows: MOAA/S scores 
at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, [ADDRESS_1083354] 3 
minutes, at 1-minute intervals until patient is Fully Alert (first of three consecutive MOAA/S 
scores of 5). After Fully Alert, MOAA/S scores will be recorded every 5 minutes until ready for 
discharge, and 
after ready for discharge every 10 minutes (up to 90 minutes) until actual 
discharge of the patient. 
Time to peak sedation is defined as the time between start of the injection of the initial dose (t=0) 
until the lowest MOAA/S score is achieved for the first time. 
Close monitoring of MOAA/S levels will be undertaken by [CONTACT_142921] a patient level during 
the study to ensure patient safety, and any concerns notified to the DMC.  The blind will be 
maintained throughout.

13.1.5 Process to Determine Time Ready for Discharge  
 The patient will be instructed that after the procedure is completed and he is fully 
awake again, he has to indicate by [CONTACT_787481] a walking test before discharge29. 
 Any attempts to wake the patient prematurely are not allowed. 
 Prior to determine  
time ready to discharge, patient must be fully alert and meet the 
following criteria:  
- The patient must be free of nausea/vomiting and diaphoresis. 
- The patient must be free of dizziness in supi[INVESTIGATOR_787433]. 
- Vital signs must be within a reasonable and normal range of pre-procedure status. 
 As soon as the patie
nt indicates, that they feel ready to be discharged, the walking 
test will be started and patient must walk [ADDRESS_1083355] be repeated; if fulfilled, 
the patient is ready for discharge and time will be recorded. 
 Patients will be discharged only with an accompanying person, even if they are able 
to walk unassisted. 
 
13.1.6 Readiness-for-Discharge Score  
Patients will be asked at 30,  60, and 90  minutes after time = 0 for their readiness-for-discharge34 
using the Visual Analogue
 Scale, where 0 denotes no readiness for discharge and 10 represents 
immediate readiness for discharge.

13.2 Safety Procedures 
Safety will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_46636], vital signs (supi[INVESTIGATOR_27443], systolic, 
diastolic and mean arterial BP, respi[INVESTIGATOR_149939]), ECG findings, clinical 
laboratory test results, and the incidence of AEs. In addition, other procedures including pulse 
oximetry measurements, pain on injection intensity rating, and the assessment of interventions 
such as airway interventions (chin lift, jaw thrust, requirement of repositioning and/or manual or 
mechanical ventilation), administration of additional fluids or medication or any interventions 
necessary due to a clinically relevant change in ECG will also be performed. Concomitant 
medications will be documented to evaluate possible drug interactions and also any AEs or 
pharmacodynamic data that could be associated with peri-procedural medications. All 
observations will be followed from Baseline/Screening until the Follow-up on Day 4 (+3/-1 
days). Specific details on follow up of AEs can be found in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
13.2.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 At Screening, blood/urine/saliva will be collected for the following tests :  
- Saliva test for alcohol. 
- Urine-pregna
ncy test in female subjects. 
- Urine-drug 
screen to include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phency
clidine, and cannabinoids.  
 At Day 1 (if not the same day
 as Screening) sites will test for the following: 
- Saliva test for alcohol. 
- Urine pregna
ncy test in female subjects. 
- Urine drug sc
reen to include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phency
clidine, and cannabinoids. 
 Screening (if not the same as Day 1), Day [ADDRESS_1083356] 3 hrs after the procedure : venous 
blood samples will 
be collected for routine safety evaluations (hematology, serum 
chemistry): 
- Hematolo gy and Coagulation : hemoglobin, he matocrit, red blood cell (RBC) 
count, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (both % and absolute), 
platelet count, activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and International 
Normalized Ratio (INR). 
- Serum Chemistry: AST, ALT, direct and total bilirubin, chloride, bicarbonate, 
calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, total protein, sodium, potassium, LDH, 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, uric acid, 
albumin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by  [CONTACT_787482] C. 142

03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 Clinical laboratory values outside the normal range:  
Any value outside the normal range will be assessed by [CONTACT_787483]. Additional testing during the study may be done if medically 
indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after 
administration of study drug or  during the study, the abnormality will be recorded as an AE. 
 
13.2.2 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination (excluding rectal and genitourinary examination) will be 
performed at screening. A baseline physical examination will be performed on admission i f 
screening and randomization is not at the same day. 
 
13.2.3 Vital Signs  
Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP) will be measured using an 
electronic recording device after the patient has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] ≥[ADDRESS_1083357] on Day 1 from 15 mi
nutes pre-dose until fully alert. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute) will be manually
 assessed at screening and on admission. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_787434]-monitored and recorded 
(Nellcor, Covidien) on Day 1 and documented once within 15 minutes pre-dose (baseline) and at 
approximately
 2, 5, 10, and every five minutes thereafter for the duration of the procedure until 
the patient is fully alert and clinically stable. 
Body temperature will be measured at screening, on Day 1, within 5 hours pre-dose, within 30 
minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes
 after the procedure, at fully alert and at discharge. 
A pulse oximeter for measurement of SpO 2 will be placed 15 minutes prior
 to start of procedure 
and will be monitore
d and recorded continuously until fully alert and documented in the eCRF at 
the following time points: within 15 minutes of dosing of trial medication, and immediately 
before administration of fentanyl (baseline) and trial medication. Post-dose measurements will be 
made at the following time points: 2, 5, 10, and every five minutes thereafter for the duration of 
the procedure until the patient is fully alert and clinically stable. Any event occurring at the same 
time as a significant change in SpO 2, such as a displaced sensor, will be recorded. 
A set of vital signs will additionally be recorded at the onset time of adverse events, if feasible or 
available and documented in the eCRF (if an AE occurs outside the medical practice / hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111483] [ eg during the time from screening to day 1 or after discharge until follow up when the 
patient is sent home] data for vital signs might be unavailable).  
Systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate and SpO 2 will also be recorded immediately prior to and 2 
minutes after each dose of fentanyl.

documented at the following time points: 2, 5, 10, and every five minutes thereafter for the 
duration of the procedure until the patient is fully alert and clinically stable. 
Single 12-lead ECGs wil
l be performed within five hours pre-dose, [ADDRESS_1083359] dose, 
5 minutes after start of
 initial dosing and every 10 minutes until the end of the procedure (if 
possible), and five minutes after end of procedure and at discharge or in case of a clinical event, 
eg arrhythmias, wher
e repeated ECG recordings are warranted. The ECG will include all twelve 
standard leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the tracing. The ECG will be recorded 
at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The following ECG parameters will be collected or calculated : 
PR interval, RR interval QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval (QT corrected, using Bazett 
[QTcB] and Fride
ricia [QTcF] formul ae; correction may be done by  [CONTACT_787484].  144

03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 All ECGs will be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities and any 
significant finding will be documented as an AE. 
 
 
 
 
13.2.6 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically 
significant abnormal values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, ECGs, 
vital signs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or 
not considered related to the study drug.  
Diagnostic findings during the bronchoscop y procedure will not be reported as AEs, but 
documented as findings of the bronchoscopy in a specific section of the CRF. 
 
Serious adverse event:  
Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, 
requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is a medical 
important event. 
 
Adverse reaction:  
Any untoward and unintended response to an investigational medicinal product related to any 
dose administered. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction:  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. 'Reasonable possibility' means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
Unexpected suspected adverse reaction:  
A suspected adverse reaction, not listed in the applicable product information ( eg investigator’s 
brochure for an unauthorized investigational product, or summary of product 145

PAION Confidential Page 56 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 characteristics/product insert for an authorized product) or the specificity or severity of which is 
not consistent with the applicable product information. 
 
Suspected u nexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):  
A suspected adverse reaction related to an investigational medicinal product (the tested 
investigational medicinal products and comparators) which occurs in a clinical trial, and that is 
both unexpected and serious. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Adverse Events 
Assessment of intensity:  
There are three intensity categories: 
 Mild : the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the subject’s normal activities. 
 Moderate : the adverse 
event is sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of 
the subject’s normal activities. 
 Severe : the adv
erse event is incapacitating, preventing the subject from participating in 
his/her normal activities.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur, the maximum intensity for the experience should 
be noted. 
 
Assessment of causality:  
Criteria for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_2235] (suspected relationship to IMP35) are presented below. 
Causality term  Assessment criteria * 
Certain  • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time  relationship to drug intake  
• Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_787485]  
• Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically,  pathologically)  
• Event definitive pharmacologic ally or phenomenologically ( ie an objective and specific 
medical disorder or a recogni zed pharmacological phenomenon)  
• Re-challenge satisfactory, if necessary  
Probable  / Likely  • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time  relationship to drug intake  
• Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs  
• Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable  
• Re-challenge not r equired  
Possible  • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time  relationship to drug intake  
• Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]  
• Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
Unlikely  • Event or laboratory test a bnormality, with a time to drug intake  that makes a relationship 
improbable (but not impossible)  
• Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations  
Conditional/  
Unclassified  • Event or laboratory test abnormality  
• More data for proper assessment nee ded, or  
• Additional data under examination  146
PAION Confidential Page 57 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
 
 
 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 
 Unassessable/  
Unclassifiable  • Report suggesting an adverse reaction  
• Cannot be judged because information is insufficient or  contradictory  
• Data cannot be supplemented or verified  
* All points should be reasonably complied with 
 
Assessment of outcome:  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 Resolved: the subject has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain. 
 Resolved: with sequelae –  the subject has recovered, but some symptoms remain.  
 Resolving: the subject’s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain. 
 Not resolved: the subject’s 
condition has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged 
or worsening. 
 Death. 
Death should only be selected as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE 
is possibly related to the patient’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such 
AE. 
 
Assessment of seriousness:  
For the purpose of assessing seriousness of an AE, the occurrence at any dose of any the 
following will be considered as qualifying the event as an SAE: 
 Fatality. 
 A life-threatening event. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787435]. 
 Persistent or significant disa
bility/incapacity. 
 A congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
 An important medical e
vent that requires immediate medical intervention to prevent the 
above outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 All AEs that require any of the following interventions will be considered SAEs: 
o Instrumentation of the airway  
o Administration of flumazenil 
In-patie
nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320335]/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787436], or 
occurred as a consequence of the event. It does not refer to pre-planned elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485050] a pre-existing condition (before signing the informed consent) that 
has not significantly worsened, or to diagnostic procedures. It does not refer to findings during 
the bronchoscopy that might lead to further follow-up requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 147
PAION Confidential Page 58 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 Assessment of expectedness:  
The expectedness of an adverse reaction is determined by [CONTACT_456]. This should be done from 
the perspective of events previously observed, not on the basis of what might be anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of a medicinal product. For the study drug, the reference safety 
information is found in the current IB. For the comparator, the information is found in the current 
package insert (Summary of Product Characteristics). An unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current version of the IB. 
For example, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (of greater severity) if the IB only listed 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (of greater specificity) if the current version of the IB only listed 
cerebral vascular accidents. 
Furthermore, adverse events listed in the investigator brochure as occurring with members of the 
same class of drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, would be 
considered unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. For 
example, although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some patients exposed to drugs in th e 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the 
investigator brochure as a class effect, a case of angioedema observed with the drug under 
investigation should be considered unexpected for reporting purposes until it is included in the 
investigator brochure as occurring with the drug under investigation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 
An AE may be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_102], discovered on physical examination, or 
uncovered as a result of general questioning by [CONTACT_5984]. From signing the informed 
consent to admission then discharge and again at the Follow-up Visit, the patient will be asked 
non-leading questions such as, “How have you been since you were last asked?” All AEs will be 
recorded. 
For 
all AEs, the Investigator or designee must obtain enough information to both determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the criteria for classification as a SAE. 
All AEs will be recorded in the study subject’s own words (“verbatim”) as well as by [CONTACT_787486] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. The term will subsequently be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse events should be recorded 
individually unless the AEs constitute a condition, disease, or syndrome. In that case, separate 
AEs should not be recorded for individual symptoms; rather, the condition, disease or syndrome 
should be recorded as one AE.  
Each AE will also be described in terms of seriousness, start and stop times and dates, frequency, 
maximum intensity, causality (suspected relationship to trial medication), actions taken, and 
outcome. 
All incidents of abuse, misuse, overuse, or overdose (intentional or accidental) will be reported 
as AEs including case narrative. 148
PAION Confidential Page 59 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse event (AE) reporting will begin upon signing of the informed consent and will continue 
through the Follow-up visit. 
Any SAE, whether deemed IMP-related or not, must be reported to the Sponsor's local safety 
management organization as soon as possible after the Investigator or Coordinator has become 
aware of its occurrence. The Investigator/Coordinator must complete an SAE form and submit it 
within [ADDRESS_1083360] Info rmation:  
24-hour SAE Fax Line: 88
Email: PAm
The Investigator must be prepared to supply the local safety management organization with the 
following information: 
a. Investigator's name [CONTACT_187419]
b. Patients number
c. Patients initials
d. Patients demographics
e. Clinical event:
1. descri
ption
2. date of onset
3. seve
rity
4. treatment (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])
5. relationship to IMP (causality)
6. action taken regarding IMP
7. outcome
f. If the AE was fatal:
1. cause of death (whether or not the death was related to the IMP)
2. autopsy findings (if available)
Additional information about any SAE should be forwarded by [CONTACT_11255] 24 hours of the 
information becoming available. Under the Sponsor’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the safety management organization is responsible for immediately informing the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor of the occurrence of any SAEs. 
Any new SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
IMP or study participation should be handled in the same manner as that for SAEs that occur 
during the study. 149

[IP_ADDRESS] Special Procedures for Managing SAEs and Unblinding 
When a patient 
has a serious adverse event (SAE) that is a medical emergency requiring 
immediate knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment, study site personnel will call the 
central interactive web response system (IWRS) to obtain the treatment assignment. In all other 
cases, prior to unblinding, the investigator must discuss the SAE with the medical monitor. The 
procedure for unblinding a patient’s treatment assignment is described in Section  12.9.[ADDRESS_1083361] to expedited reporting, the Sponsor/CRO 
Pharmacovigilance will unblind the affected cases in order to fulfill reporting requirements. For 
such cases, unblinding will be performed according to documented procedures and the unblinded 
information will be kept to authorized safety personnel. 151

 14 STUDY MANAGEMENT 
14.1 Regulatory Guid
elines 
The study will be
 conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki (64th WMA assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil 10/2013; including amendments in effect up to 
the time the study was conducted) and in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), local 
regulatory requirements, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New 
Drug (IND) regulations (21 CFR 56). 
 
14.[ADDRESS_1083362] 
(IRB). Approval is required for the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent 
forms (ICFs), patient information sheets, and advertising materials. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_1083363] explain orally and in writing the 
nature, duration, and purpose of the study, and the action of the drug in such a manner that the 
patient is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or adverse effects that may occur. The 
patient will be informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The patient 
will receive all information that is required by [CONTACT_787487] (ICH) guidelines. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_509891] a copy of the 
IRB-approved ICF prior to the start of the study. 
 
14.4 Discontinuation of the Study by [CONTACT_787488]. Should the study be terminated and/or a site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and IMP pertaining to the study must be returned to the Sponsor. Any actions 
required to assess or to maintain patient safety will continue as required, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_787437]. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_1083364] be approved by [CONTACT_787489]. 
Amendments significantly affecting the safety of patients, the scope of the investigation, or the 
scientific quality of the study, require additional approval by [CONTACT_442007]. Examples of 
amendments requiring such approval are: 152
PAION Confidential Page 63 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 An increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of subjects.
A significant change in the study design ( eg addition or deletion of a control group).
An increase in the number of
 invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed.
Addition or deletion of a test procedure for safety monitoring.
Change in the
 inclusion or exclusion criteria that may increas
e the risk to the subjects.
Addition of patients to the
 study.
These requirements fo r 
approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by [CONTACT_787490] . 
If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_787491]/her for safety reasons, the Sponsor and the monitor should be notified 
within [ADDRESS_1083365] be kept informed of such changes. 
Examples of administrative changes not requiring formal protocol amendments or IRB approval 
that can be treated as administrative amendments ( eg file notes) include: 
Changes in the staff used
 to monitor trials ( eg Sponsor staff or CRO staff).
Minor changes in the pa
ckaging or labeling of study drug.
14.6 Deviations from the Protocol 
The Investigator
 will not deviate from this protocol for any reason without prior written approval 
from the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, except in cases of medical emergencies. The Investigator 
may deviate from the protocol without prior approval only when the change is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a patient. In that event, the Investigator will notify the 
Sponsor immediately by [CONTACT_648], notify the IRB, and confirm notification to the Sponsor in 
writing within five working days after the change is implemented.

Statistical summaries will
 be provided for all demographic, efficacy, and safety parameters, as 
described in Sections  15.6 and 15.7. The data from all study sites will be combined for analysis. 
All data will be provided in listing
s. Descriptive summaries will be provided where applicable. 
15.1 Randomization and Blinding 
Prior to dosing, patients will be randomly assigned in a 30:6:[ADDRESS_1083369] 100 patients on 
remimazolam aged ≥ 65 yrs (at least 30 of these aged ≥ 75 years or older) across the three late 
stage clinical trials (CNS7056-006, CNS7056-008, and CNS7056-015). Study site will not be 
stratified in the randomization schedule. Although the amount of chronic use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_787432], it is difficult to be able to stratify the randomization 
for amount of these drugs from a practical perspective. At Study Day 1, after confirming that a 
pa
tient still meets 
entry criteria, study personnel will inform the pharmacist that the subject 
qualifies for randomization. The unblinded pharmacist will call the central IWRS and enter the 
requested information. The IWRS will then assign the next randomization number in the 
sequence and inform the pharmacist of the study treatment assignment. Thereafter, the 
pharmacist will dispense the corresponding treatment. For treatment unblinding please refer to 
Section  12.9.6. 
15.2 Statistical Analysis 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) describing in detail the analyses to be conducted will be written and approved prior to 
unblinding. All statistical analyses will be performed in SAS®. This study is a superiority study 
whose sample size was determine
d based on the results of previous studies. 
15.3 Analysis Populatio ns 
The analysis populations include the following: 156
PAION Confidential Page 67 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 The safety population will consist of all randomized patients who receive any amount of
study drug and will be analyzed as treated.
The intent- to-treat analysis set (ITT) will include all patients who were randomized and
will be analyzed as randomized.
The modified intent- to-treat analysis set (mITT) will include all patients included in the
ITT population who received at least one complete dose of study medication.
The per-protocol analysis set (PP) will include all patients from the ITT analysis set who:
received randomiz
ed treatment according to their randomization and the planned
treatment schedule.
did not have any major protocol violations.
Membership in the analysis populations will be determined prior to unblinding. 
All safe
ty analyses will be conducted on patients in the safety population and will be based on 
the actual treatment administered. 
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on patients in the 
ITT, mITT and PP populations and will 
be based on the tre
atment assigned at randomization.

The remaining patient characteristic variables will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_787497]. Summary statistics will consist of sample size (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum for continuous measurements; and 
numbers and percentages of patients for categorical measurements. For categorical variables, 
percentages will be based on the number of the patients in the analysis population. 157

03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 15.6 Efficacy Analysis 
15.6.1 Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy variable is success of the bronchoscopy procedure; a composite endpoint 
consisting of the following: 
Completion of the bronchoscopy procedure, AND
No requirement for a re
scue sedative medication, AND
No requirement of more
 than 5 doses of study medication within any 15 minute
window, ie 0-15, 1-16, 2-17 minutes, etc.  (For midaz olam only: no requirement for
more than 3 doses within any 12 minute window, ie
 0-12, 1-13,2-14 minutes, etc).
Exceeding 5 doses within any sliding 15 minute 
window in the blinded (remimazolam or 
placebo) arm will be considered a treatment failure. Exceeding 3 doses within any 12 minute 
sliding window in the open label midazolam arm will be considered a treatment failure. 
The primary efficacy analysis 
(success of the procedure using a composite endpoint) will be 
summarized descriptively for overall success and within each category for treatment group, with 
summaries to include the number and percentage of patients.  
For the primary efficacy analysis, the following 
primary hypothesis will be tested: 
H0: π Remi ≤ π PLA vs. H1: π Remi > π PLA, 
where π Remi and π PLA denote the success rates fo
r Remimazolam and placebo, respectively. The 
primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of these success rates between the 
remimazolam and placebo groups, using th e Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to account 
for fentanyl, opi[INVESTIGATOR_787438]. Three strata will be formed based on amount 
of fentanyl given during the study, chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], and chronic benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_67910]. The 
details of the strata will be decided at the end of the study by [CONTACT_787498]. 
The primary efficacy analysis 
will be based on the ITT, mITT and PP populations, with the 
mITT and PP population pla
nned to confirm the results of the ITT population. 
In the case that one of the strata contains all
 but 10 patients for the remimazolam or the placebo 
group, the other strata will be pooled if they are adjacent. If they are not adjacent, an unstratified 
[ADDRESS_1083371] will be used for the primary analysis. Similarly, if one of the strata contains all but 5 
patients for either the remimazolam or the placebo group, an unstratified ² test will be used for 
the primary analysis. 158

15.6.2 Secondary Analysis  
Comparisons between treatment groups will be performed in a descriptive manner on the 
following parameters: 
1. The time to start of procedure after administration of the first dose of study medication.
2.
3. The time to ready for discharge (defined as ability to walk unassisted) after the last
injection of study drug and after the end of bronchoscopy procedure (bron
choscope out).
4. The time to fully alert (time to first of three Modified Observer's Assessment of

All secondary efficacy va
riables will 
be compar

the three treatment groups. For the 
key secondary variables, only the pairwise comparison between midazolam and remimazolam 
will be used for efficacy significance testing. 
Variables 1-[ADDRESS_1083373]. Median time to event with the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval will be presented. Additional quartiles (25% and 75%) 
and confidence intervals will be presented. All the time to event analyses will also be presented 
in Kaplan-Meier curves. Patients who do not reach the fully alert or ready for discharge criteria 
will be censored at the time of their last assessment. To account for the different sedation 
properties of remimazolam and midazolam, the following additional stratification factors will be 
added: For variables 3 and 4, the mean MOAA/S score for the last [ADDRESS_1083374] injection 159

PAION Confidential Page 70 of 89 
CNS 7056- 008 
03 March 2016  Version: Amendment 5.0 of study drug or the mean MOAA/S score for the 3 minutes prior to bronchoscope out. For 
variables 1 and 2, 
such covariates will not be added as they aim at comparing the different 
sedation properties of remimazolam and midazolam. 
For secondary efficacy variables 5, 7-9 and 11 descriptive summaries (n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum), and summary graphs (mean ± SD) against assessment times will be 
provided. Overall and pairwise comparisons at each time point using ANOVA models with 
treatment as the main effect will be conducted for descriptive purposes.  
For secondary efficacy variables 6 and 10, which is binary/categorical, descriptive summaries 
will be provided to include the number and percentage of patients within each category for each 
treatment group.

requirement of repositi
oning and/or manual or mechanical ventilation), administration of 
additional fluids or medication or any interventions necessary due to a clinically relevant change 
in ECG. All analyses will be performed on the Safety population. 
15.7.1 Adverse Events  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs reported during treatment (at or after the start time 
of initial fentanyl injection administration) that are not present at Baseline, or that represent an 
exacerbation of an event that is present at Baseline. Any AE with an unknown start date and time 
will be considered treatment-emergent if the event does not discontinue prior to study drug 
administration. The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs will be displayed for each 
treatment group by [CONTACT_787499] (MedDRA). Pre-treatment AEs (reported from 
signing informed consent to before administration of study treatment) will be analyzed and 
displayed in a similar manner to TEAEs. 
Summaries in terms of severity and relationship to study drug will also be provided. Summaries 
of SAEs similar to those of AEs will be provided separately. By-patient listings of AEs causing 
discontinuation of study drug and SAEs will be produced. 
15.7.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
For qualitative clinical laboratory tests, the number and percentage of patients in each category 
will be displayed for each treatment group at each time point.  
For all laboratory tests, a shift table will be produced summarizing changes from baseline to the 
end of the treatment period by [CONTACT_1570].  
Individual data listings of laboratory results will be presented for each patient at all study visits 
(scheduled and non-scheduled), including normal range limits for each laboratory test. Out-of-
range results will be flagged, and determinations of whether the results were considered to be of 
clinical significance by [CONTACT_787500]. Clinically significant laboratory test 
abnormalities that are considered AEs by [CONTACT_787501]. 
15.7.3 Vital Signs and Pulse Oximetry  
Individual data listings of vital signs (supi[INVESTIGATOR_424092] t rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
calculated mean arterial pressure, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487])  will be presented for each 
patient at all visits (scheduled and non-scheduled). Pulse oximetry data (SpO 2) will be presented 
by [CONTACT_787502]-defined time points, and as oxygen saturation over time (AUC). 161

The number and percentage of patients with normal and abnormal 12 lead ECG findings will be 
displayed for each treatment group at each time point. Additionally, patients with normal ECG 
findings at baseline and abnormal ECG findings at each time point will also be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570]. For quantitative ECG variables (PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and 
QTc interval [corrected using the Bazett and Fridericia formulae]), descriptive statistics 
including the n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum will be given for the values 
themselves as well as for change from baseline, by [CONTACT_239497]. In 
continuous 3 lead ECG recording, all epi[INVESTIGATOR_787440], and any 
interventions that were instituted, even if the event had not been deemed an adverse event will be 
displayed.

A. Background: 
Enhanced recovery after s urgery (ERAS)  has become the standard of care for patients undergoing 
surgery for gynecological malignancies after the ERAS guidelines for gynecologic oncology were widely 
disseminated in 2016 .1,2 Regional analgesia can be a  part of a multimodal analgesic regimen leading to  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing effects.3  While epi[INVESTIGATOR_796534], they may  slow postoperative 
mobility , delay return of bowel function , prolong the need for urinary cathe ters, result in transient 
hypotension, and may be ineffective in as many as 50% of patients .4, 5 Alternate opi[INVESTIGATOR_796535].  
Intra thecal analgesia (ITA) has been shown to shorten time to return of bowel function and length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796536].5 Intrathecal analgesia is known to be effective after 
cesa rean delivery;[ADDRESS_1098677], and resulted in a reduction in patient -controlled analgesia 
from 33.35 to 4.1% (P<.001)  in patients undergoing laparotomy and complex cytoreduc tion for ovarian 
cancer.9 The advantages of wound infiltration are that it is quick, simple, inexpensive, and consistently 
effective. Intrathecal analgesia is currently used in less than 1% of our patients.   
Given that visceral pain which can be significant in tumor debulking is not targeted  by [CONTACT_796547][INVESTIGATOR_10319], combining ITA with incisional liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (ILB) to provide more intensive pain 
relief in the first 24 hours is a viable option. However, it is unclear if patient experience with pain 
management is improved with ITA given that opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277] (nausea, vomiting, itching) as 
well as rare advers e events related to spi[INVESTIGATOR_307844] (postural puncture headache) can occur. 
Additionally, ITA is invasive and expensive. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate whether ILB is 
non-inferior to a combination of ITA and ILB for management of postoperative pain after laparotomy for 
gynecological malignancy within an established enhanced recovery pathway  using the O verall Benefit of 
Analgesia Score  (OBAS)  as our primary outcome10. Additionally, we will evaluate cumulative 24 hour 
postoperative  morphine  milligram  equivalents (MME) consumption , pain scores , length of stay , cost,  
and patient satisfaction as secondary outcomes.  
B. Hypothesis and Aims  
Hypothesis:  Among women undergoing laparotomy for gynecological malignancy , the pain experience 
(as measured by [CONTACT_796548]) of those randomized to no additional intervention will be non -inferior to 
GYN- ITA-ILB_ V 2.0_ 01.07.[ADDRESS_1098678]  which includes incisional  ILB (in both arms) . 
Specific Aims

 Outcome s:  
Primary outcome:  
Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score ( OBAS) : The OBAS will be administered in the form of a questionnaire to be 
filled out by [CONTACT_796550] (preoperatively) and at 24 hours ( ±2 hours) postoperatively.  The OBAS 
consists of 7 items that assess pain intensity, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse effects and patient satisfaction with pain 
management.  The composite score ranges from 0 (best) to 28 (worst).

5 Exploratory end point:  
QoR 1511: The QoR  15 will be administered in the form of a questionnaire to be filled out by [CONTACT_796551] 
24 hours ( ±2 hours) postoperatively  for the purposes of validation. 
Sa
mple size  calculation  
The primary outcome will be the mean OBAS  score measured at 24 hours postoperative. Using a non -
inferiority margin of +3 points, SD of 5 , power of 90% , and 1-sided two-sample equal variance t -test with 
an alpha  of 0.05, the sample size is 49 p articipants  per group, 98 p articipants total. If it is  determined 
after randomization that a participant will need an additional spi[INVESTIGATOR_315680], they will be evaluated for 
data. We will perform intention- to-treat analysis including these participants as well as per-p rotocol 
analysis excluding them.  Based o n our data, this would be a rare situation as <1% of our current 
patients need a spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]. The sample size will be increased by 5% to maintain power for the per- protocol 
analysis. Increasing the sample size by 5% changes the sample size to 52 subjects per ar m, for a total of 
104 subjects.   
We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_796542] (20 patients) in order to obtain an estimate of the SD 
specific to our patient population.  The SD reported in the literature varies from [ADDRESS_1098682] descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_796552] (SD) or median (IQR) for 
continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables will 
be compa red between the two treatment arms using the two -sample t -test or the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test as appropriate.  Categorical variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using the chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test. For the primary outcome, the mean OBAS score between the 
two groups will be presented along with the upper limit of the  95% confidence bound  for the mean 
difference .  We will conclude non -inferiority if this upper limit is less than the predefined limit for non -
inferiority.  Mu ltivariable regression models will be fit to assess for differences in outcomes if there are 
unbalanced baseline covariates in the two treatment arms.  
The primary analysis will be restricted to per- protocol patients and will mirror that of the POP -UP trial, 
which was a non -inferiority trial that evaluated the effectiveness of continuous wound infiltration in 
patients undergoing hepato -pancreato -biliary surgery.
12  An intention -to-treat analysis will be 
performed as a secondary analysis based on the rationale that such an analysis in  a non -inferiority trial 
might introduce bias to no diff erence.

 A thorough review of the data for inconsistencies and outliers will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_796553].  Data issues will be resolved by [CONTACT_796554].  The extent of missing data will be examined and sensitivity analyses of the primary and 
secondary outcomes will be conducted using multiple imputation if warranted.  All statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS or R.

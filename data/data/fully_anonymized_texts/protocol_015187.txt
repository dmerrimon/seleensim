to inpatients with documented COIVD-19 infection  
1.1.2. To measure NAb titers in an aliquot of the CP administered, to measure 
the volume of CP administered, and determine whether there is a 
correlation between the NAb dose (in NAb units/kg body weight, where a 
unit is the reciprocal of the endpoint NAb titer in the CP multiplied by [CONTACT_644857]) and change or lack of change when comparing pre-treatment 
and day one NAb titers.  
1.2. Secondary, exploratory objectives
1.2.1. To evaluate the safety of convalescent plasma (CP) administration in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-19 patients 
1.2.2. To evaluate viral shedding of SARSCoV-2 in nasopharyngeal or nasal samples 
before and on days 3, 7, and 14 after CP transfusion 
1.2.3. To perform genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 from patients before and after 
treatment with CP transfusion 
1.2.4.Determine cumulative incidence of disease severity (transfer to ICU, type of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], LOS, and mortality) 
2. Background
Passive antibody treatment involves the administration of antibodies against a specific infection 
to a susceptible individual to treat or ameliorate the severity of the disease caused by [CONTACT_644858]. Plasma from patients that have recovered from the infection is harvested and 
administered to the non-immune. The use of this modality of treatment dates back to the 
1890´s, but it popularity decreased during the antibiotic era.(Casadevall, 2020)
During the current SARSCoV-2 pandemic, with its associated high mortality and morbidity and 
the lack of demonstrated and effective treatment or vaccine, the induction of immunity with the 
transfusion of convalescent plasma offers a therapeutic alternative. 
Convalescent plasma was studied during the SARS epi[INVESTIGATOR_644835] 80 patients in Hong Kong.(Cheng 
2005)  Those treated before day 14 from had improved prognosis defined by [CONTACT_402179][INVESTIGATOR_129648] 22, consistent with the notion that earlier administration is more likely to be 
effective. There is also anecdotal information on the use of convalescent serum in seriously ill 
individuals. Three patients with SARS in Taiwan were treated with 500 mL convalescent serum, 
resulting in a reduction in serum virus titer, and each survived (Yeh 2005) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 6 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020There are reports that convalescent serum was used for therapy of patients with COVID-19 in 
China during the current outbreak. In an open label study, 5 patients received transfusion with 
convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2– specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 
(end point dilution titer, by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization 
titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who 
recovered from COVID-19 (Shen 2020). Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 
22 days after admission. In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with 
COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was 
followed by [CONTACT_644859].
In another study, 10 patients were treated with one dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) 
derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 in 
addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents Duan 2020). The clinical symptoms were 
significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several 
parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte 
counts (0.65×109/L vs. 0.76×109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 
mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 
days. In none of these two trials serious adverse events associated with the use of CP were 
reported.
More recently, the FDA has endorsed the use of CP under an emergency IND, specific guidance 
on donor and potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_644836]. 
(https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download)
Little is known about how the treatment with CP affects the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s immune response to the 
infection with SARS-CoV-2. What levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are obtained in 
patients transfused? Is there association between neutralizing antibody titers and clinical 
outcomes? In the study by [CONTACT_644860], with 10 patients treated with CP, the neutralizing 
antibody titers of five patients increased and four patients remained at the same level after CP 
transfusion. However, neither study performed a comparison between the NAb dosing adjusted 
for body weight versus resulting NAb levels in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
In light of limited availability of CP and the urgent need for promising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135297]-19, it 
will not be initially feasible to measure NAb titers in the convalescent plasma (CP) prior to 
plasma administration or to adjust the volume of CP to be administered based on NAb titer in 
the CP or the body weight or plasma volume of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  However, while this study does 
not involve administration of plasma with known NAb titer, information gained from the 
current study may help inform dosing in the future, including in potential dosing modifications 
that could be submitted via a protocol modification.    
PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 7 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020The correlation between the levels or titers of neutralizing antibodies after CP transfusion and 
viral shedding has not been sufficiently explored. Are certain levels of neutralizing antibodies 
associated with viral clearance? In the study by [CONTACT_644860]., the viral load was undetectable 
after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia (Duan et al.) We propose to 
monitor viral shedding in respi[INVESTIGATOR_644837]. The presence of the virus 
is relevant for transmission, especially in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].

1. Vital sign testing: Immediately prior to infusion, 10-20 minutes after start of infusion, at completion of infusion 
and 30-60 minutes after the end of the infusion
2. Sampling can include nasopharyngeal, nasal or oropharyngeal swabs.
13. Data Analysis
13.1.1. We will determine whether there is a correlation between the NAb dose 
(in NAb units/kg body weight, where a unit is the reciprocal of the endpoint 
NAB titer in the CP multiplied by [CONTACT_644868]) and change or lack of 
change when comparing pre-treatment and day one NAb titers.  We will 
also compare changes in pre- and post-treatment NAb titers based on NAb 
dosing calculated in units/BSA and units/calculated plasma volume to see if 
either measurement provides a better prediction of changes in NAb titers in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].    
13.2. Data analysis will be limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644845]-CoV-2 infection by [CONTACT_644869][INVESTIGATOR_135608] (nasal or oral swabs or endotracheal fluid) or blood or by 
[CONTACT_644870].  Subjects without laboratory-confirmed COVID 19 will be 
excluded from analysis.  
Neutralizing antibody titers in the patient’s first blood sample (day 0) will be compared 
by [CONTACT_644871] (Wilcoxon) test between patients who develop any of the secondary 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 14 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020clinical end-points and patients who do not develop these secondary endpoints. The 
same comparison will be performed to evaluate NAb titers with other parameters such 
as age >65 and <65, presence or absence of diabetes, or presence or absence 
hydroxychloroquine therapy. These analyses of day 0 Nab titers aim to characterize 
patient heterogeneity in Nab titers in relationship to patient demographic and clinical 
characteristics.   
We will also analyze the association between NAb titers at day 0 with duration of viral 
shedding, duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644846].
Our primary endpoint for statistical analysis is changes in NAb titers at day 1, 3, 7, and 
14 from the entry level (day 0).  Our primary hypothesis is that Nab titers will increase 
post-transfusion in positive correlation with transfused volume of convalescent plasma 
when adjusted for NAb titer in the convalescent plasma. We will use repeated 
measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) when 
controlling for other factors (e.g. use of hydroxychloroquine) for initial exploration of 
the association with the transfusion volume of convalescent plasma. A more advanced 
approach is to use nonlinear regression models with random effects to characterize the 
trajectory of Nab titers over the course of 14 days. This latter approach can effectively 
characterize individual-specific trajectory in Nab titers in relation to convalescent 
plasma, and at the same time quantify between-patients variation, thereby [CONTACT_644872]. This mixed-effects nonlinear regression modeling approach is also 
capable of adjusting for other factors as appropriate (e.g. patient age). We will also 
conduct post-hoc analysis of change in Nab titers from day 0 to a specific day (day 1, 3, 
7, or 14) post transfusion of convalescent plasma when appropriate.   Better 
understanding and better characterization of the relationship between Nab titers and 
amount of convalescent plasma transfusion adjusted for NAb titer in the convalescent 
plasma will inform standardized dosage for future study.   
In the absence of a comparison group, we will use descriptive statistics to report other 
parameters of interest (e.g. secondary outcomes), including the use of mean (SD), 
frequency (%) and their confidence interval. When appropriate, we will also report 
association between a parameter of interest and a factor of clinical relevance (e.g. 
duration of shading and underlying comorbidities, Nab titers at a specific post-
transfusion day and underlying comorbidities, Nab titers at a specific post-transfusion 
day and secondary outcomes such as transfer to ICU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473]). This analysis 
will utilize odds ratio and Fisher’s test for dichotomous variables, and Wilcoxon test a 
continuous variable. 
We will conduct interim analysis after the first 10 patients complete the study. Based 
on the interim analysis results we may consider submitting a protocol amendment 
requesting adjustment our patient recruitment or CP dosing.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 15 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020Given that we have a large number of clinical parameters of potential interest and a small sample 
of [ADDRESS_863324] for multiplicity of 
comparisons (e.g. associations) using False Discovery Rate (FDR) in reporting our findings.  
13.3. Sample size.  A sample size determination is less plausible for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_644847]. 
However, we will conduct a post-hoc statistical power analysis to determine the actual 
power with the sample we obtain. 
14. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
14.1. A DSMB will be convened to include clinicians specializing in clinical trials, 
transfusion medicine and biostatisticians. The roster will be provided in a Modification 
for HRRC approval once the DSMB has been created.
14.2. The safety information that will be collected and monitored as follows: reports 
of rapid deterioration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_228180]-CoV-2 
convalescent plasma and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events during the 
study period: febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, allergic transfusion reaction, 
transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated circulatory 
overload (TACO), transfusion related infection, and hemolytic transfusion reaction.
14.3. Review of data after [ADDRESS_863325] 10 patients enrolled and periodically thereafter. 
14.6. The conditions that would trigger a suspension or termination of the research 
(i.e., stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]), are as follows:
a. If available published information convincingly reports non-efficacy or significant 
safety concerns with the use of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma.
b. If an unexpectedly high incidence of serious adverse events judged to be related to 
SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma is detected in these critically ill COVID-19 
patients during the trial in the clinical judgetment of the investigators 
compared to that expected in similarly ill patients receiving normal donor 
plasma in the clinical judgement of the investigators.

Page 16 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020c. If there is an unanticipated safety signal, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_644848].
14.7. Findings will be reported to the HRRC within [ADDRESS_863326] been enrolled and end-points reached. The results will be presented to 
the HRRC and investigators.
15. Withdrawal of Subjects
15.1. Subjects will be withdrawn if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167246], in consultation with the treating 
clinician(s) that continuation in the study is not in the participant’s best interest. 
Subjects may also withdraw (or be withdrawn by [CONTACT_644873] a member of the study team.
15.2. If a patient develops a serious adverse event that may be probably or definitely 
related to the CP, during the infusion, that may trigger the discontinuation of the 
offending drug.
15.3. If a participant is withdrawn from the study, chart review will continue to be 
performed to track the participant’s clinical outcomes.
15.4. Data and specimens collected before withdrawal will not be removed from the 
study.
16. Data Management/Confidentiality
16.1. Participants will be assigned a randomly generated study ID that will be linked to

PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 17 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/202018.1 Published data on convalescent antibody administration in SARS (Cheng 2005 and 
Yeh 2005) and SARS and MERS (Mair-Jenkins 2015), and preliminary data on 
convalescent plasma administration in COVID-19 (Shen 2020 and Duan 2020), also 
suggests that CP is safe and well tolerated.  
18. 2 One theoretical risk involves the phenomenon of antibody-mediated enhancement 
of infection (ADE). ADE can occur for several viral diseases and involves an enhancement 
of disease in the presence of certain antibodies. For coronaviruses, several mechanisms 
for ADE have been described and there is the theoretical concern that antibodies to one 
type of coronavirus could enhance infection to another viral strain (Casadevall, 2020). It 
may be possible to predict the risk of ADE of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_863328] the same 
virus, SARS2-CoV-2, ADE may be unlikely. The available evidence from the use of 
convalescent plasma in patients with SARS1 and MERS and anecdotal evidence of its use 
in patients with COVID-19 (Casadevall 2020), suggest it is safe. Nevertheless, caution 
and vigilance will be required in for any evidence of enhanced infection. Both COVID-[ADDRESS_863329] any reports suggesting ADE to the IRB.
18.2 Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those infected by [CONTACT_7544]-
CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals 
mount attenuated immune responses, thereby [CONTACT_644875]-infection. It will not be feasible to assess this risk in data collected in this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-
based treatment study, but we will monitor the emerging scientific literature and report 
any concerning findings to the IRB.
18.3 There are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of 
transfusion transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, 
anaphylaxis to transfusion, febrile transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung 
injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should 
ABO incompatible plasma be administered.  In order to minimize the risks of disease 
transmission, donors will fulfill donor requirements for blood donation with the 
exception of recent illness, in this case COVID-19 infection.
18.4 Venipuncture can cause bruising, bleeding and mild discomfort. It is infrequently 
associated with infection.  To minimize the risk of phlebotomy, only adequately trained

Page 18 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/2020study personnel or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644849].  Blood volumes to be obtained 
fall within OHRP guidelines for minimal risk studies.  Alternative procedures are not 
feasible.
18.[ADDRESS_863330] confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_51856]:  All 
records will be kept in a locked file.  All computer entry and networking will be 
performed with coded numbers only.  Clinical information will not be released without 
written permission from the subject.  Access to identified, source records will be limited 
to the local site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89560].  
18.6. 1.1.1.     Mild to discomfort from obtaining NP.  Nasal swabs can be performed 
without discomfort or risk. To minimize discomfort from obtaining nasal or NP swabs, 
these will be obtained by [CONTACT_128490], and subjects who cannot tolerate 
NP swabs will only have nasal swabs obtained.
 
19. Potential Benefits to Subjects
A key potential benefit is treatment for established infection.  Convalescent plasma would be 
administered to those with clinical disease in an effort to reduce their symptoms and mortality. 
Based on the historical experience with antibody administration, it can be anticipated that 
antibody administration relatively early in the course of disease would be more effective in 
preventing disease progression than in the treatment of established severe disease.
Given that historical and current anecdotal data on use of convalescent plasma suggest it is safe 
in coronavirus infection, the high mortality of COVID-19, particularly in elderly and vulnerable 
persons, suggests that the benefits of its use in those at high risk for or with early disease 
outweigh the risks. However, for all cases where convalescent plasma administration is 
considered, a risk-benefit assessment must be conducted to assess individual variables.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 19 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/202022.1. The study is responsible for the cost of any research-related procedures. The 
participant and/or third party payer is responsible for any standard of care procedures. 
22.2. Investigators do not anticipate any additional costs. 
23. Compensation
No compensation will be given to study participants.
24. Compensation for Research-Related Injury
 The University of New Mexico does not have funds set aside to pay for the cost of any care or 
treatment that might be necessary or for any wages lost as a result of participating in this study. 
Medical costs to care and treatment of study related harm will be billed to the participant 
and/or third party payer. 
25. Consent Process
25.1. An approved member of the study team will conduct the consent process with 
the participant and/or their LAR in a private area of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_644850]. 
If applicable, impartial witness will be utilized as needed (witness/translator for Spanish 
speaking participant and impartial witness for phone consent). 
25.2. It may not be possible to have an in-person discussion of the study with 
participants or their LAR. Documenting written informed consent in these instances 
must involve a process as follows: the participant or their LAR receives a copy of the 
informed consent document in advance of a telephone discussion. The investigator 
obtains consent over the telephone with the participant or their LAR. If LAR consented 
via phone, a copy of the consent will be mailed to LAR. 
25.3. The informed consent form may be mailed, emailed or faxed to the participant 
or their LAR. The consent discussion may then be conducted by [CONTACT_644876]’s LAR can read the consent form during the discussion.
25.4. Investigators will explain the study to the potential participant or their LAR by 
[CONTACT_644877]/or LAR, providing all 
pertinent information (purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to 
participation), and allowing the potential participant or their LAR ample opportunity to 
ask questions. This can be done by [CONTACT_48052]. 
25.5. Investigators will ensure a thorough verbal discussion by [CONTACT_644878]. Investigators will allow the potential participant or LAR time to read 
the consent form and allow the participant or their LAR sufficient time to consider 
whether or not to participate in the research.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Open, non-comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_644834]-19 
Page 20 of 30Version: 1 Date: 5/04/202025.6. Investigators will ensure the potential participant or their LAR additional 
questions s/he may have are addressed. 
25.7. Participants and/or their LAR will be asked to explain the purpose of the study, 
procedures involved, and/or conditions for participation to confirm understanding.
25.8. If the participant or LAR agrees to participation, s/he signs the consent form and 
returns it to the investigator for signature [CONTACT_3670]. The signed and dated consent form 
can be returned to investigators by [CONTACT_2319], facsimile, or by [CONTACT_644879] a secure e-mail account. 
25.9. Once the signed form is received, the investigator who conducted the informed 
consent will sign and date the consent and will ensure the participant or their LAR 
receives a copy of the fully signed consent form. The fully signed original consent form 
will be filed with the participant’s study records.   
25.10. Ongoing consent from participants and and/or their LAR will be ascertained as 
research procedures are being conducted.
25.11. Alternately, on a case-by-by [CONTACT_413], and per the FDA regulation 21
CFR 50.23 Exception from general requirements, the following will be done:
(a) The obtaining of informed consent shall be deemed feasible unless, before use
of the test article (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), both the
investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical
investigation certify in writing all of the following:

2. Data collection of de-identified data, if done in a clinical setting or other setting that 
does not allow direct entry into a secured system, may be done temporarily using a 
personal or university owned electronic storage device or hard copy document. The 
important security safeguard is that no identifiers be included if the data is entered or 
stored using an untrusted device or storage.
3.Permanent (during data analysis, after study closure) storage must reside on HSC 
central IT managed storage. Processing of data (aggregation, etc.) are to be carried out 
in such a way as to avoid creating/retaining files on untrusted storage 
devices/computers. Trusted devices are HSC managed and provide one or more of the 
following safeguards: access logs, encryption keys, backups, business continuity and 
disaster recovery capabilities.

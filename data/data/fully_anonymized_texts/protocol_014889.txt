3.0 Objectives of the Clinical Study  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the necessity of adjunctive therapy following treatment of stenoses of a mature native AV dialysis access circuit fistula or graft with the Enforcer b alloon compared to stenoses initially treated with commercially 
available conventional balloon angioplasty.  4.0 Device Description  
4.1 Intended Use  
The Enforcer  balloon is intended for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 
lesions in peripheral arteries including iliac, renal, popliteal, infrapopliteal, femoral and iliofemoral as well as obstructive lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistulae. This device is n ot for use in the cerebral or coronary vasculature. 
 For this study, the Enforcer balloon will be used in the treatment of obstructive lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistula.  
4.2 General Device Description  
The Enforcer balloon is a double-lumen catheter with a balloon near its distal tip. Four 
polymer elements are incorporated into the balloon, which provide f ocal-force upon 
inflation. These elements will aid in opening lesions. Platinum/iridium, radiopaque 
markers are positioned on the shaft within the balloon to enable visualization of the catheter/balloon under fluoroscopy. The catheter is compatible with 0.035 inch 
(0.89 mm) wire guides.

1 
 A prospective, single- arm, single -center clinical evaluation of the Enforcer balloon was 
previously conducted to evaluate the treatment of A V access stenos es.
2 The study 
evaluated the treatment of 39 AV fistula lesions in 28 patients who  were treated with 37 
Enfo rcer balloons; patients were followed for [ADDRESS_383001]-procedure. Device success, 
defined as < 30% residual stenosis immediately following treatment was 64.1% (25/39). Similarly, 92.3% (36/39) of lesions were reduced to < 50% residual stenosis. Overall, 
treatment with the Enforcer balloon led to a reduction in the average percent diameter 
stenosis of the treated lesion from 66.3% pre-procedure to 23.7% post-procedure. The average maximum inflation pressure required was  12.3 atm. Only one lesion  required 
adjunctive treatment following angioplasty with the study balloon, indicating that

 Page 10 of 34 007-13 03.01T  clinically relevant luminal gains can be achieved with the study device alone, without the 
need for a high pressure balloon or other additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Following the study procedure, all patients could resume normal dialysis. The Kaplan -
Meier estimates for patency at 90 days and 6 months were 62.0% and 25.1%, 
respectively. The rate of access site complications were low (1/28; 3.6%). Overall, the 
data supported the safety of the Enforcer ballon for the treatment of stenotic lesions in mature native AV hemodialysis access circuits.

9.1 Pre-procedure 
A pre -procedural clinical assessment will be com pleted and will include patient 
demographics and medical history. Baseline data will be collected and recorded on 
appropriate eC RFs. Baseline angiography should be performed prior to study enrollment 
to assess and document study lesion(s) characteristics including length, location , and 
percent (%)  stenosis. Up to two  distinct lesions can be treated within the dialysis acces s 
circuit. Pre-treatment for thrombosed dialysis access circuits may be performed (e.g., 
thrombectomy or  thrombolysis) prior to enrollment in the study. Also, central venous 
lesions that require treatment (i.e., >50% stenosis) to meet eligibility criteria must be 
treated successfully prior to treatment of the study lesion . Successful treatment of the 
central veins is defined as less than  30% residual stenosis.  
 Once baseline angiography is complete and patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized as described in Section 7.4.1 into either the Enforcer  balloon or 
conventional angioplasty balloon (defined as balloons with rated burst pressure of less 
than 25 atm) group prior to treatment.   Assessment(s) required to be completed  prior to patient enrollment are  summarized  in

into the patient’s body. 9.3 Study Procedure  
PTA with either the Enforcer  balloon or conventional angioplasty balloon will be 
performed  and recorded  in accordance with the manufacturer’s IFU to achieve a residual 
stenosis <  30%. The balloon diameter may  be chosen based on the recommendations in 
the IFU. If necessary, the balloon could be deflated, repositioned, and re- inflated to 
achieve a residual stenosis < 30%. Inflation details (e.g., maximum pressure and duration 
of inflations) will be recorded on an appropriate e CRF. Conventional angioplasty 
balloons are defined as those having a rated burst pressure less than  25 atmospheres. 
Completion angiography to assess percent residual stenosis  of the treated study lesion(s) 
should be performed immediately fol lowing the study procedure ( initial treatment with 
Enforcer or conventional angioplasty balloon) and p rior to beginning any adjunctive 
procedures. 
 The physician may also perform adjunctive procedures (e.g., using a high -pressure 
balloon, cutting balloon, stent , or stent graft ) if in the  best interest of the patient. High -
pressure angioplasty balloons are defined as those having a rated burst pressure greater 
than or equal to 25 atmospheres. The  adjunctive procedure may  be performed in 
accordance with the device manufacturer’s IFU to achieve a residual stenosis < 30%. Completion angiography following any adjunctive procedures should also be performed . 
Any additional procedures performed will be documented on the appropriate e CRF.  
 All angiographic images and medical charges (i.e., UB -04 or CMS-1500) should be 
provided to the Sponsor on the appropriate eCRF. Total procedure time (defined as the time from needle entry for intervention to sheath withdrawal) as well as  total procedural 
charges will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF s. 
 Type (s) and level (s) of sedation provided during the procedure will be recorded  on the 
appropriate eCRF . A single assessment representing the pain associated with balloon 
inflations during the procedure is recommended to be recorded at  or before  the time of  
the patient’s discharge assessment. Patients will be instructed to rate the pain they feel

suspend enrollment or terminate the study at an individual clinical site. Reasons for early 
termination or suspension of a study (or at one or more sites) may be due to safety  
concerns,  effectiveness concerns, ethical concerns, alterations in accepted clinical 
practice, clinical site performance, or organizational issues. In the event of clinical site or 
study closure, a ll patients who have received the study tre atment  will be followed for 90 
days following the study procedure.  
 
The p rincipal investigator -required  notifications/reports are described in Table 10.2-1. 
The reports wi ll be provided as required by [CONTACT_311145], IRB policies, or local 
regulations, whichever is more stringent .

 Page 21 of 34 007-13 03.01T  11.0 Statistical Considerations 
11.1 Sample Size  
The expected rates of adjunctive therapy for the Enforcer balloon and conventional 
angioplasty groups were assumed to be 5% and 15%, respectively. A sample size of at 
least 250 total lesions (125 lesions per group) is required to detect a 10% difference in the 
rate of adjunctive therapy  with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.05. Prior 
experience suggests that 40% of patients, on average, would also have a second lesion 
treated . Therefore the study will enroll approximately 200 patients (approximately 100 
patients per group) and enrollment will continue until at least [ADDRESS_383026] longer -term 
outcomes, and therefore lesions were assumed to be independent for the purposes of the sample size calculation.   
 Up to 10 clinical sites will be included in the study , and t he maximum enrollment per 
clinical site will be no more than 80 patients or 40% of the total enrollment. There is n o 
minimum enrollment threshold. Patients that withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
11.2  Randomization 
Once patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized into either the Enforcer 
balloon or conventional angioplasty group prior to treatment in a 1:[ADDRESS_383027] stratified by [CONTACT_311146] 
(singl e lesion or two lesions) and type of AV access circuit (fistula or graft). Using 
restricted  randomization maximize s the balance of treatment allocations within stratum 
and vice vers a. Randomization codes will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.3  Analyses  
11.3.1 Primary endpoint analysis 
The study is intended to compare the necessity of adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_311127] (Enforcer balloon) compared to those treated with the control 
device (conventional angioplasty balloon inflated to standard pressures). The null (H
0) 
and alternative (H A) hypotheses are expressed as follows:

 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 22 of 34 007-13 03.01T  H0: AT EB ≥ AT CA 
HA: AT EB < AT CA 
 
where AT EB is the rate of adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_311128]. 
 The rates of adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_311129] a one- sided Z -test. A p-value < .05 will be used to claim statistical significance. If 
the number of patients within each  strata are sufficiently large, the association of 
stratification factors and treatment will be assessed. Crude and adjusted , if applied, 
differences  in rate of adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_311130] 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported .  
11.3.2 Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Differences in pain, procedural costs, procedure times, and maximum balloon pressure 
will be assessed overall by  [CONTACT_31806]- sided  t-tests, with Enforcer balloon having favorable 
outcomes. In addition, regression model s will be used to incorporate the stratification 
factors as covariates and reported if found to be significant. If the parametric assumptions 
are not met , nonparametric methods will be used. The safety claim will be evaluated with 
a Z-statistic, with  a non- inferiority  of Enforcer balloon at a margin of 10%. The observed 
non-inferiority margin will also be presented.  
 Adjustments for multiplicity will be made using the Holm procedure to control the family -wise error rate to 0.[ADDRESS_383029] suggests a difference. If the 
parametric assumptions are not met, nonparametric methods will be used. Survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan -Meier or Cox Proportional Hazards will be 
incorporated if censoring of data occurs.  Key components of the additional measures may also be compared, including specific adverse events associated with the procedure, such as vessel rupture or tear.

 Page 23 of 34 007-13 03.01T  11.4 Missing Data  
For the primary endpoint, minimal or no missing data is expected. Missing primary 
outcome will be assumed missing at random and excluded for analyses. However, if more 
than 5% of primary endpoint is missing, multiple imputation technique will be applied 
followed by [CONTACT_224986]. All the other measurements will be analyzed accordingly with all available data using a complete case approach . 
11.5 Site-level Poolability  
This is a multi-c enter  study with up to 10 clinical sites. It is not intended to incorporate 
study sites into primary endpoint analyses. However, the primary endpoint will be 
examined across sites  and reported  if necessary .

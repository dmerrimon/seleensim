Study Assessments: OS is the primary endpoint of the study. OS will be followed conti nuously wh ile subjects are 
on the study drugs and every [ADDRESS_577069] discontinued the study drugs. 
Subjects will be assessed for res ponse by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
beginning at 6 weeks ( ±5 days) (from the first dose of study treatment) and continuing every 6 weeks ( ±5 days) 
until Week 30 and then every 12 weeks ( ±5 days). Tumor assessment will continue until disease progression (or 
until discontinuation of study d rug in p atients receiving nivolumab beyond progression), lost to follow-up, 
withdrawal of study consent, or the study ends. All randomized subjects will be evaluated.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: A total of approximately 560 subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 into two arms: Arm A 
(nivolumab); Arm B (chemotherapy – ie, topotecan or amrubicin). This includes approximately 78 subjects enrolled 
in China (~ 16% of the 480 subjects planned to be  randomized in global populatio n). If n ecessary, the China 
enrollment will continue until the pr e-specified sample size of the China sub-population is filled. Additional 
analyses exploring the consistency of findings in the C hina sub-population may be conducted. Details of these 
analyses will be provided in the analysis plan.
The decision to incorporate the China sub-population into the overall population for analysis is the result of a review 
of the protocol statistical assumptions in comparison to recent data from the CA209032 study in 2L+ SCLC subjects (Hellman MD et al, 2017). The data from CA209032, which we re not available at the time of protocol design, 
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577070] at the overall alpha level of 0.05 
(two-sided). For sample size calculation, non-proportional hazard model with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_91909] e xponential distributions 
in both arms are assumed. Based on published survival curves for topotecan, a 2-pi[INVESTIGATOR_452682] 8-month median OS and taking into account that a limited number of subjects might receive immuno-oncology
agents as subsequent therapy in this open-label study, a conservative 5% 2-year survival rate is assumed for the 
control arm. A delayed effect for ni volumab with a hazard ratio (HR) of [ADDRESS_577071] 8 months and an HR of 0.5 
thereafter is assumed 
The final analysis will take p lace 34 months after FPFV and no for mal inter im analysis will be conducted. It is 
anticipated that approximately  480 events will be observed at the time of the analysis, leading to 90% power to 
detect a difference in overall survival as tested v ia a log-rank test with a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_577072] ®Software (version 6.4.1).
The secondary endpoints PFS and ORR will be tested hierarchically.

Expected number of event at 34 months 482
Endpoints: The primary endpoint for the st udy is OS. It is defined as the time from randomization to the date of 
death. A subject who has not died will be censored at last known date alive. OS will be followed continuously while 
subjects are on the study drug and every [ADDRESS_577074] after subjects discontinue the study drug. Secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS.
Analyses: All hypothesis testing will be two-sided based on a significance level of 0.05 except for OS. If superiority 
of OS is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing a pproach for the key secondary endpoints will be used to 
preserve a study-wise type I error rate at 0.05. The key secondary endpoints will be tested in the following 
hierarchical order: 1) PFS
2) ORR
The formal statistical testing for PFS will take place only if OS is statistically signifi cant and the statistical testing 
for ORR will take place only if both OS and PFS are statistically significant.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
CA209331 is a rando mized, open-label, multinational Phase 3 trial of nivolumab (also known as 
BMS-936558) monotherapy versus chemotherapy in subjects with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
whose disease has relapsed or progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. This study will d etermine if nivolumab improves overall survival (OS) over chemotherapy in this 
subject population. Additional objectives include further characterization of the efficacy, adverse 
event profile, pharmacokinetics, patient reported outcomes, and potential predictive biomarkers of nivolumab in subjects with SCLC.
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Rationale for Investigating Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
SCLC accounts for 15 to 20% of new cases of  lung cancer, and near ly 33,900 new cases are 
expected in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in 2012.
1SCLC is traditionally classified as Limited Stage 
Disease (LD-SCLC: tumor tissue encompassed within a single radiation port) and Extensive 
Stage Disease (ED-SCLC: tumor that extends beyond the boundaries of a single radiation port).2
For LD-SCLC, or Stage IA- IIIB lo calized disease (T1-4, N0-3, M 0), a combined therapeutic 
approach of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and rarely surgery is used with curative intent.3Most 
patients at diagnosis have ED-SCLC, or Stage IV  disease, and are treated with four to six cycles 
of platinum plus etoposide (PE) which remains the standard chemotherapy regimen for LD- and 
ED-SCLC.4Initial response rate is robust with 70 to 90% response seen in LD-SCLC and 50 to 
70% response seen in ED- SCLC.3However, overall survival remains poor with median survival 
for LD-SCLC at [ADDRESS_577082]-line therapy, about 80% LD-SCLC patients and all of ED SCLC patients have disease progression.
7Patients whose response after first-line platinum-based 
therapy last beyond [ADDRESS_577083] ine (CAV) which showed an improved 
objective response rate (ORR, 24.3% vs 18.3%, P = 0.285) while median survival was similar 
between two arms (25 weeks vs 24.7 weeks).8In another Phase 3 trial comparing supportive care 
alone with supportive care with oral topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC, the median 
survival was s tatistic ally significantly improved for the topotecan arm (25.9 weeks [95% 
confidence interval {CI}, 18.3 to 31.6]), compared to s upportive care only (13.9 weeks [95% CI, 
11.1 to 18.6]).9In a randomized Phase 3 trial of amrubicin versus topotecan as second-line 
treatment for patients with SCLC, amrubicin di d not improve survival when compared with 
topotecan.10For second-line SCLC, the median OS was 6.7 months based on a meta analysis 
using 21 studies published between 1984 and 2011.11In summary, there is a high unmet medical 
need for the treatment of patients with recurrent or relapsed SCLC.

1.1.2 Rationale for Immuno-oncology Therapeutic Approaches in SCLC
An analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SCLC p atients has shown a 
higher number of T-effector cells in LD-SCLC compared to ED-SCLC sub jects and long-term 
survivors of SCLC have a higher T-effector to T regulator ratio.12In a Phase 2 randomized 
study, phased ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (placebo plus paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_452683]/carboplatin) showed improved progression free survival (PFS) versus ca rboplatin and 
paclitaxel (5.[ADDRESS_577084] Ratio (HR) = 0.72, P = 0.05), though there was no

Preliminary results in a Phase 1/2 trail wi th nivolumab in SCLC are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Considering the immune response seen in SCLC patients, and the results of checkpoint inhibitors 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251336], it is reasonable to expect that nivolumab monotherapy is likely to provide benefit in second-line treatment of SCLC.
1.1.3 Rationale for Nivolumab 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds the programmed death 
receptor-1 (PD-1) on activated immune cells and di srupts engagement of the receptor with its 
ligands PD-L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), thereby [CONTACT_452698]. Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1, 
CD279), a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein, is a member of the CD28 family of T-cell 
co-stimulatory receptors that also includes CD28, CTLA 4, ICOS, and BTLA.2 PD-1 contains an 
intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD-[ADDRESS_577085] been identified: PD-L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273). PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 have been shown to dow n-regulate T-cell activation upon bindi ng to PD-[ADDRESS_577086] genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self antigens.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577087] shown that blockade by [CONTACT_4002]-1 by [CONTACT_20403] (mAbs) can enhance the anti-tumor immune response and result in tumor rejection. Antitumor activity by [CONTACT_4002]-[ADDRESS_577088] mechanisms (ie, expression 
of PD-L1 in antigen-presenting cells) limit the antitumor response. Consequently, both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors may be targeted using this approach. In humans, constitutive PD-L1 expression is normally limited to macr ophage-lineage cells, although expression of 
PD-L1 can be induced on other hematologic cells  as well, including activated T cells. However, 
aberrant expression of PD-L1 by [CONTACT_66846] a number of human malignancies. PD-L1 expressed by [CONTACT_452699] T cells in vitro. Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 may pro tect the tu mor cells 
from the induction of apoptosis by [CONTACT_20411] T cells. Additional details are available in the Nivolumab Investigator Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1/2 Data for Nivolumab in SCLC
In a Phase 1/2 study of nivolumab with or without ipi[INVESTIGATOR_120958] 
(CA209032) subjects who were platinum sensit ive or refractory, and had progressive disease 
were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 status or number of prior chemotherapy regimens. This open-label study randomized s ubjects to nivolumab 3 mg/kg by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) i nfusion every 
2 weeks (Q2W) or nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 + 1 mg/kg, 1 + 3 mg/kg or 3 + 1 mg/kg) IV every 
3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg Q2W. Primary objective was ORR. Other objectives were safety, PFS, OS and bio marker analysis. Seventy-five subjects were 
enrolled (nivolumab, n = 40; ni volumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], n = 35); 59% had at least 2 prior 
regimens. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) in ≥10% of subjects were fatigue (18%), diarrhea 
(13%), nausea (10%), and decreased appetite (10%) with nivolumab; and fatigue (29%), diarrhea (17%), pruritus (14%), nausea, endocrine dis orders and rash (11% each) with nivolumab + 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Grade 3/4 drug-related AEs with nivolumab occurred in 7 (18%) subjects (all in n = 1 [3%]: stomatitis, fatigue, hyperglycemia, A LT increased, GGT increased, encephalitis, 
infusion related reaction).Grade 3/4 drug-related AEs in ≥5% included diarrhea and rash (6% 
each; nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]). Drug-related pneumoni tis occurred in 2 pts (1 per arm). Limbic 
encephalitis was reported in [ADDRESS_577089] in the nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772].  The event resolved under steroid tr eatment in [ADDRESS_577090]. Of 40 evaluable subjects treated 
with nivolumab, partial response (PR) was seen in 6, 15% (duration of ongoing responses [DOR] 
80 - 251+ days); stable disease (SD) in 9, 22.5%; and progressive disease (PD) in 25, 62.5%. In 
conclusion, in this PD-L1 unselected heavily pretreated SCLC population including platinum 
based first-line treatment, nivolumab treatment was well tolerated. The ORR was 15% for subjects with nivolumab with long lasting re sponses beyond 251 days, all ongoing at the time of 
the data cut off.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Profile of Nivolumab Monotherapy
In clinical trials, nivolumab has demonstrated an acceptable benefit-risk across multiple tumor 
types, including advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma ( RCC), NSCLC, and lymphomas. The 
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577091] previously treated advan ced solid tumors, including melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, color ectal 
cancer, and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Subjects received nivolumab at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV Q2W, up to a maximum of 2 y ears of total therapy. A total of 306 subjects 
were treated with nivolumab in the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg.
No maximal tolerated dose was identified in CA209003. The incidence, severity and relationship 
of AEs were generally similar across dose levels and tumor types. Nivolumab related AEs of any grade occurred in 75.2% of subjects. Of th e 306 treated subjects, 303 (99.0%) s ubjects had at 
least [ADDRESS_577092] frequently reported AEs were fatigue (54.9%), decreased appetite (35.0%), dia rrhea (34.3%), nausea (30.1%), and cough (29.4%). 
Treatment-related AEs were repor ted in 230 (75.2%) of the [ADDRESS_577093] frequently 
reported treatment-related AEs were fatigue (28.1%), rash (14.7%), diarrh ea (13.4%), and
pruritus (10.5%). Most treatment-r elated AEs were low grade. Treatment-related high grade 
(Grade 3 - 4) AEs were reported  in 52 (17.0%) of subjects. The most common treatment-related 
high grade AEs were fatigue (2.3%) and diarrhea (1%). Drug related SAEs occurred in 11.5% of subjects. Grade [ADDRESS_577094] 2 subjects included: diarrhea 
(3 subjects, 1.0%), pneumonitis (3 subjects, 1.0%), pne umonia (2 subjects , 0.7%) and lipase 
increased (2 subjects, 0.7%).
Select AE categories (events with a potential i nflammatory mechanism requiring more frequent 
monitoring and/or unique intervention such as immunosuppressants and/or endocrine 
replacement therapy) include: GI AEs, pulmonary AE s, renal AEs, hepatic AEs, skin AEs, and 
endocrinopathies. In addition, select AEs incl ude a category for infusion reactions. Each 
category is composed of a discrete set of preferred terms, including those of greatest clinical 
relevance. These select AEs are considered events of interest based on the mechanism of action and were previously referred to as immune-related AEs or imm une-mediated AEs. Most high 
grade events resolved following the treatment guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary events, 
GI events, hepatic events, renal events, and e ndocrine events, respectively. Overall, the safety 
profile at 3 mg/kg (n = 54) was similar to safety profile across the dose ranges from 0.1 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg (n = 306).
Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 32 (10.5%) of the [ADDRESS_577095] frequent of th ese were pneumonitis  (8 subjects ; 2.6%) and 
colitis (3 subjects; 1.0%). Ther e were 3 (1%) drug related deaths; each occurred after

safety results as outlined below (source document interim CSR, DCN930081508) that are 
consistent with the Phase 1 experience of CA209003.
In CA209037, nivolumab-related AEs of any grade occurred in 67.5% of subjects. Of the 
268 subjects treated with nivolumab, 255 (95.1%) sub jects had at least [ADDRESS_577097] frequently reported  treatment-related AEs we re fatigue  (25.0%), prur itus 
(16.0%), dia rrhea (11.2%), and nausea (9.3%). Most treatmen t-related AEs were low grade. 
Treatment -related high grade (Grade 3 - 4) AEs were reported in 24 (9.0%) of subjects. The most common treatment-related high grade AEs were fatigue (0.7 %), an emia (0.7%), dia rrhea 
(0.4%), and vomiting (0.4%). Drug-related SAEs occurre d in 4.5% of subjects . Grade [ADDRESS_577098] 2 subjects  included diarrhea (2 subjects, 0.7%). In additi on, 
drug related SAE of hyperglycemia occurred in 0.7%.
Select AE categories (events with a potential inflammatory mechanism requiring more frequent 
monitoring and/or unique intervention such as immunosuppressants and/or endocrine replacement therapy) were:
•Skin (29.1%) including pruritus (16.0%) and rash (9.3%)
•GI (11.6%) including diarrhea (11.2%) and colitis (1.1%)
•Endocrine (7.8%) including hypothyroidism (7.8%) and hyperthyroidism (1.9%)
•Hepatic (4.5%) including AST increased (4.1%) and ALT increased (2.6%)
•Pulmonary (2.2%) including pneumonitis (1.9%)
•Hypersensitivity/infusion reaction (1.9%)
•Renal (1.5%) including increased creatinine (0.7%), increased urea (0.4%), and 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (0.4%).
In general, these select AEs were considered by [CONTACT_7185], 
except for AEs in the hepatic and renal select AE  categories. There were few high-grade select 
AEs (n = 20), and the majority of high-grade ev ents (13 of 20) subsequently resolved, including 
those for which immunosuppressive therapy was not initiated.
Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation  were reported in 6 (2.2%) of the 268 treated 
subjects in CA209037 including single events of colitis, pancreatitis, increased ALT, increased 
lipase, autoimmune neuropathy, and demyelination. There were no deaths due to drug related 
toxicity in CA209037; however, [ADDRESS_577099] experienced drug-related Grade 5 hypoxia, possibly pneumonitis, in the setting of lymphangitic spread and possible pneumonia.
Taken together, these data from studies from CA209003 and CA209037 highlight the acceptable 
safety profile with similar trends in AEs in the 574 subjects treated with nivolumab in these 
2 studies. Available safety data in SCLC subjects as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] do not hint 
towards a different safety profile in SCLC compar ed to the tumor types investigated in studies 
CA209003 and CA 209037. Additional details on the safety  profile of nivolumab, including 
results from other clinical studies, are al so available in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) IB.

[IP_ADDRESS] Standard of Care for the Treatment of Relapsed or Recurrent SCLC
Although SCLC is very responsive to initial tr eatment, most p atients relapse with relatively 
resistant disease16The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines 
recommend for second- or later-lin e treatment e nrollment in a clinical trial. For patients with a 
relapse > 6 months after completion of the firs t-line treatment, the original treatment regimen can 
be considered, although no Phase 3 study has proven an overall survival benefit of this approach. 
Other single agent chemotherapy options include paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, irinotecan, 
temozolomide, gemcitabine, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, etoposide, or CAV (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine). A ll of these recommendations are category 2A per NCCN categories of 
evidence and consensus, except for the treatment of patients with a relapse > [ADDRESS_577100]-line treatment, where topotecan has a Phase 3 proven overall 
survival advantage and a category 1 recommendation. Similarly, the ESMO SCLC clinical 
practice guidelines which were also endorsed by [CONTACT_452700] 
(JSMO) recommend a clinical trial participation for refractory patients and resistant patients with 
early relapse (< 6 weeks), topotecan for patients having resistant or sensitive relapse with CAV 
being an alternative option, and for patients with sensitive relapse reintroduction of the first-line 
regimen.17Amrubicin is approved in Japan for the treatment of SCLC patients.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Use of Nivolumab Monotherapy as Experimental Agent
(Arm A)
Substantial monotherapy clinical activity has been observed in ≥second-line SCLC subjects 
treated in the ongoing Phase 1 study of nivolumab (CA209032). The ORR was 15% for subjects 
with nivolumab with long lasting responses up to 251 days, all ongoing at the time of the data cut off. The ORR with topotecan in a second-lin e SCLC Phase 3 trial was 16.9%, however, the 
response duration only 4.[ADDRESS_577101] a potential overall survival benefit in a Ph ase 3 trial. The use of nivolumab monotherapy 
for the experimental arm appears to be justified.
1.1.4 Rationale to Support Topotecan and Amrubicin as Comparators
(Arm B)
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , topotecan is the only treatment with proven overall survival 
benefit in a larger randomized trial and reco mmended by [CONTACT_452701] a relapse less than [ADDRESS_577102]-line treatment completion is not 
based on a Phase 3 randomized trial actually showing improved overall survival. Therefore, it is 
justified to use topotecan in Study CA209331 also as a control agent for subjects with a longer 
than 6 months treatment free interval. Topo tecan is approved in the US and Europe for the 
second-line treatment of platinum resistant and sensitive patients. Oral topotecan was found to 
demonstrate s imilar efficacy and safety to  IV topotecan in a rando mized Phase 3 study, and w ill

be permitted in CA290331.18Amrubicin is approved for the treatment of SCLC patients in Japan 
and commonly used in this setting. In a Phase 2 study with amrubicin the response rate in SCLC 
patients was 75.8% (25/33 patients).19Topotecan and amrubicin are considered suitable 
comparators given that they are the only approved second-line treatments for SCLC in the EU, 
US, and Japan, respectively.

1.1.5 Rationale for Open-label Study DesignThis study will use an open-label design. Due to  the obvious difference in chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy related toxicities, the different  schedules and durations of therapy in the 
treatment arms, different dose modification rules for safety management, and different 
premedication requirements according to chemothe rapy, an open-label design is appropriate. An 
open-label design will also help ensure that immune-r elated toxicities in subjects receiving 
immunotherapy are promptly identified and managed.

1.1.6 Rationale to Support Nivolumab Monotherapy Flat Dose (Arm A)
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in NSCLC patient population in studies 
CA209003, CA209063, CA209017, and CA209057 with body weight normalized 
dosing (mg/kg). Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposures of subjects in these studies have been characterized by [CONTACT_452703] (PPK) analysis of data collected in these 
studies, together with PK data from several Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab 
monotherapy in solid tumors. Nivolumab PK was determined to be linear, with dose proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution 
was found to increase with increasing body weight, but the increase was less than proportional, 
indicating that a mg/kg dose represents an over-adjustment for the effect of b ody weight on 
nivolumab PK. Conversely, given the relationshi p between nivolumab PK and body weight, a 
flat dose is expected to lead to lower exposures in heavier patients, relative to the exposures in  
lighter patients. Table 1.1.6-1 presents summary s tatistics of the es timated nivolumab  
steady-state trough, peak and time-averaged c oncentration (Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavgss,  
respectively) in NSCLC subjects receiving 3 mg/ kg, together with c orresponding statistics of  
exposures predicted for a flat nivolumab dose of 240 mg. It should be noted that a dose of 240 mg nivolumab is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for sub jects weighing 80 kg, which is the  
approximate median body weight of NSCLC subjects in the 3 Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of  
nivolumab monotherapy in NSCLC patients (CA209017, CA209057, and CA209063). As  
evident from the data presented in Table 1.1.6-1, the geometric mean values of Cminss, Cmaxss,  
and Cavgss with flat dosing are slightly (< 15%) higher than that produced by a 3 mg/kg dose,  
and the coefficient of variation (cv%) in these measures of exposure are only slightly (< 10%)  
greater than that of 3 mg/kg dosing.
Table 1.1.6-1: Summary Statistics of Nivolumab Steady-state Exposure
Nivolumab Dose Cminss Geo. Mean 
[ug/mL] (cv%)Cmaxss Geo. Mean 
[ug/mL] (cv%)Cavgss Geo Mean 
[ug/mL] (cv%)
240 mg 61.5 (44.6) 133.7 (35.0) 84.2 (38.2)
3 mg/kg 54.7 (41.9) 118.9 (31.8) 73.3 (35.6)
Nivolumab has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the 
relationship between nivolumab exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy has been found to be relatively flat. Taken together, the PK, safety, and efficacy data indicate that the safety and efficacy profile of 240 mg nivolumab will be similar to that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab.
Based on these clinical results, the experimental arm in CA209331 will be nivolumab monotherapy [ADDRESS_577103] a burden on patients and tr eatment centers. Establishing that 
nivolumab can be safely administered using shorter infusion times of 30 minutes duration will 
diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577104] used a 60-minute i nfusion duration for 
nivolumab (1 - 3 mg/kg). However, nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at 
doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over long tr eatment duration. In Study CA209010, (a Phase 2, 
randomized, double-blinded, dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with 
advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity r eactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All 
the events were Grade 1 - 2 and were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 
3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety 
concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon 
across the nivolumab program. A change in safety profile is not an ticipated with 30-minute 
infusion of nivolumab.
1.1.8 Rationale for Collection of Tumor Tissue and Evaluation of Tumor PD-
L1 Expression and Tumor Mutational Burden as Potential Predictive 
Biomarkers
The role of PD-L1 as a potential predictive bi omarker in SCLC is unknown. Preliminary internal 
data from SCLC tumor samples show that less than 10% of tumor samples have ≥5% PD-L1 
positive tumor cells. A preliminary analysis of tumor samples in Study CA209032 showed no 
suggestion of a correlation of PD-L1 expression and tumor shrinkage under nivolumab therapy. 
Recently, expression of PD-L1 was shown to be positively correl ated with a LD stage, and to be 
an independently predictive factor of a fa vorable overall survival versus PD-L1-negative 
tumors.
[ADDRESS_577105] Cases of 
Progressive Disease
Accumulating clinical evidence indicat es some subjects treated with immune system stimulating 
agents may develop progression of disease (by [CONTACT_121021]) before 
demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable disease. This phenomenon was observed 
in a Phase [ADDRESS_577106], enhanced inflammation within tumors

could lead to an increase in tumor size which would appear as enlarged index lesions and as 
newly visible small non-index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading to over t signs of clinical improvement. Alternatively, in 
some individuals, the kinetics of tumor growth may initially outpace anti-tumor immune activity. 
With sufficient time, the anti -tumor activity will dominate and become clinically apparent. 
Therefore subjects randomized to nivolumab monotherapy w ill be allowed to continue study 
therapy after initial investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) defined progression if they are assessed to be deriving clinical benefit and 
tolerating study drug ( Secti on 4.5.4 ). Such subjects must discontinue study therapy upon 
evidence of further progression.

1.[ADDRESS_577109] Development Background
Nivolumab is in clinical development for the treatment of subjects with NSCLC, RCC, 
glioblastoma and other cancer types. Recentl y, nivolumab was approved for the treatment of 
patients with advanced squamous NSCLC and melanoma.
In a Phase 1/2 trial in subjects with heavily pretreated SCLC, nivolumab monotherapy showed 
an ORR of 15%.23Study CA209331 will be the first Phase [ADDRESS_577110]-line chemotherapy.
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects with SCLC who relapse or progress after platinum based first-line therapy represent a 
great unmet medical need. Responses to salvage chemotherapy are short lived and the overall 
survival benefit of chemotherapy is modest. The clinical activity of nivolumab monotherapy 
observed to date in SCLC suggests the potential for improved clinical outcomes relative to 
approved chemotherapy. However, nivolumab has not been directly compared to any approved 
chemotherapy in SCLC previously. Topotecan, the only approved 2
ndline treatment for SCLC in 
the US and Europe, has a well ch aracterized AE profile consistent with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
such as pancytopenia including febrile neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, stomatitis, fever, 
and diarrhea. Amrubicin is approved for SCLC in Japan and its safety profile is characterized as 
well by [CONTACT_452705]. Nivolumab can cause clinically relevant AEs 
including liver toxicities, thyroiditis, pneumoniti s, and diarrhea. The activity and manageable AE
profile observed with nivolumab supports a head-to-head evaluation versus chemotherapy in second-line SCLC. To assure an ongoing favorable benefit-risk assessment for subjects enrolled 
onto CA209331, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor 
the activity and safety of nivolumab versus chemotherapy throughout the conduct of the trial.

addition, this study includes a cohort of at least 78 additional rando mized patients from China 
(~ 16% of the global number of randomized subjects). The primary population for safety and 
efficacy analysis will include subjects from the Global P opulation as w ell as subjects from the 
additional China cohort, leading to a total sample size of about 560 subjects.
Subjects will be stratified according to the following factors:
•Response to first-line platinum based treatment: platinum sensitive (progression-free interval 
≥90 days after completion of platinum thera py) vs platinum resistant (progression-free 
interval < 90 days after completion of platinum therapy)
•Brain metastases at baseline: yes vs no.
Treatments will be administered as follows: 
Arm A:
•Nivolumab 240 mg (flat dose) on Day 1 of a 14-day cycle as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.
Arm B:
•Topotecan: 1.5 mg/m2administered as 30-minute IV infusion or 2.3 mg/m2administered as

•Tumor tissue (archival or recent tumor biopsy) must be available and received by [CONTACT_452707] a subject to be randomized. Subjects must consent to 
allow the acquisition of tumor tissue by [CONTACT_452708].
•Baseline disease or tumor assessments should be  performed within 28 days of randomization.
•The screening phase either ends with confirmat ion of full eligibility and randomization of the 
subject or with the confirmation that the subject is a screen failure.
Subject is assessed for study eligibility as described in Table 5.1-1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment
•The treatment phase begins with the rando mization call to the interactive vo ice res ponse 
system (IVRS). The subject is randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment arms. Treatment 
should begin within 3 business days of rando mization.
•Study drug is administered as an IV i nfusion or oral capsule beginning on Treatment Day 1 
of each cycle (frequency is dependent on the treatment arm) until disease progression, 
discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the study ends.
•Subjects will be evaluated for response accord ing to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Radiographic 
assessments will be obtained in all tr eatment arms at Week 6 (± 5 days) and every 6 weeks 
from Week 6 (± 5 days) for the first 30 weeks, and subsequently every 12 weeks (± 5 days), 
until disease progressi on (or until discontinuation of study drug in sub jects receiving 
nivolumab beyond progression), lost to follow-up, withdrawal of study consent, or the study 
ends.
•Subjects in Arm A may continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed 
RECIST 1.1-defined progression as defined in Section 4.5.4 .
•This phase ends when the subject is discontinued from study drug.
Study assessments are to be collected as outlined in Table 5.1-2 or Table 5.1-3 for subjects 
randomized to nivolumab monothera py or chemotherapy, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow up
•Begins when the decision to discontinue a subject from study drug is made (no further 
treatment with study drug).
•Follow-up consists of [ADDRESS_577118] to follow-up, or withdrawal of study consent.
•Subjects who discontinue study drug for reasons other than disease progression will continue 
to have radiographic assessments every 6 weeks (± 5 days) for the first 30 weeks, and

oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as [ADDRESS_577137] a serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
* Females treated with hormone rep lacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.

metastases is not permitted.
•Surgical resection of tumor.
Supportive care for disease-related symptoms may be offered to all subjects on the trial.
Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal med ications as there may  be as yet unknown 
interactions with nivolumab. Discontinuation of the use of herbal medications prior to study 
enrollment is encouraged.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Only non-target bone lesions that do not include lung tissue in the planned radiation field may 
receive palliative radiotherapy while on study treatment. Details of palliative radiotherapy should 
be documented in the source records and case re port form (CRF). Details in the source records 
should include: dates of treatment, anatomical site, dose administered and fractionation schedule, 
and AEs. 
Subjects requiring palliative radiotherapy should be assessed for disease progression. Subjects 
considered as having progressive disease are required to discontinue study therapy, or in Arm A, 
if appropriate, continue nivolumab therapy as treatment beyond progression. Administration of 
additional nivolumab to subjects who expe rienced disease progressi on at the time of palliative 
radiotherapy should follow guidelines specified in Section 4.5.4 Treatment Beyond Disease 
Progression.
3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic abs orption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses including 
doses > 10 mg daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids fo r prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune 
conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.
Subjects receiving topotecan or amrubicin may receive growth factors (including G-CSF and 
erythropoietin) at the discretion of the investigator.
Concomitant palliative and supportive care fo r disease related symptoms (including 
bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitors) is an allowed therapy (prior radiotherapy must have 
been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization per inclusion criterion 2i) in Section

Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents 
Immuno-oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is considered immuno-oncology agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno-oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological.
The algorithms are found in the Investigator Brochure and Appendix [ADDRESS_577155] 1.1 criteria

A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 6 weeks of original PD to 
determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued PD. 
For the subjects who continue nivolumab study  therapy beyond progressi on, further progression 
is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial PD. This 
includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable lesions. For subjects with evaluable disease only, further progression is defined as unequivocal 
disease progression of non target lesions or the development of new measurable lesions from 
time of initial PD. Treatment s hould be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further 
disease progression.
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological ly mph nodes, which must have a s hort axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-meas urable at the time of initial progression may 
become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest

For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion inte rruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal anti inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤24 hours).
•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infus ion of normal saline, a nd treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalen t) and/or paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the r ate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion r ate. Monitor sub ject closely. If symptoms recur

should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms : (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief  interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi [INVESTIGATOR_452685] r other clin ical se quelae

4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by [CONTACT_52240]) such as 
partially used study drug containers, vials  and syringes may be destroyed on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_452717], or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy provide d to BMS upon request.
•Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal 
vendor must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal reco rds are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor 
to review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Study Monitor w ill make 
arrangements for return of study drug.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange  for disposal of all empty containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.
4.9 Return of Study Drug

Biopsy samples should be excisional, incisional, or core needle. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_452687]. Tumor samples obtained from bone metastases are not acceptable for PD-L1 testing 
because the PD-L1 assay does not include a decalcification step.
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue may be evaluated also by [CONTACT_452720] (FISH), genet ic mutation detection methods, and/or by [CONTACT_284340] (QPCR) for exploratory analyses of prognostic or predi ctive molecular markers 
associated with SCLC (eg, gene mutation, amplification or overexpression), to determine if these 
factors influence response to nivolumab. Such an alyses will be completed retrospectively and 
within the scope of informed consent. 
If feasible, tumor biopsies may be obtained for subjects who have progressed on nivolumab 
treatment. Changes in expression of immunoregulatory proteins will be assessed in these 
specimens.

perspective and offers insights into the patient experience that may not be captured through 
physician reporting.
The LCSS will be collected to assess the impact of  study treatment on patient reported disease 
related symptoms. The LCSS is a validated instrument designed to assess the impact of treatment 
on disease-related symptoms. It consists of 6 symptom specific questions related to dyspnea, 
cough, fatigue, pain, hemoptysis and anorexia plus 3 summary items: symptom distress, 
interference with activity, and global health r elated qu ality of life (HRQoL). The degree of 
impairment is recorded on a [ADDRESS_577206] effectiveness analysis. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a
measure of self-reported h ealth s tatus. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety) an d a visual analog rating scale (VAS). The utility 
data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and commonly used in cost effe ctiveness 
analysis.27
Healthcare resource utilization data (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], non- protocol specified  medical visits, 
etc) w ill be co llected for all ra ndomized subjects. Specifically, h ealthcare res ource utilization is 
evaluated based on the number of medical care enc ounters such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452688]: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577207] prior to the delayed dose. Selected serum samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_20489]-nivolumab antibodies for technol ogy exploration 
purposes. 
In addition, serum samples designated for PK  assessments may also be used for 
immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, insufficient volume fo r complete imm unogenicity 
assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity related AE).
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occ urrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical inve stigation subject administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an a bnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug , whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determin ed by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The causal r elationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relati onship between study drug administration and 
the AE.Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relat ionship between study drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can includ e events with an alternate etiology which 
were exacerbated by [CONTACT_104155].
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577208]’s case report form
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in wh ich the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_313], base d upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscras ias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liv er injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agen t (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver inju ry (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. (See 
Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to st udy drug (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if d eath occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported  
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 fo r reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment requiring admission for bas eline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)

−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative reason).
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols).
6.1.[ADDRESS_577209]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to 
study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified 
procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within
[ADDRESS_577210] be collected that relate to any
later protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follo w-up skin biopsy). Subjects, who are randomized 
but never treated with study drug, must have SAEs collected for 30 days from the date of 
randomization.
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. If the investigator believes that an  SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.SAEs, whether related or not rel ated to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_577211] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is th rough the CRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the electronic CRF system is not 
functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile 
(fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately, only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable fo r transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577212] (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is initially available, fo llow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to st udy drug or if ne w information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE  report should be sent wi thin 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious 
AE information s hould also be co llected from the star t of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and f or those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) should be co llected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_577213] dose 
of study treatment.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be reque sted for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.6.[ADDRESS_577214] result abnormalities s hould be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the sub ject to r eceive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by 
[CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, ti mely confirmation of initial liv er-related laboratory abnormalities s hould  
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI  event. All occurrences of potential DILIs,  
meeting th e defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for re porting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined when all three of the following are present:
1) Aminotransaminase (AT, ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_577218], without init ial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alk aline 
phosphatase),
3) No other immediately a pparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
One independent committee will be utilized, a DMC. The DMC will be utilized to provide 
general oversight and safety considerations for this study, CA209331. The DMC will provide 
advice to the Sponsor regarding actions the commi ttee deems n ecessary for the continuing 
protection of subjects enro lled in this study. The DMC w ill be charged with assessing such 
actions in light of an acceptable risk/benefit profile for nivolumab. The DMC will act in an 
advisory capacity to BMS and will monitor subject safety data for the study.
The DMC will be advisory to the clinical study leadership team. The clinical study leadership
will have responsibility for overall conduct of the study including managing the communication 
of study data. The group will be responsible for promptly reviewing the DMC recommendations, 
for providing guidance regarding the continuation or termination of the study, and for 
determining whether amendments to the protocol or changes to the study conduct are required.
Details of the DMC responsibilities and procedures will be specified in the DMC charter.When required, adjudicated events will be submitted to the DMC and Health Authorities for 
review on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudi cation documentation.

The decision to incorporate the China subset into th e overall population for analysis is the result 
of a review of the protocol statistical assumptions in comparison to recent data from the 
CA209032 study in 2L+ SCLC subjects.28The data from CA 209032, which were not available 
at the time of protoc ol design, suggest a delayed effect of nivolumab with  a non-proportional 
hazard for survival. Additionally, review of recently generated real-world data for topotecan 
resulted in updated assumptions for the control arm. Given the updated statist ical assumptions, 
incorporation of the China subset in to the study analyses grants adequate statistical power by

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint for the study is OS. It is defined as the time from randomization to the date 
of death. A subject who has not died will be censored at last known date alive. OS will be followed continuously while subjects are on the st udy drug and every [ADDRESS_577223] after subjects discontinue the study drug. 
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression Free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor 
progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Subjects who die without a reported 
prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who 
did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. 
Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date they were randomized. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to 
initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Tumor response will be assessed every 6 weeks 
(±5 days) (from the first dose of study drug) until Week 30, and every 12 weeks ( ±5 days). 
Tumor assessment will continue until disease progression (or until discontinuation of study drug 
in subjects receiving nivolumab beyond progression), lost to follow-up, withdrawal of study 
consent, or the study ends.
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Rate
The ORR will be based on the best overall re sponse on study defined using RECIST 1.1, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_093]. ORR is defined as the proportion of all rando mized sub jects whose 
BOR from baseline is either a CR or PR per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_577224] 1.1 defined progression . The comparison of ORR will be carried out using a two-sided 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_452722] 3.1 associated odds ratio and 95% CI will be calcu lated. Rates and their 2-sided exact CI 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_452723].

Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577225] documented tumor 
progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Subjects who neither progress nor die 
will be censored on the date of their last assessment. TTR is defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of the first confirmed CR or PR. DOR and TTR w ill be evaluated for 
responders (confirmed CR or PR) only.
8.3.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
PD-L1 expression is defined as the percent of tumor cells demonstr ating plasma membrane 
PD-L1 staining of any intensity using an IHC assay.
Safety and tolerability objective will be measured by [CONTACT_51253], serious adverse 
events, deaths, and laboratory abnormalities.Adverse event assessments and laboratory tests are performed at baseline, and continuously 
throughout the study at the beginning of each subsequent cycle.Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is measured using FoundationOne CDxTM (F1CDx) assay, 
a comprehensive genomic prof ile (CGP) assay based on baseline tumor tissue. TMB is defined 
as the number of somatic, coding, base subs titution, and i ndel mutations per megabase of 
genome examined. All base substitutions and indels present at 5% allele frequency or gr eater in 
the coding region of targeted genes, including synonymous alterations, are initially counted 
before filtering as described below. Synonymous  mutations are counted in order to reduce 
sampling noise. While synonymous mu tations are not likely to be directly involved in creating 
immunogenicity, their presence is a signal of mutational processes that  will also have resulted in 
nonsynonymous mutations and neoantigens elsewhere in the genome. Non-coding alterations were not counted. Alterations listed as known somatic alterations in COSMIC and truncations in 
tumor suppressor genes were not counted, since our assay genes are biased toward genes with functional mu tations in cancer. 
Alterations predicted to be germlin e by [CONTACT_452724]-germline-zygosity al gorithm were not 
counted. Alterations that were recurre ntly predicted to be germline in our co hort of clinical 
specimens were not counted. Known germline alterations in dbSNP were not counted. Germline alterations occurring with two or more counts in the ExAC database were not counted.
To calculate the TMB per megabase, the total number of mutations counted is divided by [CONTACT_452725].
Definition of high tumor mutational burden: high TMB will be provided in S tatist ical Analysis 
Plan.Time to Symptom deterioration (TTSD) is defined as the time between the date of 
randomization and the first date of a 10 point  or more increase from baseline in the LCSS 
Average Symptom Burden Index (ABSI). Subjects w ho did not meet the criteria of a [ADDRESS_577226] any on study LCSS assessment will be censored on their date of

The LCSS is a measure of disease-related symptoms and quality of life suited to use in patients 
suffering from lung cancer. It includes six items  measuring loss of appetite, fatigue, coughing, 
shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and pain. Three additional items measure overall symptom 
burden, disease-related func tional limitations, and qu ality of life. The questionnaire uses a 24 
hour recall period, and responses for each item ar e captured using a 100 -mm visual analog scale 
(VAS). Scores for individual items ranging from 0 (no symptomatology or  highest quality of 
life) to 100 (worst symptomatol ogy or quality of life) are derived by [CONTACT_452726]’s response by [CONTACT_452727] 100.
An average symptom burden index (ASBI) score can be derived as the average of scores for the 
six symptom-related items with a clinically meaningful change in ASBI score being defined as 
10 points. Disease-related sympto m deterioration rate by [CONTACT_10585] 12 and by [CONTACT_10585] 24 is defined as the 
proportion of rando mized subjects who had 10 points or more increase from baseline in ABSI 
score at any time between randomization and Week 12/Week 24, respectively. 
Subjects’ overall health status will be assessed using The E uroQol Group’s self-reported h ealth 
status measure ( EQ-5D ). EQ-5D essentially has 2 health s tatus components - the EQ-5D 
descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system 
comprises the following 5 dimensions:  mobility, s elf-care, usual activities,  pain/discomfort and 
anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels:  no problems, some problems, severe problems. The EQ Vas records the subject’s self-rated h ealth state on a 100-point vertical, visual analogue

Serum concentrations will be used to characterize the PK of nivolumab using a population PK approach and to explore exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships.
Other exploratory endpoints for phamacogenomics, immunogenicity and outcomes research are 
discussed in detail in Sections 8.4.5 through 8.4.7 .
8.4 Analyses
8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline laboratory results w ill be summarized by [CONTACT_452728].
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
All hypothesis testing will be two-sided based on a significance level of 0.05 except for OS. If 
superiority of OS is demonstrated, a hierarchical hypothesis testing approach for the key secondary e ndpoints will be used to preserve a study-wise type I e rror rate at 0.05. The key 
secondary endpoints will be tested in the following hierarchical order: 
1) PFS
2) ORR.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577227] only if both OS and PFS are statistically significant.
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Primary Endpoint
The distribution of OS will be compared in tw o randomized arms via a two-sided, log-rank test 
stratified by [CONTACT_452729] 3.1 . The HR and the corresponding 
two-sided 95% CI will be estimated in a st ratified Cox proportional h azards model using 
randomized arm as a single covariate. The OS curves for each randomized arm will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product- limit met hod. Two-sided, 95% confidence intervals for 
median OS will be compu ted by [CONTACT_452730] y method (using a log-log 
transformation). Survival rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 months and 5 years will be estimated using 
KM estimates on the OS curve for each randomized arm provided minimum follow-up is longer 
than timepoint to generate the rate. Associated two-sided 95% CIs will be calculated using the  
Greenwood formula.
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods for Secondary Endpoint
The distribution of PFS will be compared in two randomized arms  using a two-sided, log-rank  
test stratified by [CONTACT_452729] 3.1. The HR and the  
corresponding two-sided 95% CI will be estimated in a stratified  Cox proport ional hazards 
model using randomized arm as a single covariate. The PFS curves for each randomized arm will  
be estimated using the KM product- limit met hod. Two-sided, 95% confidence intervals for  
median PFS will be computed by [CONTACT_143958] (using a log-log  
transformation).
ORR in two randomized arms will be compared using a two-sided CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_452731]. An associated odds ratio and 95% CI w ill also be calculated. Rates and their 
corresponding 95% exact CI will be calculated by [CONTACT_94532]-Pearson method for each randomized 
arm.
The estimation of DOR and TTR in two randomized arms will be computed for subjects who 
achieve PR or CR using KM product-limit method. Median values of duration and time-to, along 
with two-sided 95% CI, will be calculated.

concentration). Model determined exposures may be used for exposure-response analyses of selected efficacy and safety end points. Results of population PK and exposure-response 
analyses will be reported separately.
8.4.5 Biomarker Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic AnalysesTo assess pharmacodynamic effects in serum obt ained from subjects on each treatment arm, 
summary statistics for biomarkers of  
and their corresponding changes (or percent changes)
from baseline will be tabulated by [CONTACT_452732]. In addition, the time course of biomarker 
outcomes will be investigated graphically. If ther e is indication of a meaningful pattern across 
time, further analysis may be completed to char acterize the relationship. Po ssible associations 
between changes in biomarker measures of interest and exposure to study drug will be explored 
graphic. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogenomic Analyses
Pharmacogenomic and Exploratory Analyses
Potential relationships between biomarker data and efficacy or safety endpoints will be 
investigated as part of an analysis plan aimed at identifying baseline biomarkers that may be used to prospectively identify subjects likely (or not likely) to res pond to nivolumab and to 
identify subjects who may be predisposed to having adverse reactions to treatment. These 
exploratory predictive biomarker analyses will be completed with biomarkers measured in blood 
and in tumor samples and will focus primarily--as outlined in the exploratory objectives--on SNPs in select genes associated with immunity or on the expression of , PD-L1,  
proteins in tumor specimens. Similar analyses  will be completed with data regarding 
 and putative additional analyses to be completed 
using FFPE tissue. 
Associations between biomarkers and eff icacy measures will be analyzed on all randomized 
subjects with available biomarker data. Efficacy  measures will include response, PFS, and OS. 
Demographic and case-history factors w ill be ex amined to determine whether stratification or 
adjustments should be made within the subsequent statist ical analyses, and if n ecessary, the 
appropriate stratification or adjustment will be made.Biomarkers will be summarized graphically as they  relate to ef ficacy and safety endpoints, as 
applicable. Summary statistics will be tabulated. SNP allele frequencies will be summarized. The 
relationships between binary measures (eg, response) and candidate biomarkers will be 
investigated using logistic regression. Associatio ns will be summarized in terms of point and 
interval estimates of hazard ratios, odds ratios, or other statistics, as appropriate for the analyses 
completed. Models to pr edict clinical activity based on combinations of biomarkers may also be 
investigated.
Revised Protocol No: 03

approaches may be completed. All analyses described in this section are based on the availability of the data. 
8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
LCSS questionnaire complete rate, defined as th e proportion of questionnaires actually received 
out of the expected number (ie, the number of subjects still on treatment or in follow-up), will be 
calculated and summarized at each assessment point.
Baseline and change from baseline of the average symptom burden index score at each 
assessment point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Subject’s overall health s tate on a visual analog scale (EQ- VAS) at each assessment time point 
will be su mmarized using descriptive statistics Pr oportion of subjects reporting problems for the 
5 EQ-5D dimensions at each assessment time point will be summarized by [CONTACT_61895].
Summary statistics will be calculated for the population preference -based health s tate ut ility 
score (EQ-5D Index).

•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_102471].
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic Lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measura bility described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with Prior Local Treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irrad iated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_129918]
1.4.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements s hould be recorded in metric notation (mm). All bas eline evaluations s hould 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI Scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure  lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_577248] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.

[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important e ndpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging evaluation s hould be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and s hould not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_251634], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target Lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesio ns per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be s elected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577249] meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥≥[ADDRESS_577250] a short axis  < 10 mm are considered non-p athological and should not be 
recorded or followed.
2.2 Non-target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathologi cal lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorde d at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form  (e.g. ‘multiple enlar ged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of di ameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increas e of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinka ge to qualify for PR nor sufficient inc rease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥[ADDRESS_577251] a short axis  < 10 mm are considered non-p athological and should not be 
recorded or followed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Target Lesions that Become ‘Too Small to Measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_577252] measure to then:
•If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
•If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be  assigned (note: in case of a lymph node b elieved to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_577253] slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Target Lesions that Split or Coalesce on Treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesio n. If the lesions have truly coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance 
should be the maximal longest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Non-target Lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows:

[IP_ADDRESS] When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. 
[IP_ADDRESS] When the Subject Has Only Non-measurable Disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such  that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
•Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increas e in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable  in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which  is equivalent to a 20% increase di ameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from lo calized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. 
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, however, they must normal ize in order for a sub ject to be 
considered as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to  differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, 
which it is not.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577254]’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
3.3.[ADDRESS_577255] 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly  possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the 
basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following al gorithm: 
•Negative FDG-PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. 
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], this is PD. 
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if ther e is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial positive
FDG-PET scan).
−If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

4.1.1 Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject is not 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can 
be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have changed the 
assigned time point response.
4.1.2 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: Confirmation of response (CR or PR) is required. Confirmed CR or 
PR will be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent timepoint (minimum 
[ADDRESS_577257] met).
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease should be verified in cases where 
progression is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using 
the date of the init ial scan. If rep eat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered not 
to have progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.
4.[ADDRESS_577258] Overall Response: All Timepoints
The best overall response is defined as the be st response designation, as determined by [CONTACT_4520], recorded between the date of rando mization and the date of ob jectively 
documented progression per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_577259]’s best overall response assignmen t will depe nd on the 
findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the

Date: 20-Mar-[ADDRESS_577260] respons e across all time points (for example, a subject who  
has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best  
overall response of PR). 
When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time  
from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point  
response, the subject’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a  
subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for  
SD, will have a best response of PD. The s ame subject lost to follow-up after the first SD  
assessment would be considered not evaluable.
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation.  
Complete or par tial responses may be claimed only if  the criteria for each are met at a  
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later). In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as specified in Table 2. When  
SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum time from  
baseline. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a  
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 - 8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

Best response would depend on whether minimum dur ation for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions we re likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not

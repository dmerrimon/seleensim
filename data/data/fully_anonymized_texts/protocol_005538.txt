I. Purpose:
You are invited to take part in a research study. The purpose of the study is to compare [ADDRESS_319982] of these programs on blood glucose 
and insulin (a hormone) levels.  These levels are used to see if you are at risk for type 2 diabetes.  
One program is about promoting sleep behaviors.  The other program is about promoting 
health/safety behaviors. You are invited to take part because you are 18-[ADDRESS_319983] study visit lasts about 45 minutes. You will be asked to wear an activity 
monitor that looks like a watch all day long and also spend 1-2 minutes a day keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a diary 
about your sleep for 5 weeks.    
II. Procedures: 
If you decide to take part in the study, you will be asked to complete an initial screening visit.  
After the screening visit, if you qualify and decide to continue, you will be asked to complete [ADDRESS_319984] in the School of Nursing at Georgia State University 
(GSU).  During the entire study period, you will be asked to wear an activity monitor that looks 
like a watch.  You will be asked to wear the activity watch all day long.  You will also spend 1-[ADDRESS_319985] your body's blood sugar (lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],

tube.  This method of taking blood is called a venipuncture.  If it is difficult to obtain blood from 
the middle inside part of your arm, other places on your body may be pi[INVESTIGATOR_263186], such as your hand. 
The total amount of your blood drawn is about [ADDRESS_319986] an equal chance of being 
assigned to 1 of 2 groups.  One group will receive the sleep program.  The other group will 
receive the safety program.  A computer program, similar to a ‘flip the coin’, will be used to 
decide your group.  We hope to find out which program will benefit your health the most.  
Participants in the sleep program group will receive a sleep behavior program. Participants in the 
safety program group will receive a safety behavior program.  Once a week you will receive a 
text or phone call (your choice) from a researcher to remind you to complete the diary.  The 
researcher will also answer any questions you may have. 
The third study visit will take place [ADDRESS_319987] study visit. A blood sample will be taken from a vein in your arm by a

venipuncture technique described above to obtain blood samples for blood sugar, insulin, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_263187].  You will also complete 5-6 short questionnaires on sleep and/or safety, 
stress, diet and physical activity. Your height and weight and body fat will also be measured.

of the visit, people in the safety program group will have an opportunity to review the sleep 
program information if desired.

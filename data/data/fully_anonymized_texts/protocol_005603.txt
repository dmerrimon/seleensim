I. Objective  
 
To determine how multifocal contact [CONTACT_367054]-presby[CONTACT_367055].  
 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
Contact [CONTACT_367056] a condition characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_367046], either with or without visual disturbance, resulting from 
reduced c ompatibility between the contact [CONTACT_367057], which can lead 
to decreased wearing time and discontinuation of contact [CONTACT_13279].[ADDRESS_458692] 
lens discomfort typi[INVESTIGATOR_367047], irritation, discomfort, and 
fatigue.1 With today’s growing use of digital devices, visual, ocular, and musculoskeletal 
(neck and shoulder pain) symptoms have been reported to  include eye strain, eye fatigue, 
burning and irritation of the eyes, tired eyes, dry eyes, ached in and around the eyes, blurred 
vision at near, blurred vision when looking from near to far, headache, neck ache, and 
shoulder pain.[ADDRESS_458693] people begin to 
experience functional presby[CONTACT_367058] (near blur, trouble focusing while re ading, etc.) 
around the ages of 40-[ADDRESS_458694] lens wearers  
who are also near -sighted  (myopic) . Because of basic optical principles, myopic patients 
have to exert more accommodation when corrected with contact [CONTACT_367059].[ADDRESS_458695] lens wearers that fall in the non-presby[CONTACT_367060]. Table 1 lists the complete in clusion criterion. A total of 68  subjects will be recruited. See 
the Detailed Study Pr ocedures section for a complete sample size justification.  
Table 1:  Inclusion criterion  
 
c. Measurement/Instrumentation  
 
All measurements and tests performed throughout this study are currently used in routine eye 
examinations. The risks associated with all study procedures are no more than would be 
encountered by [CONTACT_64702] a normal eye exam. All subjects will be ha bitual soft contact 
[CONTACT_19554], so no additional risk will be incurred by [CONTACT_367061]. Below is a summary of all vision tests, dry eye tests, binocular vision tests, 
and contact [CONTACT_224044]/assessment methods that will be used throughout the study.  
 
Visual Acuity Assessment: Distance (6 meters) visual acuity will be assessed on a high contrast 
visual acuity chart when the patients wears their habitual contact [CONTACT_367062]. Patients will 
instructe d to read the 20/[ADDRESS_458696] 3 of 5 letters on 
the 20/25 line with each eye will be excluded from the study.  
 
Refractive Error Determination : Inclusion criteria r efractive e rror will be determined using an 
autore fractor  while the patient is not corrected with spectacles or contact [CONTACT_13276] . This non -contact, 
automated instrument measures the subject’s  spectacle/contact [CONTACT_32494]. Subjects that 
do not meet refractive error inclusion criteria (Table 1) will be excluded from the study.  
 
Contact [CONTACT_367063] -8 (CLDEQ -8): The CLDEQ -[ADDRESS_458697]  a score ≥12 points ( show to be a score that identifies a subject that could benefit from Personal Characteristics  Dry Eye Status  Binocular Vision Status

Reports digital device (smart phone, tablet, 
computer) of at least [ADDRESS_458698] lens -related sym ptoms15) in order to qualify for the baseline 
examination.  
 
Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS): The CISS is a [ADDRESS_458699] lens discomfort and dryness are similar to convergence 
insufficiency symptoms,9 so the CISS will be administered at each study visit.  
 
Binocular Vision Testing: Binocular vision testing assesses the ability of the eyes to move, 
conver ge, diverge, and focus together while focusing at distance and near targets. Symptoms of 
binocular vision disorders are similar and sometimes associated with accommodative disorders. 
Therefore, we will exclude any subject that has significant signs of a bi nocular vision disorder. 
Binocular vision testing for this study will include horizontal heterophoria measurement s, near 
point of convergence (NPC) , and accommodative function testing. All of these tests are performed 
in routine eye exams.  
 
Heterophoria M easurement : Heterophoria measurements how wel l the eyes simultaneously focus  
and align together. Several methods exist to measure heterophoria. Modified Thorington (MT) 
testing has been shown to be the most repeatable form,17 so it will be used in this study at distance 
(6 m) and near (40 cm). A Maddox rod (transparent red occlude r with cylindrical grooves) will be 
used to perform the technique. The MT card contacts horizontal and vertical rows of numbers that 
are calibrate d to measure prism diopters at each distance. Each card contains a small central 
hole where a penlight will be shown through. The subject will hold a Maddox rod over their right 
eye in a horizontal orientation, and the subject will see a red streak of ligh t while viewing the MT 
card. At both distance and near, the subject will be asked to report what numbered row the red 
streak is passing through. This number on the card corresponds to a particular horizontal 
heterophoria finding, which will be recorded for  distance and near.  Subjects reporting 4 or more 
esophoria or exophoria at distance or near will be excluded from the study.  
 
NPC : NPC is a routine clinical measurement that assesses the ability of the eyes to converge and 
accommodate while viewing a near target.[ADDRESS_458700]’s 
habitual correction using a push -up technique. An accommodative target (20/30 near let ter) on a 
fixation stick will be slowly moved closer towards the subject’s central visual axis until the subject 
experiences constant diplopia. The distance from the bridge of the subject’s nose to this point will 
be recorded as the break point.  Subjects w ith a break point of 6 cm or higher will be excluded 
from the study.  
 
Accommodative Function: Accommodative function (lead/lag), or the ability of the subject to focus 
when reading, will be measured with an autorefractor.  The autorefractor is a non -contact  
[CONTACT_367065].  Subjects will wear their habitual contact [CONTACT_35483] . 
Accommodative response will be measured at two stimulus levels  with each pair of contact [CONTACT_13276] 
(habitual, single vision, and multifocal)  (2.00 and 4.00 diopters) to determine how accurately the 
subject focuses on letter visual targets  at various distances  while corrected with different contact 
[CONTACT_13276] . 
 
Dry Eye Testing: Subjects who have significant signs of dry eye will be excluded from the stud y. 
Basic dry eye testing, similar to that performed during a regular eye exam, will be performed to 
ensure subjects with dry eye do not confound study results. Tear break -up time (TBUT), ocular 
surface staining, and Schirmer test will be performed at the b aseline examination. All dry eye tests 
will be performed on the right eye only.  
 
TBUT:  TBUT measurements are commonly used to assess severity of dry eye. The measurement 
quantifies the time it takes for the tear film to break -up on the ocular surface after a complete 
blink. To measure TBUT, fluorescein sodium will be instilled in the inferior palpebral conjunctiva 
using with a Barnes -Hind Ful -Glo Fluorescein So dium Ophthalmic Strip that has been wetted with 
a drop of non -preserved saline. After instillation, the subject will be place d in a slit lamp and 
instructed to blink several times. After several blinks, the subject will be asked to hold the blink 
for as lo ng as possible. While the patient is holding the blink, the tear film will be observed through 
the slit lamp with cobalt blue light and a yellow barrier filter (Wratten 12 filter) held over the slit 
lamp objective to improve fluorescein visibility. The tim e of the first apparent tear break up will be 
recorded . Subjects with TBUT times of 7 seconds or lower will be excluded from the study.  
 
Ocular Surface Staining:  Fluorescein sodium is commonly used to assess corneal and 
conjunctival surface integrity and causes little to no ocular discomfort upon instillation. In the 
presence of ocular surface disruption, fluorescein glow will be easily observed with cobalt blue 
light. To assess ocular surface staining, fluoresce in previously used to assess TBUT will be 
sufficient. The subject will remain in the slit lamp and cobalt blue light will be used to assess 
severity of ocular surface staining. The Oxford Scheme12 will be used to grade surface staining 
severity. Subjec ts with Grade [ADDRESS_458701] : The Schirmer test is a standardized method used to measure tear flow and assess 
dry eye. It measures the tear flow using a filter paper that is  inserted into the conjunctival sac. To 
perform this test, a Schirmer filter paper (5x35 mm Whitman No 1) will be placed on the lower lid, 
midway between the middle and outer third of the lid. The tip of the Schirmer paper will be tucked 
under the lid. The  patient will be instructed to close his/her eyes for five minutes. After five 
minutes, the Schirmer paper will be removed and the tear flow measured on the filter paper will 
be recorded.  Subjects with a Schirmer score of 7 mm or lower will be excluded fro m the study.  
 
Keratograph 5M Measurements: The Keratograph 5M is a clinical instrument used to assess 
corneal curvatures and the tear film. This instrument is routinely used in clinical eye care  and 
takes all measurements without touching the eye. For this study, the Keratograph 5M will be used 
to measure non-invasive TBUT over contact [CONTACT_13276], tear film meniscus height and eye redness 
after the subjects have wor n their habitual contact [CONTACT_367066].  All Keratograph 5M measurements will be performed on the right eye only.  
 
Subjective Refractive Error Determination:  Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria for the study 
will be enrolled and be fitted in two differ ent kinds of contact [CONTACT_367067]. Before fitting the contact [CONTACT_13276], a subjective refraction will be performed to determine the 
best correction and contact [CONTACT_367068]. The refraction will be performed by a 
licensed, trained optometrist ([CONTACT_367090]) using a phoropter. Patient responses will be used to 
determine the final refractive error. This method is identical to refractive error determination in a 
regular eye exam.  
 
Contact [CONTACT_353705]: In this crossover tri al, single vision  Bausch + Lomb  ULTRA ® contact [CONTACT_367069] + Lomb ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_367070] a licensed 
optometrist. Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® and Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_367071] -
approved daily wear  soft contact [CONTACT_367072]. All subjects will be habitual soft contact [CONTACT_19554], so 
no increased risk will be assumed by [CONTACT_367073] + Lomb ULTRA ® contact [CONTACT_13276].  
 
Anterior Ocular Segment Assessment:  While the risk of contact [CONTACT_367074] (ocular 
inflammation, infection, etc.) in this study is extremely low, the anterior segment ocular health of 
both eyes of every subject will be assessed by a licensed optometrist at each visit to ensure no 
complications have occurred.  This assessment will also include the ocular adnexa (lid margin and 
Meibomian glands).  In the unlikely event that a complication does occu r, the subject will be treated 
by a licensed optometrist and dismissed from the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 c. Detailed Study Proc edures  
 
Overview  
 
This randomized, prospective, crossover clinical trial will recruit uncomfortable, single vision, soft 
contact [CONTACT_367075]-presby[CONTACT_367076]. The tenants of the Declaration of Helsinki will 
be followed. Complete inclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. Each subject will receive a single vision  
(Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ®) and multifocal contact [CONTACT_13293]  (Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_19555])  to 
wear for [ADDRESS_458702] Lens Dry Eye Questionnai re-8 (CLDEQ -8), a survey validated to 
reflect change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_367048],[ADDRESS_458703] a score of ≥[ADDRESS_458704], baseline examination.  
 
At the baseline examination, inclusion criteria will be confirmed. The presence of concurrent dry eye 
or a binocular vision disorder (a group of disorders that involved how the eyes move together) w ill 
confound study results, so subjects with significant signs of these conditions will be excluded from 
the study  (as defined in  Table 1 ). With the each subject ’s habitual contact [CONTACT_35483], 
heterophoria at distance and near and NPC will be measured to determine binocular vision eligibility. 
Accommodative function will also be assessed at this time. TBUT, ocular surface staining, and 
Schirmer testing will be performed to determine dry eye eligi bility. Keratograph 5M tear imaging will 
also be performed at this time. A general anterior segment assessment will be made and assessment 
of the lid margins and Meibomian glands after habitual lens wear will be recorded. The CISS will be 
administered at t he baseline examination. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will be enrolled and 
randomized ( blocked randomization design with a 1:1 allocation ratio ) to receive e ither the single 
vision Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® or single vision Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_367077]. All subjects who complete the baseline examination (whether enrolled or not) will receive 
$40 cash and a parking pass.  
 
Each lens is made in only one size (base curve and diameter), so the main parameter determined 
during t he fitting process will be power of the lens. For the single vision lens  and multifocal lens , the 
power will be determine based on the spherical equivalent of the subject’s refractive error. For the 
multifocal  contact [CONTACT_13293], subjects will receive a Low Add power in both eyes . Vision, fit, and comfort of 
the contact [CONTACT_367078] . Lenses will be allowed to settle on the eye 
for approximately 10 minutes before vision or fit are assessed. Once a satisfactory fit and visual end-
point  has been achieved (patient is comfortable in lenses , binocular vision is better than 20/[ADDRESS_458705] lens fit ), the subject will be instructed to wear the lenses daily 
for the next [ADDRESS_458706] lenses and to remove 
them each night to clean and soak and Biot rue ® contact [CONTACT_243293]. A clean contact [CONTACT_367079] d 
Biotrue ® solution will be provided to each subject. Subjects will be given the contact [CONTACT_367080] [INVESTIGATOR_367049] (redness, 
discharge, irritation, pain, etc.). Before leavi ng the baseline examination, each subject will schedule 
an appointment for the second examination approximately 2 weeks from the initial baseline 
examination date (no sooner than 2 weeks, no later than 3 weeks). The Bausch + Lomb  ULTRA  ® 
contact [CONTACT_367081]-approved for daily wear. Subjects will receive $40 cash and a parking pass 
at the end of the baseline examination.

Sample Size Justification section for updated sample size numbers ) 
 
Second Examination and Fitting  
 
After wearing the first dispensed lens pair for approximately [ADDRESS_458707] dispensed lens pair will be performed.  The lenses will be removed, 
discarded, and an anterior ocular segment assessment will be performed on both eyes.  An 
assessment of the lid margins and Meibomian glands will be performed.  As well, an assessment of 
the tear film (TBUT, Schirmer test, and ocular surface stain ing) and tear film assessment with the 
Keratograph 5M will be performed.  
 
Next, the remaining contact [CONTACT_13293] ( Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® or Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® for 
Presby[CONTACT_19555], depending on which lens the subject wore first) will be fitted on each subject. Fit, vision, 
and comfort will be assessed (as in the baseline examination)  after the lenses have settled on the 
eye for 10 minutes . When a satisfactory endpoint is reached, subjects will again be educated on 
proper lens care (daily lens wear, no sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_367050], proper cleaning/storage with Bio true® 
solution) and be given a fresh contact [CONTACT_367082]® contact [CONTACT_243293]. Accommodative 
testing and heterophoria measurements with the  second dispensed lens pair will be performed. Each 
subject will sch edule an appointment for the third and final examination approximately 2 weeks from 
the date of the second examination.  Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_458708] and Final Examination  
 
After wearing the second dispensed lens pair for approximately 2 weeks, subjects will return to the 
clinic. The CLDEQ -8 and CISS will be administered and subjects will be instructed to answer based 
on their experience with the second dispensed lens pair. Accommodative testi ng and heterophoria 
measurements with the second dispensed lens pair will be performed. The lenses will be removed, 
discarded, and an anterior ocular segment assessment will be performed on both eyes. An 
assessment of the lid margins and Meibomian glands w ill be performed. As well, an assessment of 
the tear film (TBUT, Schirmer test, and ocular surface staining) and tear film assessment with the 
Keratograph 5M will be performed.  
 
Subjects will be asked which of the two trial lens pairs they preferred  and be  asked which lens (single 
vision or multifocal) they think they had first and second. After all testing and procedures have been 
completed, subjects will be instructed to return to habitual contact [CONTACT_367083].  Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_458709] examination.  
 
Data Analysis and Sample Size Justification  
 
Paired t tests will be performed to compare mean CLDEQ -8 scores with habitual single vision  lenses, 
single vision Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® contact [CONTACT_13276], or Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_367084]. Repeated measures ANOVA testing will be performed to determine if 
contact [CONTACT_367085] (CLDEQ -8 score) is affected by [CONTACT_367086] m agnitude of myopia when subjects are 
corrected with their habitual single vision lenses, single vision Bausch + Lomb ULTRA ® contact 
[CONTACT_13276], or ULTRA ® for Presby[CONTACT_367087].  CISS scores throughout the trial will be analyzed 
in the same way as the CL DEQ -[ADDRESS_458710] lens preference (single vision 
versus multifocal) to initial accommodative function (lag/lead) values . 
 
In order to dete ct a conservative standardized effect size of 0.6 (α = 0.05, β = 0.20), a sample size of 
45 subjects would be necessary. A previous cross -over trial utilizing the CLDEQ -8 reported a 20% 
loss-to-follow -up rate.[ADDRESS_458711] sample size will be increased by  [CONTACT_33018]  25% to allow for additional data 
collection that may be necessary . Therefore, 68 subjects (34 subjects per group) wi ll be sought for 
IRB approval to accou nt for the possibility of needing  more subject data to make reliable  study 
conclusions.  
 
Updated sample size (03/07/2017 ): At this point in the study, we have seen 26 total subjects: 17 
were successfully enrolled and 9  failed to qualify for the study (did not meet all dry eye and binocular 
vision inclusion criteria) after completing the baseline examination. Therefore, approximately 35% of 
the subjects who have participated in baseline examinations have failed. With 17 subjects enrolled, 
we need to recruit and enroll an additional 51 subjects to complete the study. Considering our recent 
experience with enrollment, we will assume that 35% of these 51 baseline examinations (or about 
18) will not qualify for the study. The refore, we are requesting to increase our original sample size of 
68 subjects by 18 and recruit a sample size of 86 (43 subjects per group).  
 
Updated sample size (8/14/2017):  Upon initial data analysis of the subjects who have completed 
the study, we found an interaction between subject age group and change in CLDEQ -8 survey score 
that, while not statistically significant (p = 0.12), was clinically significant (an approximate 4 -point 
difference between age groups) according to CLDEQ -[ADDRESS_458712] lacked statistical significance because of an inadequate 
sample size. Because of the lack of software or well -developed methods for calculating the sample 
size for an interaction in a cross -over study, a simulation study was conducted to estimate what a 
sufficient sample size would be. The simulation assessed adding more subjects to the sample – using 
the subjects cu rrently in the sample. This iterative process was conducted to draw 10 different 
samples from which sample size was estimated in order to attempt to replicate the original finding 
with greater power. Given the simulation, it was recommended that 30 additio nal subjects be tested. 
At this point, approximately 27% of subjects who present for the baseline examination fail to qualify 
for the study, so we will increase the 30 additional subjects by 27% (8 subjects) and, therefore, 
increase our overall sample size  by 38 subjects. In conclusion, the new number of recruited 
participants will increased from 86 to 124.  
 
Updated Sample Size (11/21/2017): At this stage in the study, we have successfully enrolled [ADDRESS_458713] recruited 104 of the 124 approved subjects for this study.  The 27% 
baseline examination failure rate we observed during the first recruitment stage has increased to 
66%. Specifically, sinc e beginning this new ro und of recruitment, we have enrolled 15 subjects in the 
study and had 15 baseline examination failures  (making our total recruitment at 104 subjects) . In 
order to enroll the 30 additional subjects described above (on 8/14/2017) and a llow for anticipated 
baseline examination failures, we will increase the number of recruited participants from [ADDRESS_458714] Lens Clinic patients.

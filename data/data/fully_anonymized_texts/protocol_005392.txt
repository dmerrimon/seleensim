The functioning of frontostriatal control systems will be assessed using the well-validated Simon task. Functioning of the dorsal striatum and ventral frontostriatal circuits that support habit learning and reward processing will be assessed using a novel fMRI paradigm directly analogous to tasks used to define the neural bases of reward-based learning systems in rodents, tailored to a virtual reality environment within the MRI scanner. This study will also assess functional and anatomical connectivity within dorsal and ventral frontostriatal circuits in the same children and adolescents, and determine whether disturbances in these overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_536080]. Participants will also undergo an MRS scan to measure striatal Glu levels. Behavioral measures will be administered to further assess regulatory, learning and memory functions. Children and adolescents with OCD will then be offered a evidence based standard course of cognitive behavioral therapy before rescanning (along with age-and gender-matched control participants) in order to assess how these circuits may change with treatment. In addition, de-identified data may be used in the future to conduct secondary data analyses. As we learn more about the diagnoses and neurobiological mechanisms of interest in the current study, we may use these data to answer questions beyond those described in this protocol. All study procedures will be conducted on-site at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute.

Background, Significance and RationaleBackground, Significance and RationaleObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by [CONTACT_536097], images, or impulses (i.e., obsessions) and repetitive acts performed to prevent or reduce distress (i.e., compulsions). Early-onset (i.e., pediatric) OCD is often considered a distinct OCD subtype given its greater familiality, genetic differences, comorbidity with tic disorders and ADHD, and male preponderance. Prior work suggests that OCD is characterized by [CONTACT_536098] (FS) that subserve inhibitory control. Dysfunction in dorsal circuits impairs regulatory control over intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and compulsive behaviors. Dysfunction in ventral circuits contributes to reward processing deficits, decreasing the rewarding relief that should result from the behaviors and enhancing urges to repeat them. Abnormal maturation of FS circuits also contributes to an over-reliance on the dorsal striatum (DS) in OCD, allowing compulsive behaviors to evolve into “habits.” This study plans to examine the structure and function of these circuits in a large sample of unmedicated OCD children and adolescents. We will combine both well-validated and novel fMRI paradigms, along with measures of functional and anatomical connectivity. We will also explore measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes and changes in circuit-based abnormalities following treatment. All study procedures will be conducted on-site at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. Specific Aims and HypothesesSpecific Aims and HypothesesThe goal of this study is to use multimodal MRI to assess the functioning and structure of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_536081] a large sample of unmedicated children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD before and after CBT. The brain activity of children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD will be compared to age-matched healthy controls during performance of the simon task and our virtual reality (VR)-based assessment of multiple learning and memory systems. In addition, functional connectivity within frontostriatal circuits in children and adolescents with OCD will be compared to age-matched healthy control children and adolescents. Anatomical and DTI data will also be collected so that we can begin to identify any structural and organizational abnormalities in these neural systems in children and adolescents with OCD compared to healthy control participants. Finally, children and adolescents with OCD will be offered a standard course of evidence based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before rescanning (along with age-and gender-matched control participants) so we can explore changes in these circuits following treatment and the improvement of OCD symptoms. We will test the following hypotheses:1. Compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with OCD will have increased activation in subcortical structures (insula, and putamen) comprising a right hemisphere dorsal frontostriatal circuit while performing a self-regulatory control task (Simon task). 2. Compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with OCD will have increased activation in the dorsal striatum associated with the receipt of rewards during the habit learning task and decreased activation

in ventral frontostriatal and mesolimbic areas (amygdala and hippocampus) associated with reward receipt during the reward-based spatial learning task. 3. Compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with OCD will have increased connectivity within task-related dorsal frontostriatal circuits and decreased connectivity within ventral frontostriatal circuits during performance of the Simon and reward-based spatial learning tasks, respectively. 4. Activation within dorsal frontostriatal circuits will correlate positively and activation within ventral frontostriatal circuits will correlate inversely with symptom severity in the OCD children and adolescents, suggesting that these circuits are functionally more impaired in those with more severe symptoms. 5. Compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with OCD will have increased fractional anisotropy (FA) within dorsal frontostriatal circuits and decreased FA within ventral frontostriatal circuits. Exploratory Hypotheses:We will explore change in these circuits in children and adolescents with OCD following CBT compared to non-specific changes in the control group. We hypothesize that (1) group differences in the patterns of brain activations and connectivity will decrease from baseline. (2) In the children and adolescents with OCD who meet the definition of responder status (clinical global impression scale of improvement equaled to 1 or 2), we hypothesize that change in the function and connectivity within these circuits will be associated with change in OCD symptoms.Group differences in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes before and after CBT will also be explored.

H racially, there are 72.4% White, 12.6% Black, 4.8% Asian, and 10.2% Other. Based on our experience and the demographics served by [CONTACT_17928], we expect the subject racial distribution to be approximately 73% White, 18% Black, 9% Asian, and for the ethnic distribution to be approximately 22% Hispanic. OCD is believed to occur more frequently in males. Thus, this study population will contain a ratio of boys to girls of roughly 3:1. Because of our location in [LOCATION_001] City and our history recruiting for studies like these, we do not anticipate problems recruiting ethnic or racial minorities. The final ethnic and racial composition of our sample will depend not only on who we screen, but also who is eligible and agrees to participate in the study.   To encourage minority participation, we will promote awareness of our research project among minority individuals in order to ensure the continued diversity of our sample. These efforts will include: 1) placing advertisements in media outlets popular with minority $H 2) contact[CONTACT_536099] $H and 3) involving minority research staff in patient recruitment. These efforts are facilitated by [CONTACT_536100] (Washington Heights) and by [CONTACT_536101]’s Day Unit (e.g., bilingual staff of Hispanic background).  Description of subject populationWe plan to recruit approximately [ADDRESS_697893] a current diagnosis of OCD or no psychiatric diagnosis (healthy control). Recruitment ProceduresDescribe settings where recruitment will occurThe study will recruit pediatric participants diagnosed with OCD from the CAPES Evaluation Service and the Pediatric Anxiety and Mood and Research Clinic (PAMRC), which is part of the Children's Day Unit, and is directed by [CONTACT_6283]. Rynn and Goldberg. The CAPES/PAMRC provides free expert consultation, evaluation, and treatment referrals for children and adolescents suffering from mood and anxiety disorders. OCD self-help organizations such as the International OCD Foundation will be contact[CONTACT_536102].Participants and their parent/caregiver will be assessed with an IRB approved phone screen (see attached

Regardless of study participation, we enter the information from the phone screens into a deindentifed and password protected database.Morgan Stanley Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CHONY)Children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD will also be recruited through the patient resources and clinics at the Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242326]-Presby[CONTACT_194840]. After a parent/guardian gives permission to the clinic staff to refer a child/adolescent patient to the study, we will follow the screening procedures detailed in the study procedures section. We would also like to send a recruitment letter and/or pamphlet to all the parents/guardians with children/adolescents who are being treated in these outpatient clinics letting them know about our research. We will give this letter and/or pamphlet to the clinicians at each clinic and they will distribute the letter to the parents/guardians of their patients. Please see the attached recruitment letter and brochure we would like to distribute.Columbia University Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders (CUCARD) (Director: Anne Marie Albano, PhD)Children and adolescents with OCD will be recruited through the CUCARD. [CONTACT_536154] collaborates with [CONTACT_536155] on other treatment research projects in the area of pediatric anxiety disorders. The CUCARD sees 300 new children and adolescents per year referred for anxiety disorders, and each child/adolescent and family are approached for participation in research projects. Recruitment procedures from this clinic will be the same as those above (CHONY). Advocacy and Support GroupsOCD participants will also be recruited through scientific presentations to patient advocacy and support groups, such as the OCF (Obsessive Compulsive Foundation). We will also set up advertisements in their newsletters and on their internet websites and distribute recruitment letters.Craigslist Participants with and without OCD will be recruited through the volunteers section of the Craigslist website. We will post advertisements on the website biweekly with a brief description of the study (see attached craigslist postings). We will also post this description on other websites and pages relevant to OCD and anxiety disorders, consistent with the recruitment methods in IRB #6574. Facebook and Twitter Participants will be recruited via Facebook (www.facebook.com). We will post a description of this study on a page created for [CONTACT_536156]'s Cognitive Development and Neuroimaging Lab and the facebook page for the Columbia Pediatric Anxiety and Mood Research Clinic, as well as on other pages relevant to OCD and anxiety disorders. The description of our study posted on these Facebook pages will inform treatment providers, support group leaders, parents and guardians of the research being conducted under this protocol. Facebook will not be utilized to inform children/adolescents of our studies. Facebook will not be used to contact [CONTACT_7683]/adolescents. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_536082], if a child/adolescent does respond to a Facebook posting, he/she will be asked to speak with her/her parent or guardian regarding he/her interest in participation in the study who then may contact [CONTACT_3019]. The same IRB approved description of our study and a list of tweets (see attached list of tweets) will be posted on our lab twitter page on twitter.com.

LinkedinWe will use Linkedin to communicate with colleagues about our research efforts. A web announcement will be sent including our lab website, Facebook, and Twitter page links for their reference and for referring potential participants. As with Facebook and Twitter, if a child/adolescents contacts us directly after being referred by [CONTACT_536103], he/she will be asked to speak with a parent or guardian regarding interest in participation in the study. RecruitMe: ColumbiaParticipants with OCD and healthy controls will be recruited through Columbia University's Recruit Me, an online tool to connect potential research participants with researchers conducting relevant studies. FlyersParticipants diagnosed with OCD and healthy controls will also be recruited through flyers posted in the community. We will post flyers on bulletin boards in Columbia University Medical Center buildings as well as in local laundromats, grocery stores, public libraries, and community centers. Please see the attached flyers. Private PracticeParticipants diagnosed with OCD will be recruited through colleagues who see patients in private practice. Recruiting patients seen in private practice will enable us to gain a more diverse demographic and socioeconomic sample than would be found in the Washington Heights area alone. We will provide clinicians with a list of target diagnoses and a brief description of the purpose and procedures of our protocol, as well as letters for families who express interest in our research. The clinicians will initially approach parents or guardians to ascertain their interest in our protocol. Parents/guardians that express interest in our MRI study and want to hear more about it will be asked for permission for a member of our research team to contact [CONTACT_476]. With this verbal permission, members of our research team will follow up with a telephone call to read through a recruitment script detailing what we want to do and what would be expected of their child, and to administer screening procedures (please see recruitment script and screening questionnaire).Healthy Control RecruitmentIn addition to advertisements on Craigslist and flyers in the community, normal controls will berecruited from community-based telemarketing lists of households characterized by [CONTACT_121810], age,gender, ethnicity, and income level (Info [LOCATION_003] based in Omaha, Nebraska. Phone #: [PHONE_11095]).Healthy Control Recruitment Procedures: Introductory letters will be sent by [CONTACT_536104] a demographic profile matching the clinical sample. We will also contact [CONTACT_536105]. We will explain the purpose and design of our study, encouraging parents to ask questions about the project (see attached Telephone Recruiting Script). Parents of children who are interested in participating will then be screened for eligibility (see attached Telephone Screening Questionnaire).

Describe Study Consent ProceduresEach member of the research team has been extensively trained in consent procedures by [CONTACT_6283]. Rynn and Marsh and has completed the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_536083]. The person obtaining consent will explain the protocol and associated risks to the prospective participant's parent/guardian. They will review the study objectives and procedures with the parent/guardian and ask him/her to read the attached consent form. The research team will also answer any questions the parent/guardian may have and ensure that the participant's parent/guardian understands that information collected as part of this study may be used in the future to answer other research questions not specified in this protocol as we learn more about the diagnoses and neurobiological mechanisms of interest. Once the research team member obtaining consent feels confident the participant is comfortable with the requirements of the study, they will obtain informed consent from the parent/guardian by [CONTACT_536114]/her sign the consent form. The consent process will be conducted after the telephone screening but before any other part of the study is conducted. Because we will collect medical histories from all participants, each participant's parent/guardian will be asked to sign a HIPPA form prior to review of his or her child's medical history and prior to participation in the study. Permission to review medical histories is thus documented in writing. This form is designed to inform parents/guardians of their child's rights to privacy and of measures that we will take to keep their information as secure as possible according to the law. Our HIPAA form is in accordance with all federal and state regulations as laid out by [CONTACT_19819].

After completing the screening procedures, eligible participants will proceed to the baseline study visit. We will make every effort to schedule study procedures so that they do not interfere with the school day, especially for the control group. Should a family of a child/adolescent with OCD in search of treatment decide to participate in an in-person screen during a school day (times), we will leave that decision up to the family. The baseline study visit will include optional training in the Mock scanner, pregnancy testing, an MRI scan, Neuropsychological testing and completion of self-report forms. These procedures are described below:Mock Scanner or MRI Simulator : The participant will have the option to undergo training for the MRI scan in an MRI simulator. Two software programs are used in the MRI simulator: SimFx and Motrack. SimFx software simulates the ambient scanner sound and the active scanning noise. Motrack software uses trackSTAR to monitor how much a participant moves, through the use of a sensor attached to the participant's head. The purpose of the MRI simulator is to provide a realistic scanning experience to help the participant gradually acclimate to scanning procedures.Pregnancy Test: All females who are post-menarchal will be required to take a pregnancy test prior to the MRI scan. In addition, all post-menarchal females will be required to take a pregnancy test at the screening visit to ensure eligibility. The tests will be conducted on-site after the signing of the consent/assent forms and will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758]. Urine samples will be collected and pregnancy tests done on the day of the screen and MRI scan. Children and their parents will be told about the results of pregnancy tests done on minors. The participant must have a negative pregnancy test in order to participate in this study. The trained clinician (i.e., professionally trained, bachelor's or higher level clinician) will conduct the pregnancy test and discuss the results with the parent and child. Whether the parent and the child are told the results of the pregnancy test together or separately will be determined on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_536116]. Rynn and Marsh and other senior staff based on all available data on the family. In the rare instance of a positive pregnancy test, a trained clinician will provide appropriate information and referrals. The participant will be encouraged to consult with heir primary physician or with a family planning clinic.  MRI Scan  Pulse Sequence Approximate Scan Time fMRI 50 minutes Anatomical 25  minutes DTI 10  minutes * see attached for full pulse sequence For the MRI procedures, the participant will be instructed to lie as still as possible within the magnet for 90 minutes. All precautions and protections will be given to the participant to ensure that they are as safe and comfortable as possible. For the participant’s comfort within the scanner, they will lie on a padded table with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_536084]. A blanket will also be provided to keep participants warm during the procedure. If the participant appears nervous or anxious, a trained member of the research staff will remain with them inside the scanning suite for the duration of the scan. The participant will be given a squeeze ball to terminate the scan at any time. If they squeeze the ball, they will be removed from the scanner immediately. All of the MRI procedures will be conducted on the 3-Tesla MRI scanner at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. Conducting these procedures will be an accredited Magnetic Resonance

Page [ADDRESS_697898] (B.M.R.) and two members of the research staff (Bachelor’s Level or Higher) trained in the acquisition of MR images by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Marsh, as well as in procedures for testing human participants.Functional MRI procedures will include the completion of the Simon Spatial Compatibility Task (Simon) and the Virtual Reality Maze Tasks (VR). EyeLink 1000 Plus system will be used during these tasks to observe and analyze the participant’s eye movements during each task. By [CONTACT_536117]'s gaze we will be able to determine whether or not the participant is focused on the stimulus presented on the screen. The fMRI tasks are as follows:1. In the Simon Task, participants are instructed to respond with a button press each time an arrow is displayed to indicate the direction in which it was pointing. Most of the stimuli will be arrows that were displayed on congruent sides of the screen (e.g. left-pointing arrows displayed on the left side of the screen). Only a few of the stimuli will be presented on the incongruent side of the screen (e.g. left-pointing arrow displayed on the right side of the screen). Participants will be asked to inhibit the response to the location of arrow display and indicate their response to the direction of the arrow displayed.2. The VR task is designed to study declarative and procedural/habit-learning and memory systems. Participants will be told that they will find themselves in the center of a virtual maze with [ADDRESS_697899] and that their task is to find hidden rewards ($ signs). The task will use a joystick to navigate through the environment. There will be both a spatial (declarative) and an S-R (procedural) learning condition. In the declarative version, participants must remember the locations of extra-maze cues (e.g. mountains, trees, and a sunset) to find the rewards. In the S-R version, participants must learn to approach lit arms to obtain rewards. Here, the extra-maze cues will be randomly interchanged at the end of each trial, thus destroying any possibility of using spatial learning to find the rewards.In total, we will collect data from three modalities of MRI within this study: functional MRI; anatomical MRI; and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Between the functional and structural (anatomical and DTI) scans there will be a break for participants to stretch and use the bathroom. Child participants will be given the option to watch a segment of a child-friendly movie during the structural portion of the scan. Although our MRI Scans are for research purposes, T-[ADDRESS_697900] T1-weighted volumetric MRI series will be acquired for use in estimating the proportions of gray matter, white matter and CSF content of the head of the caudate through tissue segmentation. Second, glutamate (Glu) levels will

The Glu data will be quantified as peak area ratios relative to the robust unsuppressed water resonance (W) in a spectroscopic imaging data set that will be acquired in just 4 min using the same spatial parameters as in the PRESS SI sequence.Neuropsychological AssessmentsAll participants will undergo neuropsychological testing that includes measures of intelligence, impulse control and sustained attention, memory, and learning. These behavioral measures, conducted either before or after (but always within a week of) the scanning session for each participant, will be used in correlation analyses with our MRI measures of brain function, connectivity, and morphology.These measures will be used in correlation analyses with measures of regional brain activation. (Please see “Instruments” below for a complete listing of these measures).The tests assessments will all be administered at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute by a trained member of the research staff (Bachelor’s level or higher). Self-reports Participants and their parents will fill out self-report forms during the baseline study visit and during screening. Please see the section on assessment instruments for more detail about these self-reports. Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) TreatmentUpon completion of the diagnostic interviews, neuropsychological tests, and baseline MRI scan, pediatric participants diagnosed with OCD will be offered standard evidence based CBT treatment in the PAMRC. The treatment team will offer a course of CBT (45 minute sessions for 12 to 16 weeks), augmented by [CONTACT_536118]. This treatment will be overseen by [CONTACT_6283]. Rynn, Goldberg, Yanes-Lukin and Puliafico. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a treatment based on learning and cognitive theories. CBT for OCD involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety provoking stimuli while having patients refrain from engaging in compulsive rituals and/or avoidance behaviors. There are three major components of CBT treatment for OCD, specifically: (1) exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli, (2) response prevention, and (3) cognitive techniques intended to decrease anxiety during the exposure and response prevention processes. CBT has demonstrated clinically significant effects in reducing pediatric OCD symptomatology in several randomized controlled clinical trials (Abramowitz, Whiteside, & Deacon, 2005, for review). We will use the following referral sources for those for whom treatment in PAMRC might not be suitable (CUCARD, CHONY, NYU Child Study Center, private practices etc.) The study physician and psychologist will provide ongoing monitoring of treatment cases during the PAMRC weekly research meeting and at the midpoint CBT treatment (between 6 to 8 weeks) the study physician will be scheduled to clinically evaluate participants with the standard clinical PAMRC protocol. At this time, the study physician will administer the CSSRS and the CGI. He will also conduct a clinical review of symptoms. Additionally, the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752]/or independent evaluator will clinically evaluate the participant by [CONTACT_536119]. If the study staff believe that the patient meets for clinical deterioration, following administration of these assessments, the physician will discuss with the family the option of augmenting treatment with medication. In addition to ongoing monitoring and treatment midpoint

Page 22 of 31
physician evaluations, the study clinician will complete weekly clinical assessments, including the CGI, as indicated in the treatment manual “OCD in Children and Adolescents: A Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Manual” by [CONTACT_270095], M.D. To ensure that EX/RP is delivered appropriately, treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_536120]/RP and supervised by [CONTACT_536121], Ph.D. and Paula Yanes-Lukin, Ph.D., both of whom are experts in EX/RP treatment. To ensure fidelity, treatment for all participants will follow the treatment manual “OCD in Children and Adolescents: A Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Manual” by [CONTACT_270095], M.D. Clinicians will meet weekly with [CONTACT_536157] or [CONTACT_536158]-Lukin for supervision on study treatment cases, and Drs. Puliafico and Yanes-Lukin will review treatment procedures to ensure fidelity and appropriate clinical care. End of Study VisitAll treatment-seeking OCD participants will be asked to return for an end of study visit following completion of their treatment in the PAMRC. We will also ask age-and gender-matched control participants to return for an end of study visit, within [ADDRESS_697902] scan. Procedures for the end of study visit will be similar to those described for the baseline visit. The following assessments will be completed during the end of study visit: Diagnostic and Safety assessments:Diagnostic Assessments: Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule- Child/Parent version (Subsections of ADIS that were endorsed at baseline will be administered to all child/adolescent participants and their parents at follow-up.); Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Child version (CYBOCS), Clinical Global Inventory- Severity Scale; Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAM-D)Feasibility and safety measures: Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating ScaleMedical: Tanner Scale, vital signs, and height and weight measurements to ensure participant safety prior to the MRI scan MRI: MRI Screening Questionnaire (The screening questionnaire includes questions regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, including the presence of ferromagnetic implants, pubertal status, and pregnancy)Self-Report Forms:Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R), Family Accommodation Scale (FAS), Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire-Children (SPSRQ-C), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUSC), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) Brief, Media Use Questionnaire Neuropsychological Testing:Stroop Word-Color Interference, Continuous Performance Task, the Reinforcement Learning Go/no-go task, and the risk/ambiguity tasks 2nd MRI Scan:

The MRI procedures and pulse sequences used in the second scan will be the same as those described for the baseline scan. The MRS data may also be collected from OCD participants who remain symptomatic at end of study. MRS procedures and pulse sequences used at end of study will be the same as those described for the baseline scan. The purpose of the follow-up visit is to have information allowing us to compare brain structure and function before and after treatment in children and adolescents with OCD and to be able to examine the relationships with treatment response.Follow-Up Care Upon completion of CBT treatment, end of treatment assessments and MRI Scan, participants will be offered an additional 3 months of follow up care, consisting of 3 monthly booster sessions, and/or open medication management, if applicable. If a participant is withdrawn from the study or drops out of the study, he/she will also be offered 3 monthly booster sessions. In the event they prefer to be treated elsewhere, they will also be provided referrals to community providers. All participants will be assessed during these booster session OCD severity (using the CYBOCS and CGI-S by [CONTACT_35520]). Patients and families will have the option of completing [ADDRESS_697903] experienced worsening of CGI-S by [CONTACT_536122] (such as family therapy and education support). If the child/adolescent continues to show clinical deterioration during the study and further continuation under such circumstances would be detrimental to the child/adolescent, the participant will be withdrawn from the study. If the child/adolescent is withdrawn from the protocol, the child/adolescent will be eligible for [ADDRESS_697904] treatment in the PAMRC, consisting of 3 monthly booster sessions.If the participant or the participant’s parent/guardian would prefer outside referrals, arrangements will be made by [CONTACT_16133].

Assessment InstrumentsCreate a table or give a brief description of the instruments that will be used for assessmentDiagnostic Assessments:Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children for DSM-IV (ADIS-C/P Revised): This will be administered to the participant and parent/caretaker by [CONTACT_400240] (IE) at screening to confirm the diagnosis of OCD and its age of onset. Family History Screen (FHS): This screens for the presence of 15 psychiatric disorders among the participant’s biological relatives. It is administered to a family informant (for those ages 6-17) or to the subject (ages 18-20), who reports on himself/herself and on other biological relatives. It will be administered by [CONTACT_327197].The Tanner Scale: This is a scale of physical development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. Participants look at pi[INVESTIGATOR_536085]. Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Child version (CYBOCS): The CYBOCS is a semi-structured measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. It is validated in those starting at age 7 and used in studies up to age 20. The CYBOCS differs from the adult YBOCS only in its use of simpler language. The CYBOCS will be administered by [CONTACT_536125]. Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D, 17-item): This semi-structured interview which assesses the severity of depressive symptoms is validated for use in ages 7 and above. It will be administered by [CONTACT_484846].   Feasibility and Safety Assessments:Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS): This is a semi-structured clinician rating of suicidal behavior, suicide attempts, and presence and intensity of suicidal ideation. Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ): Used in prior studies, this scale includes questions about satisfaction with treatment (CSQ). It will be completed by [CONTACT_2299] (and parent/caretaker for those < 18 and those 18-20 with permission). For children under the age of 12, the Research Assistant (RA) will be present in case of reading comprehension questions. Self-Report Forms:
Protocol Summary Form7006Marsh, Rachel
Page 25 of 31
OCD onset Form- This is a questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_536126], used previously in IRB # 6574, to gather information about the onset and severity of OCD symptoms. Following the completion of the questionnaire, the Independent Evaluator (IE) completes a composite form taking into account the parent and child reports. Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R): This 27-item self-report questionnaire measures OCD-specific functional impairment. The COIS-R-C is a 3-factor structure youth-report form. The COIS-R-P is a 4-factor structure parent-report measure (completed by [CONTACT_7071]/caretaker for those <18 and those 18-20 with permission). Both will be completed at baseline. Family Accommodation Scale (FAS) (5 minutes): This scale consists of 12 items to assess the areas and the level of family accommodation to the patient’s OCD symptoms. It will be completed by [CONTACT_536127]. Isolated Tics/Tic Disorder Assessment: The parent(s) of the participant will be asked five questions about family history of isolated tics and Tic Disorder. The questions were developed by [CONTACT_536128].Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire-Children (SPSRQ-C): This questionnaire measures Gray's anxiety and impulsivity dimensions. The questionnaire will be used to assess reward sensitivity.Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children (IUSC): The IUSC is a 27-item, 5-point Likert-style rating scale of a child’s negative reaction to uncertain or ambiguous situations on emotional, cognitive, or behavioral level. The rating scale is completed by [CONTACT_536129]. IUSC Child and Parent forms have been validated in samples of youth ages 7-17, and the outcomes of this psychometric study have been published in Psychological Assessment (Comer, Roy et al., 2009). Specifically, both the parent and child forms of the IUSC have demonstrated strong internal consistency, as well as convergent validity as evidenced by [CONTACT_536130], worry, and reassurance-seeking. Children with anxiety disorders score higher than matched non-referred community youth on both the parent and child forms. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrate acceptable overall utility for the measure in distinguishing youth with anxiety disorders from youth without anxiety disorders. In all, findings from this psychometric work provide support for the use of the IUSC for continuous measurement of children's ability to tolerate uncertainty.Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) Brief:  The BIS Brief is an 8-item, 4-point Likert-style rating scale, adapted from the BIS-11 self report, and  designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness.The Short Grit Scale: The Short Grit Scale is an 8-item self-report survey that measures persistence and commitment to long-term goals. It takes fewer than 10 minutes to complete and score, and is designed to be appropriate for children. The child reads or hears sentences like "I am a hard worker" and then chooses a response on a scale of [ADDRESS_697907] describes himself or herself.  Media Use Questionnaire: This questionnaire is a 5-item self-report survey that measures media use in youth (i.e. time spent on TV, video games, phone; types of video games, etc.) which was adapted from the Media Use measure in the PhenX Toolkit (#750700). It will be completed by [CONTACT_536131]. Neuropsychological Testing:Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II): This estimates Full Scale IQ with excellent reliability and validity for ages 6-90. It consists of four subtests: Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, and Matrix Reasoning. The full assessment will be administered by [CONTACT_536132].

Page [ADDRESS_697908]-Color Interference: This is a classic task of cognitive interference that is comprised of 3 subtasks. In task A (color naming), participants are asked to name [CONTACT_536150] (red, green, or blue) of 126 dots, 5.6 mm in diameter, arrayed randomly in 9 columns and 14 rows on an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of white paper, scanned left to right and then top to bottom. In B (word reading), they are asked to read as quickly as possible an equal number of similarly arrayed words ("red", "green", or "blue") printed in black ink. In C (color-word naming), they are asked to name [CONTACT_536151] a similar array of words written in incongruent colors. The time to completion of each task is recorded (A, B, and C, respectively). Stroop interference is calculated as C-[(AxB)/(A+C)].The PhenX Toolkit Hand Dominance Measure: This measure assesses one’s handedness, and is based off of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The PhenX Toolkit is a collection of measures developed for researchers to use to combine or share data. Continuous Performance Task: The Continuous Performance Task (CPT)is a standardize measure of sustained attention and impulsivity. Subjects are presented with a series of letters on a computer screen and are instructed to hit the spacebar on the keyboard whenever a letter is presented. However, subjects are instructed to not hit the spacebar when the letter “X” is shown.Reinforcement Learning Go/no-go task:Participants will be presented with one of [ADDRESS_697909] learn to press (i.e., ‘Go’) or not to press (i.e., ‘NoGo’) a button for each image. Two of the images are more associated with reward (i.e. participants gain points if they press the button upon presentation of those images); another two images are more associated with punishment (participants lose points if they press the button); and the last image is neutral. Not pressing the button is never associated with feedback and does not gain or lose points. By [CONTACT_536133] (for the respective images), the task can determine if they learn better from rewards or punishments, respectively. The task consists of 150 trials: 3 blocks of 50 trials (each image presented 10 times with images randomly intermixed). Stop Signal Task: Participants will perform a child-friendly visual stop-signal task, in which they will be asked to indicate the direction of an airplane with a button press. Eighty percent of the trials will be simple go trials. Unpredictability, on 20% of trials, a stop signal (cross) will appear with a delay after the airplane. Behavioral outcome measures will be the subject-specific stop-signal reaction time (speed of the stop process), the mean reactions time on the accurate go trials (speed of go process), and the error percentage on go trials (overall attention). Decision-Making Tasks: These tasks investigate how individuals make decisions under risky or ambiguous conditions. Participants will make many choices between different amounts of money that they can receive at different times or with different likelihoods. The tasks will begin with a set of instructions and a couple of practice trials. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], two or more options will be presented simultaneously on the screen. For instance, one option might be a money amount to be received soon and the other might be another amount to be received later, or one option might be a money amount to be received with some stated or unstated likelihood and the other might be another amount to be received for sure. After a brief delay, the options will disappear and subjects will be prompted to state their choice by [CONTACT_7326] a particular key on the computer keyboard. The trial will end with the subject's answer. The program will then move on to the next trial after a short delay. Each task will include 100-[ADDRESS_697910] approximately 15 minutes. Breaks will be provided and available anytime subjects require them. At the end, one of the participant’s choices will be selected randomly to count for actual payment that will be given in cash ($0 to $66), immediately following their completion of the tasks. This payment mechanism ensures that the experiment is incentive compatible: participants don’t know which choice will count for actual payment and will not be able to

The task is administered on a laptop computer (Dell). In the Weather Prediction task, subjects are required to "guess" whether card-like stimuli mean that the weather will be sunny or whether the cards mean that it will rain. On each of [ADDRESS_697912] instruments are usedResearch Related Delay to TreatmentWill research procedures result in a delay to treatment?YesMaximum duration of delay to any treatment It is anticipated that the maximum time from the time of consent to completion of the first MRI scan will be no more than [ADDRESS_697913]. Rynn and her clinical team in the Children's Day Unit will be in contact [CONTACT_536134]. All attempts will be made to schedule the scan within 2 weeks of consent, though we may require 4 weeks to accommodate participants’ and their families' schedules. If clinically inappropriate to delay treatment, the case will be referred for treatment within our system or elsewhere. If a child suddenly met any exclusion criteria (e.g., active suicidal ideation) or no longer met the inclusion criteria of being "able to tolerate a treatment-free period," the patient would be removed from the study and referred for treatment. Patients may refuse to participate at any point and seek treatment.Maximum duration of delay to standard care or treatment of known efficacysame as above Treatment to be provided at the end of the studyFollowing completion of treatment in the PAMRC (including 3 months of follow-up care following completion of study treatment) and all other study procedures, children with OCD will be referred to other clinical settings (outpatient mental health care clinics or private clinicians specializing in OCD) in the tri-state area if they need additional care.Clinical Treatment AlternativesClinical treatment alternativesCurrently cognitive-behavioral treatment involving exposure and response prevention (CBT/ERP) and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medication are considered the first line treatments for OCD. However, pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_327162]. CBT/ERP treatment is the mainstay of the treatment for OCD. Yet, CBT/ERP alone results in response rates of anywhere between 60% and 80%, and

fear of non-adherence to ERP is hypothesized to contribute to the lack of ERP efficacy across age groups.Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences Risks that could be encountered during the study periodClinical and Neuropsychological Assessments: No risks are associated with these assessments. If the participant no longer wishes to continue the testing, they may stop at any time. All tests will be administered at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute by a trained member of the research staff (Bachelor’s level or higher). Any adverse events that occur during the interview and/or any information that warrants clinical attention (i.e. suicidal ideation, intent to harm oneself/others) will be reported immediately to Drs. Rynn and Marsh, and proper interventions and referrals will be made.Diagnostic Interviews: No risks are associated with these diagnostic interviews. If the participantno longer wishes to continue the interview, they may stop at any time. All interviews will beconducted at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. The interviews will be performed by [CONTACT_536135] (Bachelor’s level or higher). Any adverse events that occurduring the interview and/or any information that warrants clinical attention (i.e. suicidal ideation,intent to harm oneself/others) will be immediately reported to Drs. Rynn and Marsh, and properinterventions and referrals will be made.Pregnancy Testing: No known risks are associated with pregnancy testing. If the results of thepregnancy test cause the participant and parent any distress, a trained member of the research staff willdiscuss the results with her, and appropriate referrals will be made.Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Both the FDA and the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_536086] 3Tesla MRI Scanner at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute to be classified as anon-significant risk.  CBT Treatment: There is a possibility that symptoms may not improve or could worsen during treatment. Any patient who is evaluated by [CONTACT_536136] (CGI-S score of 5) for two consecutive visits will be evaluated by [CONTACT_536137] (such as family therapy and education supporters). At this time, the study physician will discuss the possibility of withdrawing from the study or beginning medication treatment in conjunction with CBT.  In the case of combined treatment with medication treatment:Adverse events will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_536138]. The study physician will review with the participant and their families the following potential serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) related adverse events: gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, pain, diarrhea, and constipation), dizziness, allergic reactions, increased anxiety or irritability, increased activation/restlessness, sleep changes (increased or decreased), sexual side effects, appetite changes (increase or decreased), unusual thoughts, sweating, fatigue, suicidal ideation/attempts/and or behaviors. In addition to these issues, the study physician will discuss with participants and their families the Food and Drug Administration advisory that the use of antidepressants like the SSRIs may lead to suicidal

thinking/attempts in depressed and anxious youth and that the FDA has placed product warning label with information highlighting the need for close observation for worsening of symptoms and the emergence of suicidality in children treated with these medications. This information will be a part of the consent process for the study so that families are aware of these issues when considering the addition of medication treatment. The study physician will review with the adolescents and their legal guardians, potential adverse events and to carefully monitor for any significant changes in mood, thinking, behaviors, and physical symptoms especially early in medication treatment. The adolescents and their families will be instructed to call the study physician with any concerns, and to call the 24 hour on call service at the Child/Adolescent Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) for any emergency.Describe procedures for minimizing risksTo reduce the potential for participant fatigue, we will offer several breaks to the participants throughout study procedures. Prior to the administration of the interviews, participants will be told that if any questions make him/her uncomfortable, he/she can ask to move on to the next question. This will be done to minimize any potential discomfort from the personal nature of the questions asked. In EX/RP treatment, patients confront feared situations that are expected to produce moderate levels of distress initially. This initial fear reaction is essential to the treatment, as it allows the patient to habituate to situations in which he or she is excessively or irrationally fearful. Exposures to feared situations are carried out with the patient’s advance knowledge and full consent. Such exposure procedures have produced considerable benefits in studies of children and adolescents with OCD. The only reported side effect has been transient increases in anxiety. These reactions will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_536139].There is a possibility that symptoms may not improve or could worsen during treatment. Any patient who is evaluated by [CONTACT_536136] (CGI-S score of 5) for two consecutive visits will be evaluated by [CONTACT_536137] (such as family therapy and education supporters). At this time, the study physician will discuss the possibility of withdrawing from the study or beginning medication treatment in conjunction with CBT.Methods to Protect ConfidentialityDescribe methods to protect confidentialityIn all records from this study, the names of participants and their family members will be available only to the team of researchers working on the study. Neither their names nor any identifying information will be used in any scientific reports from this study or from secondary data analyses conducted with de-identified data from this study. All the information obtained from the subjects is coded by [CONTACT_536140], confidential files. MRI data from this study will be stored on computers behind firewalls in our laboratory at NYSPI.

Adolescents participating in the study will receive therapy from psychologists specifically trained in CBT/ERP therapy. The response rate of CBT/ERP could be up to 80%. Therefore, there is a good chance patients’ symptoms will improve during the study.Another direct benefit of study participation is that patients will receive a completepsychiatric and medical evaluation. During this evaluation, other potential problems may be identified by [CONTACT_536141]. In this instance, the study clinician will inform the participant that further evaluation and clinical assessment may be indicated, and will provide a brief summary of the information obtained to any treatment provider selected by [CONTACT_2299].Compensation and/or Reimbursement Will compensation or reimbursement for expenses be offered to subjects?YesPlease describe and indicate total amount and schedule of payment(s). Include justification for compensation amounts and indicate if there are bonus payments.Following completion of the MRI scan and MRI assessments (diagnostic interviews, clinical and neuropsychological assessments) healthy control participants, 11 years or younger, will be compensated $[ADDRESS_697915] ($50 for the MRI scan, $50 for the neuropsychological testing, and $75 for the interviews), and OCD participants, 11 years or younger, will be compensated $[ADDRESS_697916] ($50 for the MRI scan, $25 for the neuropsychological testing, and $25 for the interviews). Healthy control participants 12 years and older, will be compensated $175 for their time in the form of a check ($50 for the MRI scan, $50 for the neuropsychological testing, and $75 for the interviews). OCD participants 12 years and older, will be compensated $100 for their time in the form of a check ($50 for the MRI scan, $25 for the neuropsychological testing, and $25 for the interviews). Gift cards will be given to participants on site following completion of study procedures. For children 12 years and older, checks will be mailed to the participant's home address and can be expected to arrive within 2-[ADDRESS_697917] the opportunity to earn $20 in the Virtual Reality (VR) fMRI task. Because these are measures of reward-based learning, participants must be rewarded immediately after the task has been completed based on their task performance so that we can accurately assess the functioning of reward circuits.

Participants will also be given the opportunity to earn up to $66 while playing computer tasks (risk/ambiguity tasks). Each participant can win $0-$66 on these tasks, combined. Participants will be rewarded with the amount they won immediately following the completion of these tasks.  Healthy control participants who return for a follow-up scan and assessments will again be compensated $175 for their time, and OCD participants who return will again be compensated $100 for their time (in the form of a gift card or check depending on their age) and given another opportunity to earn $20 in the VR task and up to $[ADDRESS_697918] MRI scan.  Additionally, families may receive up to $30 per visit to reimburse for transportation costs to and from the study site, as requested. This reimbursement will be offered in the form of a check mailed to the families' home address and can be expected to arrive within 2-3 weeks of the study visit.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Functional MRI (fMRI) Data Processing The Human Connectome Project (HCP) preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_32042]1 will be used to preprocess all multiband functional imaging data. Briefly, this will include gradient unwarpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], motion correction, field map-based EPI [INVESTIGATOR_536090], brain-boundary-based registration of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_536091] T1-weighted scan, non-linear (FNIRT) registration into MNI152 space, and grand-mean intensity normalization. The EPI [INVESTIGATOR_536092] a 4mm Gaussian kernel. Additional processing will be run in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Using commands from Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI; http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/) and FMRIB Software Library (FSL; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) software, BOLD signal will be demeaned and detrended (AFNI 3dDetrend), despi[INVESTIGATOR_116111] (AFNI 3dDespi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -localedit), and bandpass filtered (FSL fslmaths 0.01-0.08 Hz). Nuisance regression of 24 motion parameters (bandpass filtered; 6 motion parameters, derivatives, and squares), as well as of average global signal from gray and white matter, and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_536093]. Motion censoring2 based on framewise displacement (FD; >0.2mm) and DVARS (z-score>3) will also be performed. Structural MRI Data Processing Two high-resolution T1-weighted BRAVO structural images will be averaged and bias field corrected. Data will then be processed in FreeSurfer3,4. This will include subcortical segmentation (left and right thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens) and cortical parcellation (74 regions per hemisphere) based on the Destrieux atlas5. Output images will be visually inspected for quality. Diffusion MRI Data Processing Diffusion MRI data will be assessed for data quality and head motion. A structural connectivity matrix will be estimated for each participant using the standard MRtrix3 preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]6, yielding a 164x164 symmetrical streamline count matrix for each participant using the FreeSurfer segmentations/parcellations noted above (148 cortical, 14 subcortical regions, and the left and right cerebellum). Using this approach, streamline count between brain regions is proportional to the cross-sectional area of white matter fibers connecting those regions. Thus, streamline count is a biologically plausible metric of "structural connectivity" proposed to represent the communicatLRQµEDQGZLGWK¶EHWZHHQUHJLRQVWKRXJKLWPD\LQGLFDWHHLWKHUVSDUVHbut fast (i.e. few large diameter axons) or dense but slow (i.e. many small diameter axons) connections7. Furthermore, streamline counts in macaques significantly correlate with connection strength from anatomical tract-tracing, supporting its validity as an indicator of fiber connection strength8.  Hypothesis Testing:  Primary Outcome Analysis: Brain activation (i.e., BOLD signal) during performance of an fMRI task (Simon) that requires self-regulatory control in children and adolescent with OCD compared to age-matched healthy control (HC) participants. First-level parametric analyses will be performed for each participant using the general linear model (GLM) provided by [CONTACT_237777]12. For each participant, preprocessed time series data from all three Simon task runs will be modeled using a GLM with six conditions: 1) Incongruent correct trails preceded by [CONTACT_536145] (cI), 2) Congruent correct trials preceded by [CONTACT_536146] (iC), 3) Incongruent correct trials preceded by [CONTACT_536146] (iI), 4) Congruent correct trials preceded by [CONTACT_536145] (cC), 5) fixation trials, and 6) incorrect trials (incongruent or congruent), including trials with reaction times below the minimal RT of 200ms for stimulus detection and processing. These events will be convolved with the canonical HRF and then least-squares regression will be used to estimate parameters for each independent variable for each participant. Only correct trials will be included, given the limited number of incorrect trials. Runs in which a participant have more than 30% error rate on the task will be excluded from analyses. Because activation of task control regions is greatest when level of conflict is maximal (i.e., when incongruent stimuli are preceded by [CONTACT_536147])9, analyses will focus on post-congruent trials. Parameter estimates averaged across the three runs will be used to produce a post-congruent Incongruent versus post-congruent Congruent (cI-cC) contrast for each participant to access brain activation associated with the engagement of self-regulatory control and resolution of maximal cognitive conflict. Whole-brain second-level analyses of conflict-related BOLD signal will be performed using voxel-wise independent t-WHVWVDFURVVJURXSV2&'YV+&DGMXVWLQJIRUSDUWLFLSDQWV¶DJHVH[DQGKHDGPRWLRQLHmean FD). A cluster-defining threshold (CDT) of p<.001 will be applied to all second-level group comparisons 
maps, with Family Wise Error correction for multiple comparisons of p<.05 at the cluster level (FWEc). For each significant group difference detected, the direction of the effect will then be explored using within-group t-maps (CDT of p<.001, uncorrected). We hypothesize that compared to healthy controls, children and adolescents with OCD will have increased activation in subcortical structures (insula, and putamen) comprising a right hemisphere dorsal frontostriatal circuit while performing a self-regulatory control task (Simon task). Secondary Outcome 1 Analysis: fMRI functional connectivity (FC) in task-control circuits in children and adolescent with OCD compared to age-matched HC participants. Whole-Brain Connectome-Level Analyses will be performed on the preprocessed fMRI data, computing FC-strength indices using Fisher Z-Transformation of the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between 352 regions (i.e., 333 cortical surface10 and 19 subcortical11 parcellated regions). Edge-wise functional connectivity analyses will then be conducted whole-brain across the resulting matrix comprised of 352 nodes and 123,904 edges. Analyses examining group differences will be adjusted for age at the time of scanning, sex, and head motion (mean FD) and conducted using the Network-Based Statistics (NBS) Toolbox12 in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). NBS controls for family-wise error rate using permutatiRQWHVWLQJWRLGHQWLI\FRPSRQHQWVRU³FOXVWHUV´RIFRQWLJXRXVregion-to-region connections. A statistical threshold of p=.05 with 20,000 permutations will be used. We hypothesize that youth with OCD will show altered functional connectivity between task-control circuit regions. Secondary Outcome 2 Analysis: Regional subcortical volume and cortical thickness based on structural MRI data in children and adolescent with OCD compared to age-matched HC participants. Group differences in regional subcortical volume and cortical thickness will be assessed using linear regressions controlling for age and sex (ICV covaried subcortical volumes analyses). False discovery rate (FDR) will be used to correct for multiple comparisons (14 for subcortical analyses and 148 for cortical analyses).  A follow-up vertex-wise analysis (QDEC in FreeSurfer) will probe group differences in cortical thickness (smoothed at 20mm), controlling for age and sex. Results will be corrected for multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulations with a vertex-wise threshold of p<.001 and an analysis-level threshold of p<.05 correcting for tests in each hemisphere (mri_glmfit-sim --cache 3 abs --2spaces). Given that prior meta- and mega-analyses of structural abnormalities in pediatric OCD by [CONTACT_536148]-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium ENIGMA OCD only showed small effect sizes in unmedicated youth with OCD compared to healthy participants13, we do not expect significant group differences in subcortical volumes or cortical thickness.  Secondary Outcome 3 Analysis: Structural connectivity (streamline count) based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data in children and adolescent with OCD compared to age-matched HC participants. Structural connectivity matrices will be analyzed using the NBS toolbox12 in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). To avoid examining very sparse connections, those with median streamline count <100 will be zeroed out for exclusion from analysis. Group differences in structural connectivity (streamline count) will be tested using two one-tailed contrasts (OCD>healthy and healthy>OCD, controlling for age and sex, and corrected to an analysis-level p<.025 (10,000 permutations). We hypothesize that youth with OCD will show altered structural connectivity in the corpus callosum and in tracts integrating the fronto-partial and cingulo-opercular networks that are functionally altered in OCD. Exploratory Analyses: In the children and adolescents with OCD, we will explore whether activation and functional connectivity is associated with OCD symptoms pre- to post-treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). These exploratory analyses will be restricted to regions/circuits in which group differences were detected (Primary Outcome and Secondary Outcome 1). Cross-lagged panel models will be constructed using IBM SPSS Amos to WHVWIRUGLUHFWLRQDO³FDXVDO´UHODWLRQVKLSVEHWZHHQ2&'V\PSWRPVDQGI05,measures pre- to post-CBT in the OCD patients. These models provide estimates of the extent to which a variable pre-CBT (e.g., connectivity) predicts another variable post-CBT (e.g., symptom severity), over and above the variability attributable to scores of that second variable (e.g., symptom severity) pre-CBT14. Thus, by [CONTACT_536149]-CBT on the same variable post-CBT, pre-CBT variables then predict the residual, or change in that variable from pre- to post-CBT. WKH&KLOGUHQ¶V<DOH-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)15 total scores at each time point will be used as the OCD symptoms measure. The initial model will be adjusted for age, sex, and head motion (mean FD). All variables at each time point will be covaried to adjust for shared variance. Non-significant paths (ps>.1) will be removed one at a time within each model, and a chi-square difference test will examine whether each removal significantly reduced model fit. All stability paths will be retained, even if non-significant, to adjust for baseline levels of each variable.

Background  
 
      Cannabis  use is prevalent among  emerging adults  (EAs)1, with national trends toward increasing use2 
and shifting cannabis -related attitudes .3 The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)  data show the 
annual , monthly, and daily  prevalence of cannabis use  increased in  18-25 year -olds from 2002 to 2014 .4 
Similarly, Monitoring the Future (MTF) data show daily cannabis use increased from 2007 to 2014  (from 3.5% 
to 5.9% ) in college students and  non-college EAs  (5.0% to 6.9%) .5 These increases are reflected in decreasing 
risk perceptions .4,6 Among EAs  from 2002 -2014, perceived risk of monthly and weekly cannabis used declined 
by 43% and 48%, respectively , with 75% of EAs  stating cannabis is easy to obtain  and decreases in perceived 
peer disapproval since 2008 .5 In 2015, 23%  of 18 year -olds reported having friends who use cannabis .7 These 
trends  are consistent with cannabis risk factors among  EAs: perceived availability, peer  use, and being offered 
cannabis .8-14 Furthermore, s hifting perceptions and increased prevalence are occur ring in the context of 
changing cannabis  policies .15 Legaliz ation of cannabis for re creational use by [CONTACT_67022] (ages 21+ ) in 8 states  
(WA, NE, ME, MA, CA, OR, AK, CO) and the District of Columbia (D.C.)  may impact the availability an d use of 
cannabis by [CONTACT_67023], as well as potentially allowing diversion to those under age [ADDRESS_73213] 
neuro -maturational changes to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866], resulting in adverse emotional and cognitive changes .17-19 
Decision -making and inhibitory control are critical function s developi[INVESTIGATOR_67007] , which can be  compromised by [CONTACT_67024] .19-21 Although c annabis use is related to long -term 
health problems  (e.g., lung cancer , respi[INVESTIGATOR_67008] )22-24, the short -term effects of cannabis are also 
alarming .25-28 After acute use ( <6 hours), cannabis can alter executive functions, such as : attention, decision -
making,  inhibition/ impulsivity, risk-taking, working memory, and concentration .18,[ADDRESS_73214]  
increased propensity for  risk behaviors, such as risky sex31,32 or impaired driving33,34; 10% of EAs reported 
past-year drugged driving1. Evidence supports  adverse r elationships between cannabis and psychiatric  
problem s35, including emerging  psychotic disorders .36,[ADDRESS_73215] pre valence. Given the role of peer influences in EAs ’ drug us e38, 
modifying perceived peer norms of cannabis use is a viable strategy . Thus, 
consistent with NIDA’s Strategic Plan for 2016 -2020 , which calls for researchers 
to “explore the potential for technology -based methods for delivering pr evention 
interventions, such as …social media,”  we seek to develop and test  a social  
media  (SM) intervention to address legal and illegal  recreational cannabis use by  
[CONTACT_67025], delivered by [CONTACT_67026] . SM provides the opportunity to intervene in EAs’ 
real-life contexts and to  harness peer influence s via peer-led interactions within a 
group -based intervention.  The guiding framework for this intervention can be 
found in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
Objective  
 
The specific aim of this  clinical trial is  to:  
 
 
Aim #2: Test the preliminary efficacy of a cannabis intervention  delivered by [CONTACT_23872] e -coaches  (versus 
attention -placebo control; up to N=90 per group  with a target enrollment of 72 per group ) on primary outcomes 
of cannabis use (quantity, frequency)  and hazardous use (i.e., consequences)  and secondary outcomes of 
perceived risk of cannabis, peer approval/disapproval of cannabis use , cannabis impaired d riving, other drug 
use, and alcohol use (quantity, frequency)  
Social Media Intervention Pi[INVESTIGATOR_67009]:  We will conduct a two -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_67010] -placebo control 
condition (n = up to  90 per group , target enrollment of 72 per group ) for EAs who use cannabis at least 
3x/week. Eligible participants will complete a baseline  survey , a post -test at 3 -months, and a 6 -month follow -
up.  
Figure 1. Guiding Conceptual Model  
 
Participants and Recruitment Procedure. Study participants will be recruited via sponsored advertisements 
appearing on social media websites (e.g., Facebook and Instagram). Advertisements will be targeted towards 
18-25 year olds in specific regions (e.g., states with legal recreational cannabis vs. not legal). When users click 
on the advertisement , they will be redirected to an  online screening consent  (with waiver of documentation ). 
Interested pa rticipants will be asked to provide consent in Qualtrics and answer a captcha question (for identity 
verification). Participants will have the option to print or save a copy of the informed consent before moving on 
to the online survey.   
 
Following determ ination of eligibility  by [CONTACT_12550] a [ADDRESS_73216] 
information for national organizations that ca n provide assistance in the areas of substance use and 
physical/mental health and well -being. No identifying information will be collected from participants who are not 
eligible for the study, although the IP address of the device used to complete the surv ey will be automatically 
recorded by [CONTACT_38385].  
 
Eligible participants will be notified of their eligibility and asked to provide contact [CONTACT_67027]. After completing the 
contact [CONTACT_33655], particip ants will see a “Thank You” message that includes a link to the resource list.  
 
Those eligible will be invited to review an RCT consent form, directed to an online baseline survey and priority -
mailed a urine drug screen (UDS; uploading  a photo of results, as in prior work137). Due to the COVID -19 
pandemic including the disruptions in work/research and participant concerns’ about receiving mailed 
packages, starting May 2020, baseline procedures will no longer include a UDS (as approved by [CONTACT_1758]’s 
NIDA Progr am Officer) . Participants will upload a selfie with a timestamp to verify their identity; baseline 
compensation will be a $[ADDRESS_73217]  for completing all procedures . Verified participants (e.g., captcha, verified 
survey completion time, IP address) will b e randomized and join their assigned secret Facebook group 
(intervention/ control; separated by [CONTACT_654] [18 -20, 21 -25] and residence in states with/without legal recreational 
cannabis).  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  Participants will be eligible for the scre ening survey if they are able to view and 
click on a social media ad, participants who cannot read English will be informally excluded . Participants will be 
eligible to participate in the study if they are [ADDRESS_73218] an active Facebook profile.  Participants will be excluded if they fail 
identity verification  based on: 1) IP addresses, 2) survey time completion, 3) repeat attempts, 4) survey 
respons es, and 5) photo identification via a timestamped selfie sent to the RAs. Participants  from an earlier 
intervention content development study used to determine content for this intervention  will be excluded.  
 
Randomization and Consideration of Key Biologic al Variables .  Randomization to conditions will be 
balanced across groups based on sex and cannabis use (<daily vs. daily [~43% estimate]), using urn 
randomization. Groups will be conducted separately by [CONTACT_654] (18 -20 vs. 21 -25) and state residence (legal 
recreational cannabis vs. not) with 8 groups total (4 intervention; 4 control; N~20 per group).  
  
Intervention condition. Content will be posted daily in secret Facebook groups where participants are 
randomly assigned at enrollment  (N~20 per group for this fe asibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]). Secret group members are kept 
private; groups cannot be identified in a web or Facebook search and can only be joined via a personal 
Facebook invitation  from study staff . Groups will be closed; with enrollment in the group within approxim ately [ADDRESS_73219] intervention content 6 times per day, 7 days per 
week, for 8 weeks, mostly during late afternoon and into evening/night to capture time after school or work . E-
coaches will also private message participants via other SM accounts (e.g., Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram) to 
notify them of trending posts and prompt them to visit the group. E -coaches will encourage discussion of 
content by [CONTACT_67028] -ended questio ns and reflections, consistent with M otivational Interviewing (MI).  They 
will reply to comments with MI strategies (e.g., reflection, affirmation), including managing sustain talk (e.g., 
come alongside, agree with a twist), tagging other participants’ or t he original commenter to encourage 
discussion and engagement. Based on our ongoing Alcohol  social media intervention  on Facebook, we have 
developed an e -coach manual outlining basic MI principles, protocols for posting, risk assessment (e.g., how to 
respon d if a participant posts about self -harm/suicidality), and e -coach professionalism (e.g., how to respond if 
a participant contacts the e -coach on their personal SM profile). The group process, although conducted online 
by [CONTACT_67029] e -coaches, is analogous to gr oup therapy in a treatment setting where therapi[INVESTIGATOR_67011], eliciting feedback, and calling on group members to 
react or to share their own ideas. “Tagging” a participant on a post functi ons like calling on a group member. 
To harness the presence of peers, e -coaches will tag multiple participants to encourage interaction. Use of 
“likes” and reactions (e.g., “haha,” “sad,”) allow for members and coaches to provide support and affirmation. 
We have also revised the User Safety Agreement from our current alcohol -SMI RCT for use in this study which 
outlines guidelines for participation (e.g., privacy, no posting opportunities to buy or receive drugs; no racial or 
political slurs; respect and con fidentiality). Participants must signify their agreement with the User Safety 
Agreement before receiving the group invitation. Groups will be monitored multiple times/day (including 
weekends, holidays) during the 8 -week period by [CONTACT_53339] e -coaches and ro tating on -call supervisors (all 
highly experienced in MI) who include the investigators, study coordinator, and our lab network of clinical post -
docs and clinical social workers, who work as a team across studies in our Center. We will note in the group 
cover photo, that we cannot monitor groups 24/7, and include crisis numbers.  
 
Attention -Control condition. Control participants will be assigned to secret Fa cebook groups where the e-
coaches (RAs) will post daily content (e.g., news, videos) unrelated to in tervention topi[INVESTIGATOR_67012] [ADDRESS_73220] agree to the User Safety Agreement; groups will be 
monitored.  
   
Follow -Up Procedures. Self-report data will be collected online via Qualtrics ($[ADDRESS_73221]; $40 
for 6-month follow -up). Participants will be reminded to complete post -test and follow -up measures via e -mail, 
private Facebook messaging, text message, and phone calls. Participants will be mailed UDSs and return 
time-stamped photos of their  results through Qualtrics , to encourage accurate reporting of cannabis use.  Due 
to the COVID -19 pandemic, including the disruptions in work/research and participant concerns’ about 
receiving mailed packages, follow -up procedures  will no longer include UDS  starting May 2020 (as approved 
by [CONTACT_67030] ).  
 
Measures.  
 
We will use reliable and valid measures from prior studies with adolescents and EAs .  
 
Screening Survey . To assess study eligibility and characterize the study sample, participants will be asked 
about their demographics41, social media involvement39,42 -44, and  health behaviors, including  cannabis use45.  
 
Baseline and Follow -Up Asse ssments . Participants will be asked to self-report measures including : 
demographics; SM involvement; cannabis use, motives, consequences, and protective strategies ; perceptions 
of peer approval, cannabis risk perceptions, etc. Primary dependent measures ar e cannabis quantity and 
frequency assessed in the Timeline Follow -back (TLFB170-172), hazardous use/consequences, risk perceptions 
and perceived peer approval. In May  2020  as approved by [CONTACT_1758]’s NIDA Program Official , all assessments 
will include questions pertaining to the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic  in order to provide important 
contextual information about substance use and psychosocial factors that may be related to study find ings.  If 
there is incomplete/inconsistent timeline follow back answers study staff will contact [CONTACT_67031] . We will ask participants to self -administer UDSs at baseline and follow -ups, sending a 
timestamped photo of results to t he study staff, since in -person UDSs are not possible in a national study. As 
described the recruitment and follow -up procedures above, as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic,  
participants will no longer receive a mailed  UDS. The 3 - and 6 -month surveys will  mirror the baseline survey 
measures with the inclusion of acceptability measures at 3 -months and engagement with other group members 
measures at 3 and 6 -months.  
 
 We will use software we developed to analyze user engagement with content posted in groups, tallying 
reactions (e.g., reactions, likes) and comments on a post. Our software also uses automated linguistic coding 
for text posts to categorize content (e.g.,  cannabis -related); we have developed a  list of drug terms, including 
slang, that will  be used in this coding.  This automated process will be supplemented by [CONTACT_67032] -
code non -text posts (e.g., videos) for topic and content.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_67013] [ADDRESS_73222]  and schedule a phone or video call with  up to 20  
participants. On the call  a member of the study team  will complete a pi[INVESTIGATOR_67014] -
structured interview (analogous to the Timeline Follow Back online survey measure they have completed at 
each study assessment) where participants will answer questions about their substance use in the past 30 
days. Participants will be paid $30 (online gift card) for completing this procedure.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_67015].  
 
 
Data analysis  
To assess changes in the primary dependent measures (perceptions of risk and peer approval, 
quantity/frequency of consumption, cannabis consequences)  while controlling for the fact that this is an 
individually randomized group -treatment trial (IR GT), we wi ll use we will use generalized linear mixed models 
(GLMMs) . We will account  for correlations between individual within the same Facebook group using random 
intercepts.  To assess  treatment effects at 3M and 6M outcom es, we will fit separate models for each follow -up 
that control for baseline measurement, as well as  age, sex, recreational cannabis status, and will  quantify the 
treatment effect using the coefficient for the treatment/control indicator. Controlling for the baseline outcome is 
critical for guar ding against regression to the mean in treatment effect estimation. We will convert the treatment 
effects to effect sizes (Cohen’s D) by [CONTACT_67033] (square root of) the total variation 
unaccounted for by [CONTACT_67034] (i.e., the residual variance + the random effect variance). 
Confidence intervals for the effect sizes will be derived using estimated marginal means (averaged across sex) 
and the confidence intervals are produced from the estimated variance of the esti mate, and the estimated 
residual degrees of freedom from the random effects model.  Overall, this approach is effectively the same as 
ANCOVA,  but accounting for the IRGT design, and controlling for sex and the strata used in the randomization 
(age and recr eational cannabis status). Our initial specification will be a linear mixed effects model (i.e. 
Gaussian error distribution) with only a random intercept to capture within -group  dependence. As the need is 
ascertained through model diagnostics, we will exam ine other distributional choices (e.g., Poisson, Negative 
Binomial) and more complex random effects structures  (e.g., autoregressive).  
 
Human Use Considerations and Protections  
 
Eligibility and study informed consent will be administered online ( a waiver of documentation  of consent is 
requested ) as the first pages of the screening and baseline surveys, respectively.  The consent document will 
include information on the general nature of the study, privacy rights, expectations for participation, the 
voluntary nature of participation, and that participation can be withdrawn at any time. Participants will also be 
assured that data will not be shared with anyone outside of the study team. Because of the sensitive nature of 
the information collected, as an  added protection for subjects, this research is covered by a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from NIH.  Study documents will make explicit the voluntary nature of the subjects’ participation 
as well as potential situations for breaking confidentiality (see below for more information about limitations to 
confidentiality). Participants will be informed that their answers to the screening questions will be used to 
determine their eligibility for a research study. No identifying information will be collected fro m those who 
complete the screen and are ineligible or choose not to participate in the study , although the IP address of the 
device used to complete the screening survey will be automatically recorded in Qualtrics .  
Since the age of majority varies across states (i .e., age [ADDRESS_73223] states, age 19  in Alabama and  Nebraska , 
and age 21 in Missi ssippi), a waiver of parental consent is also requested  for those participants who are in 
the study’s target age group but are under the legal age of consent in their state of residence (i.e ., AL, NE , 
MS). The same consent document described previously will be used for minors and adults. According to the 
Federal regulations governing research (45 CFR 46),163 Section 116(d) allows a waiver of the parental 
permission requirement for informed consent when (a) the research involves no more than minimal risk, (b) the 
waiver would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants, (c) the research could not 
practicably be c arried out without a waiver, and (d) whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.  
a) This study involves no more than minimal risk. Every effort will be made to ensure that study 
partic ipants are protected from risk. For screening eligibility, we will not collect any identifiers from participants 
unless they screen eligible for and are interested in enrolling in the main study. Screening data will be 
anonymous for those participants who are not eligible or interested in the main study. Participants  will be 
informed in the consent document about the procedures taken to maintain and protect their confidentiality, 
including assigning unique ID, securing data on secure, password protected UM servers and that this study is 
covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality.  
b) The waiver of parental consent does not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects  (age 
18-20 in certain states) . Screening data will be anonymous for those partic ipants who are not eligible for the 
main Aim [ADDRESS_73224] information and can indicate the method they prefer for being 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without a waiver: This research could not be 
practicably conducted without a waiver of parental consent because we would not be able to en sure 
confidentiality around  the participant’s substance use if parental consent were required for  participants under 
the age of majority in their state  (age 18 -20 in certain states) . Lack of a waiver of parental consent would 
hinder re cruitment, particularly of young adults  engaging in high -risk behaviors, and more importantly, have the 
potential to s everely limit the generalizability of the findings. Research shows lower rates of young adult 
enrollment when  parental consent is required , and that participants with lower risk (less substance use) are 
disproportionally enrolled (higher risk/ greater use less likely to participate).  
d) Whenever appropriate, the participants will be provided with additional pertinent information. After 
completing the screening and baseline surveys, participants will receive a pdf of  an electronic resource 
brochure with contact [CONTACT_67035], including suicide hotlines, mental 
health and substance use treatment, etc.   
We also request a waiver of consent fo r re-consent of minors (in states where the age of majority is greater 
than 18) who re ach the age of majority in their state  while participating in the study  (between screening 
completion and baseline invitation) . As described above, this study involves no more than minimal risk to 
subjects. Given the brief length of time in which a partici pant is part of this study, it will not be feasible to obtain 
immediate consent for any minors (age 18 -20 in certain states) who reach the age of majority during the study. 
Furthermore, we anticipate that all study assessments will be completed online.    
Every effort will be made to ensure that study participants are protected from risks.  Although it is not expected 
that there will be any risks to participants because of online screening and baseline assessment procedures, 
the risk of violation of confide ntiality exists because human participants are giving personal information. 
Consent documents will contain a statement explaining mandatory reporting requirements for information 
regarding child abuse and intention to harm self or others. We  do not  expect that participants will  disclose such 
information in the context of this study , since our assessments do not inquire about these behaviors . However, 
we will notify participants when/if we must make any mandatory reports based on information they disclose an d 
we will only disclose the minimum information necessary.  Participants will be informed in the consent about 
the procedures taken to maintain and protect their confidentiality.  
To minimize the risk of violating confidentiality, RAs will make every effor t to ensure that study data are always 
kept confidential. Staff training procedures will include information about the importance of confidentiality and 
techniques to maintain confidentiality of all information reported by [CONTACT_67036]. Staff will  maintain 
human subjects and confidentiality certifications through the U -M Program for Education and Evaluation in 
Responsible Research and Scholarship system.  
Unique identification numbers will be assigned to participants. All computerized databases with survey data will 
identify participants by [CONTACT_67037] a secure, encrypted, password -protected server. For 
participant tracking, one electronic document will be maintained linking participants’ ID n umbers to their 
names. This document  will be kept in a restricted -access  folder on a password -protected computer within a 
secure researc h server.  This document  will be deleted as soon as the study is completed. All data will be 
collected specifically for use on this project.  
For the online surveys, participants will be reminded that they may refuse to answer any questions that make 
them uncomfortable and that they may terminate the assessment at any time.  As described above, all 
participants will also receive substance use and  mental health resources after completing the screening and 
baseline surveys . Participants’ confidentiality will be breached by [CONTACT_67038]. 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
Participation in this study may not directly benefit participants. However, in previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_67039], participants have expressed that they enjoy being a part of research that will directly help other young 
adults around their age. The assessments themselves could also benefit participants by [CONTACT_67040]. Furthermore , all participants will receive a resource list with referral information including 
the suicide hotline and text line, substance use, and mental health treatment.

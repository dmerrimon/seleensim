Confidential  1 Background and Study Rationale 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder caused by a single base substitution of valine for 
a glutamine at the sixth amino acid of the gene encoding for the hemoglobin β chain. Patients 
with Hgb SS disease or other sickle hemoglobinopathies suffer from a variety of clinical  
complications related to this abnormal hemoglobin. 
These clinical manifestations include hemolytic anemia and painful or vaso-occlusive crisis that 
occurs when sludging in the microcirculation causes tissue hypoxia. In addition to the painful 
events , SCD patients generally auto-splenectomize in childhood secondary to infarctions from 
their hemoglobinopathy1, thus increasing their risk of infection and rendering them 
immunosuppressed.  
Patients with SCD are considered at increased risk of complications from infection from SARS -
CoV-[ADDRESS_747308] the virus. In 
data published from a COIVD -19 registry , 69% of patients with SCD diagnosed with COVID -19 
were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 11% required ICU admission and 7% died.2 The mean patient age was <[ADDRESS_747309] that general immune function in SCD patients may be impaired, and thus responses 
to vaccine may be suboptimal. One example is the decreased efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination 
in children with SCD. Although this vaccine is highly effective in the general pediatric population, 
a clinical trial in children with SCD showed that only 89% of subjects achieved a protective 
antibody level of >= 10 mIU/mL as compared to 97% of controls (p=0.002). However, 93% of the 
children who did not achieve protective immunity after the standard series of [ADDRESS_747310] an increased number of CD4+CD28null cells as compared to age-  
and race-matched controls, and in vitro studies have demonstrated these cells release high levels 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with hydroxyurea was demonstrated to decrease this 
dysfunctional immune cell population.[ADDRESS_747311] a 
skewing of T helper cells towards a Th2 phenotype and a reduction in the ratio of CD4 helper to 
CD8+ T suppressor cells, both of which may contribute to a mild state of immunosuppression in 
SCD patients.[ADDRESS_747312] SCD patients’ ability to respond to vaccine 
antigens as well as infectious diseases. Concerns have been raised about response to 
vaccination to influenza6, and the effect of the use of hydroxyurea on the seroconversion post 
yellow fever vaccination in people with SCD.7 Understanding response to COVID -19 vaccination 
in this high-risk group of patients can provide a more targeted approach to vaccination and an 
assessment of whether additional doses of vaccine will be required in order to achieve adequate 
protection.  
2 Study Objectives 
• Primary Objective: to measure antibody response to COVID -19 vaccination in a cohort 
of persons  with SCD.  
COVID -19 Vaccine Response in Sickle Cell Disease  - Version: 2.0 Page 5 of 15 
 
Confidential  • Secondary Objective: to assess for unexpected side effects of COVID -[ADDRESS_747313] is to monitor the antibody response to vaccination in this 
immunosupressed population and assess for unexpected side effects from vaccination. Subjects 
with sickle cell disease who are eligible  to receive their initial COVID -19 vaccination will be 
recruited and asked to provide informed consent. Prior to receiving COVID -19 vaccination, 
subjects will visit the study site to complete questionnaires and provide a blood sample. Following 
vaccination, subjects  will be contact[CONTACT_3012], text, or email to complete a survey  (2 to 3 total) . 
Subjects will return to the study site 2 and 6 months after vaccination to complete questionnaires 
and provide a blood sample. Blood samples will be analyzed for antibody response to the COVID -
19 vaccine.  
3.1 Study Endpoints 
• Primary endpoint:  IgG ELISA titer geometric mean at 2 months (56 days) after the initial 
vaccination.  
• Secondary endpoints:   
o IgG ELISA titer geometric mean at 6 months after initial vaccination.  
o Side effects of vaccination and sickle cell related consequences of those side 
effects, as assessed by [CONTACT_569728] -Me, the Brief COPE scale and the Brief Pain Inventory  for 
participants 18+ years  of age, and PROMIS Pain Interference,  and PROMIS 
Mobility  for pediatric participants . 
o Incidence of patient reported COVID -19 infections  in the 6 -months following 
immunization with the COVID -19 vaccine.

4.4 Vulnerable Populations:  
This study will enroll participants under the age of [ADDRESS_747317] questions answered.  At the end of the consent 
discussion, the subjects will be asked to sign the consent form and return it to the study team.  
The same study personnel, in the capacity of “persons obtaining consent” will sign the consent 
form of the subject after the consent conversation occurs . Consent conversations will be 
documented. A signed copy of the consent will  be provided to the subject. Informed consent may 
occur prior to Visit 1.  
For subjects  under the age of 18, a parent or legal guardian will provide permission using the 
consent procedures described above. In addition, subjects 12 – 17 years of age will be asked to 
review the consent form and provide assent.  
Verbal Informed Consent 
As this is a minimal risk study with procedures for which written consent would not normally be 
required outside of the research setting, verbal consent is sufficient for enrollment into this study.   
Subjects will be provided with a “ Consent Information Sheet” describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation.  This 
document will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_14884].  Before initiating any study 
procedures, study personnel will review the study in detail and the subjects will have the 
opportunity to have questions answered.   
COVID -19 Vaccine Response in Sickle Cell Disease  - Version: 2.[ADDRESS_747318].  Consent 
discussions will be led by [CONTACT_569732].   
Consent discussions will be documented, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_569733] ‘Record of Verbal Consent’ document. A participant will be considered 
enrolled after they have provided verbal consent  and received a copy of the participant information 
document, and the rest of the study procedures may commence.  
For subjects under the age of 18, a parent or legal guardian will provide permission using the 
verbal consent procedures described above. In addition, subjects 12 – [ADDRESS_747319] Review

• Collection of information regarding COVID -[ADDRESS_747325] for reasons related to safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be 
COVID -19 Vaccine Response in Sickle Cell Disease  - Version: 2.[ADDRESS_747326] initial vaccination ([ADDRESS_747327] requiring two vaccinations). Data were 
obtained from Table 10 in the VRBPAC briefing document provided to the FDA dated 12/17/2020 
(page 29).[ADDRESS_747328] administered will be recorded and all products will be pooled for use for analyses; 
power calculations are based on a total of 200 participants. It is anticipated that 60% of 
participants will be of SS or Sbeta0thal genotype and 40% will be SC or Sbeta+thal or less 
common genotypes. The primary goal is to provide estimates of geometric mean titer at 2 months 
following initial vaccination with a 95% confidence interval. The geometric mean approach will be 
used to address asymmetry in the distribution of titers. Under these assumptions there will be 
more than 99% power to detect a drop to a geometric mean titer (GMT) to 5.50, assuming a two-
sided 0.[ADDRESS_747329] deviation. This high level of power will be 
retained for the 120 SS or SBeta0thal patients and the 80 SC or SBeta+thal patients separately. 
Should the standard deviation for sickle  cell patients be three ti mes that reported for healthy 
controls in Table [ADDRESS_747330] 90% power will still be retained for each of 
the genotypic subsets.  
It is not yet known whether an immune response to vaccination might trigger vaso-occlusive crises 
or other consequences of sickle cell disease. Side effects reported in vaccinated participants  will 
be described, with an estimate of rate with a confidence interval.  Such events might enhance any 
vaccine hesitancy that may already exist in this population, leading some participants to decline 
the second vaccination if they receive an mRNA vaccine. Therefore, the rate at which patients 
receiv e only one dose of mRNA vaccine will be assessed. These participants will be retained in 
the study and titers will be measured at [ADDRESS_747331] clinical consequences for subjects whose titers increase substantially 
but are less than exceedingly high.  
7 Safety and Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events 
if the abnormality: 
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
COVID -19 Vaccine Response in Sickle Cell Disease  - Version: 2.0 Page 12 of 15 
 
Confidential  • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_569736] 2 or higher per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v5.0  determined by [CONTACT_274432]  (phlebotomy ) and 
occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each related event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that study  participation is 
not the cause. Adverse events related to a study procedure will be reported to the study sponsor 
and IRB, in accordance with IRB reporting requirements.  
[ADDRESS_747332] of 1996 (HIPAA).  These 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study period.  
8.[ADDRESS_747333] linking the subjec t’s identity to the subject ID and will retain this record in a 
secure method as described above.  
9 Study Monitoring 
Site investigators are expected to ensure that data are collected appropriately. Study data entered 
in the study database  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_569737] a regular basis to 
ensure data quality and timely data entry. 
10 Ethical Considerations 
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research 
policies and procedures.  
COVID -19 Vaccine Response in Sickle Cell Disease  - Version: 2.0 Page 13 of 15 
 
Confidential  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or IRB, in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the 
study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in 
writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
10.1 Risks 
Blood draw risks:  Risks and discomfort associated with vena-puncture are minor and include 
swelling, bruising/bleeding at the site, fainting, and, more rarely, the risk of infection at the needle 
puncture site.  These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_569738]. 
Risk of loss of confidentiality:  There is small risk of loss of confidentiality if identifiable data 
were inadvertently accessed by [CONTACT_569739]. This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_569740].  
10.[ADDRESS_747334]; 
however, payments may be made in installments that accommodate participant scheduling: 
Subjects will receive $50 per in person visit and $25 per telephone/remote visits  for a total of 
$200-225 for completing all study visits.
